The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved. These studies underscore the need to apply multiple biophysical and biochemical approaches to the elucidation of the physical basis for polymerase fidelity.","output":"Structural dynamics as a contributor to error-prone replication by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the first two decades of the 21st century, there have been three coronavirus infection outbreaks raising global health concerns by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the SARS-CoV-2. Although the reported imaging findings of coronavirus infection are variable and nonspecific, the most common initial chest radiograph (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) findings are ground-glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral predominance and eventually spread to involve both lungs as the disease progresses. These findings can be explained by the immune pathogenesis of coronavirus infection causing diffuse alveolar damage. Although it is insensitive in mild or early coronavirus infection, the CXR remains as the first-line and the most commonly used imaging modality. That is because it is rapid and easily accessible and helpful for monitoring patient progress during treatment. CT is more sensitive to detect early parenchymal lung abnormalities and disease progression, and can provide an alternative diagnosis. In this pictorial review, various coronavirus infection cases are presented to provide imaging spectrums of coronavirus infection and present differences in imaging among them or from other viral infections, and to discuss the role of imaging in viral infection outbreaks.","output":"Imaging findings in coronavirus infections: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Limited data exists on the impact of COVID-19 on national changes in cardiac procedure activity, including patient characteristics and clinical outcomes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND RESULTS: All major cardiac procedures (n = 374,899) performed between 1st January and 31st May for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020 were analysed, stratified by procedure type and time-period (pre-COVID: January-May 2018 and 2019 and January-February 2020 and COVID: March-May 2020). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine the odds ratio (OR) of 30-day mortality for procedures performed in the COVID period.Overall, there was a deficit of 45,501 procedures during the COVID period compared to the monthly averages (March-May) in 2018-2019. Cardiac catheterisation and device implantations were the most affected in terms of numbers (n = 19,637 and n = 10,453) whereas surgical procedures such as MVR, other valve replacement/repair, ASD/VSD repair and CABG were the most affected as a relative percentage difference (&#916;) to previous years' averages. TAVR was the least affected (&#916;-10.6%). No difference in 30-day mortality was observed between pre-COVID and COVID time-periods for all cardiac procedures except cardiac catheterisation (OR 1.25 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.47, p = 0.006) and cardiac device implantation (OR 1.35 95% CI 1.15-1.58, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Cardiac procedural activity has significantly declined across England during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a deficit in excess of 45000 procedures, without an increase in risk of mortality for most cardiac procedures performed during the pandemic. Major restructuring of cardiac services is necessary to deal with this deficit, which would inevitably impact long-term morbidity and mortality.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on cardiac procedure activity in England and associated 30-day mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has had adverse psychological impact on the general population. Most surveys published till date are online questionnaires targeting general population/health care providers. There is lack of data on the psychological impact of disease on newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital, actively involved in the management of COVID patients. Newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients who had presented to the outpatient COVID care clinic were interviewed face to face by an interviewer using Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), a validated and universally accepted research questionnaire. RESULTS: Most of the respondents were males (83.2%), mean age: 40.8 years. 31.7% were graduates and 58.5% were actively employed. Fever (57.4%), cough (37.6%), and progressive breathlessness (08.9%) were the three most common clinical symptoms. The mean score on IES-R was 31.8. 30.7% respondents had suffered severe psychological impact, 30.7% had minimal impact. 19.8% and 1.8% had mild and moderate psychological impact respectively. On linear regression analysis, increasing age had statistically significant corelation with increasing scores on IES-R scale (p = 0.004). Educational qualifications of the patient had negative corelation (Pearson correlation=? 0.117) while none of the clinical parameters had any statistically significant correlation with the patients' psychological impact scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk of suffering from disease-related adverse psychological impact.

Complete genome sequencing of the distinct genotypes from two bats, using degenerate/genome-specific primers with overlapping sequences confirmed by specific PCR, supported the coexistence of at least two distinct genomes in each bat. Recombination analysis using eight Ro-BatCoV HKU9 genomes showed possible recombination events between strains from different bat individuals, which may have allowed for the generation of different genotypes.

The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID\\\\19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA\\\\Seq databases to study gene expression and co\\\\expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, B cells and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID\\\\19 risk factor status. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells.

For any live vector, genetic stability is an essential requirement. However, little is known about the genetic stability of recombinant coronaviruses expressing foreign genes. In this study, the Renilla and the firefly luciferase genes were systematically analyzed for their stability after insertion at various genomic positions in the group 1 coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus and in the group 2 coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus. It appeared that the two genes exhibit intrinsic differences, the Renilla gene consistently being maintained more stably than the firefly gene. This difference was not caused by genome size restrictions, by different effects of the encoded proteins, or by different consequences of the synthesis of the additional subgenomic mRNAs. The loss of expression of the firefly luciferase was found to result from various, often large deletions of the gene, probably due to RNA recombination. The extent of this process appeared to depend strongly on the coronaviral genomic background, the luciferase gene being much more stable in the feline than in the mouse coronavirus genome. It also depended significantly on the particular genomic location at which the gene was inserted.

OBJECTIVE: To adapt an evidence-based resiliency intervention to address FOR among cancer survivors. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of researchers, clinicians, and patient stakeholders followed an iterative intervention adaptation process (ORBIT). In Step 1, we sought to define key FOR management skills through a literature review and feedback from stakeholders. In Step 2, we integrated findings into a treatment manual and refined procedures for in-person delivery to groups of cancer survivors, defined as adults who had completed primary cancer treatment for non-metastatic cancer. In Step 3, we conducted a single arm trial to assess initial acceptability and change in FOR severity with 23 cancer survivors (N=4 intervention groups). In Step 4, we conducted additional qualitative interviews with 28 cancer survivors (N=6 focus groups stratified by FOR severity, N=15 individual interviews) to define adaptive and maladaptive strategies for coping with FOR and to identify preferences for delivery. In Step 5, we refined the treatment manual and procedures for testing in a future pilot randomized feasibility trial. RESULTS: We identified critical feedback using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. The single arm trial suggested preliminary feasibility and sustained reductions in FOR severity, yet need for refinement (i.e., eligibility, delivery modality), prompting additional qualitative interviews for further targeting. The resulting intervention (IN FOCUS) is comprised of virtual, synchronous, group-delivered sessions that offer an integrated approach to FOR management by teaching cognitive-behavioral techniques, meditation, relaxation training, adaptive health behaviors, and positive psychology skills. Sessions are targeted by applying skills to FOR and associated healthcare engagement.

RESULTS: Twenty-five cats were included. Prevalence of the honeycomb pattern was 6.8%. None of the spleen was considered normal on cytology and four types of lesions were found: lymphoid hyperplasia (64%), neoplasia (16%), extramedullary haematopoiesis (12%) and splenitis (8%). A honeycomb pattern was successfully identified with a linear high-frequency probe in all cats, but only in 36% of cases with the micro-convex probe.

Here, we aimed to examine the circulating miRNA profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to evaluate its potential as a source of biomarkers for the management of the disease. METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicenter study which included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-May 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care (n = 47) and hospitalized patients admitted to the ICU (n = 37). An additional study considering ICU non-survivors (n=17) and survivors (n = 20) was performed. Expression profiling of 41 miRNAs was performed in plasma samples using RT-qPCR. The panel included miRNAs associated with: i) immune/inflammatory response;ii) lung damage;iii) respiratory viral infections;iv) myocardial damage;v) coagulation. Quality control was performed using spike-ins and hemolysis tests. Predictive models were constructed using a variable selection process based on LASSO regression. RESULTS: Ten circulating miRNAs were deregulated in ICU compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs that displayed an optimal discrimination ability to distinguish between ICU and ward patients (AUC = 0.88) (Figure 1A). Among ICU patients, six miRNAs were downregulated when comparing nonsurvivors to survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs was found to be a relevant predictor of mortality during ICU stay (AUC = 0.84) (Figure 1B). The discrimination potential of the miRNA signature was higher than the observed for clinical laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts (including neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and the neutrophil-tolymphocyte ratio), CRP or D-dimer (maximum AUC for these variables = 0.76).

It is one of the most common symptoms of upper respiratory diseases including COVID-19 and is a leading cause of physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions. However, few over-the-counter medications are proven to heal sore throat inflammation. METHODS: Adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells) and three dimensional organotypic human respiratory tissues were used to study inflammation and various treatment effects on respiratory epithelia. The cells and tissues were studied both in the presence and absence of bradykinin, one of the first inflammatory mediators of pharyngitis. Inflammation was measured by analyzing the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and leukotriene B4 (LTB4), transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Tissue morphology was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In studying pharyngitis using organotypic human respiratory tissue stimulated with bradykinin, we saw an increase in PGE2 and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in response to bradykinin. Acetyl salicylic acid (ASA), a nonspecific COX inhibitor, was able to mitigate a bradykinin-induced increase in PGE2 in our studies. However, ASA was inflammatory above its therapeutic window, increasing the levels of PGE2 and IL-8 above those seen with bradykinin stimulation alone. We describe a novel, scientifically validated treatment for sore throat, that contains a low dose of ASA and other anti-inflammatory ingredients. CONCLUSION: This study elucidates the complex mechanisms involved in healing pharyngitis, an inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory epithelia. An ASA-based formula (Biovanta) mitigated bradykinin-induced inflammation more strongly than ASA alone in organotypic human respiratory tissues. Surprisingly, we found that many of the most common over the counter sore throat therapies exacerbate inflammation and IL-8 in organotypic human respiratory tissues, suggesting these common treatments may increase the likelihood of further respiratory complications.","output":"A novel anti-inflammatory treatment for bradykinin-induced sore throat or pharyngitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals can test positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by molecular assays following the resolution of their clinical disease.

A disadvantage of antibiotics is that they often kill beneficial commensal, bacteria in addition to, pathogenic bacteria. Indiscriminate killing disrupts the homeostasis between commensal bacteria and the host gut epithelium allowing colonization of the gut by pathogenic bacteria and increases susceptibility to infections. This research was done to develop a non-antibiotic modality to prevent bacterial infections by growing, rather than killing, commensal bacteria in the gut. Gut commensal bacteria grown on carbohydrates produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that support gut homeostasis maintenance and promote resistance to bacterial colonization. SCFAs have direct and indirect effects on the gut and lung mucosal immune system. They have also been linked to respiratory viral infection reduction and shown to influence macrophage function to mitigate pro-inflammatory neutrophil-mediated tissue damage. METHODS: A library of over 1,500 synthetic proprietary glycans, termed Microbiome Metabolic Therapies (MMT?), was synthesized using different chemical and enzymatic approaches. An ex vivo platform using fecal bacterial communities from human subjects was devised to screen MMTs for their abilities to deplete pathogenic bacteria, and modulate multiple aspects of bacterial metabolism. RESULTS: KB109 was identified based on its ability to reduce the relative abundance of a diversity of pathogens including clinically relevant Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in human fecal communities. KB109 also increased the relative abundance of prevalent commensal bacteria. Monoculture experiments demonstrated that KB109 promotes the growth of commensal bacteria, but not pathogens. Ex vivo screening revealed that KB109 consistently increased SFCA production across multiple fecal communities. CONCLUSION: KB109 represents an appealing activity profile and offers an opportunity to prevent enteric and systemic bacterial infections by promoting gut homeostasis and colonization resistance, and ameliorating respiratory viral infections by stimulating immune homeostasis. KB109 is under evaluation in two COVID-19 clinical studies.

To make it proper to perform them, understanding of the immunological aspects is critically important. The present study aimed to assess humoral responses in COVID-19 using various quantitative antibody tests. METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titres of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titres measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titres were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred, while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases. Viral burdens estimated according to threshold cycle values at the RT-PCR seemed to impact antibody responses.

An acquired decrease of CR1 density on E from COVID-19 patients was observed (Mean = 418, SD = 162, N = 52) versus healthy individuals (Mean = 592, SD = 287, N = 400), Student's t-test p < 10-6, particularly among fatal cases, and in parallel with several parameters of clinical severity. Large deposits of C4d on E in patients were well above values observed in normal individuals, mostly without concomitant C3 deposits, in more than 80% of the patients. This finding is reminiscent of the increased C4d deposits on E previously observed to correlate with sub endothelial pericapillary deposits in organ transplant rejection, and with clinical SLE flares. Conversely, significant C3 deposits on E were only observed among ? of the patients. The decrease of CR1/E density, deposits of C4 fragments on E and previously reported detection of virus spikes or C3 on E among COVID-19 patients, suggest that the handling and clearance of immune complex or complement fragment coated cell debris may play an important role in the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. Measurement of C4d deposits on E might represent a surrogate marker for assessing inflammation and complement activation occurring in organ capillaries and CR1/E decrease might represent a cumulative index of complement activation in COVID-19 patients. Taken together, these original findings highlight the participation of complement regulatory proteins and indicate that E are important in immune pathophysiology of COVID-19 patients. Besides a potential role for monitoring the course of disease, these observations suggest that novel therapies such as the use of CR1, or CR1-like molecules, in order to down regulate complement activation and inflammation, should be considered.","output":"Acquired decrease of the C3b/C4b receptor (CR1, CD35) and increased C4d deposits on erythrocytes from ICU COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants are emerging around the globe. Unfortunately, several SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially, variants of concern (VOC) are less susceptible to neutralization by the convalescent and post-vaccination sera, raising concerns of increased disease transmissibility and severity. Recent data suggests the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing anti-body levels as a good correlate of vaccine mediated protection. However, currently used BSL3 based virus micro-neutralization (MN) assays are more laborious, time consuming and expensive, underscoring the need for BSL2 based, cost effective neutralization assays against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In light of this unmet need, we have developed a BSL2 pseudovirus based neutralization assay (PBNA) in cells expressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The assay is reproducible (R2=0.96), demonstrates a good dynamic range and high sensitivity. Our data suggests that the biological Anti-SARS-CoV-2 research reagents such as NIBSC 20/130 show lower neutralization against B.1.351 RSA and B1.1.7 UK VOC, whereas a commercially available monoclonal antibody MM43 retains activity against both these variants.

As an essential part of virtual communication, VoIP should be promoted to achieve the desired level of performance. One critical area investigated in VoIP is the bandwidth utilization (BWU) of the VoIP over IPv6 networks. Enhancing BWU will impact call capacity and quality;it increases call capacity and boosts call quality. Unfortunately, a considerable amount of bandwidth is wasted when running VoIP over IPv6 networks. This is due to the large size of the IPv6 header and the small size of the speech frame. This paper proposes a new method to handle the inefficient BWU when running VoIP over IPv6 networks. The proposed method combines multiplexing multiple VoIP packets in one IPv6 header and using the superfluous fields to carry a portion of the speech frame. Therefore, the proposed is called packet multiplexing and carrier fields (PMCF). Investigation of the PCMF method has been done using four metrics to measure the promotion in BWU, namely calls capacity, header size, bandwidth saving, and speech frame shortening metrics. With the four metrics, the PMCF method has outperformed the comparable methods. For instance, the call capacity has been promoted by up to 269% compared to the typical IPv6 method in the tested scenarios.

RFA is effective for small (<3 cm) tumors, but for tumors > 3 cm, there is a tendency to leave viable tumor cells in the margins or clefts of overlapping ablation zones. This increases the possibility of incomplete ablation or local recurrence. Lyso-Thermosensitive Liposomal Doxorubicin (LTLD), is a thermally sensitive liposomal doxorubicin formulation for intravenous administration, that rapidly releases its drug content when exposed to temperatures >40C. When used with RFA, LTLD releases its doxorubicin in the vasculature around the zone of ablation-induced tumor cell necrosis, killing micrometastases in the ablation margin. This may reduce recurrence and be more effective than thermal ablation alone. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to optimize the RFA procedure used in combination with LTLD to maximize the local deposition of doxorubicin in a swine liver model. Pigs were anaesthetized and the liver was surgically exposed. Each pig received a single, 50 mg/m2 dose of the clinical LTLD formulation (ThermoDox?). Subsequently, ablations were performed with either 1, 3 or 6 sequential, overlapping needle insertions in the left medial lobe with total ablation time of 15, 45 or 90 minutes respectively. Two different RFA generators and probes were evaluated. After the final ablation, the ablation zone (plus 3 cm margin) was dissected out and examined for doxorubicin concentration by LC/MS and fluorescence. CONCLUSION The mean Cmax of plasma total doxorubicin was 26.5 g/ml at the end of the infusion. Overall, increased heat time from 15 to 45 to 90 minutes shows an increase in both the amount of doxorubicin deposited (up to ~100 g/g) and the width of the ablation target margin to which doxorubicin is delivered as determined by tissue homogenization and LC/MS detection of doxorubicin and by fluorescent imaging of tissues.","output":"Increased Duration of Heating Boosts Local Drug Deposition during Radiofrequency Ablation in Combination with Thermally Sensitive Liposomes (ThermoDox) in a Porcine Model."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid identification of highly specific and potent drug candidates continues to be a substantial challenge with traditional pharmaceutical approaches.

The effect of variants on protective immunity afforded by vaccination has been mostly analyzed with regard to B cell responses. This analysis revealed variable levels of cross-neutralization capacity for presently available SARS-Cov-2 vaccines. Despite the dampened immune responses documented for some SARS-Cov-2 mutations, available vaccines appear to maintain an overall satisfactory protective activity against most variants of concern (VoC). This may be attributed, at least in part, to cell-mediated immunity. Indeed, the widely multi-specific nature of CD8 T cell responses should allow to avoid VoC-mediated viral escape, because mutational inactivation of a given CD8 T cell epitope is expected to be compensated by the persistent responses directed against unchanged co-existing CD8 epitopes. This is particularly relevant because some immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes are located within highly conserved SARS-Cov-2 regions that cannot mutate without impairing SARS-Cov-2 functionality. Importantly, some of these conserved epitopes are degenerate, meaning that they are able to associate with different HLA class I molecules and to be simultaneously presented to CD8 T cell populations of different HLA restriction. Based on these concepts, vaccination strategies aimed at potentiating the stimulatory effect on SARS-Cov-2-specific CD8 T cells should greatly enhance the efficacy of immunization against SARS-Cov-2 variants. Our review recollects, discusses and puts into a translational perspective all available experimental data supporting these hot concepts, with special emphasis on the structural constraints that limit SARS-CoV-2 S-protein evolution and on potentially invariant and degenerate CD8 epitopes that lend themselves as excellent candidates for the rational development of next-generation, CD8 T-cell response-reinforced, COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Degenerate CD8 Epitopes Mapping to Structurally Constrained Regions of the Spike Protein: A T Cell-Based Way-Out From the SARS-CoV-2 Variants Storm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is to share gaps in knowledge and research related to pandemic management identified by nurse leaders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this manuscript, we explore how two of these social practicesclapping and singingwere useful to counter the emotions entailed in the subjectivation processes that accompanied the pandemic. We then argue that, seen as affective happenings, singing and clapping heightened emotions and affects that were already implicit in neoliberalism, mainly anxiety, loneliness, and a sense of precariousness, disposability, and inadequacy. On one hand, singing and clapping were liberatory practices of solidarity and resistance against the changes induced by the pandemic and its biopolitics. On the other hand, they contributed to the primary narratives on social resilience, docile bodies, and biopolitics that informed the crisis management. Singing and clapping also operated as neoliberal technologies of the self by bringing the focus on individual agency, behavioral control, and the sacrifice of specific subjects (e.g., the healthcare workers described as heroes). In short, singing and clapping were affective happenings that instantiated an entanglement of subjectivation practices in which the power to affect and the power to resist coincided.","output":"Neoliberal and pandemic subjectivation processes: Clapping and singing as affective (re)actions during the Covid-19 home confinement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biological learning systems are outstanding in their ability to learn from limited training data compared to the most successful learning machines, i.e., Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). What are the key aspects that underlie this data efficiency gap is an unresolved question at the core of biological and artificial intelligence. We hypothesize that one important aspect is that biological systems rely on mechanisms such as foveations in order to reduce unnecessary input dimensions for the task at hand, e.g., background in object recognition, while state-of-the-art DNNs do not. Datasets to train DNNs often contain such unnecessary input dimensions, and these lead to more trainable parameters. Yet, it is not clear whether this affects the DNNs' data efficiency because DNNs are robust to increasing the number of parameters in the hidden layers, and it is uncertain whether this holds true for the input layer. In this paper, we investigate the impact of unnecessary input dimensions on the DNNs data efficiency, namely, the amount of examples needed to achieve certain generalization performance. Our results show that unnecessary input dimensions that are task-unrelated substantially degrade data efficiency. This highlights the need for mechanisms that remove task-unrelated dimensions, such as foveation for image classification, in order to enable data efficiency gains.","output":"The Data Efficiency of Deep Learning Is Degraded by Unnecessary Input Dimensions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To study the features of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Esprito Santo, Brazil. METHODS: Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1(st), 2019 to June 30(th), 2020. FINDINGS: Covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 210 (2.85%) out of the 7,370 serum samples tested. The earliest undiagnosed missed case of COVID-19 dated back to a sample collected on December 18, 2019, also positive for Dengue Virus. Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed. INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Data presented here demonstrate that in arboviral endemic regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection must be always considered, regardless of the existence of a previous positive diagnosis for Dengue or Chikungunya.","output":"Covert cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: An obscure but present danger in regions endemic for Dengue and Chikungunya viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The decision to work from home (WFH) or to commute during COVID-19 is having a major structural impact on individuals travel, work and lifestyle. There are many possible factors influencing this non-marginal change, some of which are captured by objective variables while others are best represented by a number of underlying latent traits captured by attitudes towards WFH and the use of specific modes of transport for the commute that have a bio-security risk such as public transport (PT).

The data was collected between September-October 2020, during a period of no lockdown and relatively minor restrictions on workplaces and public gatherings. The results show that one of the most important attributes defining the WFH loving attitude is the workplace policy towards WFH, with workers that can decide where to work having a higher probability of WFH, followed by those that are being directed to, relative to other workplace policies. The bio-security concern with using shared modes such as public transport is a key driver of WFH and choosing to commute via the safer environment of the private car.","output":"Advanced modelling of commuter choice model and work from home during COVID-19 restrictions in Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Teaching on physical examination, especially evidence-based physical diagnosis, is at times lacking on general medicine rounds.

Recently, accumulating evidence has suggested that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) exerts significant effects in vascular endothelial cell injury. However, PRNCR1, a novel lncRNA, remains scarcely understood in terms of its functions in PVEC injury. Both in vivo and in vitro models of PVEC injury were constructed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. The relative expressions of PRNCR1, miR-330-5p, and TLR4 were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Besides, gain and loss assays of PRNCR1/miR-330-5p were conducted to verify their effects on LPS-induced PVEC injury. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay used to measure cell viability and flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. Besides, the protein levels of caspase 3, nuclear factor-B (NF-B), and inflammatory cytokines (including tumor necrosis factor-, interleukin-1 [IL-1], and IL-6) were evaluated via Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, a dual-luciferase activity experiment and RNA immunoprecipitation were applied to confirm the targeting relationship between PRNCR1 and miR-330-5p, miR-330-5p, and TLR4. PRNCR1 and TLR4 levels were significantly upregulated in LPS-treated PVEC, both in vivo and in vitro, while miR-330-5p were downregulated. Inhibiting PRNCR1 or overexpressing miR-330-5p markedly attenuated LPS-induced PVEC injury, expressions of TLR4, NF-B, and inflammatory cytokines. Mechanistically, PRNCR1 functioned as a competitive endogenous RNA by sponging miR-330-5p and then promoting TLR4 expression. PRNCR1 was upregulated in LPS-induced PVEC and aggravated its injury via modulating the miR-330-5p/TLR4 axis.","output":"Downregulating lncRNA PRNCR1 ameliorates LPS-induced pulmonary vascular endothelial cell injury by modulating miR-330-5p/TLR4 axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Health status in adolescents is difficult to evaluate and compare horizontally, vertically and longitudinally among different regions and nations of the world. METHODS: With repeated surveys conducted with relatively uniformed standards, the UNICEF Data warehouse compiles and publishes a wide spectrum of health indicators, of which data analysis and visualization would reveal the underlying statuses and trends on global, regional and national levels. RESULTS: Apparent geographic disparity is present in that sub-Saharan African countries lag far behind their counterparts in other regions with regard to most health indicators on adolescents. Education attendance rates sequentially drop from primary to secondary school levels, and display correlation with youth literacy. Harmful practices of early marriage, early childbearing and female genital mutilation have decreased but the presences of peer violence and sexual violence are worthy of attentions. Although incidence and mortality rates of HIV/AIDS have dropped (most notably in sub-Saharan Africa), adolescents' HIV/AIDS awareness remains suboptimal in selected countries. Cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths in the adolescents are comparable to the children but relatively lower than the adult and senior groups. CONCLUSIONS: Findings on the health indicators of adolescents until 2019 reveal the most recent status quo for reference right before the hit of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

SETTINGS This study was conducted at the Department of Surgery of Juntendo University Urayasu Hospital between April 2009 and April 2010. Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained single-institution laparoscopic colon cancer database. PATIENTS Thirty-one consecutively selected patients (mean BMI, 22.5  2.3) were evaluated. INTERVENTIONS All patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic colectomy for colon cancer. Two different approaches were used for single-incision laparoscopic colectomy: the trocar insertion method and the SILS port method. The trocar insertion method was adopted in 22 of 31 patients, and the SILS port method was used in 9 patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main measures of outcomes were intraoperative findings, postoperative course, and oncological outcomes.

Radiology is thus confronted with the effects of the pandemic. The aim of this study was to use natural language processing (NLP) to automatically analyze the number and distribution of fractures during the pandemic and in the 5 years before the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a pre-trained commercially available NLP engine to automatically categorize 5397 radiological reports of radiographs (hand/wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, knee, pelvis/hip) within a 6-week period from March to April in 2015-2020 into \\"fracture affirmed\\" or \\"fracture not affirmed.\\" The NLP engine achieved an F1 score of 0.81 compared to human annotators. RESULTS: In 2020, we found a significant decrease of fractures in general (p < 0.001); the average number of fractures in 2015-2019 was 295, whereas it was 233 in 2020. In children and adolescents (p < 0.001), and in adults up to 65 years (p = 0.006), significantly fewer fractures were reported in 2020. The number of fractures in the elderly did not change (p = 0.15). The number of hand/wrist fractures (p < 0.001) and fractures of the elbow (p < 0.001) was significantly lower in 2020 compared with the average in the years 2015-2019.

Our pragmatic algorithm produces a recommendation to treat empirically, image with DXA, or observe.

We estimate this will reduce DXA scan numbers by about 50%, whilst pragmatically ensuring those with the highest clinical need correctly receive treatment without delay. This algorithm will help many clinicians including general practitioners/family physicians prioritise DXA when they may not always have the expertise to make this judgement based on clinical information alone.

We collected semen samples from men who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection to evaluate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We also assessed the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate both during the acute phase after testing positive and a smaller cohort of men at follow-up. METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or inperson in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (IQR=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=53.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024).

In this paper, we present our Care-Ethical Model of Quality Enquiry (CEMQUE) and apply it to the case of residential care for older people in the Netherlands during the Covid-19 pandemic. Instead of thinking about care in healthcare and social welfare as a set of separate care acts, we think about care as a complex practice of relational caring, crossed by other practices. Instead of thinking about professional caregivers as functionaries obeying external rules, we think about them as practically wise professionals. Instead of thinking about developing external quality criteria and systems, we think about cultivating (self-)reflective quality awareness. Instead of abstracting from societal forces that make care possible but also limit it, we acknowledge them and find ways to deal with them. Based on these critical insights, the CEMQUE model can be helpful to describe, interrogate, evaluate, and improve existing care practices. It has four entries: (i) the care receiver considered from their humanness, (ii) the caregiver considered from their solicitude, (iii) the care facility considered from its habitability and (iv) the societal, institutional and scholarly context considered from the perspective of the good life, justice and decency.

The 127 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with DS had a higher incidence of cough, fever, nasal signs and shortness of breath than controls. Compared with controls, hospitalized children with DS (especially those from LMICs) had a higher prevalence of COVID-19-related medical complications (pneumonia, ARDS, acute renal failure). Conclusions and relevance: Children with DS are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 than the general pediatric population. Efforts should be made to monitor the health of children and young people with DS during the ongoing pandemic and to report any COVID-19 signs and symptoms in a timely manner, especially for those who have comorbidities which are risk factors for severe COVID-19. When vaccination rollout for pediatric populations begins, children with DS should be prioritised.","output":"COVID-19 in Children with Down Syndrome: Data from the Trisomy 21 Research Society Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently, nurses are in the middle of the battle against COVID-19 The pandemic situation has put these professionals against various ethical challenges Therefore, this review aims to identify the main ethical challenges faced by nurses during COVID-19 pandemic This integrative review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols All English version studies that reported ethical challenges of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic, from November 9, 2019, to November 9, 2020, were eligible for the review The electronic databases used were PubMed, Google Scholar, JURN, Cochrane Library E-Journals, MEDLINE, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Accordingly, 8 articles were included for further analysis and synthesis The ethical challenges of nurses were categorized into three thematic areas: nurses' safety, role and moral distress, resource allocation, and client-nurse relationship Thus, the lack of full protection of nurses across the health industry has raised ethical questions such as the extent of their duty, scarce resources, and the failure of personal protective equipment In connection, a significant number of nurses were also facing moral distress because of prolonged pressure to maintain the resources needed to provide safe and high-quality nursing care Furthermore, nurses were challenged to restrict many COVID-19 patients from having end-of-life communication with their families Overall, nurses are still facing various ethical challenges across the globe Therefore, it is important to mobilize resources and invest in nurses to bring long-lasting solutions","output":"Ethical Challenges of Nurses in COVID-19 Pandemic: Integrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pernio is a commonly reported cutaneous manifestation of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection.(1) Our international registry of COVID\\\\19 dermatologic manifestations has collected 1,176 total cases of COVID\\\\19 skin manifestations, including 619 cases of pernio in suspected or confirmed COVID\\\\19 patients.(1) Most patients with new\\\\onset pernio were entered into the registry after the first pandemic wave (79% in March\\\\May 2020).

Additional questions assessed whether participants had expressed a need for mental health and/or substance use resources since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020) and whether they had experienced barriers when accessing this care. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between variables and expressing a need for resources as well as experiencing barriers to accessing these resources. Bivariate analyses revealed multiple sociodemographic, mental health, and substance use variables significantly associated with both expressing a need for and experiencing barriers to care. Multinomial regression analysis revealed gender identity, sexual orientation, ethnicity, and level of educational attainment to be significantly correlated with both cases.

First, the quantitative method was adopted, and data collected from 734 questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software. Then, the qualitative method was used, and semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect the opinions of 12 interviewees, including scholars, government employees, citizens, and practitioners. Finally, we discuss multiple comparison analysis testing. The survey results indicate that river improvement and greening projects could be conducted to take advantage of diverse ecological environments, urban transportation planning, and geographical location. Such projects can help people relieve stress, even during the COVID-19 pandemic; improve their physical and mental health; and enhance their environmental awareness. However, due to poor traffic flow, a low space utilization rate, and inflexible management practices, visiting these environments has posed a risk of infection. As a result, most respondents indicated that the leisure benefits of green fields are limited and not helpful for improving their physical and mental health or having fun. Additionally, survey responses by people from different backgrounds (p < 0.01) varied.

We conducted this survey to assess the quantitative and qualitative effects of this pandemic on the sleep of doctors. METHODS: A survey was created on Google Forms and it was circulated / sent through WhatsApp for voluntary participation amongst several groups of doctors and individually as well. RESULTS: We received 304 responses from doctors of various specialties, cadres and background. Our results showed that 52% of them were involved in direct clinical care of COVID-19 patients. 55.8% doctors reported changes in sleep pattern and 37.2% reported reduced duration of sleep, as compared to the time before the pandemic. More than 50% of them slept for less than 7 hours a night since the beginning of the pandemic. 37% had difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep. 30% had difficulty in concentration and functioning during day-time. Non-refreshing sleep was experienced by 36.3% of them and 18.8% of physicians had recollected having COVID-19 related dreams. 33% doctors last thought before sleep and first thought after waking up were about COVID-19. 36% doctors looked for information about COVID-19 on media immediately before going to sleep and immediately after waking up. More than 60% doctors started meditation, exercise, yoga or relaxation techniques for getting better sleep. CONCLUSION: A further decline in duration and quality of sleep due to the COVID-19 pandemic amongst already sleep-deprived doctors may be detrimental not only to their own health but for patient-care also.

Twenty-seven patients with moderate to severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 52  13% predicted) completed pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, maximal exercise tests, and cycle endurance tests at baseline. Inspiratory capacity was measured at 2-minute intervals during the cycle endurance test to quantify dynamic hyperinflation. Pulmonary function and cycle endurance testing were repeated after 14 days of bisoprolol 10 mg/day and 14 days of placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. The extent of dynamic hyperinflation at peak isotime exercise with bisoprolol and placebo was compared. Peak isotime was defined as the latest time point that was reached during the 2 cycle endurance tests. Changes in inspiratory capacity from rest to peak isotime were different with bisoprolol compared to placebo (-0.50  0.35 vs -0.41  0.33 L, p = 0.01). Exercise duration tended to be lower with bisoprolol compared to placebo (305  125 vs 353  172 seconds, p = 0.11). The magnitude of change in exercise duration between the bisoprolol and placebo conditions was correlated with the magnitude of change in inspiratory capacity (r = 0.57, p <0.01). In conclusion, bisoprolol was associated with modest worsening dynamic hyperinflation, whereas exercise duration remained unchanged in patients with moderate to severe COPD.

This, together with data that suggest that a large cohort of coronavirus disease 2019 patients have better outcomes if we can avoid intubating them, creates a need for a safe method of NIV or high-flow oxygen delivery during transport. Commonly used and successful in-hospital regimens for these patients are high-flow nasal cannula and continuous positive airway pressure or bilevel positive airway pressure. In some studies, helmet NIV has been shown to be a viable, if not superior, alternative to these therapies for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.

In several recent studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been demonstrated to be the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 as it was previously well known as the receptor of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 can bind with high affinity to human ACE2 and engages it as an entry receptor. It seems that the genetic, notably epigenetic variations of ACE2 are less known in different populations, indicating the need for its further investigation. These variations have the potential to affect its contribution to the pathogenicity of COVID-19. The contribution of epigenetics in the interindividual variability of ACE2 merits more attention because epigenetic processes can play important roles in ACE2 alterations in various tissues and different people and populations. Analyzing different DNA methylation patterns and microRNAs, contributing to the ACE2 modulation in the lungs will have a high priority. The epigenetic and genetic variations of ACE2 become even more important when considering that some people have mild clinical symptoms despite having COVID-19. The pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is complex; therefore, a better understanding of the underlying pathobiology, especially binding the virus to its receptors, could help improve therapeutic and preventive approaches.

In hospitalized-patients, prompt interruption of the virus-driven inflammatory process by using combination treatments seems theoretically of outmost importance. Our aim was to investigate the hypothesis of multifaceted management of these patients. Methods A treatment algorithm based on ferritin was applied in 311 patients (67.2% males; median age 63-years; moderate disease, n=101; severe, n=210). Patients with ferritin <500ng/ml received anakinra 2-4mg/kg/day  corticosteroids (Arm A, n=142) while those with &#8805;500ng/ml received anakinra 5-8mg/kg/day with corticosteroids and ?3-globulins (Arm B, n=169). In case of no improvement a single dose of tocilizumab (8mg/kg; maximum 800mg) was administered with the potential of additional second and/or third pulses. Treatment endpoints were the rate of the development of respiratory failure necessitating intubation and the SARS-CoV-2-related mortality. The proposed algorithm was also validated in matched hospitalized-patients treated with standard-of-care during the same period. Results In overall, intubation and mortality rates were 5.8% and 5.1% (0% in moderate; 8.6% and 7.6% in severe). Low baseline pO2/FiO2 and older age were independent risk factors. Comparators had significantly higher intubation (HR=7.4; 95%CI: 4.1-13.4; p<0.001) and death rates (HR=4.5, 95%CI: 2.1-9.4, p<0.001).

Much information about the interplay between viruses and cell proliferation and metabolism has come from the history of clinical cases of patients infected with virus-induced cancer. In addition, information from viruses used to treat some types of cancer is valuable. Now, since the global coronavirus pandemic erupted almost a year ago, the scientific community has invested countless time and resources to slow down the infection rate and diminish the number of casualties produced by this highly infectious pathogen. A large percentage of cancer cases diagnosed are strongly related to dysregulations of the tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) family and its downstream signaling pathways. As such, many therapeutic agents have been developed to strategically target these structures in order to hinder certain mechanisms pertaining to the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells such as division, invasion or metastatic potential. Interestingly, several authors have pointed out that a correlation between coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 or MERS viruses and dysregulations of signaling pathways activated by TKRs can be established. This information may help to accelerate the repurposing of clinically developed anti-TKR cancer drugs in COVID-19 management. Because the need for treatment is critical, drug repurposing may be an advantageous choice in the search for new and efficient therapeutic compounds. This approach would be advantageous from a financial point of view as well, given that the resources used for research and development would no longer be required and can be potentially redirected towards other key projects. This review aims to provide an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with different TKRs and their respective downstream signaling pathway and how several therapeutic agents targeted against these receptors can interfere with the viral infection.

Under this framework, in the second stage, we develop a dual-children network (DuCN) based on a pre-trained ResNet-18 to simultaneously realize the disease diagnosis and similar case recommendation. Besides, we employ triplet loss and intrapulmonary distance maps to assist the detection, which helps incorporate tiny differences between two images and is conducive to improving the diagnostic accuracy. For each confirmed COVID-19 case, we give similar cases to provide radiologists with diagnosis and treatment references. We conduct experiments on a large publicly available dataset (CC-CCII) and compare the proposed model with state-of-the-art COVID-19 detection methods. The results show that our proposed model achieves a promising clinical performance. ? 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"DuCN: Dual-Children Network for Medical Diagnosis and Similar Case Recommendation Towards COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Conflicting data exist of an association between off-hour (weekend, holiday, or night-time) hospital admission and adverse outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We determined the association between off-hour admissions and poor clinical outcome, and of any differential effect of early intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering treatment between off- and on-hour admissions, among participants of the Intensive BP Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial (INTERACT2). METHODS Subsidiary analysis of INTERACT2, a multinational, multicenter, clinical trial of patients with spontaneous ICH with elevated systolic BP, randomly assigned to intensive (target systolic BP <140 mm Hg) or guideline-based (<180 mm Hg) BP management. Primary outcome was death or major disability (modified Rankin scale of 3-6) at 90 days. Off-hour admission was defined as night-time (4:30 p.m. to 8:30 a.m.) on weekdays, weekends (Saturday and Sunday), and public holidays in each participating country. RESULTS Of 2,794 patients with information on the primary outcome, 1,770 (63%) were admitted to study centers during off-hours. Off-hour admission was not associated with risk of poor outcome at 90 days (53% off-hour vs. 55% on-hour; p = 0.49), even after adjustment for comorbid risk factors (odds ratio 0.92; 95% CI 0.76-1.12). Consistency exists in the effects of intensive BP lowering between off- and on-hour admission (p = 0.85 for homogeneity). CONCLUSIONS Off-hour admission was not associated with increased risks of death or major disability among trial protocol participants with acute ICH. Intensive BP lowering can provide similar treatment effect irrespective of admission hours.","output":"Off-Hour Admission and Outcomes in Patients with Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage in the INTERACT2 Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical presentation, course of disease and health-care seeking behaviour of the first few hundred cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. METHODS: We implemented the World Health Organizations First Few X cases and contacts investigation protocol for COVID-19. Trained public health professionals collected information on 381 virologically confirmed COVID-19 cases from 31 January 2020 to 9 April 2020. We actively followed up cases to identify exposure to infection, symptoms and outcomes. We also collected limited data on 752 symptomatic people testing negative for COVID-19, as a control group for analyses of the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of symptoms. FINDINGS: Approximately half of the COVID-19 cases were imported (196 cases; 51.4%), of whom the majority had recent travel to Italy (140 cases; 71.4%). Of the 94 (24.7%) secondary cases, almost all reported close contact with a confirmed case (93 cases; 98.9%), many through household contact (37 cases; 39.8%). By age, a lower proportion of children had COVID-19. Most cases presented with cough, fever and fatigue. The sensitivity and specificity of symptoms varied by age, with nonlinear relationships with age. Although the proportion of COVID-19 cases with fever increased with age, for those with other respiratory infections the occurrence of fever decreased with age. The occurrence of shortness of breath also increased with age in a greater proportion of COVID-19 cases.

However, the pharmacological mechanism of JYTD against UC remains unclear. MATERIAL/METHODS: Compounds and targets of JYTD and UC-related genes were screened from public databases. Integrated analysis was performed to identify therapeutic targets of UC, followed by functional enrichment analysis. ProteinCprotein interaction (PPI) and pharmacological networks were then established. Molecular docking was used to validate the affinity of compounds and their targets. Further, the efficacy of JYTD was evaluated by meta-analysis. Relevant studies were searched from 5 databases. Outcomes were complete response rate (CRR) and overall response rate (ORR), and pooled results were estimated by risk ratio (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The pharmacological network identified 13 herbal medicines, 28 compounds, 54 targets, and 20 pathways. Stigmasterol, liquiritigenin, and naringenin were potential active compounds, and PRKCA, NFKB1, ESR1, NTRK1, AKT1, PPARG, RXRA, and VDR were hub targets. Pathway analysis revealed that genes were mainly involved in the cellular response to lipids. Molecular docking indicated that AKT1, NFKB1, ESR1, NTRK1, PRKCA, and PPARG exhibited good affinity to 6 key compounds of JYTD. Then, meta-analysis revealed that Tao Hua decoction treatment significantly improved CRR (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06C1.37; P=0.004) and ORR (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08C1.24; P<0.001).

Development of innovative direct-acting antiviral agents is sorely needed to address this virus. Peptide-conjugated morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are antisense agents composed of a phosphordiamidate morpholino oligomer covalently conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide. PPMO require no delivery assistance to enter cells and are able to reduce expression of targeted RNA through sequence-specific steric blocking. Objectives and Methods Five PPMO designed against sequences of genomic RNA in the SARS-CoV-2 5-untranslated region and a negative control PPMO of random sequence were synthesized. Each PPMO was evaluated for its effect on the viability of uninfected cells and its inhibitory effect on the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero-E6 cell cultures. Cell viability was evaluated with an ATP-based method and viral growth was measured with quantitative RT-PCR and TCID50 infectivity assays. Results PPMO designed to base-pair with sequence in the 5-terminal region or the leader transcription regulatory sequence-region of SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA were highly efficacious, reducing viral titers by up to 4-6 log10 in cell cultures at 48-72 hours post-infection, in a non-toxic and dose-responsive manner.

METHODS A prototype swept-source OCT system operating at 100-kHz axial scan rate was developed and interfaced with a pulse oximeter. Using the plethysmogram measured from the earlobe, Doppler OCT imaging of a 1.5-  2-mm area at the optic disc at 1.8 volumes/s was synchronized to cardiac cycle to improve sampling of pulsatile blood flow. Postprocessing algorithms were developed to achieve fully automatic calculation of TRBF. We evaluated the repeatability of en face Doppler OCT measurement of TRBF in 10 healthy young subjects using three methods: measurement at 100 kHz with asynchronous acquisition, measurement at 100 kHz with cardiac-gated acquisition, and a control measurement using a 400-kHz instrument with asynchronous acquisition. RESULTS The median intrasubject coefficients of variation (COV) of the three methods were 8.0%, 4.9%, and 6.1%, respectively. All three methods correlated well, without a significant bias. Mean TRBF measured at 100 kHz with cardiac-gated acquisition was 40.5  8.2 L/min, and the range was from 26.6 to 55.8 L/min. CONCLUSIONS Cardiac-gated en face Doppler OCT can achieve smaller measurement variability than previously reported methods. Although further validation in older subjects and diseased subjects is required, precise measurement of TRBF using cardiac-gated en face Doppler OCT at commercially available imaging speeds should be feasible.","output":"Cardiac-Gated En Face Doppler Measurement of Retinal Blood Flow Using Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography at 100,000 Axial Scans per Second."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Metastasis is a crucial cause of the high mortality in patients with lung cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important players in the development and progression of human cancers. Here, we aimed to identify metastasis-associated lncRNA and to study its roles in the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Materials and Methods We screened differentially expressed lncRNAs between high- and low-metastatic lung cancer cell lines by using microarray and identified the target lncRNA TM4SF1-AS1. The effect of the TM4SF1-AS1 on the invasion and migration was evaluated through the wound healing experiment and transwell assay. The expression of related genes was assessed by RNA sequence and Western blotting. Results TM4SF1-AS1 was highly expressed in high metastatic lung cancer cell line, and it was also significantly up-regulated in lymph node metastatic lung cancer and was associated with lymph node metastasis. Overexpression of TM4SF1-AS1 promoted the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Overexpression of TM4SF1-AS1 decreased the expression of E-Cadherin and increased the expression of Vimentin, Snail and Twist, while knockdown of TM4SF1-AS1 exhibited the opposite trend. Furthermore, RNA sequence analysis revealed that some signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, were enriched upon TM4SF1-AS1 overexpression. Western blotting further confirmed that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was activated by TM4SF1-AS1. Conclusion This study illustrates that TM4SF1-AS1 promotes the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

The authors investigate the intriguing question of whether the companies that issue green bonds are valued more by investors or not, and further extend our analysis by exploring whether the green image of companies helps to minimize the value erosion during a crisis and enhance the resilience of the stocks? Design/methodology/approach To examine the association between environmental commitments and firm value, the authors use the COVID-19 crisis as an exogenous shock and create a perfect natural setting to eliminate the endogeneity bias from our estimations. Moreover, the authors use propensity score matching to choose a one-to-one match of green bond firms with a larger pool of brown bond firms and eliminate the \\"size effect\\" arising out of the disproportionate sample size of green and brown bond firms. Findings The results of the study indicate that green bond firms are valued more by investors compared to brown bonds firms. Hence, green bond issuance acts as a strong signal of a firm's environmental commitment and it is well recognized by the investors. One of the possible reasons for a higher value of green bond firms may be due to their ability to arrest value erosion during environmental shocks. The authors could not find any difference in the resilience of green and brown bond firms. Originality/value The study contributes to the growing literature in the area of impact investing, specifically on exponentially growing innovative instrument green bond.

Spermatogenesis duration is stable within a certain species but highly variable even between species of the same family. OBJECTIVES In this study, spermatogenesis duration of the Roborovski hamster was measured for the first time, and spermatogenesis duration of the Chinese hamster was re-assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Stage classification and cycle length measurement was conducted via labelling the dividing cells with bromodeoxyuridine and an antibody-based chromogen as well as with the periodic acid-Schiff / hematoxylin stain. Analysis was conducted using reference calculation and linear regression. Morphological measurements completed our set of methods. RESULTS The mean duration of one seminiferous epithelium cycle was 8.58  0.34 days (mean  SEM; Phodopus roborovskii) and 16.59  0.47 days (Cricetulus griseus) based on the reference calculation. Slightly higher results were obtained using linear regression analysis: 9.72  0.41 days for P. roborovskii and 17.64  0.61 days for C. griseus. Additionally, a newly developed exemplary flowchart was proposed for the Roborovski hamster to facilitate spermatogenesis stage classification also in other species. The Chinese hamster presented an unexpected high paired epididymides weight of 1.701  0.046 g (mean  SEM) while having a body weight of only 40.5  0.7 g. However, no significant correlation between the relative epididymis weight and spermatogenesis duration in mammals (Spearman rank correlation: r = -0.119, p = 0.607, n = 21) or rodents could be found (r = 0.045, p = 0.903, n = 11). CONCLUSION Our data emphasize the stability of spermatogenesis duration within species and its remarkable variability between different species.

METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of a representative sample of General University Hospital of Castellon workers, vaccinated with two doses in January and February 2021. We measured IgG antibodies against protein N (IgG-NP), IgM against protein S (IgM-S), and quantitative levles of IgG against protein S (IgG-Quant) one month after the last dose. We obtained information on demographic, risk factors, and vaccine side effects via a self-completed questionnaire. For the statistical analysis we used multiple regression models. RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-five workers participated (96.8%, 275/284). Positive IgG-Quant, IgM-S, and IgG-NP were 99.6%, 14.9% and 4.4%, respectively. Adjusted IgG-Quant levels increased significantly with obesity, nonsmoking status, positive IgM-S, and/or IgG-NP. The prevalence of IgM-S was higher in males, and associated with the same factors as those for IgG-Quant. Among those with a history of COVD-19 infection, 42.9% did not have IgG-NP.

Methods & Materials A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among all household heads in Anguwan Mangu in February 2021 using total population sampling. A pre-tested, electronic based, semi-structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection from household heads. Data was analysed using SPSS version 23. Univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted at alpha level of significance set at p< 0.05 Results Three hundred and thirty-three respondents participated in the study. Age range was 15 to 80 years. Mean age of the respondents was 35 years (14.45). Only 55% (183/333) of the respondents were willing to accept COVID-19 vaccines. Major reasons for unwillingness to accept vaccines included; didn't feel the need to be vaccinated (4.5%), lack of trust in government (1.8%), belief that vaccine is used for population control (1.8%), belief that COVID-19 is not real (3%), and concerns over safety of the vaccines (1.8%). Household heads less than 50 years were more likely to accept the vaccines than those aged 50 and above (46% vs 41%) (p<0.592), those who were educated were more likely to accept the vaccines (50% vs 46%) (p<0.235), male household heads were more likely to accept vaccines than female household heads (66% vs 48%) (p<0.002).

Here, we show that coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) RNA replication is insensitive to BFA in MDCK cells, which contain a BFA-resistant GBF1 due to mutation M832L. Further evidence for a critical role of GBF1 stems from the observations that viral RNA replication is inhibited upon knockdown of GBF1 by RNA interference and that replication in the presence of BFA is rescued upon overexpression of active, but not inactive, GBF1. Overexpression of Arf proteins or Rab1B, a GTPase that induces GBF1 recruitment to membranes, failed to rescue RNA replication in the presence of BFA. Additionally, the importance of the interaction between enterovirus protein 3A and GBF1 for viral RNA replication was investigated. For this, the rescue from BFA inhibition of wild-type (wt) replicons and that of mutant replicons of both CVB3 and poliovirus (PV) carrying a 3A protein that is impaired in binding GBF1 were compared. The BFA-resistant GBF1-M832L protein efficiently rescued RNA replication of both wt and mutant CVB3 and PV replicons in the presence of BFA.

Our analysis identified that majority of the circulating strains strikingly differ from both the reference genome and the first sequenced genome from Bangladesh. Mutations in nonspecific proteins (NSP2-3, NSP-12(RdRp), NSP-13(Helicase)), S-Spike, ORF3a, and N-Nucleocapsid protein were common in the circulating strains with varying degrees and the most unique mutations (UM) were found in NSP3 (UM-18). But no or limited changes were observed in NSP9, NSP11, Envelope protein (E) and accessory factors (NSP7a, ORF 6, ORF7b) suggesting the possible conserved functions of those proteins in SARS-CoV-2 propagation. However, along with D614G mutation, more than 20 different mutations in the Spike protein were detected basically in the S2 domain. Besides, mutations in SR-rich region of N protein and P323L in RDRP were also present. However, the mutation accumulation showed a significant association (p = 0.003) with sex and age of the COVID-19-positive cases. So, identification of these mutational accumulation patterns may greatly facilitate vaccine development deciphering the age and the sex-dependent differential susceptibility to COVID-19.

The aim of this study is to assess lung perfusion changes with sCTA seen in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate them with clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective cohort study was carried out with 45 RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients that required hospitalization at three different hospitals, between April and May 2020. In all cases, a basic clinical and demographic profile was obtained. Lung perfusion was assessed using sCTA. Evaluated imaging features included: Pattern predominance of injured lung parenchyma in both lungs (ground-glass opacities, consolidation and mixed pattern) and anatomical extension; predominant type of perfusion abnormality (increased perfusion or hypoperfusion), perfusion abnormality distribution (focal or diffuse), extension of perfusion abnormalities (mild, moderate and severe involvement); presence of vascular dilatation and vascular tortuosity. All participants were followed-up until hospital discharge searching for the development of any of the study endpoints. These endpoints included intensive-care unit (ICU) admission, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS: Forty-one patients (55.2  16.5 years, 22 men) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and an interpretable iodine map were included. Patients with perfusion anomalies on sCTA in morphologically normal lung parenchyma showed lower Pa/Fi values (294  111.3 vs. 397  37.7, p = 0.035), and higher D-dimer levels (1156  1018 vs. 378  60.2, p < 0.01). The main common patterns seen in lung CT scans were ground-glass opacities, mixed pattern with predominant ground-glass opacities and mixed pattern with predominant consolidation in 56.1%, 24.4% and 19.5% respectively. Perfusion abnormalities were common (36 patients, 87.8%), mainly hypoperfusion in areas of apparently healthy lung. Patients with severe hypoperfusion in areas of apparently healthy lung parenchyma had an increased probability of being admitted to ICU and to initiate IMV (HR of 11.9 (95% CI 1.55-91.9) and HR 7.8 (95% CI 1.05-61.1), respectively).

Hemorrhagic complications (HC) after surgery are common and require surgical revision. Accurate estimation of the risk of postoperative HC can improve surgical decision-making process and minimize the risk of reoperation. The aim of the present study was to develop a predictive model for HC after LSG. MATERIAL AND METHODS The retrospective analysis of 522 patients after primary LSG was performed. Patients underwent surgery from January 2013 to February 2015. The primary outcome was defined as a surgical revision due to hemorrhagic complications. Multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS The rate of hemorrhagic complications was 4 %. The mean age of patients was 41.0 (11.6) years and mean BMI was 47.3 (7.3) kg/m2. Of the 12 examined variables, four were associated with risk of HC. Protective factors for HC were no history of obstructive sleep apnea (odds ratio [OR] 0.22; 95 % CI 0.05-0.94) and no history of hypertension (OR 0.38; 95 % CI 0.14-1.05). The low level of expertise in bariatric surgery (OR 2.85; 95 % CI 1.08-7.53) and no staple line reinforcement (OR 3.34; 95 % CI 1.21-9.21) were associated with higher risk of HC.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 22,481 adult breast cancer survivors who were active members of a large California integrated healthcare plan in 2020. We collected data on their breast cancer diagnosis, comorbidity, and demographic characteristics. We examined SARS-CoV-2 testing utilization between March 2020 and September 2020 by race or ethnicity, comorbidity, and other patient characteristics. We also examined the correlates of a having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. We conducted bivariable and multivariable logistic regression to identify correlates of testing utilization and test positivity. RESULTS: Of these 22,481 women, 3,288 (14.6%) underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. The cohort included 51.8% women of color. Of the 3,288 tested, 264 (8.0%) women had a positive test result. In multivariable analyses, Latinx survivors were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12 to 1.34) to undergo testing than White survivors; however, Asian or Pacific Islander survivors were 16% less likely to get tested (adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.94). Compared to White survivors, Latinx survivors were 3.5 times (adjusted OR, 3.47; 95% CI, 2.52 to 4.77) and Asian or Pacific Islander or Other survivors were 2.2-fold (adjusted OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.49 to 3.34) more likely to test positive.

Despite the presence of numerous FIs in Canada, there is still a lack of understanding on their distribution and effectiveness. This review first investigates the FIs available for residential and commercial buildings in Canada, and then performs a comprehensive review of studies related to FIs effectiveness evaluation. It is found that FIs for buildings in Canada can be distributed into four categories: tax, loans, grants, and rebates. Among these, rebates from utility providers are the most common and are administered in all provinces. In addition to these, special incentives are available for three end-users (low-income, aboriginal people, landlords and tenants) and for three types of buildings (heritage, non-profit and energy rated). A clear contrast is observed on FIs offered in three regulatory regimes (Federal, provincial and municipal). Four provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec) are leading in green building efforts. The in-depth literature review was also used to develop an understanding on the criteria used in effectiveness evaluation and the factors impacting effectiveness. Based on the findings of different studies on FIs effectiveness, a generic approach for evaluation of FIs is proposed that can help in deploying successful FIs programs.

However, many EDs experienced decreased demand even for higher acuity illnesses. In this study we sought to examine the change in utilization at a large Canadian community ED, including changes in patient demographics and presentations, as well as structural and administrative changes made in response to the pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study took place in Ontario, Canada, from March 17-June 30, 2020, during province-wide lockdowns in response to COVID-19. We used a control period of March 17-June 30 in 2018-2019. Differences between observed and expected values were calculated for total visits, Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) groups, and age groups using Fisher's exact test. Length of stay (LOS), physician initial assessment time (PIA), and top primary and admission diagnoses were also examined. RESULTS: Patient visits fell to 66.3% of expected volume in the exposure period (20,901 vs 31,525, P<0.0001). CTAS-1 (highest acuity) patient volumes dropped to 86.8% of expected (P = 0.1964) while CTAS-5 (lowest acuity) patient volumes dropped to 32.4% of expected (P <0.0001).

Our data demonstrated that HDFs are highly susceptible to MAYV infection. SB203580, a p38 inhibitor, reduced MAYV replication in a dose-dependent manner in both HDFs and HeLa cells. Additionally, SB203580 significantly decreased viral E1 protein expression. Similarly, knockdown or inhibition of p38?/p38 isoforms with NR-7h or Losmapimod, respectively, affected MAYV replication in a dose-dependent manner.

However, UPA came into disrepute due to its temporary suspension in 2017 and 2020 because of an apparent association with liver injury. This clinical opinion paper aims to review the process of marketing authorization and implementation of UPA, in order to provide all involved stakeholders with recommendations for the introduction of future drugs. Before marketing authorization, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) states that Phase III registration trials should evaluate relevant outcomes in a representative population, while comparing to gold-standard treatment. This review shows that the representativeness of the study populations in all PEARL trials was limited, surgical outcomes were not evaluated and intermittent treatment was assessed without comparative groups. Implementation into clinical practice was extensive, with 900 000 prescribed treatment cycles in 5 years in Europe and Canada combined. Extremely high costs are involved in developing and evaluating pre-marketing studies in new drugs, influencing trial design and relevance of chosen outcomes, thereby impeding clinical applicability. It is vitally important that the marketing implementation after authorization is regulated in such way that necessary evidence is generated before widespread prescription of a new drug.

SUMMARY ANSWER: No SARS-CoVC2 RNA was detected in semen. An impact of SARS-CoVC2 infection on semen quality and reproductive hormone profile awaits evaluation at 3 + 6 months follow-up. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: SARS-CoVC2 may use angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2 as an entry point into the cell. As ACE2 is expressed in testicular tissue, it has been speculated that SARS-CoVC2 may affect the male reproductive system. A cohort study including 38 male COVIDC19 patients showed that SARS-CoVC2 was present in the semen of six patients (15.8%) [Li et al., 2020]. Later studies including a total of 223 patients have not provided evidence of transmission of SARS-CoVC2 via semen. There are to date no available longitudinal studies on semen quality following SARS-CoVC2 infection. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Longitudinal cohort study including 50 non-hospitalized men from the general population in the Capital Region of Denmark. All participants had a confirmed SARS-CoVC2 infection by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on oropharyngeal swab material within the last week. The presence of SARS-CoVC2 in semen samples by RT-PCR, semen parameters and reproductive hormone profile were assessed at inclusion and at 3 + 6 months follow-up. SARS-CoVC2 antibody levels were assessed 3C5 weeks after inclusion. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: SARS-CoVC2-positive males (age 18C60 years) were included. Oropharyngeal and semen samples were tested by RT-PCR applying the E-Sarbeco primers and probe published by Corman et al. 2020 and adapted to TaqMan Fast Virus 1-step master mix and LightCycler 480 as previously reported by J?rgensen et al. 2020. SARS-CoVC2 antibodies were detected using the serological immunoassay from Shenzhen YHLO Biotech on the iFlash 1800. Semen quality parameters were analysed according to World Health Organisation (WHO) standards. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: To date, 25 men with a mean age of 35 years have been included in the study. SARS-CoVC2 RNA could not be detected in the semen samples of any of the 25 men at the time of inclusion. Twenty-one of the 25 men (84,0%) had a same day RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoVC2 infection in an oropharyngeal swab. RT-PCR cycle threshold (ct) values were distributed as follows: four (19,0%) were strongly positive (ct < 25), 16 (76,2%) intermediately positive (ct 25C35) and one (4,8%) weakly positive (ct 35C45). The four men without PCR-confirmed SARS-CoVC2 infection all had a positive IgG response to SARS-CoVC2 at the time of inclusion. Longitudinal semen and reproductive hormone profiles analyses will be performed. Further studies are needed to prove whether SARS-CoVC2 can be transmitted to the male reproductive tract and whether SARS-CoVC2 infection may cause alterations of spermatogenesis and endocrine function. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Strengths of this study are the unselected population of men examined within a week after confirmed SARS-CoVC2 infection and the follow-up of semen parameters and endocrine profile. Limitations are the limited sample size and the fact that semen quality was not known before the participants were diagnosed with COVIDC19. Wider implications of the findings: Knowledge of viral detection and semen persistence of SARS-CoVC2 is essential for clinical practice and public health. There is a need for evidence-based counselling on the impact of SARS-CoVC2 infection for patients undergoing assisted reproduction technology and patients who have a need for semen cryopreservation.

Understanding how governments deal with the negative impacts of the infodemic (e.g., public panic) has become a priority. This paper uses the theoretical framework of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to explore mechanisms for alleviating panic associated with the infodemic. It considers, in particular, the quality of information circulated on Government Social Media (GSM) as the central route and local government trust as the peripheral route. An empirical study was conducted using data from a focus group interview and a questionnaire survey collected within the first three weeks following the citywide lockdown of Wuhan, China. The results show that as: (1) Quality of GSM information does not significantly reduce public panic, but local government trust significantly increases peoples pandemic prevention knowledge; (2) Pandemic prevention knowledge is a critical mediator between information quality of GSM and public panic, as well as local government trust and public panic; and (3) Information quality of GSM significantly increases peoples trust in local governments.

Reflective practice provides an opportunity for individuals to learn through their experience as well as gaining insight into themselves and their practice. If completed effectively, it has been shown to reduce stress and improve mental well-being. Our aim therefore was to provide regular group reflective practice sessions with the aim of supporting junior doctor's mental wellbeing during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodJunior doctors within a critical care setting were offered two-weekly group reflective practice sessions focusing on difficult or challenging cases and encounters. The sessions were offered to all junior and middle grade doctors within a critical care department in a small district general hospital. Consultants were also able to attend. The groups were facilitated by a consultant liaison psychiatrist and an accredited balint group leader. Critical care doctors were provided a feedback questionnaire assessing the impact of the sessions and the levels of stress and burnout. The themes emerging from the sessions were also explored.ResultA total of six reflective practice sessions were offered during a three-month period. A total of four reflective practice sessions were completed;two sessions were cancelled due to high workload on the department. Each session lasted approximately 50mins. On average a total of 3-4 junior doctors attended each session. The sessions were conducted face to face in a socially distanced manner and with all participants wearing face masks. The sessions were predominately attended by foundation doctors and SHOs. There was occasional attendance by middle grades and a consultant.The predominant themes that emerged included: guilt, prolonged suffering, desensitisation, support and exhaustion. Despite the challenges associated with the pandemic and lockdown, many of the doctors also acknowledged the benefit of being at work during both waves of the pandemic. There was a sense of collectiveness and group belonging. The group found it beneficial to be able to share their experiences and challenges faced;this was most striking amongst the very junior members of the team.Questionnaires were also provided to gain additional insight into the wellbeing of the critical care doctors. Worryingly the results highlighted a significant proportion of doctors were experiencing signs of burnout including fatigue (77%), lack of energy (54%), cynicism (31%), frustration and irritability (45%) and detachment (38%). Many of the issues highlighted were in response to the demand created by the pandemic and a lack of medical staffing wth 69% of doctors requesting regular feedback on staffing issues.ConclusionBurnout and low morale were already highlighted in a significant number of junior doctors prior to the pandemic. COVID-19 has identified a clear need for NHS employers and medical leaders to provide emotional and psychological support to staff. It is vital that we create an open environment where individuals can express their feelings openly without fear that they will be judged. Group reflective practice provides an avenue to build on collectiveness created during both waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. This pilot has demonstrated that if introduced as part of a wellbeing support package, junior doctors within a critical care setting are able to utilise the sessions in an effective and productive manner.","output":"The introduction of regular group reflective practice sessions for junior doctors in a critical care setting during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic C a Pilot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-medication impacts both negatively and positively the health of people, which has become evident during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We performed a cross-sectional, analytical, multicenter study in 3792 study respondents on the use, the reason for use, and perception of relief after the use of six drugs during the quarantine period. An online questionnaire was developed, pretested and submitted to the general public. Multivariable logistic regression was used to ascertain factors that influence an individuals desire to self-medicate, associations were considered significant at p < 0.05 and using region (coast, mountain and jungle) as cluster group. The majority of respondents self-medicated with acetaminophen for respiratory symptoms and mainly because they had a cold or flu. It was observed that all the surveyed drugs (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, azithromycin, penicillin, antiretrovirals and hydroxychloroquine) were consumed for various symptoms including: fever, fatigue, cough, sneezing, muscle pain, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache and breathing difficulty. Over 90% of respondents perceived relief of at least one symptom. Multivariable logistic regression showed that older people have a higher frequency of antiretroviral self-medication, respondents who currently have a job had a higher frequency of penicillin self-medication, and that respondents from the Andes consumed less acetaminophen, while the ones from the rainforest consumed it more.

As outbreaks have spread throughout prisons and detention centers, detainees have organized collectively to demand life-saving measures. Chief among these demands has been the call for decarceration: the release of detainees and inmates to prevent exposure to COVID-19. This paper theorizes the compounding racial vulnerability that has led to such a marked spread behind bars, mainly among race-class subjugated communities. METHODS: We use journalistic sources and administrative data to provide an in-depth account of the spread of COVID-19 in American correctional facilities and of the mobilization to reduce contagions. We also use two survey experiments to describe public support for harm reduction and decarceration demands and measure the effects of information about (a) racial inequalities in prison, and (b) poor conditions inside migrant detention centers. FINDINGS: We find that only one-third to one-half of respondents believe that response to COVID-19 in prisons and immigrant detention centers should be a high priority. We also find that Americans are much more supportive of harm reduction measures like improved sanitation than of releasing people from prisons and detention centers. Information about racial disparities increases support for releasing more people from prison. We do not find any significant effect of information about poor conditions in migrant detention centers.

ANIMALS Fourteen 12-month-old female New Zealand White rabbits. PROCEDURES Rabbits were assigned to 2 treatment groups (7 rabbits/group). One group received buprenorphine (0.06 mg/kg, IV, q 8 h for 2 days), and the other received lidocaine (continuous rate infusion [CRI] at 100 g/kg/min for 2 days). Variables, including food and water consumption, fecal output, glucose and cortisol concentrations, and behaviors while in exercise pens, were recorded. RESULTS Rabbits receiving a lidocaine CRI had significantly higher gastrointestinal motility, food intake, and fecal output and significantly lower glucose concentrations, compared with results for rabbits receiving buprenorphine. Rabbits receiving lidocaine also had a higher number of normal behaviors (eg, sprawling, traveling, and frolicking) after surgery, compared with behaviors such as crouching and sitting that were seen more commonly in rabbits receiving buprenorphine. Both groups had significant weight loss after surgery. Pain scores did not differ significantly between treatment groups. Significant decreases in heart rate and respiratory rate were observed on the day of surgery, compared with values before and after surgery. Rabbits in the lidocaine group had significantly overall lower heart rates than did rabbits in the buprenorphine group. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE A CRI of lidocaine to rabbits provided better postoperative outcomes with respect to fecal output, food intake, and glucose concentrations. Thus, lidocaine appeared to be a suitable alternative to buprenorphine for alleviating postoperative pain with minimal risk of anorexia and gastrointestinal ileus.","output":"Effects of intravenous administration of lidocaine and buprenorphine on gastrointestinal tract motility and signs of pain in New Zealand White rabbits after ovariohysterectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic remains a global challenge. Accurate COVID-19 prognosis remains an important aspect of clinical management. While many prognostic systems have been proposed, most are derived from analyses of individual symptoms or biomarkers. Here, we take a machine learning approach to first identify discrete clusters of early stage-symptoms which may delineate groups with distinct symptom phenotypes. We then sought to identify whether these groups correlate with subsequent disease severity. METHODS: The Epidemiology, Immunology, and Clinical Characteristics of Emerging Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential (EPICC) study is a longitudinal cohort study with data and biospecimens collected from nine military treatment facilities over 1 year of follow-up. Demographic and clinical characteristics were measured with interviews and electronic medical record review. Early symptoms by organ-domain were measured by FLU-PRO-plus surveys collected for 14 days post-enrollment, with surveys completed a median 14.5 (Interquartile Range, IQR = 13) days post-symptom onset. Using these FLU-PRO-plus responses, we applied principal component analysis followed by unsupervised machine learning algorithm k-means to identify groups with distinct clusters of symptoms. We then fit multivariate logistic regression models to determine how these early-symptom clusters correlated with hospitalization risk after controlling for age, sex, race, and obesity. RESULTS: Using SARS-CoV-2 positive participants (n = 1137) from the EPICC cohort (Figure 1), we transformed reported symptoms into domains and identified three groups of participants with distinct clusters of symptoms. Logistic regression demonstrated that cluster-2 was associated with an approximately three-fold increased odds [3.01 (95% CI: 2-4.52); P < 0.001] of hospitalization which remained significant after controlling for other factors [2.97 (95% CI: 1.88-4.69); P < 0.001].

The RBD is a major target for neutralizing antibodies, whilst recombinant RBD is commonly used as an antigen in serological assays. Such assays are essential tools to gain control over the pandemic and detect the extent and durability of an immune response in infected or vaccinated populations. Transient expression in plants can contribute to the fast production of viral antigens, which are required by industry in high amounts. Whilst plant-produced RBDs are glycosylated, N-glycan modifications in plants differ from humans. This can give rise to the formation of carbohydrate epitopes that can be recognized by anti-carbohydrate antibodies present in human sera. For the performance of serological tests using plant-produced recombinant viral antigens, such cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) could result in false positives. Here, we transiently expressed an RBD variant in wild-type and glycoengineered Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and characterized the impact of different plant-specific N-glycans on RBD reactivity in serological assays. While the overall performance of the different RBD glycoforms was comparable to each other and to a human cell line produced RBD, there was a higher tendency toward false positive results with sera containing allergy-related CCD-antibodies when an RBD carrying 1,2-xylose and core 1,3-fucose was used. These rare events could be further minimized by pre-incubating sera from allergic individuals with a CCD-inhibitor. Thereby, false positive signals obtained from anti-CCD antibodies, could be reduced by 90%, on average.","output":"Impact of Specific N-Glycan Modifications on the Use of Plant-Produced SARS-CoV-2 Antigens in Serological Assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effective data mining of social media has become increasingly recognized for its value in informing decision makers of public welfare However, existing studies do not fully exploit the underlying merit of big data In this study, we develop a data-driven framework that integrates machine learning with spatial statistics, and then use it on Xiamen Island, China to delineate urban population dynamic patterns based on hourly Baidu heat map data collected from August 25 to September 3, 2017 The results showed that hot grids are primarily clustered along the main street through the downtown area during working days, whereas cold grids are often observed at the edge of the city during the weekend The mixed use (of commercial and life services, restaurants and snack bars, offices, leisure areas and sports complexes) is the most significant contributing factor A new cold grid emerged near conference venues before the Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa Summit, revealing the strong effects of regulations on population dynamics and its evolving patterns This study demonstrates that the proposed data-driven framework might offer new insights into urban population dynamics and its driving mechanism in support of sustainable urban development","output":"Data-driven Framework for Delineating Urban Population Dynamic Patterns: Case Study on Xiamen Island, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel pyrrolopyridone BET degraders were designed and synthesized based on the binding mode between the pyrrolopyridone BET inhibitor with the BRD4 protein.

Isolation and the fear of getting infected affected the entire population, but it is felt more in pregnant women. The aim of this study is to examine the anxiety and behavioral changes in pregnant women caused by COVID-19 pandemic and antenatal care quality during the quarantine period. Methods: A cross-sectional study was initiated at outpatient clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology Department in University of Health Sciences Turkey, Prof. Dr. Cemil Tascioglu City Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, between 07 May and May 31, 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak curfew quarantine period. A total of 291 patients (174 pregnant and 102 non-pregnant) were included. The data were obtained from both qualitative and quantitative methods using face-to-face survey, using the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) and personal information form with lifestyle change questionnaire. Anxiety levels, behavioral changes were compared and antenatal care quality assessed. Results: Pregnant participants had higher anxiety STAI state (STAI-S) scores than the non-pregnant participants (43.6710.77 vs. 39.629.45, p=0.02). The STAI trait (STAI-T) anxiety scores were similar between the two groups (43.578.07 vs. 43.339.56, p=0.82. 60 of pregnant participants were in first trimester, 53 were in second and 61 were in third trimester. The education level of the pregnant participants and whether they received psychosocial support or in which trimester they were, did not make any difference between the STAI-S and STAI-T scores. 67.8% of pregnant participants stated about the fear of going to the hospital and 46.6% canceled their appointments of prenatal care. Appointment canceling was highest in third trimester (p=<0.001). Conclusion: During the quarantine period, increased maternal anxiety and decreased antenatal care quality determined, that may lead to increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality.

The prediction of COVID-19 behaviour and trend is crucial to prevent its spreading. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is Asias fifth largest country, and it hosts the two holiest cities of the Islamic world. KSA hosts millions of pilgrims every year, and it is of great importance to predict the COV-ID-19 spread to organize these religious activities and bring life to normality in KSA. This study proposes four tree-based ensemble methods to predict the COV-ID-19 daily new cases in KSA. Tree-based ensemble methods are suggested to reduce the variance and/or bias of inconsistent models. The four models utilized in the study are Gradient Tree Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Voting Regressor (VR). The study is conducted using Our Data in World (OWID) COVID-19 dataset from the first confirmed case in KSA, i.e., 2nd March 2020 to 14th April 2021. The results suggest that the tree-based ensemble models provide a good prediction of daily COVID-19 new cases and can follow the trend of COVID-19. Among the models, XGBoost and VR performed better than the other three models with the best evaluation metric scores (MAE:4.41, RMSE:7.11, MAPE:0.95%).

The overall theme of these reports was that 'electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but the power grid is still reliable' - mostly due to reduced economic activity. In this paper, we analyze electricity data until the end of May 2020, examining both electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid. We limit this study to three states in the U.S. California, Florida and New York. The results indicate that the effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction, and there are noticeable differences among regions analyzed. The variables that can indicate stress on the grid (e.g., daily peak and trough of the hourly demand, demand ramp rate, demand forecast error, and net electricity interchange) also conveyed mixed messages: some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to the pandemic is correcting for weather as it can be challenging to accurately define it for large geographic regions. We provide a weather-correction method, apply it to a small city-wide area in North Central Florida, and discuss the implications of the estimated changes in demand.

At the same time, statistical and econometric analysis of financial and economic markets and of the spread of COVID-19 is complicated by the inherent potential non-stationarity, dependence, heterogeneity and heavy-tailedness in the data. This paper focuses on econometrically justified robust analysis of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the World's financial markets in different countries across the World. Among other results, the study focuses on robust inference in predictive regressions for different countries across the World. We also present a detailed study of persistence, heavy-tailedness and tail risk properties of the time series of the COVID-19 death rates that motivate the necessity in applications of robust inference methods in the analysis. Econometrically justified analysis is based on application of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) inference methods, related approaches using consistent standard errors, recently developed robust $t$-statistic inference procedures and robust tail index estimation approaches.","output":"COVID-19: Tail Risk and Predictive Regressions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Duringthese disasters, our public health systems were tested and shown to be a \\"colossal failure,\\"2 allowing our communities to become vulnerable and suffer health consequences related to climate disasters and COVID-19, with COVID-19 killing more than 240 000 people in the United States Another key feature of this research is the importance of gathering data to track the long-term health consequences of climate change PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE Recently, the 10 essential public health services were updated, and they encapsulate perfectly how we need to respond to the climate crisis 5 In their article, Zacher et al demonstrate the use of longitudinal data to determine the root causes of health disparities and inequities as they relate to long-term physical health symptoms caused by Hurricane Katrina","output":"Climate Change Is Already Exacerbating Current Social Inequities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To present the otologic findings of a patient with COVID-19 and complicated acute otitis media, evaluate for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in middle ear fluid, and assess whether suctioning of middle ear fluid may be aerosol- generating. METHODS: The case of a man with SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis is presented to illustrate unique clinical decisions made in context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cadaveric temporal bone was used to simulate droplet spread during suctioning of fluorescein-labelled middle ear fluid and visualized with a blue-light filter. RESULTS: A 23-year-old male who presented with complicated acute otitis media with facial paralysis was found to have an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2, with positive viral PCR of nasopharyngeal swab, and a negative PCR of the middle ear fluid. He was placed on isolation precautions and treated with myringotomy, topical and systemic antibiotics, and antivirals. Consistent with observations during endonasal suctioning, suctioning of middle ear fluid was not found to be aerosol or droplet generating. CONCLUSION: The case of a patient with active COVID-19 presenting with complicated acute otitis media in whom middle ear fluid was sampled to evaluate the etiology of the infection and the potential middle ear predilection of SARS-CoV-2 is described. This study has implications for the clinical management of patients with both known and unknown SARS-CoV-2 infection who present with ear disease. While middle ear suctioning may not be aerosol-generating, the risk of coughing or prolonged close contact requires heightened precautions during otologic procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19.","output":"Considerations in Management of Acute Otitis Media in the COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is bringing hardship and tragedy.

Up to this moment, there are no signs of remission and there is no proven effective cure. The vaccine is the primary biomedical preventive measure against the novel coronavirus. However, the public bias or sentiments, as reflected on social media, may have significant impact on the progress to achieve the herd immunity needed principally. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use machine learning methods to extract public topics and sentiments on the COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter. METHODS: We collected 31,100 English tweets containing COVID-19 vaccine-related keywords between January and October 2020 from Australian Twitter users. Specifically, we analyzed the tweets by visualizing the high-frequency word clouds and correlations between word tokens. We built the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model to identify the commonly discussed topics from massive tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiments and emotions on COVID-19 vaccination in the Australian society. RESULTS: Our analysis identified three LDA topics including \\"Attitudes towards COVID-19 and its vaccination\\", \\"Advocating infection control measures against COVID-19\\", and \\"Misconceptions and complaints about COVID-19 control\\". In all tweets, nearly two-thirds of the sentiments were positive, and around one-third were negative in the public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine. Among the eight basic emotions, \\"trust\\" and \\"anticipation\\" were the two prominent positive emotions, while \\"fear\\" was the top negative emotion in the tweets. CONCLUSIONS: Our new findings indicate that some Australian Twitter users supported infection control measures against COVID-19, and would refute misinformation. However, the others who underestimated the risks and severity of COVID-19 would probably rationalize their position on the COVID-19 vaccinations with certain conspiracy theories. It is also noticed that the level of positive sentiment in the public may not be enough to further a vaccination coverage which would be sufficient to achieve vaccination-induced herd immunity. Governments should explore the public opinion and sentiments towards COVID-19 and its vaccination, and implement an effective vaccination promotion scheme besides supporting the development and clinical administration of COVID-19 vaccines.","output":"Twitter Speaks: An Analysis of Australian Twitter Users' Topics and Sentiments About COVID-19 Vaccination Using Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventilatory support, while life saving, can also cause or aggravate lung injury through several mechanisms which are encompassed within ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI).

SARS-CoV-2 Symptoms: Cough ? fever Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Gastroenterology and Hepatology ? Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging disease that is still not fully characterized. It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel virus that can be transmitted easily from human to human mainly by the respiratory route. Currently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19 or a vaccine for prevention. The disease has various degrees of severity. It often presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue, accompanied by respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough and dyspnea) and other systemic involvement. Severe disease is associated with hemophagocytic syndrome and cytokine storm due to altered immune response. Patients with severe disease are more likely to have increased liver enzymes. The disease can affect the liver through various mechanisms. CASE REPORT: We report an unusual case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a 24-year-old man with no previous medical illness, who presented with mild respiratory involvement. He had no serious lung injury during the disease course. However, he experienced acute fulminant hepatitis B infection and cytokine release syndrome that led to multiorgan failure and death. CONCLUSIONS: It is uncommon for SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild respiratory symptoms to result in severe systemic disease and organ failure. We report an unusual case of acute hepatitis B infection with concomitant SARS-CoV-2 leading to fulminant hepatitis, multiorgan failure, and death.","output":"A Case of Fulminant Liver Failure in a 24-Year-Old Man with Coinfection with Hepatitis B Virus and SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nosocomial COVID-19 in older patients has a high mortality rate.

However, killing cells generates cell debris which can promote tumor progression. Thus, therapy can be a double-edged sword. Specifically, injury and debris generated by cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, may offset their benefit by promoting the secretion of pro-tumorigenic factors (e.g., eicosanoid-driven cytokines) that stimulate regrowth and metastasis of surviving cells. The debris produced by cytotoxic cancer therapy can also contribute to a tumor microenvironment that promotes tumor progression and recurrence. Although not well understood, several molecular mechanisms have been implicated in debris-stimulated tumor growth that we review here, such as the involvement of extracellular vesicles, exosomal miR-194-5p, Bax, Bak, Smac, HMGB1, cytokines, and caspase-3.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study involving 754 participants  65 years. Data collected include demographics, cognition, and physical measurements. RESULTS: Females had a higher prevalence of high BMI with CO and a lower prevalence of high BMI without CO than males (61.0% vs 44.6% and 4.6% vs 15.0%, respectively). Within gender, CO groups, regardless of BMI, had lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE), handgrip strength (HGS), and longer timed-up-and-go (TUG) scores. Overall, the high BMI without CO group had the highest MMSE scores, HGS, and shortest TUG. Amongst males, HGS was significantly lower in the normal BMI with CO group (B ?3.28, 95% CI ?6.32 to ?0.23, P = 0.04). CO, regardless of normal/high BMI, had significantly longer TUG time (B 2.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.84, P = 0.02; B 1.07, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.88, P = 0.01, respectively) than normal BMI without CO group. CO was associated with lower MMSE scores in both genders but significant only in males with normal BMI and CO (B ?1.60, 95% CI ?3.15 to ?0.06, P = 0.04).

Young adults were previously found to have poorer functional capacity than healthy peers, but the question remains whether functional capacity degenerates further with age. Methods and Results A group of 30 patients with surgically closed VSDs (518 years) with 30 matched, healthy control participants (529 years) and a group of 30 patients with small unrepaired VSDs (5512 years) and 30 matched control participants (5510 years) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing using an incremental workload protocol and noninvasive gas measurement. Peak oxygen uptake was lower in participants with closed VSDs than matched controls (247 versus 349 mL/min per kg, P<0.01) and with unrepaired VSDs than matched controls (265 versus 328 mL/min per kg, P<0.01). Patients demonstrated lower oxygen uptake from exercise levels at 20% of maximal workload compared with respective control groups (P<0.01). Peak ventilation was lower in patients with surgically closed VSDs than control participants (1.00.3 versus 1.40.4 L/min per kg, P<0.01) but similar in patients with unrepaired VSDs and control participants (P=0.14). Exercise capacity was 29% lower in older patients with surgically closed VSDs than healthy peers, whereas younger patients with surgically closed VSDs previously demonstrated 18% lower capacity compared with peers. Older patients with unrepaired VSDs reached 21% lower exercise capacity, whereas younger patients with unrepaired VSDs previously demonstrated 17% lower oxygen uptake than healthy peers. Conclusions Patients with VSDs demonstrate poorer exercise capacity than healthy peers. The difference between patients and control participants increased with advancing age-and increased most in patients with operated VSDs-compared with previous findings in younger patients.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can manifest itself with this neuropsychiatric disorder. The endpoints of our study were: the frequency of delirium in subjects with COVID-19 pneumonia; the risk factors that predispose to this condition; and the impact of delirium on mortality. Subjects were consecutively enrolled in a Geriatric Unit from January 5th to March 5th, 2021. Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a radiologically documented pneumonia, and the ability of providing informed consent. Exclusion criteria were: absence of radiological evidence of pneumonia, sepsis, and the need of intensive care unit treatment. All subjects were evaluated by means of Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) and Confusion Assessment Method-Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) at least twice per day. In the study cohort (n = 71), twenty patients (28.2%) had delirium. Delirium was present on admission in 11.3%, and occurred during hospitalization in 19.0%. Compared to patients without delirium, patients who developed this neuropsychiatric disorder had a higher mortality rate (35% vs 5.9%) and an increased average hospital length of stay (21 days vs 17 days). In the multivariate analysis delirium was associated with frailty (OR = 2.81; CI = 1.4C5.8) and helmet ventilation (OR = 141.05; CI = 4.3C4663.9). Delirium was an independent predictor of mortality. Nearly a third of subjects (28.2%) had delirium during hospitalization for COVID-19. This finding supports the notion that delirium is a common complication of SARS-CoV2 infection. Since delirium is associated with longer hospital stay, and it is an independent marker of increased mortality, clinicians should assess and prevent it.","output":"Delirium in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: a prospective, cross-sectional, cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mental illnesses have received increasing attention in the work context in recent years, yet they are still often accompanied by stigma.

Here, we develop novel severe-disease animal models for COVID-19 involving disruption of adaptive immunity in Syrian hamsters. Cyclophosphamide (CyP) immunosuppressed or RAG2 knockout (KO) hamsters were exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the respiratory route. Both the CyP-treated and RAG2 KO hamsters developed clinical signs of disease that were more severe than those in immunocompetent hamsters, notably weight loss, viral loads, and fatality (RAG2 KO only). Disease was prolonged in transiently immunosuppressed hamsters and was uniformly lethal in RAG2 KO hamsters. We evaluated the protective efficacy of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody and found that pretreatment, even in immunosuppressed animals, limited infection. Our results suggest that functional B and/or T cells are not only important for the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 but also play an early role in protection from acute disease. IMPORTANCE Syrian hamsters are in use as a model of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Pathology is pronounced in the upper and lower respiratory tract, and disease signs and endpoints include weight loss and viral RNA and/or infectious virus in swabs and organs (e.g., lungs). However, a high dose of virus is needed to produce disease, and the disease resolves rapidly. Here, we demonstrate that immunosuppressed hamsters are susceptible to low doses of virus and develop more severe and prolonged disease. We demonstrate the efficacy of a novel neutralizing monoclonal antibody using the cyclophosphamide transient suppression model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that RAG2 knockout hamsters develop severe/fatal disease when exposed to SARS-CoV-2. These immunosuppressed hamster models provide researchers with new tools for evaluating therapies and vaccines and understanding COVID-19 pathogenesis.","output":"Disruption of Adaptive Immunity Enhances Disease in SARS-CoV-2-Infected Syrian Hamsters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our previous study [Evaluation of sodium intake for the prediction of cardiovascular events in Japanese high-risk patients (ESPRIT study)] reported that increased sodium excretion 4.0 g/day was associated with composite cardiovascular events in hospitalization for heart failure (HF), acute coronary syndrome, cerebrovascular events and documented cardiovascular-related mortality in Japanese high-risk patients with either stable and compensated HF, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease or atrial fibrillation. However, the method of estimating sodium excretion levels using spot urine is complex, requiring age, body weight, height and multiplier factors for calculation. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether the sodium to creatinine ratio in spot urine, a key component in estimating daily sodium excretion, was associated with hospitalization for HF. The present study performed a post-hoc analysis of the ESPRIT study (n=520; 60 hospitalizations for HF). Receiver operating curve analysis yielded an optimal sodium to creatinine ratio cut-off value of 24.8 for detecting hospitalization for HF. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that a high sodium to creatinine ratio in spot urine was associated with an increased hospitalization for HF (P<0.001). Cox regression analysis revealed that a high sodium to creatinine ratio was associated with hospitalization for HF with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.49 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.47-4.16]. Following adjustment for age, sex and body weight, the HR was as high as 2.74 (95% CI, 1.51-4.71).

Meat consumption is a leading driver of infectious disease. Wildlife sales at wet markets, bushmeat hunting, and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are all exceptionally risky activities that facilitate disease spread and impose immense harms on human populations.

Significant increases in surface O$_{3}$ have been reported in many cities during the COVID-19 lockdown. Here we conduct comprehensive observation and modeling analyses of surface O$_{3}$ across China for periods before and during the lockdown. We find that daytime O$_{3}$ decreased in the subtropical south, in contrast to increases in most other regions. Meteorological changes and emission reductions both contributed to the O$_{3}$ changes, with a larger impact from the former especially in central China. The plunge in nitrogen oxide (NO$_{x}$) emission contributed to O$_{3}$ increases in populated regions, whereas the reduction in volatile organic compounds (VOC) contributed to O$_{3}$ decreases across the country. Due to a decreasing level of NO$_{x}$ saturation from north to south, the emission reduction in NO$_{x}$ (46%) and VOC (32%) contributed to net O$_{3}$ increases in north China;the opposite effects of NO$_{x}$ decrease (49%) and VOC decrease (24%) balanced out in central China, whereas the comparable decreases (45-55%) in these two precursors contributed to net O$_{3}$ declines in south China.

Their apparent brittleness under uniaxial loading, however, is still a major obstacle to their industrialization. Moreover, BMGs often contain crystalline defects developed, intentionally or not, during their complex and delicate elaboration. These flaws are known to affect their fracture toughness and their plastic behaviour. This paper reviews twenty years of works about this subject on Zr-based bulk metallic glasses that may contain a low volume fraction of crystalline defects of different natures, e.g. dendrites or spherulites, depending on the synthesis method. Dedicated experimental set-ups, mainly bending tests on notched beams, were developed to create in the specimen a proper pre-crack by fatigue and then load it monotonically up to fracture. The measured fracture toughness and the fractographic observations allow to conclude that these crystalline defects facilitate pre-cracking, but result in an embrittlement that is more or less significant depending on their type. The loading mode of the crack -- mode I, II or mixed -- as well as the temperature were shown to play a key role in crack initiation and propagation, whether steadily or catastrophically, in the BMG. By means of finite element computations analyses, explanations on how the crystalline flaws presence can affect fracture toughness and perturbate crack growth, under mode I and mode II, were proposed.Finally, the relevance of these experimental techniques as well as the link between crystalline defects, fracture toughness and their consequences on the ductility of a structural component are discussed.","output":"Crystalline defects in bulk metallic glasses: consequences on fracture toughness determination and ductility"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The DAR Global surveyof Ramadan-fasting during the COVID-19 pandemic aimed to describe the characteristics and care in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D)with a specific comparison between those < 65years and>65 years.

Herein, we are proposing a novel variable [PaO(2)/(FiO(2)xPEEP) or P/FP(E)] for PEEP  5 to address Berlins definition gap for ARDS severity by using machine learning (ML) approaches. METHODS: We examined P/FP(E) values delimiting the boundaries of mild, moderate, and severe ARDS. We applied ML to predict ARDS severity after onset over time by comparing current Berlin PaO(2)/FiO(2) criteria with P/FP(E) under three different scenarios. We extracted clinical data from the first 3 ICU days after ARDS onset (N = 2738, 1519, and 1341 patients, respectively) from MIMIC-III database according to Berlin criteria for severity. Then, we used the multicenter database eICU (2014C2015) and extracted data from the first 3 ICU days after ARDS onset (N = 5153, 2981, and 2326 patients, respectively). Disease progression in each database was tracked along those 3 ICU days to assess ARDS severity. Three robust ML classification techniques were implemented using Python 3.7 (LightGBM, RF, and XGBoost) for predicting ARDS severity over time. RESULTS: P/FP(E) ratio outperformed PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio in all ML models for predicting ARDS severity after onset over time (MIMIC-III: AUC 0.711C0.788 and CORR 0.376C0.566; eICU: AUC 0.734C0.873 and CORR 0.511C0.745). CONCLUSIONS: The novel P/FP(E) ratio to assess ARDS severity after onset over time is markedly better than current PaO(2)/FiO(2) criteria. The use of P/FP(E) could help to manage ARDS patients with a more precise therapeutic regimen for each ARDS category of severity.

Debriefing can help clinicians process these emotions, but the coronavirus pandemic makes it difficult to create a physically and psychologically safe space in the emergency department (ED) to perform this intervention. In response, we piloted a video-based debriefing program to support emergency clinician well-being. We report the details of our program and results of our evaluation of its acceptability and perceived value to emergency clinicians during the pandemic. METHODS: ED attending physicians, resident physicians, and non-physician practitioners (NPP) at our quaternary-care academic medical center were invited to participate in role-based, weekly one-hour facilitated debriefings using Zoom. ED attendings with experience in debriefing led each session and used an explorative approach that focused on empathy and normalizing reactions. At the end of the pilot, we distributed to participants an anonymous 10-point survey that included multiple-answer questions and visual analogue scales. RESULTS: We completed 18 debriefings with 68 unique participants (29 attending physicians, 6 resident physicians, and 33 NPPs. A total of 76% of participants responded to our survey and 77% of respondents participated in at least two debriefings. Emergency clinicians reported that the most common reasons to participate in the debriefings were to enhance my sense of community and connection (81%) followed by to support colleagues (75%). Debriefing with members of the same role group (92%) and the Zoom platform (81%) were considered to be helpful aspects of the debriefing structure. Although emergency clinicians found these sessions to be useful (78.8 +/? 17.6) interquartile range: 73C89), NPPs were less comfortable speaking up (58.5 +/? 23.6) than attending physicians (77.8 +/? 25.0) (p = < 0.008).

Once the decomposition of the MEWs is completed, we fit the solution of the SIQR-N model to each MTLF using optimized parameters. Finally, we superpose the solutions obtained by multiple SIQR-N (MSIQR-N) models with the optimized parameters to fit the MEWs. The other is a set of N in the SIQR-N model as a function of time, namely, N(t), now called the SIQR-N ( t ) model. Numerical results indicate that a logistic functional approximation of N(t) fits MEWs with good accuracy.

We analysed data from putative household infector - infectee pairs in the Virus Watch Community cohort study to assess the serial interval of COVID-19 and whether this was affected by emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant. Methods: The Virus Watch study is an online, prospective, community cohort study following up entire households in England and Wales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Putative household infector-infectee pairs were identified where more than one person in the household had a positive swab matched to an illness episode. Data on whether or not individual infections were caused by the B.1.1.7 variant were not available. We therefore developed a classification system based on the percentage of cases estimated to be due to B.1.1.7 in national surveillance data for different English regions and study weeks. Results: Out of 24,887 illnesses reported, 915 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 186 likely infector-infectee pairs in 186 households amongst 372 individuals were identified. The mean COVID-19 serial interval was 3.18 (95%CI: 2.55 - 3.81) days.

AI might change the clinical practice of physicians from almost all medical disciplines and in most areas of health care. While expectations for AI in medicine are high, practical implementations of AI for clinical practice are still scarce in Germany. Moreover, physicians requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the usage of anonymized patient data for clinical and biomedical research have not been investigated widely in German university hospitals. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate physicians requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the secondary usage of patient data for (bio)medical research (eg, for the development of machine learning algorithms) in university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted addressing physicians of all medical disciplines in 8 German university hospitals. Answers were given using Likert scales and general demographic responses. Physicians were asked to participate locally via email in the respective hospitals. RESULTS: The online survey was completed by 303 physicians (female: 121/303, 39.9%; male: 173/303, 57.1%; no response: 9/303, 3.0%) from a wide range of medical disciplines and work experience levels. Most respondents either had a positive (130/303, 42.9%) or a very positive attitude (82/303, 27.1%) towards AI in medicine. There was a significant association between the personal rating of AI in medicine and the self-reported technical affinity level (H(4)=48.3, P<.001). A vast majority of physicians expected the future of medicine to be a mix of human and artificial intelligence (273/303, 90.1%) but also requested a scientific evaluation before the routine implementation of AI-based systems (276/303, 91.1%). Physicians were most optimistic that AI applications would identify drug interactions (280/303, 92.4%) to improve patient care substantially but were quite reserved regarding AI-supported diagnosis of psychiatric diseases (62/303, 20.5%). Of the respondents, 82.5% (250/303) agreed that there should be open access to anonymized patient databases for medical and biomedical research. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in stationary patient care in German university hospitals show a generally positive attitude towards using most AI applications in medicine. Along with this optimism comes several expectations and hopes that AI will assist physicians in clinical decision making. Especially in fields of medicine where huge amounts of data are processed (eg, imaging procedures in radiology and pathology) or data are collected continuously (eg, cardiology and intensive care medicine), physicians expectations of AI to substantially improve future patient care are high. In the study, the greatest potential was seen in the application of AI for the identification of drug interactions, assumedly due to the rising complexity of drug administration to polymorbid, polypharmacy patients. However, for the practical usage of AI in health care, regulatory and organizational challenges still have to be mastered.","output":"Future Medical Artificial Intelligence Application Requirements and Expectations of Physicians in German University Hospitals: Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Birth asphyxia is a leading cause of neonatal mortality. Ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) levels may have a predictive role in the identification and prevention of hypoxic disorders, as they increase in cases of ischemia of the liver, heart, brain, bowel, and kidney. PURPOSE This study aimed to assess the value of IMA levels as a diagnostic marker for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). METHODS Sixty newborns who fulfilled 3 or more of the clinical and biochemical criteria and developed HIE as defined by Levene staging were included in our study as the asphyxia group. Neonates with congenital malformation, systemic infection, intrauterine growth retardation, low-birth weight, cardiac or hemolytic disease, family history of neurological diseases, congenital or perinatal infections, preeclampsia, diabetes, and renal diseases were excluded from the study. Sixty healthy neonates matched for gestational age and with no maternal history of illness, established respiration at birth, and an Apgar score 7 at 1 and 5 minutes were included as the control group. IMA was determined by double-antibody enzymelinked immunosorbent assay of a cord blood sample collected within 30 minutes after birth. RESULTS Cord blood IMA levels were higher in asphyxiated newborns than in controls (250.8336.07 pmol/mL vs. 120.2438.9 pmol/mL). Comparison of IMA levels by HIE stage revealed a highly significant difference among them (207.326.65, 259.2811.68, 294.994.41 pmol/mL for mild, moderate, and severe, respectively). At a cutoff of 197.6 pmol/mL, the sensitivity was 84.5%, specificity was 86%, positive predictive value was 82.8%, negative predictive value was 88.3%, and area under the curve was 0.963 (P<0.001). CONCLUSION IMA levels can be a reliable marker for the early diagnosis of neonatal HIE and can be a predictor of injury severity.","output":"Evaluation of the role of ischemia modified albumin in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Precise reduction of a syndesmosis after disruption is critical to improve patient physical function. Intraoperative lateral radiographs of the unaffected ankle are often used in clinical practice as a template for anatomic syndesmotic reduction because sagittal plane malreduction is common. However, there is little data to suggest fibular station, or the position of the fibula in the AP plane on the lateral radiograph, is symmetric side-to-side in patients. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES (1) Is the position of the fibula in the AP plane (fibular station) on lateral ankle radiographs symmetric in an individual? (2) Do the measurements used to judge the position of the fibula on lateral radiographs have good inter- and intraobserver reliability? METHODS Over the period from August 2016 to October 2018, we identified 478 patients who presented to an orthopaedic clinic with forefoot and midfoot complaints. Skeletally mature patients with acceptable bilateral lateral ankle radiographs, which are common radiographs obtained for new patients to clinic for any complaint, were included. Based on that, 52% (247 of 478 patients) were included with most (22%, 107 patients) excluded for poor lateral radiographs. The most common diagnosis in the patient cohort was midfoot OA (14%, 35 patients). The median (range) age of the included patients was 54 years (15 to 88), and 65% (159 of 247) of the patients were female. Fibular station, defined as the position of the fibula in the AP plane, and fibular length were measured using a digital ruler and goniometer on lateral radiographs. A paired t-test was used to determine if no difference in fibular station existed between the left and right ankles. With 247 paired-samples, with 80% power and an alpha level of 0.05, we could detect a difference between sides of 0.008 for the posterior ratio, 0.010 for the anterior ratio, and 0.012 for fibular length. Two readers, one fellowship-trained orthopaedic traumatologist and one PGY-4, measured 40 patients to determine the inter- and intraobserver reliability by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS The posterior fibular station (mean right 0.147 [ = 0.056], left 0.145 [ = 0.054], difference = 0.03 [95% CI 0 to 0.06]; p = 0.59), anterior fibular station (right 0.294 [ = 0.062], left 0.299 [ = 0.061], difference = 0.04 [95% CI 0 to 0.08]; p = 0.20), and fibular length (right 0.521 [ = 0.080], left 0.522 [ = 0.078], difference = 0.05 [95% CI 0.01 to 0.09]; p = 0.87) ratios did not differ with the numbers available between ankles. Inter- and intraobserver reliability were excellent for the posterior ratio (ICC = 0.928 and ICC = 0.985, respectively) and the anterior ratio (ICC = 0.922 and ICC = 0.929, respectively) and moderate-to-good for the fibular length ratio (ICC = 0.732 and ICC = 0.887, respectively). CONCLUSION The use of lateral radiographs of the contralateral uninjured ankle appears to be a valid template for determining the position of the fibula in the sagittal plane. However, further prospective studies are required to determine the efficacy of this method in reducing the syndesmosis over other methods that exists.

Stroke is a major neurological disease contributing to death and disability worldwide, and is still an ongoing issue during the pandemic. Here we investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on stroke manifestations, treatment courses, the outcome of stroke patients, and the hospitalization rate in a referral center for stroke management in Tehran, Iran. METHODS: We extracted data regarding 31 stroke patients (10 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019) and compared the demographic and pathological characteristics of the patients with or without coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The association of demographic/pathological characteristics of stroke patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a corresponding period during the previous year (49 patients) and an earlier period during the same year as the pandemic (50 patients) was also evaluated. RESULTS: The absolute number of admissions decreased about 40% during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Except for the stroke severity (P = 0.002), there were no significant changes in the demographic and pathological characteristics of the stroke patients during the three studied periods. A significantly higher mean of age (75.60  9.54 versus 60.86  18.45; P = 0.007), a significant difference in the type of stroke (P = 0.046), and significantly higher stroke severity (P = 0.024) were observed in stroke patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with those of stroke patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment approaches, duration of hospitalization, and mortality rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: This report shows that the pandemic caused the number of acute stroke admissions to plummet compared to other periods. Although the pandemic did not affect the treatment plans and care of the patients, stroke cases with coronavirus disease 2019 had higher age, more large vessel ischemic stroke, and more severe stroke.

However, the function of P2 receptors in viral infection has been little explored. Here we demonstrated that P2Y(13) and its ligand ADP play an important role in protecting hosts from viral infections. First, we demonstrate that P2Y(13), as a typical interferon-stimulated gene, is induced together with extracellular ADP during viral infection. Most importantly, extracellular ADP restricts the replication of different kinds of viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and murine leukemia virus. This kind of protection is dependent on P2Y(13) but not P2Y(1) or P2Y(12), which are also considered as receptors for ADP. Furthermore, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and EPAC1 are downregulated by extracellular ADP through the P2Y(13)-coupled Gi alpha subunit. Accordingly, inhibition or deletion of EPAC1 significantly eliminates ADP/P2Y(13)-mediated antiviral activities. Taken together, our results show that P2Y(13) and ADP play pivotal roles in the clearance of invaded virus and have the potential as antiviral targets.","output":"IFN-stimulated P2Y(13) protects mice from viral infection by suppressing the cAMP/EPAC1 signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) is a novel virus of the family Coronaviridae.

The aim of this study was to evaluate patient's previous online assessment experiences and to compare the acceptability, usability, usefulness and potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-based symptom checker (Ada) and an online questionnaire-based self-referral tool (Rheport). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients newly presenting to three German secondary rheumatology outpatient clinics were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to complete consecutively Ada or Rheport in a prospective non-blinded multicentre controlled crossover randomized trial. DDSS completion time was recorded by local study personnel and perceptions on DDSS and previous online assessment were collected through a self-completed study questionnaire, including usability measured with the validated System Usability Scale (SUS). RESULTS: 600 patients (median age 52 years, 418 women) were included. 277/600 (46.2%) of patients used an online search engine prior to the appointment. The median time patients spent assessing symptoms was 180, 7, and 8 min, respectively using online using search engines, Ada and Rheport. 111/275 (40.4%), 266/600 (44.3%) and 395/600 (65.8%) of patients rated the respective symptom assessment as very helpful or helpful, using online search engines, Ada and Rheport, respectively. Usability of both diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) was good with a significantly higher mean SUS score (SD) of Rheport 77.1/100 (16.0) compared to Ada 74.4/100 (16.8), (p < 0.0001). In male patients, usability of Rheport was rated higher than Ada (p = 0.02) and the usability rating of older (52 years ) patients of both DDSS was lower than in younger participants (p = 0.005). Both effects were independent of each other. 440/600 (73.3%) and 475/600 (79.2%) of the patients would recommend Ada and Rheport to friends and other patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: In summary, patients increasingly assess their symptoms independently online, however only a minority used dedicated symptom assessment websites or DDSS. DDSS, such as Ada an Rheport are easy to use, well accepted among patients with musculoskeletal complaints and could replace online search engines for patient symptom assessment, potentially saving time and increasing helpfulness.","output":"Patient's Perception of Digital Symptom Assessment Technologies in Rheumatology: Results From a Multicentre Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spreading phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and society.

METHODS: A cohort of 90 cladribine-treated patients with follow-up data reported by treating physicians and recorded in the Australian MSBase registry (database lock February 2016) were examined. Clinical data included Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, relapses and other disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) administered before and after cladribine treatment. RESULTS: Mean age on starting cladribine was 47 years; mean age at MS onset was 34 years, and median baseline EDSS score was 5.25. Disability trajectories in patients with sufficient follow-up suggested an overall increasing trend prior to cladribine treatment which was reduced during the 2-year post-treatment. Approximately 80% of patients were EDSS progression-free, 65% remained relapse-free after 2 years and median time to next DMD was 1.7 years.

Generalized overlap amplitudes, including Dyson orbitals and their probability factors, may be inferred from these eigenvalues, which provide numerical criteria for: classifying transitions according to the number of holes and particles in final states with respect to initial states, identifying the most important effects of orbital relaxation produced by self-consistent fields, and the analysis of Fukui functions. Two similar theorems that apply to sums of idempotent matrices regenerate formulae for the natural orbitals and occupation numbers of an unrestricted Slater determinant that were published first by Amos and Hall.","output":"Eigenvalues of uncorrelated, density-difference matrices and the interpretation of -self-consistent-field calculations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background:Public Health Informatics (PHI) has taken on new importance in recent years as health and well-being face a number of challenges, including environmental disasters, emerging infectious diseases, such as Zika, Ebola and SARS-CoV-2, the growing impact of the Influenza virus, the opioid epidemic, and social determinants of health. Understanding the relationship between climate change and the health of populations adds further complexity to global health issues. Objectives: To describe four examples of curricula that exist in U.S. based graduate-level public and population health informatics training programs. Methods: Biomedical informatics educators are challenged to provide learners with relevant, interesting, and meaningful educational experiences in working with and learning from the many data sources that comprise the domain of PHI. Programs at four institutions were reviewed to examine common teaching practices that stimulate learners to explore the field of public health informatics. Results: Four case studies represent a range of pedagogical approaches to meeting the requirements of three established accreditation/certification agencies relevant to PHI education. Despite their differences, each program achieved the established learning objectives along with a substantive record of student learning achievements. Conclusion: The overarching goal of empowering learners to serve an active and dynamic role in enhancing preventive measures, informing policy, improving personal health behaviors, and clarifying issues such as quality, cost of care, and the social determinants of health, are essential components of PHI education and training, and must receive additional consideration now and in the future by educators, policy makers, administrators, and government officials.","output":"Current Approaches and Trends in Graduate Public Health Informatics Education in the United States: Four Case Studies from the Field"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a robust B cell response, resulting in the generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. Here, we aimed to determine the effect of COVID-19 severity on the memory B cell response and characterize changes in the memory B cell compartment between recovery and five months post-symptom onset. Using high-parameter spectral flow cytometry, we analyzed the phenotype of memory B cells with reactivity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) in recovered individuals who had been hospitalized with non-severe (n=8) or severe (n=5) COVID-19. One month after symptom onset, a substantial proportion of spike-specific IgG+ B cells showed an activated phenotype. In individuals who experienced non-severe disease, spike-specific IgG+ B cells showed increased expression of markers associated with durable B cell memory, including T-bet, FcRL5, and CD11c, which was not observed after severe disease. Five months post-symptom onset, the majority of spike-specific memory B cells had a resting phenotype and the percentage of spike-specific T-bet+ IgG+ memory B cells decreased to baseline levels. Collectively, our results suggest that the memory B cell response elicited during non-severe COVID-19 may be of higher quality than the response after severe disease.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory B cells express markers of durable immunity after non-severe COVID-19 but not after severe disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To implement a new screening method in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, increase testing capability, alleviate the burden on the PCR facility, and learn more about the infected population's herd immunity.

The aim of this study was to summarize and share our experience of infection control measures and corresponding outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Infection control measures, including workflow optimization, useful epidemiologic survey methods, and personal full protective clothing, were discussed. Characteristics and outcomes of emergency cases and elective cases under local and general anesthesia during the COVID-19 pandemic were summarized. Results: A hierarchy of interventions were applied mainly from 4 aspects. First, administration control and online consultation significantly decreased patient attendance. Second, a triage workflow was established to identify high-/low-risk patients, with clinical manifestations (fever, fatigue, cough, nasal discharge, etc), epidemiologic survey, blood test, chest computed tomographic scan, and coronavirus test if necessary. Third, strict environmental control was adopted using increasing ventilation, isolated room for inpatients, etc. Fourth, proper rotation of healthcare staff was ensured to reduce workload and minimize possible contact. A total of 904 emergency interventions, 2561 local anesthesia, and 570 general anesthesia were performed during this period, and none of the cases/healthcare professionals were found to be infected.

The aims of this study were to (1) describe the prepartum and calf-rearing systems, as well as the management practices that may influence calf welfare in pastured dairy herds in Uruguay, (2) estimate the annual calf mortality risk from birth to weaning, and (3) identify the primary clinical disease syndromes shown by the calves before death. A survey comprising a farm visit and a questionnaire was conducted on 225 randomly selected dairies with >30 milking cows, in 3 strata (31-99, 100-299, and &#8805;300 milking cows) of 6 Uruguayan departments where dairies are concentrated. Retrospective information from July 2013 to June 2014 was collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and results were inferred into the national dairy cattle population. Several management practices that could contribute to poor calf welfare were identified in a large proportion of farms. The annual calf mortality risk (calves that died between birth and weaning/calves born death or alive  100, n = 149 farms) was 15.2%. Age at weaning averaged 75 d. Farmers reported that the most common clinical syndromes were diarrhea and respiratory disease in 85.2% and 47.5% of the farms, respectively. There was no continuous veterinary advice in 61.3% of the farms, 20.0% lacked data records, 38.5% had poor drainage in the prepartum area with waterlogging after rainfall, 52.1% monitored the prepartum area &#8804;2 times per day during the calving season, 65.1% did not perform navel antisepsis on newborns, 62.3% separated the calves from their dams at >24 h postpartum, 95.2% did not have a colostrum management program, 72.4% did not rotate the calf-rearing areas, 59.0% did not disinfect the calf feeders, 85.7% did not have staff dedicated exclusively to calf rearing, and 39.8% did not separate sick from healthy calves. The average volume of milk or milk replacer offered per calf was 4.5 L/day. Several of the identified management practices that affect calf welfare in the prepartum and calf-rearing periods could explain the high mortality risk.

As of April 20, there have been more than 2.4 million confirmed cases with over 160,000 deaths. Extreme case surges coupled with challenges in forecasting the clinical course of affected patients have necessitated thoughtful resource allocation and early identification of high-risk patients. However, effective methods for achieving this are lacking. In this paper, we present a decision tree-based machine learning model trained on electronic health records from patients with confirmed COVID-19 at a single center within the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. We then externally validate our model by predicting the likelihood of critical event or death within various time intervals for patients after hospitalization at four other hospitals and achieve strong performance, notably predicting mortality at 1 week with an AUC-ROC of 0.84. Finally, we establish model interpretability by calculating SHAP scores to identify decisive features, including age, inflammatory markers (procalcitonin and LDH), and coagulation parameters (PT, PTT, D-Dimer). To our knowledge, this is one of the first models with external validation to both predict outcomes in COVID-19 patients with strong validation performance and identification of key contributors in outcome prediction that may assist clinicians in making effective patient management decisions.","output":"Machine Learning to Predict Mortality and Critical Events in COVID-19 Positive New York City Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the indisputable negative psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, positive consequences are also possible. Resilience and coping strategies have been assumed to contribute to these outcomes. However, findings are still scarce and inconclusive. The study aimed to examine the role of resilience and coping strategies in the secondary stress for the Greek healthcare workers (HCWs) and in the posttraumatic growth following the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. A sample of 673 HCWs coming from Greece were recruited. A convenience and snowball mixed sampling procedure were used. A questionnaire was distributed through social networking sites, webpages, and personal contacts of the author. Participants were asked to distribute it to their own contacts. Recruitment occurred during April 5-30, 2000, amid the lockdown (March 23-May 03), when people were asked to follow the stringent lockdown constraint enforced by the Greek government. Sociodemographic data were collected. The Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale measured secondary traumatic stress (STS) for the HCWs. The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, the Brief Resilience Scale, and the Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory measured posttraumatic growth, resilience, and coping strategies, respectively. Regression analyses demonstrated that resilience and coping strategies were differentially associated with positive and negative (stress/growth) lockdown outcomes. Resilience and mostly maladaptive coping strategies predicted STS. A mixture of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies predicted PTG. The so-called \\"second wave\\" of the outbreak that started in August 2020 indicates that the study of the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown and of the internal resources (resilience and coping) to deal with, is necessary. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the coping strategies used by population subgroups (e.g., HCWs) in dealing with the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece. Enhancing internal resources through supportive services will ameliorate HCWs ability to withstand, recover, and thrive with benefits in their psychological health and well-being.

Unfortunately, this condition can occur even during pregnancy, threatening both maternal and fetal lives. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-old nulliparous woman at 26 weeks of gestation presented with continuous fever, coughing, and sore throat. Upon arrival at our hospital, her temperature was >38C and laboratory findings indicated cytopenia (neutrophil count, 779/L; hemoglobin level, 10.2 g/dL; platelet count, 29,000/L), elevated ferritin level (1,308 ng/mL), and elevated soluble interleukin-2 receptor level (11,200 U/mL). Computed tomography showed marked splenomegaly. Bone marrow examination revealed hemophagocytosis, and blood examination showed a plasma EpsteinCBarr virus (EBV) DNA level of 8.9  10(5) copies/g. The monoclonal proliferation of EBV-infected T cells was confirmed by Southern blotting, and the patient was diagnosed with chronic active EBV-associated sHLH and T-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Immediately after admission, the patients condition suddenly deteriorated. She developed shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation, requiring endotracheal intubation along with methylprednisolone pulse and etoposide therapy. Although the patient recovered, she delivered a stillborn baby. After delivery, she was treated with reduced-dose dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (DeVIC) and steroid (dexamethasone), methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide (SMILE) chemotherapies. Five months after diagnosis, she received human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from her sister. She remains in remission for 5 months from the time of transplantation to the present.

In this turbulent era, there is a need for resilience at every levelfrom the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of government. We argue that achieving resilience will require both enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to these challenges. Such practical first steps can serve as models for creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in India. One way to stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials, thus seeking to eliminate waste. Previous research has shown that such initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community resilience, while stimulating the regional economy. An international conference on Waste Management Innovation, held in 2017 in Mumbai with funding from the US Consulate General, resulted in the award of seed grants to two Indian non-profits that sought to apply circular economy principles to regional communitiesone urban and one rural. These initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation. The World Institute of Sustainable Energy has developed an action plan to capture at least 60 percent of the electronic waste generated in the city of Pune, one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. Their approach is based on circular economy principles, and has been embraced in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents and non-governmental organizations. Barefoot College has established and demonstrated a low-cost, end-to-end solid waste management model for rural villages that is designed by the local community. Their unique approach ensures sanitation, environmental protection, income and livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. This paper presents the results of these two efforts, and suggests what lessons were learned. One overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is necessary to understand the interplay of economic, environmental, and social forces.

This paper considers a mixture of the MarshallCOlkin extended Weibull distribution for efficient modeling of failure, survival, and COVID-19 data under classical and Bayesian perspectives based on type-II censored data. We derive several properties of the new distribution such as moments, incomplete moments, mean deviation, average lifetime, mean residual lifetime, Rnyi entropy, Shannon entropy, and order statistics of the proposed distribution. Maximum likelihood and Bayes procedure are used to derive both point and interval estimates of the parameters involved in the model. Bayes estimators of the unknown parameters of the model are obtained under symmetric (squared error) and asymmetric (linear exponential (LINEX)) loss functions using gamma priors for both the shape and the scale parameters. Furthermore, approximate confidence intervals and Bayes credible intervals (CIs) are also obtained. Monte Carlo simulation study is carried out to assess the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators and Bayes estimators with respect to their estimated risk. The flexibility and importance of the proposed distribution are illustrated by means of four real datasets.

VA involves an interview of the family or caregivers of the deceased after a suitable bereavement interval about the circumstances, signs and symptoms of the deceased in the period leading to death. The VA interview data are then interpreted by physicians or, more recently, computer algorithms, to assign a probable cause of death. VA was originally developed and applied in field research settings. This paper traces the evolution of VA methods with special emphasis on the World Health Organizations (WHO)s efforts to standardize VA instruments and methods for expanded use in routine health information and vital statistics systems in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These advances in VA methods are culminating this year with the release of the 2022 WHO Standard Verbal Autopsy (VA) Toolkit. This paper highlights the many contributions the late Professor Peter Byass made to the current VA standards and methods, most notably, the development of InterVA, the most commonly used automated computer algorithm for interpreting data collected in the WHO standard instruments, and the capacity building in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that he promoted. This paper also provides an overview of the methods used to improve the current WHO VA standards, a catalogue of the changes and improvements in the instruments, and a mapping of current applications of the WHO VA standard approach in LMICs.

The results show that, in the absence of compulsory confinement measures, urban public spaces were deployed both by government agencies and the media in a process by which social isolation was framed as a public problem. Legal measures affected daily patterns of movement, mobility, and sociability, and intervened in the dynamics of central urban functions and in access to and use of public spaces. Media reports gave voice to levels of public agreement or disagreement with regulations and emphasised the significance of legal measures to contain the spread of the virus. Public spaces are at the core of debates about compliance with legal measures to enforce social isolation because they are privileged places where social issues become visible and problematic material expressions of relationships between citizens and the law.","output":"Scenarios of social isolation during the first wave of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The present study aims to characterize knowledge, attitudes and beliefs in a sample of medical professionals towards point-of-care (POC) rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Italy (April 2020). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 561 professionals (42.6% males, 26.9% &#8805; 50-year-old) compiled a specifically designed web questionnaire on characteristics of POC rapid tests. They were asked whether they would change daily practice and make clinical decisions according to POC tests. Multivariate odds ratios (aOR) for predictors of propensity towards the aforementioned behavioral outcomes were calculated through regression analysis. RESULTS: Overall, only 51.9% knew the official recommendations of the Italian Health Authorities for POC tests, while 26.0% of respondents considered POC tests for COVID-19 highly reliable. Still, 40.3% of respondents would change daily practice because of such tests, and 38.5% would make clinical decisions based of their results. Actual understanding of specificity and sensitivity of POC tests was not associated with assessed behavioral outcomes: main positive effectors were identified in perceived reliability and usefulness of rapid tests, acknowledging the existence of official recommendations, understanding the limited clinical implications of POC tests, and working as occupational physicians were characterized as negative effectors. Conclusions. Propensity of sampled professionals towards POC tests for COVID-19 was diffusely unsatisfying. While actual understanding of accuracy of such tests was not a main effector of propensity, previous experiences with other POC tests in daily practice, particularly among occupational physicians may have impaired overall acceptance of such instruments.","output":"Point-of-Care diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2: knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) of medical workforce in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Heterogeneous respiratory system static compliance (C(RS)) values and levels of hypoxemia in patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) requiring mechanical ventilation have been reported in previous small-case series or studies conducted at a national level. METHODS: We designed a retrospective observational cohort study with rapid data gathering from the international COVID-19 Critical Care Consortium study to comprehensively describe C(RS)calculated as: tidal volume/[airway plateau pressure-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)]and its association with ventilatory management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation (MV), admitted to intensive care units (ICU) worldwide. RESULTS: We studied 745 patients from 22 countries, who required admission to the ICU and MV from January 14 to December 31, 2020, and presented at least one value of C(RS) within the first seven days of MV. Median (IQR) age was 62 (52C71), patients were predominantly males (68%) and from Europe/North and South America (88%). C(RS), within 48 h from endotracheal intubation, was available in 649 patients and was neither associated with the duration from onset of symptoms to commencement of MV (p = 0.417) nor with PaO(2)/FiO(2) (p = 0.100). Females presented lower C(RS) than males (95% CI of C(RS) difference between females-males: ? 11.8 to ? 7.4 mL/cmH(2)O p < 0.001), and although females presented higher body mass index (BMI), association of BMI with C(RS) was marginal (p = 0.139). Ventilatory management varied across C(RS) range, resulting in a significant association between C(RS) and driving pressure (estimated decrease ? 0.31 cmH(2)O/L per mL/cmH(2)0 of C(RS), 95% CI ? 0.48 to ? 0.14, p < 0.001). Overall, 28-day ICU mortality, accounting for the competing risk of being discharged within the period, was 35.6% (SE 1.7). Cox proportional hazard analysis demonstrated that C(RS) (+ 10 mL/cm H(2)O) was only associated with being discharge from the ICU within 28 days (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02C1.28, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre report provides a comprehensive account of C(RS) in COVID-19 patients on MV.

The aim of this study was to characterize COVID-19-associated morbidity and in-hospital mortality by race/ethnicity. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of nine Massachusetts hospitals including all consecutive adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Measured outcomes were assessed and compared by patient-reported race/ethnicity, classified as White, Black, Latinx, Asian, or other. Students t-test, Fischer exact test, and multivariable regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 379 patients (62.916.5 years; 55.7% men) with confirmed COVID-19 were included (49.9% White, 13.7% Black, 29.8% Latinx, 3.7% Asian), of which 376 (99.2%) were insured (34.3% private, 41.2% public, 23.8% public with supplement). Latinx patients were younger, had fewer cardiopulmonary disorders, were more likely to have obesity, more frequently reported fever and myalgia, and had lower D-dimer levels compared to White patients (p&0.05). On multivariable analysis controlling for age, gender, obesity, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, hypertension, and diabetes, no significant differences in in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation by race/ethnicity were found. Diabetes was a significant predictor for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11-3.23) while older age was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 4.18; 95% CI 1.94-9.04). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest health system in Massachusetts, there was no association between race/ethnicity and clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, after controlling for key demographic/clinical characteristics. These findings serve to refute suggestions that certain races/ethnicities may be biologically predisposed to poorer COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"How Do Presenting Symptoms and Outcomes Differ by Race/Ethnicity Among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 Infection?

Molecular diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID) 19 for densely and highly populated countries like India is time\\\\consuming. A few reports have described the successful diagnosis of nSARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus from sewage and wastewater samples contaminated with fecal matter, suggesting the diagnosis of COVID 19 from the same to raise an alarm about the community transmission of virus for implementation of evacuation and lockdown strategies. So far, the association between the detection of virus and its concentration in stool samples with severity of the disease and the presence or absence of gastrointestinal symptoms have been rarely reported. We led the search utilizing multiple databases, specifically PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and Google Scholar. We conducted a literature survey on gastrointestinal infection and the spread of this virus through fecalCoral transmission. Reports suggested that the existence and persistence of nSARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 in anal/rectal swabs and stool specimens for a longer period of time than in nasopharyngeal swabs provides a strong tenable outcome of gastrointestinal contamination and dissemination of this infection via potential fecalCoral transmission. This review may be helpful to conduct further studies to address the enteric involvement and excretion of nSARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 RNA in feces and control the community spread in both COVID\\\\19 patients ahead of the onset of symptoms and in asymptomatic individuals through wastewater and sewage surveillance as an early indication of infection. The existence of the viral genome and active viral particle actively participate in genomic variations.

Half of the cases were associated with a tertiary care university hospital. OBJECTIVE To document the outbreak and successful control measures. DESIGN Descriptive study. SETTING A 1950-bed tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS 92 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS and 9793 exposed persons. MEASUREMENTS Description of the outbreak, including a timeline, and evaluation of the effectiveness of the control measures. RESULTS During the outbreak, 92 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases were associated with a large tertiary care hospital, 82 of which originated from unprotected exposure to 1 secondary patient. Contact tracing and monitoring exposed patients and assigned health care workers were at the core of the control measures in the outbreak. Nontargeted screening measures, including body temperature screening among employees and visitors at hospital gates, monitoring patients for MERS-related symptoms, chest radiographic screening, and employee symptom monitoring, did not detect additional patients with MERS without existing transmission links. All in-hospital transmissions originated from 3 patients with MERS who also had pneumonia and productive cough. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective single-center study. Statistical analysis could not be done. Because this MERS outbreak originated from a superspreader, effective control measures could differ in endemic areas or in other settings. CONCLUSION Control strategies for MERS outbreaks should focus on tracing contacts of persons with epidemiologic links. Adjusting levels of quarantine and personal protective equipment according to the assumed infectivity of each patient with MERS may be appropriate.

The Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program (CUSP) promotes patient safety through increased teamwork, empowerment of frontline staff, and utilization of science of safety principles. CUSP has demonstrated success in outpatient and inpatient settings to decrease complication rates and establish a culture of safety but has been used minimally in the perioperative setting. In this study, the CUSP methodology was utilized to improve perioperative efficiency in pediatric spine surgery, and preimplementation and postimplementation efficiency were compared, using the rate of first case on-time starts (FCOTS) as the primary metric. METHODS A CUSP quality improvement workgroup including nurses, technicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and administrators sought feedback on opportunities for improvement and tracked key performance metrics in the OR from 2015 to 2020. Key interventions developed in response to feedback included standardizing and streamlining room setup and adjusting staffing models for greater efficiency. Univariate analysis was conducted to compare time periods pre-CUSP and post-CUSP implementation. RESULTS First case on-time starts increased from 38% to a high of 81% after implementation. For more complex cases, the average patient in the room to anesthesia ready time improved by 31% with decreased variance over time, and average closure to patient out of room time improved by 45%. Improvements were sustained through Year 3, while CUSP remained a primary focus for the team. CONCLUSIONS CUSP is effective in enhancing perioperative efficiency, demonstrating strong improvement in on-time starts over 5 years. The results indicate that process improvement in ORs requires consistent attention to sustain gains over time. Engaging frontline staff in quality improvement fosters collaboration and provides employee buy-in to promoting a culture of safety and improving value in patient care.

We aimed to investigate these changes by recruiting centers from different countries. METHODS: Eight countries participated in this cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study by providing data from their stroke data base. We compared 1 year before to 1 year during COVID-19 as regards onset to door (OTD), door to needle (DTN), door to groin (DTG), duration of hospital stay, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline, 24 h, and at discharge as well as modified Rankin score (mRS) on discharge and at 3 months follow-up. RESULTS: During the pandemic year, there was a reduction in the number of patients, median age was significantly lower, admission NIHSS was higher, hemorrhagic stroke increased, and OTD and DTG showed no difference, while DTN time was longer, rtPA administration was decreased, thrombectomy was more frequent, and hospital stay was shorter. mRS was less favorable on discharge and at 3 months.

We reported a case of adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) with Eisenmenger Syndrome (ES) who survived COVID-19 without progression to severe infection. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 39 years old male with history of uncorrected ACHD complained of low-grade fever and cough for 3 days. Initial oxygen saturation was 85%, no tachypnoea, no tachycardia, and blood pressure was normal. SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR results was positive. Thorax CT showed lung fibrosis, minimal GGO, and prominent pulmonary notch. Notable laboratory result was haemoglobin: 20.4g/dL. Echocardiography showed a large secundum ASD with bidirectional shunt, dilated RA and RV, normal ventricular systolic functions, mild TR with increased tricuspid gradient (TR V max 4.27m/s) which concluded the diagnosis of ES. The patient was treated according to moderate COVID-19 guidelines and ES management. His response to treatment was favourable and was discharged in 3 weeks uneventfully. DISCUSSION: Studies have documented CHD and PAH as comorbid to severe COVID-19 infection, but our patient had moderate COVID-19 infection and recovered without progression to severe disease. We proposed several pathophysiological characteristics of ES which could serve as protective factors against severe COVID-19, which are: 1) Pre-existing PAH, where pulmonary vasculopathy and remodelling lessened endothelial response to inflammation, and reduced expression of ACE2 receptors, 2) Chronic hypoxia, which prepared cells and tissues against hypoxic environment, and 3) Polycythaemia, might be beneficial in haemoglobinopathy directly caused by SARS-CoV2.","output":"C42.

The model features path dependence in the employment-population rate and the output-capital ratio. Population growth and distribution can respond to the employment rate. Interpreted through the model, secular stagnation under neoliberal capitalism has been driven by a combination of diminished investment and reduced worker bargaining power more than by slower technical change and population growth.

The mean prediction accuracy of the best performing model in each study was 0.89  0.09. The most common algorithm for conventional machine learning studies was Support Vector Machine (mean accuracy: 0.90  0.07) and for deep learning studies was Convolutional Neural Network (mean accuracy: 0.91  0.10). Only one study used both a large training dataset (n>200) and external validation (accuracy: 0.72) for their model. The mean adherence rate to TRIPOD was 44.5%  11.1%, with poor reporting adherence for model performance (0%), abstracts (0%), and titles (0%). Conclusions: The application of ML to glioma grade prediction has grown substantially, with ML model studies reporting high predictive accuracies but lacking essential metrics and characteristics for assessing model performance. Several domains, including generalizability and reproducibility, warrant further attention to enable translation into clinical practice.

Lung ultrasound has been proposed to diagnose and it. However, little is known about ultrasound findings in these patients. Our aim is to present an overview of lung ultrasound characteristics in critically ill patients with SARS CoV2 pneumonia overall and in relation to the duration of symptoms and clinical parameters. Methods: On the Intensive Care Unit of two academic hospitals, adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV2 were included. Images were analyzed for pleural line characteristics, number and appearance of B-lines, BLUE-profiles (Bedside Lung Ultrasound in Emergency), pathology in the PLAPS (Postero Lateral Alveolar and Pleural Syndrome) point and a LUS-score (lung ultrasound). The primary outcomes were frequencies, percentages and differences in lung ultrasound findings overall and between short ([a?]14 days) and long (>14 days) duration of symptoms and their correlation with clinical parameters. Results: In this pilot observational study, 61 patients were included with 75 examinations for analysis. The most prevalent ultrasound findings were decreased lung sliding (36%), thickening of the pleural line (42%) and a C-profile per view (37%). Patients with ''long'' duration of symptoms presented more frequently with a thickened and irregular pleural line (21% (32) vs 9% (11), p=.01), C-profile per patient (47% (18) vs. 25% (8),p=.01) and pleural effusion (19% (14) vs 5% (3),p=.02) compared to patients with short duration of symptoms. Lung ultrasound findings did not correlate with P/F ratio, fluid balance or dynamic compliance, with the exception of the LUS-score and dynamic compliance (R2=0.27, p=.02). Conclusion: SARS CoV2 results in significant ultrasound changes, with decreased lung sliding, thickening of the pleural line and a C-profile being the most observed.

An improved protective box with active ventilation was designed based on a plastic bag with armholes covered with latex sheets that utilizes a supportive frame. Coughing during the intubation and extubation procedure was simulated using an aerosol generator which dispersed the aerosol powder into the protective box. During the intubation and extubation procedure, the concentration of particles increased inside the protective box but, due to the high negative airflow, quickly dropped to background levels. The particle concentration of all measured particle sizes decreased within the same time frame. No leakage of particles was observed through the armhole openings. The presented protective box design provides excellent protection against generated droplets and aerosols. The decrease in concentration does not depend on the particle size.

PATIENTS: We obtained data from the electronic medical record of all adult severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive patients managed in the ICU of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, between March 13, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Included patients were divided into two groups: people of color (including Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Arab) and White. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 365 patients were evaluated: 219 were Black (60.0%), 129 were White (35.3%), two were Asian (0.6%), eight were Hispanic/Latino (2.2%), and seven were Arab (1.9%). People of color were younger (62.8 vs 67.1; p = 0.007), with equal distribution of sex. People of color had less coronary artery disease (34 [14.4%] vs 35 [27.1%]; p =0.003) and less self-reported use of regular alcohol consumption (50 [21.2%] vs 12 [9.3%]; p = 0.004) than Whites, with no differences in diabetes (125 [53.0%] vs 66 [51.2%]; p = 0.742), hypertension (188 [79.7%] vs 99 [76.8%]; p = 0.516), congestive heart failure (41 [17.4%] vs 32 [24.8%]; p = 0.090), or chronic kidney disease (123 [54.1%] vs 55 [42.6%]; p = 0.083).There was no difference in ICU length of stay between people of color (18 d [CI, 7-47 d]) and Whites (18 d [CI, 6-48 d]; p = 0. 0.979). Neither frequency (72.5% vs 71.3%; p = ns) nor median time to mechanical ventilation between people of color (9 d [CI, 6-15 d]) and Whites (10 d [CI, 5-16 d]; p = 0.733) was different. Overall, 188 patients (51.5 %) died in the hospital. The 28-day mortality was lower in people of color (107/236; 45.3%) versus Whites (73/129; 56.6%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.60; p = 0.034), and there was an increased median survival time in people of color (20 d) versus Whites (13.5 d; hazard ratio 0.62; p = 0.002). The inhospital mortality was lower in people of color versus White, but the difference was not statistically significant (113 [47.9%] vs 75 [58.1%], respectively; p = 0.061). Finally, there was no significant difference in days of symptoms prior to admission, frequency of presenting symptoms, or frequency or severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1) first emerged in Guangdong, China in 2002 and spread to 29 countries, infecting 8089 individuals and causing 774 deaths. In 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia and has spread to 27 countries, with a mortality rate of ~34%. In 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged and has spread to 220 countries, infecting over 100,000,000 people and causing more than 2,000,000 deaths to date. These three human coronaviruses cause diseases of varying severity. Most people develop mild, common cold-like symptoms, while some develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The success of all viruses, including coronaviruses, relies on their evolved abilities to evade and modulate the host anti-viral and pro-inflammatory immune responses. However, we still do not fully understand the transmission, phylogeny, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and -2.

Methods This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in Dicle University Ophthalmology department outpatient clinic. Data were collected for COVID-19 fear and safety measurements and all the patients were applied Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). Results A total of 223 voluntary participants were recruited. Of the participants, 101 were female and 122 were male.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective study among employees of our institution during the ARI season 2010/2011 (December-March). Weekly emails were sent to the participants (n = 84), reminding them to come to the study center in case of new symptoms. The participants self-collected an anterior nasal swab from one nostril, and trained study personnel collected one from the other nostril. The participants self-collected another two swabs (one from each nostril) on a subsequent day. Human -actin DNA concentration was determined in the swabs as a quality control. Viral respiratory pathogens were detected by multiplex RT-PCR (Seeplex RV15 kit, Seegene, Eschborn, Germany). Of 84 participants, 56 (67%) reported at least one ARI episode, 18 participants two, and one participant three. Self-swabbing was highly accepted by the participants. The amount of -actin DNA per swab was higher in the self- than in the staff-collected swabs (p = 0.008). -actin concentration was lower in the self-swabs collected on day 1 than in those collected on a subsequent day (p<0.0001). A respiratory viral pathogen was detected in 31% (23/75) of staff- and in 35% (26/75) of self-collected swabs (p = 0.36). With both approaches, the most frequently identified pathogens were human rhinoviruses A/B/C (12/75 swabs, 16%) and human coronavirus OC43 (4/75 swabs, 5%). There was almost perfect agreement between self- and staff-collected swabs in terms of pathogen detection (agreement = 93%, kappa = 0.85, p<0.0001).

Several vaccine candidates already provided promising effectiveness data, but it is crucial for an effective vaccination campaign that people are willing and able to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Taking Germany as an example, we provide insights of using a mathematical approach for the planning and location of vaccination sites to optimally administer vaccines against Covid-19. METHODS: We used mathematical programming for computing an optimal selection of vaccination sites out of a given set (i.e., university hospitals, health department related locations and general practices). Different patient-to-facility assignments and doctor-to-facility assignments and different constraints on the number of vaccinees per site or maximum travel time are used. RESULTS: In order to minimize the barriers for people to get vaccinated, i.e., limit the one-way travel journey (airline distance) by around 35 km for 75% of the population (with a maximum of 70 km), around 80 well-positioned facilities can be enough. If only the 38 university hospitals are being used, the 75% distance increases to around 50 km (with a maximum of 145 km). Using all 400 health departments or all 56 000 general practices can decrease the journey length significantly, but comes at the price of more required staff and possibly wastage of only partially used vaccine containers. CONCLUSIONS: In the case of free assignments, the number of required physicians can in most scenarios be limited to 2 000, which is also the minimum with our assumptions.

Infected animals excrete MAP via feces during the prolonged subclinical stage without exhibiting any clinical signs. Therefore, accurate detection of subclinical stage animals is crucial for successful eradication of JD in the herd. In the current study, we analyzed serum samples of MAP-infected and non-infected cattle to identify potential biomarker candidates. First, we identified 12 differentially expressed serum proteins in subclinical and clinical shedder groups compared to the healthy control group. Second, we conducted ELISA for three selected biomarkers (alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M), alpha-1-beta glycoprotein, and transthyretin) and compared their diagnostic performance with that of two commercial ELISA diagnostic kits. Serum A2M levels were significantly higher in the MAP-exposed, subclinical shedder, subclinical non-shedder, and clinical shedder groups than in the healthy control group, suggesting its possible use as a diagnostic biomarker for MAP infection. Furthermore, A2M demonstrated a sensitivity of 90.4%, and a specificity of 100% while the two commercial ELISA kits demonstrated a sensitivity of 67.83 and 73.04% and a specificity of 100%, respectively.

To date, no data have ever been reported to reflect the prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among these outpatients. Moreover, it is almost unknown to discriminate COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients based on clinical features in the fever clinics. METHODS: The infectious status of SARS-CoV-2 was estimated among the outpatients. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics were compared between COVID-19 and nucleic acid negative patients. RESULTS: The nucleic acid positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 in the outpatients from our fever clinic was 671%, while the majority of patients with COVID-19 were mild cases. The predominant initial symptom in those patients with COVID-19 was fever (78.2%), followed by cough (15.6%). Very significantly lower number of eosinophils was characterized in patients with COVID-19 as compared with that of nucleic acid negative patients. More importantly, the proportion of subjects with eosinophil counts lower than normal levels in patients with COVID-19 was much higher than that of nucleic acid negative patients. Fever combined with bilateral ground-glass opacities in computed tomography imaging and eosinophil count below the normal level are probably a valuable indicator of COVID-19 infection in those outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Those findings may provide critical information for the regions, such as Europe and United States that are facing the same situation as Wuhan experienced, and could be valuable to prevent those nucleic acid negative patients from misdiagnosis before antibody testing.","output":"Analysis of 2019 novel coronavirus infection and clinical characteristics of outpatients: An epidemiological study from a fever clinic in Wuhan, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article is focused on a detailed micro-study describing changes in the behaviour of the authors in three months before and during the COVID-19 pandemic The study is based on data from Google Location Service Despite the fact it evaluates only three people and the study cannot be sufficiently representative, it is a unique example of possible data processing at such a level of accuracy The most significant changes in the behaviour of authors before and during the COVID-19 quarantine are described and interpreted in detail Another purpose of the article is to point out the possibilities of analytical processing of Google Location while being aware of personal data protection issues The authors recognize that by visualizing the real motion data, one partially discloses their privacy, but one considers it very valuable to show how detailed data Google collects about the population and how such data can be used effectively","output":"Changing Mobility Lifestyle: A Case Study on the Impact of COVID-19 Using Personal Google Locations Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is an endogenous lipid mediator of inflammation derived from arachidonic acid by the sequential action of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and 5-lipoxygenase.

Natural phytochemicals have reported anti-viral properties and favourable effects on inflammatory and oxidative pathways, both important for tissue damage post-viral pneumonia. This study involved 147 participants with symptomatic COVID-19, randomised to receive a placebo (P) or a phytochemical-rich concentrated food capsule (PC) in addition to a pre/probiotic lactobacillus capsule. Participants taking the PC had an almost two-fold reduction in mean fatigue scores compared to P [p = 0.02], a three-fold reduction in cough score and more than a double improvement in overall well-being scores [p = 0.02]. Two (1.5%) participants reported mild, increased bloating which they felt was attributable to the capsules, although GI symptoms improved in 25 of 31 participants (82%) who reported them at baseline. Sedentary, older, previously hospitalised men with GI symptoms had a statistically significantly improvement among those given the probiotic. Although some participants with early disease would have improved spontaneously, such a rapid improvement observed in the majority of participants, who had been suffering for an average of 108 days, was clinically relevant and welcomed, especially among those more likely to have pre-existing gut dysbiosis.

In patients aged 65 years and older, triage decisions are regularly based on degree of frailty measured by the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). However, the CFS could also be useful in patients younger than 65 years. We aimed to examine the association between CFS score and hospital mortality and between CFS score and admission to intensive care in adult patients of all ages with COVID-19 across Europe. METHODS: This analysis was part of the COVID Medication (COMET) study, an international, multicentre, retrospective observational cohort study in 63 hospitals in 11 countries in Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older, had been admitted to hospital, and either tested positive by PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or were judged to have a high clinical likelihood of having SARS-CoV-2 infection by the local COVID-19 expert team. CFS was used to assess level of frailty: fit (CFS(1C3)), mildly frail (CFS(4C5)), or frail (CFS(6C9)). The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was admission to intensive care. Data were analysed using a multivariable binary logistic regression model adjusted for covariates (age, sex, number of drugs prescribed, and type of drug class as a proxy for comorbidities). FINDINGS: Between March 30 and July 15, 2020, 2434 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 55C77]; 1480 [61%] men, 954 [30%] women) had CFS scores available and were included in the analyses. In the total sample and in patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients and mildly frail patients had a significantly higher risk of hospital mortality than fit patients (total sample: CFS(6C9)vs CFS(1C3) odds ratio [OR] 271 [95% CI 204C360], p<00001 and CFS(4C5)vs CFS(1C3) OR 154 [116C206], p=00030; age 65 years: CFS(6C9)vs CFS(1C3) OR 290 [212C397], p<00001 and CFS(4C5)vs CFS(1C3) OR 164 [120C225], p=00020). In patients younger than 65 years, an increased hospital mortality risk was only observed in frail patients (CFS(6C9)vs CFS(1C3) OR 222 [108C457], p=0030; CFS(4C5)vs CFS(1C3) OR 108 [048C239], p=086). Frail patients had a higher incidence of admission to intensive care than fit patients (CFS(6C9)vs CFS(1C3) OR 154 [121C197], p=00010), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS(4C5)vs CFS(1C3) OR 071 [055C092], p=00090). Among patients younger than 65 years, frail patients had an increased incidence of admission to intensive care (CFS(6C9)vs CFS(1C3) OR 296 [198C443], p<00001), whereas mildly frail patients had no significant difference in incidence compared with fit patients (CFS(4C5)vs CFS(1C3) OR 093 [063C138], p=072). Among patients aged 65 years and older, frail patients had no significant difference in the incidence of admission to intensive care compared with fit patients (CFS(6C9)vs CFS(1C3) OR 127 [092C175], p=014), whereas mildly frail patients had a lower incidence than fit patients (CFS(4C5)vs CFS(1C3) OR 066 [047C093], p=0018). INTERPRETATION: The results of this study suggest that CFS score is a suitable risk marker for hospital mortality in adult patients with COVID-19. However, treatment decisions based on the CFS in patients younger than 65 years should be made with caution.

Fat1 gene is the coding sequence from Caenorhabditis elegans which might play an important role on lipometabolism. To reveal the function of fat1 gene in bovine fetal fibroblast cells and gain the best cell nuclear donor for transgenic bovines, the codon of fat1 sequence was optimized based on the codon usage frequency preference of bovine muscle protein, and directionally cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF-GFP. After identifying by restrictive enzyme digests with AatII/XbaI and sequencing, the fusion plasmid pEF-GFP-fat1 was identified successfully. The pEF-GFP-fat1 vector was transfected into bovine fetal fibroblast cells mediated by Lipofectamine2000(TM). The positive bovine fetal fibroblast cells were selected by G418 and detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that a 1,234 bp transcription was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and the positive transgenic fat1 cell line was successfully established. Then the expression level of fat1 gene in positive cells was detected using quantitative PCR, and the catalysis efficiency was detected by gas chromatography. The results demonstrated that the catalysis efficiency of fat1 was significantly high, which can improve the total PUFAs rich in EPA, DHA and DPA. Construction and expression of pEF-GFP-fat1 vector should be helpful for further understanding the mechanism of regulation of fat1 in vitro.

It asks whether the person-level predictors of Covid-19 that are identified in reports by Public Health England and by the Office of National Statistics also hold at a neighbourhood scale, remaining evident in the differences between neighbours. In examining this, the paper focuses on localised differences in the number of deaths, putting forward an innovative method of analysis that looks at the differences between places that share a border. Specifically, a difference across spatial boundaries method is employed to consider whether a higher number of deaths in one neighbourhood, when compared to its neighbours, is related to other differences between those contiguous locations. It is also used to map localised hot spots and to look for spatial variation in the regression coefficients. The results are compared to those for a later period, April 18 C May 31. The findings show that despite some spatial diffusion of the disease, a greater number of deaths continues to be associated with Asian and Black ethnic groups, socio-economic disadvantage, very large households (likely indicative of residential overcrowding), and fewer from younger age groups. The analysis adds to the evidence showing that age, wealth/deprivation and ethnicity are key risk factors associated with higher mortality rates from Covid-19.","output":"Exploring the neighbourhood-level correlates of Covid-19 deaths in London using a difference across spatial boundaries method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a highly contagious and widespread disease that has strained the global healthcare system to the hilt.

Ultrasonography was performed to determine follicular size, ovulation occurrence, and size of CL. In Experiment 2, heifers were assigned to three groups: Control (n = 264), FA-5/GnRH, and FA-4/GnRH. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at Days 30 and 60. In Experiment 1, size of largest follicle at time of PGF was less variable (P  0.05) in all FA groups compared to the Control group. With the FA-5/GnRH and FA-4/GnRH treatments, there were greater (P  0.05) proportions of timing of ovulation synchronization (86 % and 85 %, respectively) compared to the Control (61 %) and FA-3/GnRH (62 %) groups. In Experiment 2, conception rates did not differ among groups, however, there were more pregnancies per cow when timing-of-ovulation treatments were imposed.

Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment for SAD, yet its accessibility is often constrained with long waiting times. Digital therapeutic applications, including psychoeducation and self-guided behavioral experiments in virtual reality (VR), could facilitate access and reduce waiting times. The study aims to investigate if ultra-short-time therapy involving self-guided digital therapeutic applications with VR components can reduce the severity of SAD. METHODS: Forty SAD patients will participate in this randomized controlled trial. Half will get access to a self-guided, digital therapeutic application with exposure-based behavioral experiments in VR, while the other half will receive a control treatment. Both treatments include four therapeutic appointments. Changes in the severity of SAD will be measured after each appointment and on a 6-week follow-up assessment and will be compared between groups, with the change in SAD measured at baseline- and post-assessment as primary outcome. DISCUSSION: Self-guided digital therapeutic applications including ultra-short-time therapy combined with VR could help reduce the waiting time for patients and relieve the health system.

This study aimed to assess the intrasubject variability of gut pH and transit time in healthy volunteers using SmartPill devices (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN). METHODS Each subject (n=10) ingested two SmartPill devices separated by 24 h. Mean pH values were calculated for 30 min after gastric emptying (AGE), before the ileocecal (BIC) valve, after the ileocecal (AIC) valve, and before body exit (BBE). Intrasubject variability was determined by comparing mean values from both ingestions for an individual subject using standard deviations, 95% limits of agreement, and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS Tandem device ingestion occurred without complication. The median (full range) intrasubject standard deviations for pH were 0.02 (0.0002-0.2048) for AGE, 0.06 (0.0002-0.3445) for BIC, 0.14 (0.0018-0.3042) for AIC, and 0.08 (0.0098-0.5202) for BBE. There was a significant change in pH for AIC (mean difference: -0.450.31, P=0.0015) observed across all subjects. The mean coefficients of variation for transit time were 12.07.4% and 25.815.8% for small and large bowels, respectively (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of tandem gut transit and pH assessments using the SmartPill device.

Being a newfound disease, not only many aspects of the disease are unknown, but also there is not an effective medication to cure the disease. Besides, designing a drug is a time-consuming process and needs large investment. Hence, drug repurposing techniques, employed to discover the hidden benefits of the existing drugs, maybe a useful option for treating COVID-19. Methods: The present study exploits the drug repositioning concepts and introduces some candidate drugs which may be effective in controlling COVID-19. The suggested method consists of three main steps. First, the required data such as the amino acid sequences of targets and drug-target interactions are extracted from the public databases. Second, the similarity score between the targets (protein/enzymes) and genome of SARS-COV-2 is computed using the proposed fuzzy logic-based method. Since the classical approaches yield outcomes which may not be useful for the real-world applications, the fuzzy technique can address the issue. Third, after ranking targets based on the obtained scores, the usefulness of drugs affecting them is examined for managing COVID-19. Results: The results indicate that antiviral medicines, designed for curing hepatitis C, may also cure COVID-19. According to the findings, ribavirin, simeprevir, danoprevir, and XTL-6865 may be helpful in controlling the disease. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the similarity-based drug repurposing techniques may be the most suitable option for managing emerging diseases such as COVID-19 and can be applied to a wide range of data.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 8-month prospective study of 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS in Taipei, Taiwan, was conducted from April through December 2003. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms in our 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS were fever, dyspnea, dizziness, malaise, diarrhea, dry cough, muscle pain, and chills. Lymphopenia and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were the most common initial laboratory findings. Initial chest radiographs revealed various pattern abnormalities and normal results. Five of the 14 patients required mechanical ventilation. The need for mechanical ventilation was associated with bilateral lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph and higher peak levels of LDH and CRP. Clinical severity of disease varied from mild to severe. At 8 months after disease onset, patients with mild or moderate SARS had normal findings or only focal fibrosis on chest high-resolution computed tomography. However, bilateral fibrotic changes remained in the 4 patients who had recovered from severe SARS, 1 of whom had mild restrictive ventilatory impairment. One patient with severe SARS died; she was elderly and had other comorbidities. Five additional patients had reduced diffusing capacity. CONCLUSION: The clinical picture of our patients presenting with hospital-acquired SARS revealed atypical pneumonia associated with lymphopenia, elevated serum levels of LDH, rapid clinical deterioration, and lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy. Substantially elevated levels of LDH and CRP correlated with severe illness requiring mechanical ventilatory support.

The aim of this research was to determine if rurality impacts access to WCV during early childhood, and if altering rurality measurement methods impacts outcomes. Design and Methods: We utilized a longitudinal correlational design with early childhood data gathered from the Virginia All Payer Claims Database, which contains claims data from Medicaid and the majority of Virginia commercial insurance payers (n=6349). WCV attendance was evaluated against three rurality metrics: a traditional metric using Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes, a developed land variable, and a distance to care variable, at a zip code level. Results: Two of the rurality methods revealed that rural children attend fewer WCVs than their urban counterparts, (67% vs. 50% respectively, using a traditional metric; and a 0.035 increase in WCV attendance for every percent increase in developed land). Differences were attenuated by insurance payer; children with Medicaid attend fewer WCVs than those with private insurance. Conclusions: Young children in rural Virginia attend fewer WCVs than their non-rural counterparts, placing them at higher risk for missing timely developmental disorder screenings.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective study of 450 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to SantOrsola Bologna Hospital from March 01 to April 10, 2020. Clinical, laboratory and treatment data were collected and analyzed. The in-hospital mortality between COVID-19 patients treated with standard prophylactic LMWH dosage vs. intermediate LMWH dosage was compared. Out of 450 patients, 361 received standard deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis enoxaparin treatment (40-60mg daily) and 89 patients received intermediate enoxaparin dosage (40C60 mg twice daily) for 7 days. No significant differences in the main demographic characteristics and laboratory testings at admission were observed in the two heparin regimen subgroups, except for older age and prevalence of hypertension in the group treated with standard prophylaxis LMWH dosage. The intermediate LMWH administration was associated with a lower in-hospital all-cause mortality compared to the standard prophylactic LMWH dosage (18.8% vs. 5.8%, p = 0.02).

Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these high-risk populations. Objective: To evaluate COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes associated with contact-targeted interventions and testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical modeling study developed an agent-based susceptible-exposed-infectious (asymptomatic/symptomatic)-recovered model between July and September 2020 to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff of a simulated nursing home with 100 residents and 100 staff split among 3 shifts were modeled individually; residents were split into 2 cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed from September to October 2020. Exposures: In the resident cohorting intervention, residents who had recovered from COVID-19 were moved back from the COVID-19 (ie, infected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort to the non-COVID-19 (ie, susceptible and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, staff who had recovered from COVID-19 were assumed to have protective immunity and were assigned to work in the non-COVID-19 cohort, while susceptible staff worked in the COVID-19 cohort and were assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aimed to reduce the fraction of people's contacts that were presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replaced them with recovered (immune) contacts. A secondary aim of was to evaluate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with 2 types of screening tests (ie, rapid antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing) conducted with varying frequency. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated cumulative incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3 months. Results: Among the simulated cohort of 100 residents and 100 staff members, frequency and type of testing were associated with smaller outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The testing strategy associated with the greatest estimated reduction in infections was daily antigen testing, which reduced the mean cumulative incidence proportion by 49% in absence of contact-targeted interventions. Under all screening testing strategies, the resident cohorting intervention and the immunity-based staffing intervention were associated with reducing the final estimated size of the outbreak among residents, with the immunity-based staffing intervention reducing it more (eg, by 19% in the absence of testing) than the resident cohorting intervention (eg, by 8% in the absence of testing). The estimated reduction in transmission associated with these interventions among staff varied by testing strategy and community prevalence. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that increasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes may reduce outbreaks in this high-risk setting. Immunity-based staffing may further reduce spread at little or no additional cost and becomes particularly important when daily testing is not feasible.","output":"Estimation of Transmission of COVID-19 in Simulated Nursing Homes With Frequent Testing and Immunity-Based Staffing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2012, the Bateson Review of research using non-human primates (NHPs) recommended the commissioning of a working group to identify and follow-up the results of UK-funded NHP research of potential benefit for human health (Recommendation 4), but the Medical Research Council (MRC) has postponed implementation of the recommendation.

Of these studies, 98 (35%) were medically relevant, of which 22 had potential therapeutic or public health applications. The relatively low proportion of medical studies together with the small number of applied studies raises questions over the level of investment in medical research and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer from basic to applied research.

The manifestations of COVID-19 are widely variable and range from asymptomatic infection to multi-organ failure and death. Like other viral illnesses, acute myocarditis has been reported to be associated with COVID-19 infection. However, guidelines for the diagnosis of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established. Methods Using a combination of search terms in the PubMed/Medline, Ovid Medline and the Cochrane Library databases and manual searches on Google Scholar and the bibliographies of articles identified, we reviewed all cases reported in the English language citing myocarditis associated with COVID-19 infection. Results Fourteen records comprising a total of fourteen cases that report myocarditis/myopericarditis secondary to COVID-19 infection were identified. There was a male predominance (58%), with the median age of the cases described being 50.4 years. The majority of patients did not have a previously identified comorbid condition (50%), but of those with a past medical history, hypertension was most prevalent (33%). Electrocardiogram findings were variable, and troponin was elevated in 91% of cases. Echocardiography was performed in 83% of cases reduced function was identified in 60%. Endotracheal intubation was performed in the majority of cases. Glucocorticoids were most commonly used in treatment of myocarditis (58%). Majority of patients survived to discharge (81%) and 85% of those that received steroids survived to discharge. Conclusion Guidelines for diagnosis and management of COVID-19 myocarditis have not been established and our knowledge on management is rapidly changing. The use of glucocorticoids and other agents including IL-6 inhibitors, IVIG and colchicine in COVID-19 myocarditis is debatable. In our review, there appears to be favorable outcomes related to myocarditis treated with steroid therapy.

In this study, 829 serum specimens were collected from 643 patients initially reported to be infected with SARS-CoV. The sera were tested for the N protein of SARS-CoV by using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The results of the N protein detection analysis were directly related to the serological analysis data. From 27 SARS patients who tested positive with the neutralization test, 100% of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group. The positive rates of N protein for sera collected at 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 414 samples from 298 serologically confirmed patients were 92.9, 69.8, 36.4, and 21.1%, respectively. For 294 sera from 248 serological test-negative patients, the rates were 25.6, 16.7, 9.3, and 0%, respectively. The N protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be SARS but serologically proven to be negative for SARS and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients.

Here, we characterize the auditory evoked potentials from hair cells in the utricle of non-reproductive type I males and test the hypothesis that the midshipman utricle is sensitive to behaviorally-relevant acoustic stimuli. Hair cell potentials were recorded from the rostral, medial and caudal regions of the utricle in response to pure tone stimuli presented by an underwater speaker. We show that the utricle is highly sensitive to particle motion stimuli produced by an underwater speaker positioned in the horizontal plane. Utricular potentials were recorded across a broad range of frequencies with lowest particle acceleration (dB re: 1 ms-2) thresholds occurring at 105 Hz (lowest frequency tested; mean threshold=-32 dB re: 1 ms-2) and highest thresholds at 605 to 1005 Hz (mean threshold range=-5 to -4 dB re: 1 ms-2).

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. SETTING: Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data. RESULTS: A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities.

In this Hypothesis and Theory article, a Hyper-Brain Cell Assembly Hypothesis is suggested on the basis of a conceptual review of neural synchrony and network dynamics and their roles in emerging cell assemblies within the interacting brains. The proposed hypothesis states that such cell assemblies can emerge not only within, but also between the interacting brains. More precisely, the hyper-brain cell assembly encompasses and integrates oscillatory activity within and between brains, and represents a common hyper-brain unit, which has a certain relation to social behavior and interaction. Hyper-brain modules or communities, comprising nodes across two or several brains, are considered as one of the possible representations of the hypothesized hyper-brain cell assemblies, which can also have a multidimensional or multilayer structure. It is concluded that the neuronal dynamics during interpersonal interaction is brain-wide, i.e., it is based on common neuronal activity of several brains or, more generally, of the coupled physiological systems including brains.","output":"Neural Synchrony and Network Dynamics in Social Interaction: A Hyper-Brain Cell Assembly Hypothesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To report the experience of collaborative practices facing the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eligible participants were TGE people assigned female or intersex at birth, 18 years and older, from across the United States, and recruited through The PRIDE Study or via online and in-person postings. RESULTS: Of 1694 TGE participants, 76 people (36% of those ever pregnant) reported considering trying to end a pregnancy on their own without clinical supervision, and a subset of these (n=40; 19% of those ever pregnant) reported attempting to do so. Methods fell into four broad categories: herbs (n=15, 38%), physical trauma (n=10, 25%), vitamin C (n=8, 20%) and substance use (n=7, 18%). Reasons given for abortion without clinical supervision ranged from perceived efficiency and desire for privacy, to structural issues including a lack of health insurance coverage, legal restrictions, denials of or mistreatment within clinical care, and cost. CONCLUSIONS: These data highlight a high proportion of sampled TGE people who have attempted abortion without clinical supervision. This could reflect formidable barriers to facility-based abortion care as well as a strong desire for privacy and autonomy in the abortion process.

We also observed the degree to which these policies support arguments for paradigmatic policy changes by examining different models of intersectoral and multisectoral collaborations, and the kinds of policies where these multiactor arrangements were the most common. From our analysis, we identify two main areas where COVID-19 policies are most likely to lead to more long-lasting innovation in Asia. The first is in the upgrading of infrastructures to ensure access to benefits, and to develop remote and doorstep banking. The second area is well-being and caring support, such as the development of programs to provide increased services to support home-based older persons, including telemedicine, delivery services for medical and other supplies, and remote support for older persons and their carers.

We report herein that sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), a key enzyme in sphingolipid catabolism, plays a critical role in the regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo. Hepatocyte-specific Sphk2 knockout mice exhibit pronounced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. Likewise, SphK2-deficient hepatocytes are resistant to insulin-induced activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-FoxO1 pathway and elevated hepatic glucose production. Mechanistically, SphK2 deficiency leads to the accumulation of sphingosine that, in turn, suppresses hepatic insulin signaling by inhibiting PI3K activation in hepatocytes. Either reexpressing functional SphK2 or pharmacologically inhibiting sphingosine production restores insulin sensitivity in SphK2-deficient hepatocytes. In conclusion, the current study provides both experimental findings and mechanistic data showing that SphK2 and sphingosine in the liver are critical regulators of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.","output":"Regulation of hepatic insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis by sphingosine kinase 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has alarming implications for individual and population level mental health. Although the future of COVID-19 is unknown at present, more countries or regions start to ease restrictions. The findings from this study have provided the empirical evidence of prevalence and patterns of mental disorders in Chinese general population before and after easing most COVID-19 restrictions, and information of the factors associated with these patterns. METHODS: A cross-sectional population-based online survey was carried out from February to March 2020 in the general population across all provinces in China. The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was incorporated in the survey. Latent class analyses were performed to investigate the patterns of mental disorders and multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine how individual and regional risk factors can predict mental disorder patterns. RESULTS: Four distinctive patterns of mental health were revealed in the general population. After the ease of most COVID-19 restrictions, the prevalence of high risk of mental disorders decreased from 25.8% to 20.9% and prevalence of being high risk of unhappiness and loss of confidence decreased from 10.1% to 8.1%. However, the prevalence of stressed, social dysfunction and unhappy were consistently high before and after easing restrictions. Several regional factors, such as case mortality rate and healthcare resources, were associated with mental health status. Of note, healthcare workers were less likely to have mental disorders, compared to other professionals and students. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamic management of mental health and psychosocial well-being is as important as that of physical health both before and after the ease of COVID-19 restrictions.

The transcribed data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Although the short duration of care contacts made the identification of elder abuse challenging, the emergency care providers detected indicators of physical, psychological and social abuse, unethical action, material exploitation, and self-neglect/self-abuse. The professionals based their observations on patient and family interviews, on clues in the home environment, on caregiving quality combined with the patient's medical history, and on physical signs, which were the easiest to identify. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The identification of elder abuse may be improved by multiprofessional collaboration, by increased attention given to risk groups and common indicators of abuse, and by adoption or creation of screening tools to assist detection and reporting.

As a consequence, soils in HM contaminated sites like the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund sites are predicted to have altered ecosystem functioning, with potential ramifications for the health of organisms, including humans, that live nearby. Further, several studies have shown that metal tolerant bacteria are often also resistant to antimicrobial agents (AMR), and therefore HM contaminated soils could potentially act as reservoirs that could disseminate AMR genes into human-associated pathogenic bacteria. To explore this possibility soil samples were collected from six public locations in the zip code 35207 (the home of the North Birmingham 35th Avenue Superfund site) and in six public areas in a neighboring reference zip code (35214). Sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that elevated concentrations of HMs As, Mn, Pb, and Zn reduced microbial diversity and altered community structure within each zip code. While there was no difference between zip codes in the proportion of total culturable microbes that survived antimicrobial or metal exposure, bacterial isolates with HMR almost always also exhibited AMR. Metagenomes inferred using PICRUST2 also predicted significantly higher mean relative frequencies in 35207 for several AMR genes related to both specific and broad-spectrum AMR phenotypes. Together, these results support the hypothesis that chronic HM pollution alters soil bacterial community structure in ecologically meaningful ways and may also select for bacteria with increased potential to contribute to AMR in human bacterial disease.","output":"Heavy metal pollution impacts soil bacterial community structure and antimicrobial resistance at the Birmingham 35th Avenue Superfund Site"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance and complexity of a countrys ability to effectively respond. The Joint External Evaluation (JEE) assessment was launched in 2016 to assess a countrys ability to prevent, detect and respond to public health emergencies. We examined whether JEE indicators could be used to predict a countrys COVID-19 response performance to tailor a countrys support more effectively. DESIGN: From April to August 2020, we conducted interviews with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention country offices that requested COVID-19 support and previously completed the JEE (version 1.0). We used an assessment tool, the Emergency Response Capacity Tool (ERCT), to assess COVID-19 response performance. We analysed 28 ERCT indicators aligned with eight JEE indicators to assess concordance and discordance using strict agreement and weighted kappa statistics. Generalised estimating equation (GEE) models were used to generate predicted probabilities for ERCT scores using JEE scores as the independent model variable. RESULTS: Twenty-three countries met inclusion criteria. Of the 163 indicators analysed, 42.3% of JEE and ERCT scores were in agreement (p value=0.02). The JEE indicator with the highest agreement (62%) was Emergency Operations Center (EOC) operating procedures and plans, while the lowest (16%) was capacity to activate emergency operations. Findings were consistent with weighted kappa statistics. In the GEE model, EOC operating procedures and plans had the highest predicted probability (0.86), while indicators concerning response strategy and coordination had the lowest (0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was low agreement between JEE scores and COVID-19 response performance, with JEE scores often trending higher. JEE indicators concerning coordination and operations were least predictive of COVID-19 response performance, underscoring the importance of not inferring country response readiness from JEE scores alone.

METHODS The systematic literature search identified all articles published up to 2013 that reported outcomes after abdominal wall reinforcement using synthetic non-absorbable or biologic prosthetics in contaminated fields. Studies were included if they included at least 10 cases (excluding inguinal and parastomal hernias). Quality assessment was performed using the MINORS instrument. The main outcomes measures were the incidence of wound infection and hernia at follow-up. Weighted pooled proportions were calculated using a random effects model. RESULTS A total of 32 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for synthesis. Mean sample size was 41.4 (range 10-190), and duration of follow-up was >1 year in 72 % of studies. Overall quality was low (mean 6.2, range 1-12). Pooled wound infection rates were 31.6 % (95 % CI 14.5-48.7) with biologic and 6.4 % (95 % CI 3.4-9.4) with synthetic non-absorbable prosthetics in clean-contaminated cases, with similar hernia rates.

The best fitting all ages models (R2 > 80%) for consultation data resulted in the greatest burden being associated with influenza followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). For models of adult age bands, there were significant associations between consultation data and invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae. There were also smaller numbers of consultations significantly associated with rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and human metapneumovirus. We estimate that a general practice with 10 000 patients would have seen an additional 18 respiratory tract infection consultations per winter week of which six had influenza and four had RSV.

Text messages included education about the importance of primary care, reminders to obtain an appointment, and resources to help schedule an appointment. Within 120 days of enrollment, we examined completion of at least one primary care visit and use of the emergency department. Within 1 year of enrollment, we examined diagnosis of a chronic disease, receipt of preventive care, and use of the emergency department. 8432 beneficiaries (4201 texting group; 4231 control group) were randomized; mean age was 37 years and 24% were White.

Two hundred samples of karish, a popular Egyptian fresh raw milk cheese, were analyzed for coliforms and fecal coliforms using a standard most probable number (MPN) technique. Overall, 85% of samples were unsuitable for consumption, as they exceeded Egyptian standards for coliforms (10 MPN/g), and 65% of samples exhibited coliforms at 44.5 C. Of 150 recovered thermotolerant strains, 140 (93.3%) were identified as E. coli. Importantly, one Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strain carrying a striking virulence pattern, stx1-, stx2+, eae-, was detected. Eleven strains (7.8%, 11/140) showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. Antibiotic resistance genes included blaSHV, blaCTX-M, qnrS, tet(A), and tet(B), which were present in 4.3%, 2.8%, 0.71%, 2.1%, and 0.71% of isolates, respectively. In conclusion, this study indicated that hygienic-sanitary failures occurred throughout the production process of most retail karish cheese.

Six rats from each group were euthanized at one, two and three weeks after the final inoculation. In a separate experiment, six additional animals were inoculated in each of groups 3, 5 and 6 (n = 18) and were sampled at five weeks after they had received M. pulmonis. Bronchoalveolar lavage and quantitative lung mycoplasma cultures were conducted on two-thirds of the rats. Histopathological examination and scoring of lesion severity were performed on all animals. Based on the prevalence and extent of histopathological lesions, bronchoalveolar lavage cell numbers, neutrophil differential cell counts and the isolation of M. pulmonis, the most severe disease occurred in the groups that received both agents. There was no significant difference in lesion severity between the groups receiving both agents other than in those examined during the acute stages of SDAV infection. Based on these results, it is evident that SDAV enhances lower respiratory tract disease in Wistar rats whether exposure occurs at one week prior to or at various intervals following M. pulmonis infections.","output":"Effect of time of exposure to rat coronavirus and Mycoplasma pulmonis on respiratory tract lesions in the Wistar rat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has aroused global health concerns, particularly in relation to diabetes where it has been associated with poorer outcomes The bulk of the evolving evidence in diabetes and COVID-19 relates to type 2 diabetes (T2D) Since there are a significant number of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) with unique concerns and challenges during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we reviewed existing literature, relevant websites, and related guidelines to form this narrative review to help address key questions in this area Method(s): We systematically searched the PubMed database up to May 31, 2020, and retrieved all the articles published on T1D and COVID-19 Result(s): We found 18 relevant articles, each of which carried a part of the evidence regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 in patients with T1D, effect of COVID-19 on development of T1D, outcomes in T1D with COVID-19, and special management issues in T1D in the light of COVID-19 These have been documented in the present review Conclusion(s): COVID-19 with T1D presents special challenges While the available evidence does shed some light, we need more evidence to deal with this difficult duo Copyright ? 2020, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India","output":"COVID-19 and type 1 diabetes: dealing with the difficult duo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diagnostics, including those that work at point-of-care, are an essential part of successful public health responses to infectious diseases and pandemics.

It highlights that older people are likely to have developed resilience through experiencing life challenges and living across history. METHOD: We used the narrative method to review research on three strengths: tendency toward life reflection, adaptive use of personal memory, and temporal focus encouraging generativity. RESULTS: For each, we (a) present evidence that this strength manifests in the second half of life, and (b) identify how it may specifically be applied in dealing with the challenges of the pandemic. In considering their life stories, the picture that emerges is one of older adults as having the potential to show considerable psychosocial strength despite the adversities of the pandemic.

Beginning on February 29, 2020, residents became ill with COVID-19-like illness (CLI), which required absence from work. There was initially a shortage of personal protective equipment and delays in SARS-CoV-2 testing, which gradually improved during March and April 2020. Objective We evaluated the relationship between CLI-related work absence rates of internal medicine residents and MMC's COVID-19 hospital census over time. Methods Data on resident work absence between February 29 and May 22 were reviewed along with MMC's COVID-19 hospital census data. To determine the effect of patient exposure on resident CLI incidence, we compared the mean incidence of CLI per patient exposure days (PED = daily hospital census  days pre- or post-peak) before and after peak COVID-19 hospital census. Results Forty-two percent (103 of 245) of internal medicine residents were absent from work, resulting in 875 missed workdays. At the peak of resident work absence, 16% (38 of 245) were out sick.

This study used proteomics and gene set enrichment analysis to assess effects of a GH releasing hormone (GHRH) analog, tesamorelin, on circulating immune markers and liver tissue in people with HIV (PWH) and NAFLD. METHODS 92 biomarkers associated with immunity, chemotaxis, and metabolism were measured in plasma samples from 61 PWH with NAFLD who participated in a double-blind, randomized trial of tesamorelin versus placebo for 12 months. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on serial liver biopsies targeted to immune pathways. RESULTS Tesamorelin, compared to placebo, decreased interconnected proteins related to cytotoxic T-cell and monocyte activation. Circulating concentrations of 13 proteins were significantly decreased, and no proteins increased, by tesamorelin. These included four chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL13 [MCP4], IL8 [CXCL8]), two cytokines (IL-10 and CSF-1), and four T-cell associated molecules (CD8A, CRTAM, GZMA, ADGRG1), as well as ARG1, Gal-9, and HGF. Network analysis indicated close interaction among the gene pathways responsible for these proteins, with imputational analyses suggesting down regulation of a closely related cluster of immune pathways. Targeted transcriptomics using liver tissue confirmed a significant end-organ signal of down-regulated immune activation pathways. CONCLUSIONS Long-term treatment with a GHRH analog reduced markers of T-cell and monocyte/macrophage activity, suggesting that augmentation of the GH axis may ameliorate immune activation in an HIV population with metabolic dysregulation, systemic and end organ inflammation.","output":"Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone Reduces Circulating Markers of Immune Activation in Parallel with Effects on Hepatic Immune Pathways in Individuals with HIV-Infection and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Medication review can be delivered using telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure ongoing provision of care to vulnerable patient populations and to minimise risk of infection for both patients and health professionals.

The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell. Recognition that ACE2 is the co-receptor for the coronavirus has prompted new therapeutic approaches to block the enzyme or reduce its expression to prevent the cellular entry and SARS-CoV-2 infection in tissues that express ACE2 including lung, heart, kidney, brain, and gut. ACE2, however, is a key enzymatic component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); ACE2 degrades Ang II, a peptide with multiple actions that promote CVD, and generates Ang-(1-7) which antagonizes the effects of Ang II. Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins enhance ACE2 that, in part, contribute to the benefit of these regimens. In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease.

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11, 2020. Elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which 19 elderly residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the increased susceptibility to cytokine release syndrome, inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, 19 patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: All patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable, and 18 of the 19 patients (94.7%) were discharged clinically recovered with negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results at 13 days. After one dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased within the first 24-48 h in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminarily assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients that did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. The control subjects were well matched regarding age, comorbidities, and severity of the disease. The percentage of itolizumab-treated, moderately ill patients who needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit was only one-third of that of the control group not treated with itolizumab. Additionally, treatment with itolizumab reduced the risk of death 10 times as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab in combination with other antivirals reduces COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19.

However, the complexity of chemotherapy regimens for cancer impedes retrospective research that uses observational health databases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the anticancer treatment trajectories and patterns of clinical events according to regimen type using the chemotherapy episodes determined by an algorithm. METHODS: We developed an algorithm to extract the regimen-level abstracted chemotherapy episodes from medication records in a conventional Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) database. The algorithm was validated on the Ajou University School Of Medicine (AUSOM) database by manual review of clinical notes. Using the algorithm, we extracted episodes of chemotherapy from patients in the EHR database and the claims database. We also developed an application software for visualizing the chemotherapy treatment patterns based on the treatment episodes in the OMOP-CDM database. Using this software, we generated the trends in the types of regimen used in the institutions, the patterns of the iterative chemotherapy use, and the trajectories of cancer treatment in two EHR-based OMOP-CDM databases. As a pilot study, the time of onset of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia according to regimen was measured using the AUSOM database. The anticancer treatment trajectories for patients with COVID-19 were also visualized based on the nationwide claims database. RESULTS: We generated 178,360 treatment episodes for patients with colorectal, breast, and lung cancer for 85 different regimens. The algorithm precisely identified the type of chemotherapy regimen in 400 patients (average positive predictive value >98%). The trends in the use of routine clinical chemotherapy regimens from 2008-2018 were identified for 8236 patients. For a total of 12 regimens (those administered to the largest proportion of patients), the number of repeated treatments was concordant with the protocols for standard chemotherapy regimens for certain cases. In addition, the anticancer treatment trajectories for 8315 patients were shown, including 62 patients with COVID-19. A comparative analysis of neutropenia showed that its onset in colorectal cancer regimens tended to cluster between days 9-15, whereas it tended to cluster between days 2-8 for certain regimens for breast cancer or lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a method for generating chemotherapy episodes for introduction into the oncology extension module of the OMOP-CDM databases. These proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the usability, scalability, and interoperability of the proposed framework through a distributed research network.","output":"Characterizing the Anticancer Treatment Trajectory and Pattern in Patients Receiving Chemotherapy for Cancer Using Harmonized Observational Databases: Retrospective Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycerol is an organic compound that can be utilized as an alternative source of carbon by various organisms.

Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) are now routinely given to older patients. The impact of performance status (PS) and age on the immune response remains unclear. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most older patients elected to continue their cancer therapy. Meta-analysis from trial data thus far has not demonstrated any association with cancer immunotherapy survival. This abstract reports on real -world experience of older patients with melanoma treated during the global pandemic. Methods: Real world data of all patients over 70 years of age receiving IO for melanoma, was collated at a tertiary cancer centre from Oct 2019 - Dec 2020. The objective was to see how these older patients tolerated CPI, in both the adjuvant and palliative settings, during a global pandemic. Information on demographics including age at diagnosis, intention, sites of metastases, PS, co-morbidities, toxicity, impact of COVID-19 and the patient outcomes were collected. During the pandemic the majority of patients on CPI treatment were assessed and followed up by telephone call rather than face to face. Results: Fifty-six patients over 70 years,were identified to have received CPI during the time period. There were 36 male and 22 female patients. Median age was 74 (range 70-88 years). Sixteen patients (29%) were treated with adjuvant intent;the remaining 40 patients (71%) were treated with palliative intent. Most patients with metastatic disease had 1-3 sites. All patients were PS0-1, except for one patient who was PS2. There were 19 patients (34%) who developed significant grade toxicities. No patients were treated on a clinical trial during the pandemic. Three patients (5%) elected to stop treatment during the pandemic. Calls to triage were taken as normal and the majority of patients had toxicity managed as an outpatient. No patients received the vaccine by the end of the study period. Conclusions: Real-world data explored the use of CPI in older patients and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their management. Older patients were able to continue on CPI during the pandemic and it was given safely in adjuvant and palliative settings. Comprehensive geriatric assessments are planned to be integrated however the current demands on medical colleagues has delayed the introduction. However clinicians working in partnership with patients ensured the safe delivery and no patients died from toxicity of therapy or COVID-19 during this time. These findings suggest that shared decision-making during a pandemic with older patients is essential to support patients and optimise outcomes. We suggest cancer therapies should not be restricted to patients based on age and IO can be given safely if precautions are taken during a global pandemic. Patients have now received first COVID-19 vaccinations and ongoing assessement of the impact of the vaccination is in progress.","output":"Ensuring equity in the management of patients, over 70 years of age, on immunotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented unprecedented health challenges across all strata in society throughout the world.

However, it is necessary to evaluate the panel's performance at the point of care directly, in nonspecific test settings. METHODS: Patients with respiratory tract infections were enrolled from among emergency department visitors, and all steps, including the collection of specimens and testing, were performed by our clinicians. RESULTS: Among 270 patients, 196 (72.6%) patients were found to have one or more pathogens. For signal pathogen detection, influenza A virus had the highest rate of detection; 45 (16.7%) of the patients had two or more respiratory pathogens codetected, and most of the multiplex pathogens were rhinovirus/enterovirus codetected with Bordetella pertussis (17.8%). The information provided by the FilmArray had an impact on the prescription of antimicrobials, and there were differences in the rates of antibiotic prescriptions and anti-influenza prescriptions among patients.

Age-independent, sex-biased differences in susceptibility to severe COVID-19 may be ascribable to deficits in a sexually dimorphic protective attribute that we termed immunologic resilience (IR). Objective To examine whether deficits in IR that antedate or are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection independently predict COVID-19 mortality. Methods IR levels were quantified with two novel metrics: immune health grades (IHG-I [best] to IHG-IV) to gauge CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell count equilibrium, and blood gene expression signatures. IR metrics were examined in a prospective COVID-19 cohort (n=522); primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Associations of IR metrics with outcomes in non-COVID-19 cohorts (n=13,461) provided the framework for linking pre-COVID-19 IR status to IR during COVID-19, as well as to clinical outcomes. Results IHG-I, tracking high-grade equilibrium between CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell counts, was the most common grade (73%) among healthy adults, particularly in females. SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with underrepresentation of IHG-I (21%) vs. overrepresentation (77%) of IHG-II or IHG-IV, especially in males vs. females (P<0.01). Presentation with IHG-I associated with 88% lower mortality, after controlling for age and sex; reduced risk of hospitalization and respiratory failure; lower plasma IL-6 levels; rapid clearance of nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 burden; and gene expression signatures correlating with survival that signify immunocompetence and controlled inflammation. In non-COVID-19 cohorts, IR-preserving metrics associated with resistance to progressive influenza or HIV infection, as well as lower 9-year mortality in the Framingham Heart Study, especially in females. Conclusion Preservation of immunocompetence with controlled inflammation during antigenic challenges is a hallmark of IR and associates with longevity and AIDS resistance. Independent of age, a male-biased proclivity to degrade IR before and/or during SARS-CoV-2 infection predisposes to severe COVID-19. Clinical implications Biomarkers tracking immunologic resilience may have broad prognostic utility, as they associated with longevity, as well as resistance to a progressive disease course during SARS-CoV-2, influenza, or HIV infection.","output":"Immunologic resilience and COVID-19 survival advantage"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Positive mediastinal lymph nodes, a marker for systemic disease, and positive margins, a marker for local disease, following resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are forms of residual disease. The objective of this study is to compare survival of patients with residual disease and to study the effect of receipt of guideline vs. non-guideline concordant care. Methods The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients who underwent treatment na?ve surgical resection with clinical stage T1-3N0-1M0 NSCLC between 2006-2016 and had pN2 disease, positive surgical margins, or both. Concordant care was determined based on form of chemotherapy and radiation, dosage, volume, modality, and duration. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were used to compare five-year survival. Multivariable analysis using Cox proportional hazards modeling identified factors that contributed to worse overall survival. Results There were 8,189 patients included: pN2 (5,416), positive margins (2,386), and both (387). Five-year survival rates for all patients were pN2 (35.8%), positive margins (33.9%), and both (22.9%) (P<0.0001). On multivariable analysis, positive margins were an independent predictor of better survival relative to pN2 disease (HR =0.729, CI: 0.676, 0.787, P<0.0001). Receipt of non-guideline concordant treatment was an independent predictor of worse survival compared to receipt of guideline-concordant treatment (HR =1.61, CI: 1.504, 1.725, P<0.0001). Conclusions In upfront surgical patients, guideline-concordant treatment in the setting of residual disease is associated with better overall survival compared with non-guideline concordant treatment. Pathologic N2 disease is associated with a lower survival rate than positive resection margins, possibly reflecting the systemic nature of pN2 disease.","output":"Differential outcomes of residual disease in surgically-resected non-small cell lung cancer and the importance of guideline-concordant adjuvant therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have used the Nanopore long-read sequencing platform to demonstrate how amazingly complex the human adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) transcriptome is with a flexible splicing machinery producing a range of novel mRNAs both from the early and late transcription units. In total we report more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs produced from the Ad2 transcriptome whereof more than 850 are novel mRNAs. A surprising finding was that more than 50% of all E1A transcripts extended upstream of the previously defined transcriptional start site. The novel start sites mapped close to the inverted terminal repeat (ITR) and within the E1A enhancer region. We speculate that novel promoters or enhancer driven transcription, so-called eRNA transcription, is responsible for producing these novel mRNAs. Their existence was verified by a peptide in the Ad2 proteome that was unique for the E1A ITR mRNA. Although we show a high complexity of alternative splicing from most early and late regions, the E3 region was by far the most complex when expressed at late times of infection. More than 400 alternatively spliced mRNAs were observed in this region alone. These mRNAs included extended L4 mRNAs containing E3 and L5 sequences and readthrough mRNAs combining E3 and L5 sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the virus has a remarkable capacity to produce novel exon combinations, which will offer the virus an evolutionary advantage to change the gene expression repertoire and protein production in an evolving environment.IMPORTANCE Work in the adenovirus system led to the groundbreaking discovery of RNA splicing and alternative RNA splicing in 1977. These mechanisms are essential in mammalian evolution by increasing the coding capacity of a genome. Here, we have used a long-read sequencing technology to characterize the complexity of human adenovirus pre-mRNA splicing in detail. It is mindboggling that the viral genome, which only houses around 36,000 bp, not being much larger than a single cellular gene, generates more than 900 alternatively spliced mRNAs. Recently, adenoviruses have been used as the backbone in several promising SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Further improvement of adenovirus-based vaccines demands that the virus can be tamed into an innocent carrier of foreign genes. This requires a full understanding of the components that govern adenovirus replication and gene expression.","output":"The Human Adenovirus Type 2 Transcriptome: An Amazing Complexity of Alternatively Spliced mRNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past optimization methods of modern history education resource allocation, there is a problem of large financial cost consumption.

Predisposing factors for ARDS are diverse(1,3) and include sepsis, aspiration, pneumonias and infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus(4,5). At present, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of ARDS(1,2,3). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are homologues with different key functions in the reninCangiotensin system(6,7,8). ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and is a negative regulator of the system. ACE2 has also recently been identified as a potential SARS virus receptor and is expressed in lungs(9,10).

However, predictive indicators of early weaning from MV post-treatment have not yet been defined, making treating established ARDS challenging. Interleukin (IL)-6 has been associated with the pathogenesis of ARDS. ObjectiveOur aim was to clarify clinical utility of IL-6 level in ventilated patients with established ARDS. MethodsClinical, treatment, and outcome data were evaluated in 119 invasively ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-mediated ARDS. Plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured on days 1, 4, and 7 after intubation. ResultsFifty-two patients were treated with dexamethasone (steroid group), while the remaining 67 patients were not (non-steroid group). Duration of MV use was significantly shorter in the steroid group compared to non-steroid group (11.5{+/-}0.6 vs. 16.1{+/-}1.0 days, P = 0.0005, respectively) along with significantly decreased levels of IL-6 and CRP. Even when restricted to the steroid group, among variables post-MV, IL-6 level on day 7 was most closely correlated with duration of MV use (Spearmans rank correlation coefficient [{rho}] = 0.73, P < 0.0001), followed by CRP level on day 7 and the percentage change in IL-6 or CRP levels between day 1 and day 7. Moreover, among these variables, IL-6 levels on day 7 showed the highest accuracy for withdrawal from MV within 11 days (AUC: 0.88), with optimal cutoff value of 20.6 pg/mL. Consistently, the rate of MV weaning increased significantly earlier in patients with low IL-6 ([] 20.6 pg/mL) than in those with high IL-6 (> 20.6 pg/mL) (log-rank test P < 0.0001). ConclusionsIn invasively ventilated patients with established ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2, plasma IL-6 levels served as a predictor of early withdrawal from MV after dexamethasone administration.","output":"Interleukin-6 as a predictor of early weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To assess the feasibility, safety and clinical outcomes of image-guided percutaneous thermal ablation as salvage therapy for local recurrence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in patients initially treated surgically with curative intent. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review of 11 consecutive patients (M/F = 8:3, mean age = 76 years) who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided thermal ablation for locally recurrent RCC after partial (72%, 8/11) or radical nephrectomy (28%, 3/11) with a mean time to recurrence of 48 months (range 2-156). Assessment of technical success, complication (peri- and post-procedural), oncological outcome and survival analysis were performed. Patient baseline and follow-up renal function surrogates including creatinine level (Cr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were statistically compared. RESULTS Eleven biopsy-proven recurrent RCC measuring 1.4-3.9 cm (mean = 2.8 cm) were treated with CT-guided thermal ablation. Technical success was achieved in 100% (11/11) of the cases. There were no major complications except for one (9%) asymptomatic hemorrhage (Clavien-Dindo grade I complication). Complete response, local progression-free and overall survival rate were 91, 91 and 82% during the mean follow-up time of 2.5 years (range 0.1-7.1).

To the best of our knowledge, there is no other work directly addressing workflow scheduling using quantum computing. Our solution includes transformation into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and discussion of experimental results, as well as possible applications of the solution. For our experiments we choose four problem instances small enough to fit into the annealers architecture. For two of our instances the quantum annealer finds the global optimum for scheduling.

METHODS: Descriptive study of a series of cases of patients scheduled for endoscopy during the month of May 2020, when endoscopic activity was resumed after the peak of the pandemic, following SCD, SEED, AEG and ESGE recommendations. We examined nasopharyngeal samples 48-72 hours before the appointment, by RT-PCR, in all patients. RNA extraction was performed using the kits: Qiagen?-adapted, BiosSprint?96-DNA-Blood-Kit (384). For amplification-detection of SARS-CoV-2, methods recommended by the WHO and the CDC were followed. RESULTS: 110 asymptomatic patients without close contact with a positive case in the previous 14 days were scheduled; 105 (96.4%) were negative and five (4.5%) were positive. Two patients developed respiratory symptoms after diagnosis (presymptomatic) and three remained asymptomatic.

It is considered an important therapeutic target in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, since SARS-CoV-2 enters permissive cells via an ACE2-mediated mechanism. The present in silico study attempted to repurpose existing drugs for use as prospective viral-entry inhibitors targeting human ACE2. Initially, a clinically approved drug library of 7,173 ligands was screened against the receptor using molecular docking, followed by energy minimization and rescoring of docked ligands. Finally, potential binders were inspected to ensure molecules with different scaffolds were engaged in favorable contacts with both the metal cofactor and the critical residues lining the receptors active site. The results of the calculations suggest that lividomycin, burixafor, quisinostat, fluprofylline, pemetrexed, spirofylline, edotecarin, and diniprofylline emerge as promising repositionable drug candidates for stabilizing the closed (substrate/inhibitor-bound) conformation of ACE2, thereby shifting the relative positions of the receptors critical exterior residues recognized by SARS-CoV-2.

DesignDaily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020. Setting34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. ParticipantsGoogle mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google. InterventionsWe examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data. ResultsIn two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries. ConclusionMild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPICSince SARS-CoV-2 became a pandemic, restrictions on mobility such as limitations on travel and closure of offices, restaurants, and shops have been imposed in an unprecedented way in both scale and scope to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the absence of effective treatment options or a vaccine. Although mobility restriction has also brought about tremendous costs such as negative economic growth and other collateral impacts on health such as increased morbidity and mortality from lack of access to other essential health services, little evidence exists on the effectiveness of mobility restriction for the prevention of disease transmission. A search of PUBMED and Google Scholar for publications on this topic through Sep 20, 2020 revealed that most of the evidence on the effectiveness of physical distancing comes from mathematical modeling studies using a variety of assumptions. One study investigated only the combined effect of several interventions, including physical distancing, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDSThis is the first study to investigate the association between change in mobility and incidence of COVID-19 globally using real-time measures of mobility at the population level. For this, we used Google Global Mobility data and the daily incidence of COVID-19 for 36 countries from the day of 100th case detection through August 31, 2020. Our findings from LOESS regression show that in two-thirds of countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. This decrease, however, plateaued as mobility decreased further. We found that associations between mobility restriction and incidence became smaller or negligible in the late phase of the pandemic in most countries. The reduced incidence rate of COVID-19 cases with a mild to moderate degree of mobility restriction in most countries suggests some value to limited mobility restriction in early phases of epidemic mitigation. The lack of impact in some others, however, suggests further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the distinguishing factors for when mobility restrictions are helpful in decreasing viral transmission. Governments should carefully consider the level and period of mobility restriction necessary to achieve the desired benefits and minimize harm.","output":"How well does societal mobility restriction help control the COVID-19 pandemic?

However, the molecular basis for the SARS-CoV-2 N?G3BP1 interaction remains elusive. Here we report biochemical and structural analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 N?G3BP1 interaction, revealing differential contributions of various regions of SARS-CoV-2 N to G3BP1 binding. The crystal structure of the NTF2-like domain of G3BP1 (G3BP1(NTF2)) in complex with a peptide derived from SARS-CoV-2 N (residues 1- 25, N(1-25)) reveals that SARS-CoV-2 N(1-25) occupies a conserved surface groove of G3BP1(NTF2) via surface complementarity. We show that a -x-F (, hydrophobic residue) motif constitutes the primary determinant for G3BP1(NTF2)-targeting proteins, while the flanking sequence underpins diverse secondary interactions. We demonstrate that mutation of key interaction residues of the SARS-CoV-2 N(1-25)?G3BP1(NTF2) complex leads to disruption of the SARS-CoV-2 N?G3BP1 interaction in vitro.

In the context of this particular decision, little is known about what treatment-related factors are important and how they are prioritized in order to arrive at a treatment preference. METHODS The Hydrocephalus Association electronically distributed a survey to surgically treated hydrocephalus patients or their families. Respondents rated the importance of various surgical attributes in their decision-making about treatment choice, and also indicated their preference in hypothetical scenarios involving a trade-off between potential risks and benefits of treatment. Rank-order correlations were used to determine whether certain predictor variables affected the rating of factors or hypothetical treatment choice. RESULTS Eighty percent of 414 respondents rated procedural risks, minimizing repeat surgery, and improving long-term brain function as being very or extremely important factors when deciding on a treatment; 69% rated the need to implant a permanent device similarly. Parent-respondents rated procedural risks higher than patient-respondents. A majority of respondents (n = 209, 54%) chose a procedure with higher surgical risk if it meant that implantation of a permanent device was not required, and respondents were more likely to choose this option if they discussed both treatment options with their surgeon prior to their initial intervention (Spearman rho 0.198, p = 0.001).Although only 144 of 384 total respondents (38%) chose a less established operation if it meant less repeat surgery, patient-respondents were more likely to choose this option compared to parent-respondents (Spearman rho 0.145, p = 0.005). Likewise, patient-respondents were more likely than parent-respondents to choose an operation that involved less repeat surgery and led to worse long-term brain function (Spearman rho 0.160, p = 0.002), an option that was chosen by only 23 (6%) of respondents overall. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first exploration of patient/parental factors that influence treatment preference in pediatric hydrocephalus. Procedural risks, minimizing repeat operations, and the desire to maximize long-term cognitive function appeared to be the most important attributes that influenced treatment decisions that the survey respondents had made in the past. Patients and/or their caregivers appear to see some inherent benefit in being shunt free. It appears that fear of multiple revision operations may drive treatment choice in some circumstances.","output":"Patient and parental assessment of factors influencing the choice of treatment in pediatric hydrocephalus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Thermal sterilization is generally avoided for 3-D printed components because of the relatively low deformation temperatures for common thermoplastics used for material extrusion-based additive manufacturing. 3-D printing materials required for high-temperature heat sterilizable components for COVID-19 and other applications demands 3-D printers with heated beds, hot ends that can reach higher temperatures than polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) hot ends and heated chambers to avoid part warping and delamination.

Up to 17 December 2014, it has infected at least 938 people with a fatality rate of about 36% globally. This has resulted in an urgent need to identify antiviral drugs that are active against MERS-CoV. The papain-like protease (PL(pro)) of MERS-CoV represents an important antiviral target as it is not only essential for viral maturation, but also antagonizes interferon stimulation of the host via its deubiquitination activity. Here, we report the discovery that two SARS-CoV PL(pro) inhibitors, 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG), as well as the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolic acid, are able to inhibit MERS-CoV PL(pro). Their inhibition mechanisms and mutually binding synergistic effect were also investigated. Our results identify for the first time three inhibitors targeting MERS-CoV PL(pro) and these can now be used as lead compounds for further antiviral drug development.","output":"Thiopurine analogs and mycophenolic acid synergistically inhibit the papain-like protease of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens the health of humans and causes great economic losses.

Millions of people have become infected with the disease, while billions of people have been continually asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on the COVID-19 pandemic suggests that it is associated with large-scale behavioral and mental health changes; however, few studies have been able to track these changes with frequent, near real-time sampling or compare these changes to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data in a cohort of college-aged students enrolled in a longitudinal study, we seek to understand the behavioral and mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by interest across the United States in the search terms coronavirus and COVID fatigue. METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone use, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife mobile smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Spring 2020 term, as compared to previous terms in the same cohort, were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: Linear mixed models demonstrated differences in phone use, sleep, sedentary time and number of locations visited associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In further models, these behaviors were strongly associated with increased interest in COVID fatigue. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, phone use, sedentary time), both anxiety and depression (P<.001) were significantly associated with interest in COVID fatigue. Notably, these behavioral and mental health changes are consistent with those observed around the initial implementation of COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In the initial lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, people spent more time on their phones, were more sedentary, visited fewer locations, and exhibited increased symptoms of anxiety and depression. As the pandemic persisted through the spring, people continued to exhibit very similar changes in both mental health and behaviors. Although these large-scale shifts in mental health and behaviors are unsurprising, understanding them is critical in disrupting the negative consequences to mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Mobile Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study, Part II"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a devastating complication of advanced cancer. A deep learning (DL) model for automated MESCC classification on MRI could aid earlier diagnosis and referral. PURPOSE: To develop a DL model for automated classification of MESCC on MRI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with known MESCC diagnosed on MRI between September 2007 and September 2017 were eligible. MRI studies with instrumentation, suboptimal image quality, and non-thoracic regions were excluded. Axial T2-weighted images were utilized. The internal dataset split was 82% and 18% for training/validation and test sets, respectively. External testing was also performed. Internal training/validation data were labeled using the Bilsky MESCC classification by a musculoskeletal radiologist (10-year experience) and a neuroradiologist (5-year experience). These labels were used to train a DL model utilizing a prototypical convolutional neural network. Internal and external test sets were labeled by the musculoskeletal radiologist as the reference standard. For assessment of DL model performance and interobserver variability, test sets were labeled independently by the neuroradiologist (5-year experience), a spine surgeon (5-year experience), and a radiation oncologist (11-year experience). Inter-rater agreement (Gwets kappa) and sensitivity/specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, 215 MRI spine studies were analyzed [164 patients, mean age = 62  12(SD)] with 177 (82%) for training/validation and 38 (18%) for internal testing. For internal testing, the DL model and specialists all showed almost perfect agreement (kappas = 0.92C0.98, p < 0.001) for dichotomous Bilsky classification (low versus high grade) compared to the reference standard. Similar performance was seen for external testing on a set of 32 MRI spines with the DL model and specialists all showing almost perfect agreement (kappas = 0.94C0.95, p < 0.001) compared to the reference standard.

The involvement of wildlife and wet markets with the previous outbreaks simultaneously has been brought into sharp focus. Although scientists are yet to ascertain the host range and zoonotic potential of SARS-CoV-2 rigorously, information about its two ancestors, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), is a footprint for research on COVID-19. A 96% genetic similarity with bat coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 indicates that the bat might be a potential reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where civets and dromedary camels are considered the potential intermediate host, respectively. Perceiving the genetic similarity between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, many scientists also have given the scheme that the pangolin might be the intermediate host. The involvement of SARS-CoV-2 with other animals, such as mink, snake, and turtle has also been highlighted in different research articles based on the interaction between the key amino acids of S protein in the receptor-binding domain and angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2).

The protein and gene expression levels of RNF2 in SCC and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot analysis and semi-quantitative reverse transcription (RT) PCR. Single factor analysis was used to study the association between RNF2 expression level and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with SCC. Multifactor Cox survival analysis was used to examine the association between RNF2 expression and the overall survival rate of postoperative patients with SCC. The results from IHC staining demonstrated that the positive expression rate of RNF2 was 84.68% (210/248) and 56.05% (139/248) in SCC and in adjacent tissues, respectively. Furthermore, results from western blot analysis demonstrated that RNF2 protein expression in SCC tissues was significantly higher compared with that in the adjacent tissues (P<0.05). The positive rate of RNF2 mRNA in SCC was 81.05% (201/248), which was significantly higher compared with that in the adjacent tissues 54.44% (135/248; P<0.05).

They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival.

The media landscape was dominated by corporate marketing campaigns for branded sugary beverages (65.8%; n = 184) followed by public awareness (9.6%; n = 27), public policy (8.2%; n = 23), social marketing (7.1%; n = 20), corporate social responsibility (5.7%; n = 16), and countermarketing (3.6%; n = 10) campaigns. Evaluations for 20 unique campaigns implemented over 30 years (1992-2021) across 14 states showed reduced sugary beverage or juice and increased water or low-fat milk sales and intake. Positive short-term cognitive and mid-term retail and behavioral changes were reported. There was limited evidence for long-term policy, social norm, and population health outcomes. Future research is needed to use media campaigns in strategic communications to reduce sugary beverage health risks for Americans.","output":"How have media campaigns been used to promote and discourage healthy and unhealthy beverages in the United States?

A COVID-19 Compliant IVF (in vitro fertilization) program based on the use of follitropin delta to induce ovarian stimulation and fixed protocol with GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone) antagonists was applied to demonstrate the efficacy of this program in reducing the necessity of patients to be present within the clinic while maintaining the expected success rate. METHODS The program was applied to 100 patients (women aged between 20 and 40 years, at their first IVF cycle): pretreatment assessment was carried out via video conference and clinical documentations were sent by email. Ovarian stimulation was based on doses of Follitropin delta selected on the basis of body weight and serum AMH (Anti-Mllerian Hormone). The study population was then compared with historical controls to assess the percentage of patients receiving fresh embryo transfer. Finally, a questionnaire was proposed to assess patient satisfaction. RESULTS The ovarian stimulation protocol with a fixed dose of follitropin delta led to an optimal ovarian response (8-14 oocytes) in 54% of the women included in the study. The rate of hyper response was 15% and was significantly lower that what reported in the control group (26.8%, p < .05). The good control of ovarian response to stimulation is the reason for the large percentage of cycles associated with fresh embryo transfer (84%, n 84/100). The rate of fresh embryo transfer was significantly higher that what reported for the control population (68.5%, p < .05). In 40 out of 84 patients, blastocysts were available for the fresh embryo transfer procedure. Eighty-five percent (89/100) of survey responders reported being extremely satisfied with the simplified approach to the IVF cycle because of reduced number of visits, easy management of working hours and reduction in travel costs. CONCLUSIONS The use of follitropin delta and fixed protocol with GnRH antagonist in COVID-19 - Compliant IVF program is associated to a low percentage of patients developing excessive ovarian response compared to conventional strategy and a very good level of patient satisfaction. Beyond the pandemic, the new approach to ovarian stimulation, modern technologies and telemedicine could play a key role in bridging the gap between different geographic areas and could offer advantages such as increased accessibility, cost saving and patient satisfaction.","output":"COVID-19 - compliant - IVF: reorganized clinical practice taking into account the pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To develop a MUC1-targeted CAR T that recognizes the growth factor receptor form, MUC1?, does not bind full-length MUC1, hits a wide range of solid tumor cancers, binds to little or no normal tissues, and effectively kills tumor cells. Methods: Because MUC1 is expressed on normal epithelial tissues, we needed to develop an antibody that would only bind to the aberrant, cancerous form - MUC1?. MUC1? (muk1 star) is the transmembrane portion that remains after MUC1 is enzymatically cleaved and the bulky tandem repeat domain is shed from the cell surface. MUC1? is a growth factor receptor that is activated by ligand-induced dimerization of its truncated extracellular domain. Via a novel screen we identified antibodies that bind to a specific conformation within the ectopic epitope that is created when MUC1 is cleaved to MUC1? by enzymes secreted by the tumor microenvironment. This set of antibodies competitively inhibit the binding of onco-embryonic growth factor NME7AB to the cancerous form of MUC1?. We incorporated one of these cancer-specific antibodies into a CAR T. Results: huMNC2-CAR44 is in a 1st-in-human clinical trial [NCT04020575] for metastatic breast cancers, currently being performed at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Our IND-enabling studies showed that huMNC2-scFv bound robustly to 95% of breast cancer tissues, 83% ovarian cancers, 78% pancreatic cancers and 71% of lung cancer tissues, but showed little to no binding to normal tissues. In co-culture experiments, huMNC2-CAR44 T cells did not kill MUC1? negative cells, even if they expressed full-length MUC1, and the presence of MUC1? negative cells did not elicit a cytokine response from the CAR T cells. In vivo, huMNC2-CAR44 T cells inhibited or completely obliterated a variety of MUC1? positive solid tumors in NSG mice (n400). The human CD8+ huMNC2-CAR44 T cells expanded in animals as tumors shrunk, whereas the untransduced T cells did not. Clinical trial was slowed by COVID-19, as Seattle was the first hotbed of the virus. Thus far, there have been no serious adverse events attributed to the CAR T therapy. Even at the lowest dosage, patients have had robust CAR T cell expansion and have also had measurable signs of efficacy. Conclusions: MUC1? is the predominant form of MUC1 on cancerous tissues. Antibodies that bind to a specific conformation within the ectopic growth factor binding site in the MUC1? extra cellular domain are tumor selective. CAR T cells incorporating these antibodies are highly effective against solid tumors in animals. Robust staining of cancerous tissues and minimal to no staining of normal tissues predicts a large therapeutic window for huMNC2-CAR44 T cell dosing. Early patient responses appear to fulfill the predictions of the IND-enabling studies. We have now developed a cryopreservation formulation which enables shipping frozen product to additional clinical sites for bedside thaw and infusion. The trial is currently enrolling patients.","output":"First-in-human CAR T targets MUC1 transmembrane cleavage product"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Estimated seroprevalence of Coronavirus Infectious Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a critical evidence for a better evaluation of the virus spread and monitoring the progress of COVID-19 pandemic in a population. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 11,703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates. RESULTS: Overall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the reported COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95C10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension. The study also presents the demographics and prevalence of co-morbidities in HCWs and subset of non-COVID-19 population. INTERPRETATION: Our study estimates the overall national serological prevalence of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia to be 11%, with an apparent disparity between regions.

Between the 1st of April and the 7th of June 2020, all participants scheduled for a follow-up survey were systematically included into an additional COVID-19-related wave of data collection (N = 100). We compared participants' type of housing, level of food insecurity, work and mental health (PHQ9) before and during the first COVID-19-related lockdown, using paired-Mc Nemar chi-2 tests. We next described their level of information on Covid-19 and policy measures, broken down by sex. RESULTS Among the 100 participants, 68% had no legal residence permit. Food insecurity was more often reported during lockdown than before (62% vs 52%). 9% of participants had a score indicative of severe depression (PHQ9) before lockdown and 17% afterwards (p = 0.17). Only 51% knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission of the COVID-19 virus. CONCLUSIONS This study brings original information on a hard-to-reach population group.

Critical to the rapid evaluation of vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 is the development of tractable animal models to understand the adaptive immune response to the virus. To this end, the use of common laboratory strains of mice is hindered by significant divergence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the receptor required for entry of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we designed and utilized an mRNA-based transfection system to induce expression of the hACE2 receptor in order to confer entry of SARS-CoV-2 in otherwise non-permissive cells. By employing this expression system in an in vivo setting, we were able to interrogate the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in type 1 interferon receptor deficient mice. In doing so, we showed that the T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 is enhanced when hACE2 is expressed during infection. Moreover, we demonstrated that these responses are preserved in memory and are boosted upon secondary infection. Importantly, using this system, we functionally identified the CD4+ and CD8+ structural peptide epitopes targeted during SARS-CoV-2 infection in H2b restricted mice and confirmed their existence in an established model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. We demonstrated that, identical to what has been seen in humans, the antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins. As the focus of the immune response in mice is highly similar to that of the humans, the identification of functional murine SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell epitopes provided in this study will be critical for evaluation of vaccine efficacy in murine models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"mRNA induced expression of human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in mice for the study of the adaptive immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Well-being is a complex concept with objective and subjective elements that contribute to life satisfaction Medical students experience inevitable transition from pre-clinical to clinical training with increasingly more independence and responsibility This study aimed to identify well-being issues in undergraduate clinical students The emotional, physical, social, spiritual, occupational and intellectual aspects of well-being were focused on A thorough literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines Studies reporting issues from the six aspects of well-being in undergraduate clinical students, and published in peer-reviewed journals in English language from the year 2000 to 2020 with full-text available online were included The initial search from PubMed, OVID Medline, Psych INFO and CINAHL Plus retrieved 623 articles with 51 studies included in this review Evidence from the previous studies demonstrated poor well-being among undergraduate clinical students Stress, lack of exercise, low peer and family support, and mistreatment by clinicians and patients were common well-being issues encountered Based on this literature review, the five aspects of well-being except the emotional aspect were less explored Thus, it will be of interest to investigate well-being issues among Malaysian undergraduate clinical students from the physical and occupational aspects, which are further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify possible contributing factors Undergraduate clinical students are faced with several well-being issues Thus, early detection of these issues is important to avoid devastating consequences to students and patients ?

Methods Uncinate process tissues were obtained from 61 chronic rhinosinusitis patients (of which, 39 had allergy and 22 did not) who were infected with HRV16 using an air-liquid interface organ culture system. The expression levels of programmed cell death-ligand (PD-L)1, PD-L2, intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), IFN-, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 were evaluated in the infected nasal mucosa. Results The HRV infection rates were not significantly different between allergy (74.4 %) and non-allergy (72.7 %) groups. In the allergy group, the expression of PD-L1 (P=0.013) and IL-10 (P=0.040) was significantly elevated in the HRV-infected tissues; there was a strong correlation between PDL1 and IL-10 (r= 0.868, P<0.001). In contrast, infected tissues from the non-allergy group displayed increased levels of IL-4 (P=0.039), IL-5 (P=0.023), and IFN- (P=0.031) as well as an increased IL-4/IFN- ratio after HRV infection (P=0.043). Conclusion This study shows that, regardless of the presence of allergy, HRV infection rates are similar in the nasal mucosa of patients with CRS.

The pro-inflammatory metabolites of AA and EPA such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes induce inflammation whereas lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins derived from AA, EPA and DHA not only suppress inflammation but also enhance would healing and augment phagocytosis of macrophages and other immunocytes and decrease microbial load.

Aim: The aim of this paper is to report the experiences of the community-pharmacist participants, with a focus on the fitness-for-purpose' of the programme. Methods: This was a longitudinal mixed-methods study theoretically underpinned by Miller's triangle and social cognitive theory. Eligible participants were all pharmacists registering for the programme in Scotland in September 2017 and February 2018, all participating Welsh community-pharmacists, and all tutors. Invitation packs were emailed by NES/HEIW staff with names forwarded to researchers following signed consent. Focus groups/interviews (face-to-face or virtual according to participant preference) were undertaken at start, mid-point and exit of programme, to explore expectations (benefits, social gains, professional identify), experiences (challenges, facilitators, meeting of learners' needs) and barriers. Proceedings were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and managed using NVivo. Thematic analysis (1) was based on social cognitive theory (transferable behavioural skills and professional attitudes). An inductive analysis additionally identified emergent themes. Participants in Scotland were invited to complete an on-line base-line questionnaire to describe their self-assessed competence against the NES Foundation framework (personal and professional practice, membership of healthcare team, communication, patient centred approach to practice). Data was analysed in SPSS using descriptive statistics. Themes from qualitative and quantitative data were integrated. IRAS ethical approval was not required;NHS Research & Development approval was given. Results: 96 pharmacists registered for the programme: 18 community-pharmacists in Scotland (11 health boards);14 community pharmacists in Wales. In Scotland 15 community-pharmacists completed questionnaires: 9 expected an increase in confidence' and 11 to provide better patient care'. Self-assessed competence against the framework was generally high. Across Scotland and Wales, 12 focus-groups (involving 19 community-pharmacists), 12 community-pharmacist interviews, 10 tutor focus-groups (8 community-pharmacist tutors) and 3 community-pharmacist tutor interviews were conducted. At midpoint and exit pharmacists and tutors reported increased confidence, the ability to reflect and pride in their achievement. Barriers: included lack of protected time;workload;and lack of support (tutor and employer). There were also programme issues (practicalities of portfolio;workplace-based assessment, no access to medical records);and cultural issues in community-pharmacy (speed & safety';lack of recognition). Reasons for dropping out of the programme included: moved geographical area;too experienced;workload pressures;no incentive;no employer support. Four community-pharmacists in Scotland and none in Wales completed the programme. Conclusion: Study limitations include the small numbers, programme delivery limited to Scotland and Wales, and limited response rate to focus-groups/interviews, exacerbated by COVID19. Overall community pharmacist expectations were met, and they perceived the programme was fit-for-purpose and worthwhile. However, barriers particularly related to the community pharmacy context, may have led to the high drop-out rate.

In the context of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus infection, the course of viral pneumonia is often complicated by the addition of bacterial microflora due to a decrease in the body's immune status. The causative agents of such a co-infection can exhibit multiple drug resistance, which significantly reduces the effectiveness of etiotropic therapy. In this regard, it seems expedient to provide microbiological support to patients in order to select the most optimal treatment regimens. Aim. To study the composition of bacterial pathogens' species, that cause community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in corona-positive (COVID-19+) and corona-negative (COVID-19-) patients and to determine the spectrum of their sensitivity/resistance to antibacterial drugs. Material and methods. The species composition of microorganisms in sputum samples from 723 patients with CAP, who were admitted from the healthcare facility in Rostov-on-Don in August and December 2020 were studied. The isolated cultures were identified using bacteriological and mass spectrometric methods. The sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. Results. It was shown that in August pneumococci and staphylococci prevailed in the spectrum of CAP pathogens, while in December the percentage of excretions of Acinetobacter spp. and S. haemolyticus increased. Various types of p. Candida yeast were found with a high degree of isolation, COVID-19 + patients showed a tendency towards greater contamination (>104 mcl/ml). Some pathogens (A.baumannii, S.haemolyticus, P.aeruginosa, S.maltophilia) are characterized by polydrug resistance, and some strains of these species are pan-resistant to all groups of antibiotics.

One way to do this is to choose individuals to vaccinate based on their location. Methods for this prioritization include strategies that target those regions most at risk of importing the pathogen, and strategies that target regions with high centrality on the travel network. We use a simple infectious disease epidemic model to compare a risk-targeting strategy to two different centrality-targeting strategies based on betweenness centrality and random walk percolation centrality, respectively. We find that the relative effectiveness of these strategies in reducing the total number of infections varies with the basic reproduction number of the pathogen, travel rates, structure of the travel network and vaccine availability. We conclude that when a pathogen has high spreading capacity, or when vaccine availability is limited, centrality-targeting strategies should be considered as an alternative to the more commonly used risk-targeting strategies.","output":"Evaluating strategies for spatial allocation of vaccines based on risk and centrality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, patients with chronic diseases faced many challenges like greater risk of Covid-19 and delay in treatment which increase the possibility of psychological problems in these individuals. In this regard, the present study was conducted to investigate the psychological consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic in this group of patients. METHODS: In this systematic review study, published articles on the psychological consequences of the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020 were reviewed. Keywords including Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), Psychological Implications, Epidemic, Mental Health, and Chronic diseases were searched in the title and abstract of articles published in reputable international scientific databases and all related English articles were listed and 30 qualified articles were reviewed. RESULTS: According to the collected data, loneliness increased stress and anxiety, and decreased sleep quality. Moreover, post-traumatic stress, panic attacks, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were the most important psychological consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic for people with chronic diseases. Female gender, old age, longer history of chronic disease, and lack of social support were associated with increased psychological problems. Increased fear and anxiety in caregivers and related health personnel were other results of the study. CONCLUSION: Many people with chronic illnesses have suffered from psychological problems during the outbreak of COVID-19. Furthermore, the extent of these problems depends on the characteristics of the chronic disease, and individuals' demographic and ecological characteristics, which emphasizes the need for designing individualized programs.","output":"Psychological implications of Coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in patients with chronic diseases: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrate a new method, using a universal array approach termed multiplex allele\\\\specific PCR\\\\based universal array (ASPUA), and applied it to the mutation detection of hereditary hearing loss. Mutations in many different genes may be the cause of hereditary hearing loss, a sensory defect disorder. Effective methods for genetic diagnosis are clearly needed to provide clinical management. Owing to the broad genetic basis of this condition, clinical assay of such a highly heterogeneous disorder is expensive and time consuming. In ASPUA, the allele discrimination reaction is carried out in solution by multiplex allele\\\\specific PCR and a universal solid phase array with different tag probes is used to display the PCR result. The purpose of developing the ASPUA platform was to utilize the rapidity and simplicity of the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) with the detection power of microarray hybridization. This is the first report of the combination of these two technologies, which allow for the completion of allele\\\\specific detection of 11 of the most frequent mutations causing hereditary hearing loss in under 5 hr.

Numerous computer-aided approaches have been devised for the early detection of hepatitis. In this study, we propose a method for the analysis and classification of cases of hepatitis-B virus ( HBV), hepatitis-C virus (HCV), and healthy subjects using Raman spectroscopy and a multiscale convolutional neural network (MSCNN). In particular, serum samples of HBV-infected patients (435 cases), HCV-infected patients (374 cases), and healthy persons (499 cases) are analyzed via Raman spectroscopy. The differences between Raman peaks in the measured serum spectra indicate specific biomolecular differences among the three classes. The dimensionality of the spectral data is reduced through principal component analysis. Subsequently, features are extracted, and then feature normalization is applied. Next, the extracted features are used to train different classifiers, namely MSCNN, a single-scale convolutional neural network, and other traditional classifiers. Among these classifiers, the MSCNN model achieved the best outcomes with a precision of 98.89%, sensitivity of 97.44%, specificity of 94.54%, and accuracy of 94.92%.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effects of miR-188-5p on cell proliferation and apoptosis and tumor growth, and its mechanism in pediatric APL patients. Materials and Methods: Survival-associated miRNAs or mRNAs from TCGA database associated with AML were identified via using the \\"survival R\\" package in R language. CCK8, clone formation, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays were used to detect the viability, proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and related gene expression in APL cell lines. The prognostic value of miR-188-5p was evaluated using a ROC curve. The tumorigenic ability of APL cell lines was determined using a nude mouse transplantation tumor experiment. Tumor cell apoptosis was determined by TUNEL assay in vivo. The target genes of miR-188-5p were predicted using the miRDB, miRTarBase, and TargetScan databases. A PPI network was constructed using STRING database and the hub gene was identified using the MCODE plug-in of the Cytoscape software. The DAVID database was used to perform GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. A luciferase reporter assay was used to demonstrate the binding of miR-188-5p to CD2AP. Results: miR-188-5p overexpression or CD2 associated protein (CD2AP) inhibition was significantly associated with poor survival in pediatric APL patients. Upregulation of miR-188-5p was identified in the blood of pediatric APL patients and cell lines. Increased expression of miR-188-5p also promoted the viability, proliferation, and cell cycle progression, and reduced the apoptosis of APL cells. Additionally, upregulation of miR-188-5p regulated the expressions of cyclinD1, p53, Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of miR-188-5p was 0.661. miR-188-5p overexpression increased the tumorigenic ability of APL and Ki67 expression, and reduced cell apoptosis in vivo. CD2AP was identified as the only overlapping gene from the list of miR-188-5p target genes and survival-related mRNAs of the TCGA database.

It has been suggested that menopause, and the change in hormones during menopausal transition, influences the development of these disorders. During menopausal transition, not only the hormone levels change, but also metabolism and inflammatory responses. Investigating the influence of menopausal changes, including protein change, on the development of degenerative disorders is difficult, because these changes occur slowly. However, identifying these changes is crucial to develop novel female-specific prevention strategies and therapies for these disorders. Therefore, we propose the use of an unique and novel human model to investigate the influence of menopause on the development of degenerative disorders by modelling a sudden menopause, in which we expect that menopausal-related changes will occur faster: the Females discontinuing Oral Contraceptives Use at Menopausal age (FOCUM) model. This model does not have the limitations in generalizability of animal models. Nor does it have the limitations of subsequent hormonal support, malignancy and its associated treatments that are pertinent to human models with a sudden menopause caused by ovariectomy.The aim of our study is to develop the FOCUM model as a disease model for the development of OA. We want to identify when changes, especially in proteins, occur after a sudden menopause and which of these changes are associated with the development of OA after two years. Furthermore, we want to explore if the model can also be used to learn more about the development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and tendinopathies. In this abstract we will report on the feasibility of our inclusion. Our aim is to include 50 female participants from the general population in and nearby Rotterdam within one year. Methods: Our study design is a pilot observational prospective cohort study with two years of follow-up. Our main questions for this pilot study are: will the inclusion of participants be feasible and what are the important time points to find changes in proteins? Females between 50 and 60 years of age, who are currently using a combined oral contraceptive and started oral contraceptive use before the age of 45, are recruited from pharmacies and (if necessary) general practices. In general, females are advised to stop oral contraceptive use at the age of 52. Females who are willing to stop oral contraceptive use at short term are invited to participate. Different measurements are performed before (T0 = 0 to 30 days) and after (T1 = 6 weeks;T2 = 6 months;T3 = 1 year;T4 = 2 years) stopping oral contraceptive use. At every time point of measurements a questionnaire is filled in, a normal photograph of both hands is taken and a sample of blood is drawn to measure hormones, proteins, glucose, cholesterol, DNA-methylation and immunological aspects of cells. At the first and final time point of measurements, also a physical examination, an radiograph of both hands, an MRI scan of one knee, a DXA-scan, and an ultrasound tissue characterization of one Achilles tendon are performed. To establish which time points of measurements are most relevant to find changes in proteins after hormone change, we will examine changes in serum levels of approximately 150 different inflammation and cardiometabolic related proteins by using the Olink-technology at different time points of measurements. At the first stage of this study, we will use the Principal Component Analysis on the change in protein levels over time. Thereafter, we will test for the association between principal components and hormone change. At the second stage of this study, we will relate these principal components to various OA outcomes. Results: In January 2020, we sent invitations to 108 local pharmacies to participate in this study. At that time, a total of 55 pharmacies were willing to participate. The participating pharmacies were asked to search in their own information system to identify all possible eligible subjects, based on age and oral contraceptive use, and to send an invitation letter in their name to these subjects. Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions we started sending these invitation letters by the end of June 2020, four months later than planned. Until now, we have sent 534 invitations from 26 pharmacies to possible eligible subjects. A total of 107 females replied positively and gave permission to provide them more information about the study. After giving information and screening for in- and exclusion criteria, we now have 25 eligible participants who gave informed consent. Of them, 16 participants have had their first (baseline) measurements of 2,5 hours at the Erasmus MC. With the 29 participating pharmacies left, we expect to reach the targeted number of 50 inclusions by February 2021 and to report about the first stage of this study. Conclusions: At this time, we have included half of our study population. So the inclusion of 50 female participants for this study within one year seems to be feasible. By performing different measurements before and after stopping oral contraceptive use, we will be able to investigate when and which menopausal changes occur and which of these changes can be related to OA. With this model we hope to learn more about the influence of menopause on the development of OA, but also of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, osteoporosis and tendinopathies, in order to develop new prevention strategies and therapies for these diseases.","output":"Accelerated menopausal changes as disease model for development of osteoarthritis, focum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To reduce the spread of COVID-19, several countries in Africa instituted countrywide lockdowns and other public health measures. Whereas lockdowns contributed to the control of the pandemic, there were concerns about the unintended consequences of these measures especially in the most vulnerable populations. We assessed unintended socio-economic and health consequences due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation measures among slum dwellers in Kampala to inform the on-going and future pandemic response strategies. METHODS: This was a mixed methods cross-sectional study conducted in Bwaise I and Bwaise III slums of Kawempe division, Kampala Uganda from October to December 2020. We used systematic sampling to randomly select 425 household heads for the face-to-face quantitative interviews. We also conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs) with slum dwellers and used photovoice among eight Community Health Workers (CHWs) to document unintended socio-economic and health consequences. Quantitative data were imported into STATA version 14.0 for analysis, while qualitative data were analysed thematically using NVivo version 12. Modified Poisson regression analysis was conducted to establish factors associated with impact on access to food. RESULTS: Most respondents reported limited access to food (71.1%; 302/425); disruption in education (77.1%; 270/350); drop in daily income and wages (86.1%; 329/382) and loss of employment (63.1; 125/198). Twenty five percent of the respondents (25.4%; 86/338) reported domestic violence as one of the challenges. Seven themes emerged from the qualitative findings on the impact of COVID-19 including: limited access to food; negative impact on childrens rights (child labour and teenage pregnancies) and education; poor housing and lack of accommodation; negative social behaviours; negative impact on family and child care; reduced income and employment; and negative impact on health and access to health care services. CONCLUSION: The slum dwellers of Bwaise I and Bwaise III experienced several negative socio-economic and health consequences of COVID-19 and its prevention measures that severely affected their wellbeing. Children experienced severe consequences such as child labour and teenage pregnancies among the girls. Response activities should be contextualised to different settings and protocols to protect the vulnerable groups in the community such as children and women should be developed and mainstreamed in response activities.","output":"Unintended socio-economic and health consequences of COVID-19 among slum dwellers in Kampala, Uganda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-compassion, sharing some commonalities with positive psychology 2.0 approaches, is associated with better mental health outcomes in diverse populations, including workers.

Therefore, this systematic review aimed to synthesize and evaluate the utility of self-compassion interventions targeting work-related well-being, as well as assess the methodological quality of relevant studies. Eligible articles were identified from research databases including ProQuest, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. The quality of non-randomized trials and randomized controlled trials was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality Assessment Table, respectively.

The Self-Compassion Scale or its short-form was used in almost all instances. Findings indicate that self-compassion training can improve self-compassion and other work-related well-being outcomes in working populations. However, in general, there is need for greater methodological quality in work-related self-compassion intervention studies to advance understanding regarding the applications and limitations of this technique in work contexts.

A negative correlation observed between the final number of infections and the slope of the logistic curve corroborates the result obtained long time ago via an extensive simulation study. There is both theoretical arguments and experimental evidence for the existence of such correlations. The flattening of the curve results in a retardation of the curve's midpoint, which entails an increase in the final number of infections. It is possible that more lives are lost at the end by this process.

Insulin undergoes conformational changes under certain stress conditions leading to amyloid fibrils. Fibrillation of insulin poses a problem in its long-term storage, reducing its efficacy in treating type II diabetes. The dissociation of insulin oligomer to monomer is the key step for the onset of fibrillation. The time course of insulin fibrillation at 62C using Thioflavin T fluorescence shows an increase in the lag time from 120 min without peptide to 236 min with peptide. Transmission electron micrographs show branched insulin fibrils in its absence and less inter-fibril association in its presence. Upon incubation at 62C and pH 2.6, insulin lost some -helical structure as seen by Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR), but if the peptide is added, secondary structure is almost fully maintained for 3 h, though lost partially at 4 h. FT-IR spectroscopy also shows that insulin forms the cross beta structure indicative of fibrils beyond 2 h, but in the presence of the peptide, -helix retention is seen till 4 h. Both size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering show that insulin primarily exists as trimer, whose conversion to a monomer is resisted by the peptide. Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance confirms that the hydrophobic residues in the peptide are in close contact with an insulin hydrophobic groove. Molecular dynamics simulations in conjunction with principal component analyses reveal how the peptide interrupts insulin fibrillation. In vitro hemolytic activity of the peptide showed insignificant cytotoxicity against HT1080 cells. The insulin aggregation is probed due to the inter play of two key residues, Phe(B24) and Tyr(B26) monitored from molecular dynamics simulations studies.

During crises, the dependence of pollution indicators on changes in GDP (GRP) and industrial production is higher than during periods of economic growth. During crisis years, there was a decrease in industrial pollution, the volume of atmospheric emissions and polluted wastewater, and, to a lesser extent, water consumption; conversely, vehicle emissions, the volume of toxic waste, the area of disturbed lands, and forest fires do not depend on the change in GRP. Only specific pollution parameters increase during crises. The integral index of anthropogenic impact depends less on the GRP dynamics than some indicators of the load on the natural environment. With a general trend towards a decrease in environmental stress, the group of regions with a critical level of impact is characterized by the greatest stability, while the group of regions with an insignificant level of pressure on the natural environment contracts. Differences in the sanitizing role of crises are due to their duration, depth, and structural features, as well as the mitigating effect of government support measures.

Hence, numerous trials and studies have scrutinized the analogies between SARS-CoV-2 and other corona viruses or the host-virus interactions and their similarities with immune system disorders. Still, the pathogenic mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 have been partially deciphered and the current therapies have not yet met the initial enthusiastic expectations. So far COVID-19 therapies have targeted various pathogenic mechanisms, namely the neutralization of ACE2 receptors or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes, the disruption of the endocytic pathways using hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, or anti-Janus kinase inhibitors, the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, immunosuppressive drugs or molecules acting on the immune response (corticoids, interferons, monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory cytokines, mesenchymal stem cells) and convalescent plasma administration together with numerous drugs with unproven effect against SARS-CoV-2 but with potential antiviral activities (antiretrovirals, antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, etc.).

At the same time a specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is a long-term solution requiring clinical validation and important investments together with appropriate strategies to promote the confidence in the safety of the new vaccine. The article revises the current state of SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic options but advises towards a more cautious and individualized treatment approach centred on the clinical features, immune particularities, and the risk-benefit balance.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Treatment Approaches: Numerous Options, No Certainty for a Versatile Virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) comprises ~50% of all CMT cases. CMT1A is a slowly progressive motor and sensory neuropathy that leads to significant disability. We aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) in Serbian patients with CMT1A and to assess sociodemographic and clinical features associated with their QoL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five genetically confirmed patients with CMT1A were included ?60% women [age 50.4  12.6 years, disease duration 22 (12.5C31.5) years]. SF-36, Medical Research Council (MRC) Sum Score, CMT Examination Score (CMTES), Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Krupp's Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) were used in the study. RESULTS: Regarding SF-36, Mental Health and Social Functioning were the scales with the best achievements, whereas Role Physical was the worst domain. Worse QoL in patients with CMT1A was associated with elder age (rho = ?0.34, p < 0.05), longer disease duration (rho = ?0.31, p < 0.05), more pronounced muscle weakness measured by MRC-SS (rho = 0.43, p < 0.01), presence of tremor (p < 0.05), worse CMTES (rho = ?0.68, p < 0.01), more severe disability in upper (rho = ?0.70, p < 0.01) and lower limbs (rho = ?0.61, p < 0.01) measured by ONLS scores, use of walking aids (p < 0.01), and with depression (p < 0.01) and fatigue (p < 0.01). Worse scores on CMTES (beta = ?0.43, p < 0.01), BDI (beta = ?0.39, p < 0.01), and FSS (beta = ?0.36, p < 0.01) were significant independent predictors of worse QoL in patients with CMT1A (adjusted R(2) = 0.77, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Besides impairment made directly by CMT1A itself, QoL in these patients was also strongly affected by the presence of depression and fatigue. Since CMT1A is still not a curable disease, it is of interest to identify factors associated with QoL that are amenable to treatment.","output":"Physical and Mental Aspects of Quality of Life in Patients With Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a generation of 'digital natives,' secondary students who were born from 2002 to 2010 have various approaches to acquiring digital knowledge. Digital literacy and resilience are crucial for them to navigate the digital world as much as the real world; however, these remain under-researched subjects, especially in developing countries. In Vietnam, the education system has put considerable effort into teaching students these skills to promote quality education as part of the United Nations-defined Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). This issue has proven especially salient amid the COVID19 pandemic lockdowns, which had obliged most schools to switch to online forms of teaching. This study, which utilizes a dataset of 1061 Vietnamese students taken from the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)'s \\"Digital Kids Asia Pacific (DKAP)\\" project, employs Bayesian statistics to explore the relationship between the students' background and their digital abilities. Results show that economic status and parents' level of education are positively correlated with digital literacy. Students from urban schools have only a slightly higher level of digital literacy than their rural counterparts, suggesting that school location may not be a defining explanatory element in the variation of digital literacy and resilience among Vietnamese students. Students' digital literacy and, especially resilience, also have associations with their gender. Moreover, as students are digitally literate, they are more likely to be digitally resilient. Following SDG4, i.e., Quality Education, it is advisable for schools, and especially parents, to seriously invest in creating a safe, educational environment to enhance digital literacy among students.","output":"How digital natives learn and thrive in the digital age: Evidence from an emerging economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to devastating repercussions on health care systems worldwide. This viral infection has a broad clinical spectrum broad (ranging from influenza-like disease, viral pneumonia, and hypoxemia to acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged intensive care unit stays). The prognostic impact of measuring viral load on nasopharyngeal swab specimens (by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) is yet to be elucidated. METHODS: Between March 3 and April 5, 2020, we conducted a retrospective study on a cohort of COVID-19 patients (mild or severe disease) who were hospitalized after presenting to the emergency department (ED) and had at least one positive nasopharyngeal swab during their hospital stay. We led our study at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg in the Greater East region of France, one of the pandemic's epicenters in Europe. RESULTS: We have collected samples from a cohort of 287 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who were included in our study. Nearly half of them (50.5%) presented a mild form of the disease, while the other half (49.5%) presented a severe form, requiring mechanical ventilation. Median (interquartile range) viral load on the initial upper respiratory swab at admission was 4.76 (3.29-6.06) log10 copies/reaction. When comparing survivors and nonsurvivors, this viral load measurement did not differ according to subgroups (p = 0.332). Additionally, we have found that respiratory viral load measurement was predictive of neither in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85 to 1.31, p = 0.637) nor disease severity (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.73 to 1.06, p = 0.167). CONCLUSION: Respiratory viral load measurement on the first nasopharyngeal swab (by RT-PCR) during initial ED management is neither a predictor of severity nor a predictor of mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Host response to this viral infection along with the extent of preexisting comorbidities might be more foretelling of disease severity than the virus itself.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs in the emergency department does not predict COVID-19 severity and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Following the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, a complete analysis of the characteristics of the deceased hospitalized patients was performed, to identify factors related to premature mortality and to compare patient profiles according to the epidemic periods.

RESULTS: Mean age was 80 years ( 11.1) and 10% of the deceased were younger than 65 years with specific comorbidities, e.g., genetic conditions, metastatic cancer, or massive obesity. Among the three clusters identified, two clusters (75% of deceased patients) include very elderly patients with numerous comorbidities, and differ by their proportion of dependent institutionalized patients. The third cluster is made up of younger patients with fewer but severe comorbidities. Deceased patients profiles varied according to the epidemic periods: during the first period (MarchCJune 2020), more patients were institutionalized. The second period (SeptemberCDecember2020) coincided with a higher mortality rate.

Nurses are often the first and sometimes only point of contact for people seeking healthcare following DFV incidents and are therefore well placed to identify and support these vulnerable people. The aim of this scoping review is to examine the English language studies of healthcare provided by nurses in primary healthcare settings to people experiencing domestic and family violence. Methods A scoping review of the following databases was undertaken between March-June 2021: CINAHL, Medline, and PubMed. Primary studies were included if written in English, published from 2000 onwards, and focused on the care provided by primary healthcare nurses to people experiencing DFV. A critical appraisal of included studies was conducted using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Results were synthesised narratively. Results Six studies were included, from the United States (n=2), United Kingdom (n=1), Sweden (n=2), and Brazil (n=1). Five studies were quantitative and one qualitative. A fundamental aspect of the healthcare provided by nurses, reported by all studies, was the screening of DFV. Other healthcare provided includes physical and mental health assessment and referral to other services, including sexual assault clinics, social supports, and law enforcement agencies. Findings suggest the level of DFV screening conducted by nurses is limited. Nurses knowledge of how to support people experiencing DFV was also reportedly limited. Two studies reported that nurses were unfamiliar with DFV practice guidelines and the existence and availability of support networks for people experiencing DFV. Conclusion Findings suggest inconsistency in primary healthcare nurses level of education, skill and knowledge, and detection of people experiencing DFV. As the largest healthcare professional discipline, nurses have frequent contact with people experiencing DFV. There is an urgent need for nurses to be better educationally prepared and more organisationally supported in order to adequately respond and provide healthcare to people experiencing DFV. Given that the number of people experiencing DFV has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is ever more important for nurses to be well equipped to identify and respond appropriately.","output":"A scoping review of the healthcare provided by nurses to people experiencing domestic violence in primary health care settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT In seeking to limit the number of new infections of COVID-19, governments around the world have implemented national lockdowns and guidelines about safe behaviours. Lockdown requires people to stay home and only leave when essential such as to purchase groceries and medication. In low- and middle-income countries, many of which have large proportions of the population living in precarity, lockdown forces millions of people to spend prolonged periods of time together in close proximity to one another and with limited resources. In many ways, efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 in densely populated communities with limited access to food, water and sanitation may seem counter-intuitive and even impossible under conditions of precarity. In this paper, we explore the barriers to implementation of lockdown rules in conditions of precarity. We conceptualise the structural barriers by drawing on the Theoretical Domains Framework to explain how these barriers influence adherence to lockdown rules. We argue that without sufficient support or intervention to help poor communities mitigate these structural barriers, adhering to lockdown rules is difficult, resulting in continued COVID-19 infections.","output":"Structural barriers to adhering to health behaviours in the context of the COVID-19 crisis: Considerations for low- and middle-income countries."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has so far unfolded diversely across the fifty United States of America, reflected both in different time progressions of infection\\"waves\\"and in magnitudes of local infection rates.

Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) produces potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory products including carbon monoxide. SARS-CoV-2 and influenza affect ECs in multiple vascular beds, including pulmonary tissue. The omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and its metabolites preserve EC function in a manner that may contribute to reduced incident cardiovascular events (REDUCE-IT). Currently, EPA is being tested in patients with or at risk for COVID-19. This study tested the effects of EPA on NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) release under conditions of inflammation using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the cytokine IL-6. We also measured expression of HO-1 after cell challenge with IL-6. METHODS: Human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-L) were pretreated with vehicle or EPA (40 M) in 2% FBS for 2 h, then challenged with either IL-6 (12 ng/ml) or LPS (200 ng/ml) for 24 h. Cells (including untreated controls) were stimulated with calcium ionophore to measure maximum production of NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) using tandem porphyrinic nanosensors. Proteomic analysis was performed using LC/MS to assess relative expression levels. Only significant (p< 0.05) changes in protein expression between treatment groups >1-fold were analyzed. RESULTS: HMVEC-L challenged with LPS and IL-6 showed a pronounced loss of NO release by 22% (p< 0.01) and 18% (p< 0.01), respectively, concomitant with an increase in ONOO- by 28% (p< 0.01) and 26% (p< 0.01), respectively. As a result, the [NO]/[ONOO-] ratio, a marker of eNOS coupling efficiency, decreased by 39% (p< 0.001) and 35% (p< 0.001) with LPS and IL-6, respectively. However, EPA increased this ratio by 39% (p< 0.01) in both LPS and IL-6 treated cells. EPA also caused a 5.7-fold (p = 4.4  10-38) increase in expression of HO-1 with IL-6. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that EPA improves NO bioavailability and reduces nitroxidative stress in pulmonary ECs during inflammation with LPS or IL-6. These studies indicate a protective effect of EPA on pulmonary ECs that may reduce inflammatory activation during sepsis, influenza, or advanced COVID-19 that may mediate many aspects of multiorgan system failure.","output":"Eicosapentaenoic acid increases endothelial function and Heme oxygenase-1 in pulmonary inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has wrought widespread devastation upon children and families across the United States, widening existing health disparities and inequities that disproportionately affect communities of color.

Moreover, the present study aims to add to the understanding of the role of personal resources in the Job Demands-Resources model (JD-R) by examining whether personal resources-such as the professionals' orientation towards patient engagement-may also strengthen the impact of job resources and mitigate the impact of job demands. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 532 healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. It adopted the Job-Demands-Resource Model to study the determinants of professional's burnout. An integrative model describing how increasing job demands experienced by this specific population are related to burnout and in particular to emotional exhaustion symptoms was developed.

The mean operative time (309 vs. 324 min, p = 0.755) and mean number of dissected lymph nodes (12.6 vs. 10.2, p = 0.361) were not significantly different between the LS and OS groups. The intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower (104 vs. 584 mL, p = 0.002) and the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter (9.1 vs. 21.6 days, p = 0.002) for LS patients than for those in the OS group. In the LS group, one patient developed postoperative pneumonia, but all patients survived without recurrence after a mean follow-up of 37 months.

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conceptualized to examine the relationship between whitening toothpastes and surface roughness as well as microhardness of human teeth and to clarify the evidence base available around this relationship by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in this topic area, looking at in vitro randomized control trials. Methods: Criteria for including studies in the review were done based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes and study and studies were identified from electronic databases. Covidence? was used for data screening and data extraction. The CONSORT tool was used for checking relevant content and methodology used in each of the papers reviewed. Systematic review was done followed by meta-analysis, using Review Manager. Results: A total of 125 articles were obtained on key word search. After duplicate removal and title screening, 17 articles were eligible for full text review. Finally, 7 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted on 4 studies. The forest plot for surface roughness showed that that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with surface roughness value being higher in the intervention group. The forest plot for microhardness showed that the meta-analytic effect was statistically significant with the microhardness value being lesser in the intervention group. Conclusions: Although whitening toothpastes typically can lighten tooth color by about one or two shades, there is some evidence to show that these toothpastes also affect the mineral content of teeth by increasing surface roughness and reducing microhardness.

However, the predictors and prognostic impact of HAVB in the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) era remain poorly understood. We sought to describe the characteristics and predictors of HAVB in patients undergoing primary PCI in STEMI and to assess the prognostic significance of HAVB in the contemporary reperfusion era. The present analysis includes 3,115 patients presenting with STEMI from the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial who underwent primary PCI. Outcomes were examined according to the presence of HAVB on a presenting electrocardiogram, as interpreted by an independent electrocardiography core laboratory. HAVB (second-degree Mobitz II or third-degree atrioventricular block) was present at baseline in 46 patients (1.5%). Independent predictors of HAVB included increased age, diabetes mellitus, right coronary artery occlusion, sum of ST-segment deviation, and baseline Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 0/1. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow 3 was restored in 83.7% and 91.5% of patients with versus without baseline HAVB respectively (p = 0.06). Mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with versus without HAVB at 30-day, 1-, and 3-year follow-ups (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.83, 95% CI 1.40 to 10.48; unadjusted HR 4.37, 95% CI 2.09 to 9.38 and unadjusted HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.31 to 5.91, respectively).

When occupied by linoleic acid, it reduces infectivity, by locking the spike in a less infectious conformation. Here, we use dynamical-nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations to compare the response of spike variants to linoleic acid removal. These simulations show that the fatty acid site is coupled to functional regions of the protein, some of them far from the site (e.g. in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, the furin cleavage site located in position 679-685 and the fusion peptide-surrounding regions) and identify the allosteric networks involved in these connections. Comparison of the response of the original ( Wuhan) spike with four variants: Alpha, Delta, Delta plus and Omicron BA.1 show that the variants differ significantly in their response to linoleic acid removal. The allosteric connections to the fatty acid site on Alpha are generally similar to the original protein, except for the receptor-binding motif and S71-R78 region which show a weaker link to the FA site. In contrast, Omicron is the most affected variant exhibiting significant differences in the receptor-binding motif, N-terminal domain, V622-L629 and the furin cleavage site. These differences in allosteric modulation may be of functional relevance, e.g. in differences in transmissibility and virulence.

METHODS: Between April and May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, electronic survey on remote systems use before and during the COVID-19 pandemic through the European reference center for rare and complex epilepsies (EpiCARE) network, the International and the French Leagues Against Epilepsy, and the International and the French Child Neurology Associations. After descriptive statistical analysis, we compared the results of France, China, and Italy. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-two respondents from 35 countries completed the survey. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 63.4% had experienced remote systems for clinical care. During the pandemic, the use of remote clinics, either institutional or personal, significantly increased (p < 10(?4)). Eighty-three percent used remote systems with video, either institutional (75%) or personal (25%).

A control PU using 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) as a chain extender was synthesized similarly and designated as PU-BDO. The chemical structure of the two PUs was verified by FT-IR and 1H-NMR. The PU-DMPA had a lower molecular weight than the PU-BDO (~16,700 Da vs. ~78,600 Da). The melting enthalpy of the PU-DMPA was greater than that of the PU-BDO. Both the PUs exhibited elastomeric behaviors with a comparable elongation at break (=L/L0= 13.2). The PU-DMPA had a higher initial modulus (19.8 MPa vs. 8.7 MPa) and a lower linear modulus (0.7 MPa vs. 1.2 MPa) and ultimate strength (9.5 MPa vs. 13.8 MPa) than the PU-BDO.

Using a combination of rigorous AI-guided computation and experiments, we show that COVID-19 resembles idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) at a fundamental level; they share prognostic signatures in the circulating monocytes and the lung [Viral pandemic (ViP) and IPF signatures], an IL15-centric cytokine storm and the pathognomonic AT2 cytopathic changes, e.g., DNA damage, arrest in a transient, damage-induced progenitor state, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These changes were induced in SARS-CoV-2-challenged adult lung organoids and hamsters and reversed with effective anti-CoV-2 therapeutics in the hamsters. Mechanistically, using protein-protein interaction (PPI)-network approaches, we pinpointed ER stress as an early shared trigger for both COVID-19 and IPF. We validated the same in the lungs of deceased subjects with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamster lungs by immunohistochemistry. We confirmed that lungs from tg-mice, in which ER stress is induced specifically in the AT2 cells, faithfully recapitulate the host immune response and alveolar cytopathic changes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2. Thus, like IPF, COVID-19 may be driven by injury-induced ER stress that culminates into progenitor state arrest and SASP in AT2 cells. The ViP gene signatures in monocytes may help prognosticate those at highest risk of fibrosis.

In this article, we aimed to describe uniportal VATS lobectomy that was conventionally performed in an Eastern center, which might help facilitate a good beginning in practice this technique. METHODS The indications of uniportal VATS lobectomy are merely equal, if not the same, to multiportal VATS lobectomy. All patients would receive a combination of epidural and general anesthesia, and were provided with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) postoperatively. Generally, the patient was kept in a folding knife gesture (with the cranial side slightly raised up and caudal side pushed down) in lateral decubitus position. RESULTS In uniportal VATS lobectomy, the geographical view differed from multiportal VATS, while the thoracic cavity required carefully exploration to identify any unexpected invasion or metastasis. Since the incision was located at the anterior axillary line close to the anterior part of the hilar, the posterior part of the hilar, and diaphragm were far from the surgical incision.

Decisions to employ endoscopy should be based on the institutional conditions and aims of endoscopy. All endoscopic staff need to wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). The endoscope and other devices should be cleaned and disinfected after procedures in accordance with the relevant guidelines. Optimal management of the endoscopy unit is required. Endoscopy for infected patients or those with suspected infection demands exceptional caution. When a patient who undergoes endoscopy is later found to have COVID-19, the members of staff involved are considered exposed to the virus and must not work for at least 14 days if their PPE is considered insufficient. When PPE resources are limited, some equipment may be used continuously throughout a shift as long as it is not contaminated. Details of the aforementioned protective measures are described.","output":"Clinical Questions and Answers on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy during the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For pandemic influenza planning, realistic estimates of personal protective equipment (PPE) and antiviral medication required for hospital healthcare workers (HCWs) are vital.

This was an observational and multicenter study that included 84 patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 recruited during the first pandemic wave in Spain (March-June 2020). Patients were stratified according to disease severity: hospitalized patients admitted to the clinical wards without requiring critical care and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). An additional study was completed including ICU nonsurvivors and survivors. Plasma miRNA profiling was performed using reverse transcription polymerase quantitative chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Predictive models were constructed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Ten circulating miRNAs were dysregulated in ICU patients compared to ward patients. LASSO analysis identified a signature of three miRNAs (miR-148a-3p, miR-451a and miR-486-5p) that distinguishes between ICU and ward patients [AUC (95% CI) = 0.89 (0.81-0.97)]. Among critically ill patients, six miRNAs were downregulated between nonsurvivors and survivors. A signature based on two miRNAs (miR-192-5p and miR-323a-3p) differentiated ICU nonsurvivors from survivors [AUC (95% CI) = 0.80 (0.64-0.96)]. The discriminatory potential of the signature was higher than that observed for laboratory parameters such as leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) or D-dimer [maximum AUC (95% CI) for these variables = 0.73 (0.55-0.92)]. miRNA levels were correlated with the duration of ICU stay. Specific circulating miRNA profiles are associated with the severity of COVID-19.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in China, using a random sampling method (February 6C25, 2020). Self-reported questionnaires were conducted online included the Perceived Threat Avoidability of COVID-19 Scale, COVID-19-specific Wishful Thinking Scale, COVID-19-specific Protective Behaviors Scale, and the Hamilton Psychogenic Anxiety Scale. The data were analyzed using Structural equation modeling and Bootstrapping procedure. RESULTS: A total of 2922 samples were collected in this study. Perceived threat avoidability of COVID-19 is negatively related to psychic anxiety ( = ?0.158, p< 0.001), and both COVID-19-specific wishful thinking ( = ?0.006, p = 0.029, 95% CI: [?0.012, ?0.001]) and protective behaviors ( = ?0.029, p< 0.001, 95% CI: [?0.043, ?0.018]) mediate this relationship.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of the lockdown measures on air quality and pollutant emissions in Valencia, Spain. For this reason, we determined if there was a significant difference in the concentration levels of different particulate matter (PM) sizes, PM10, PM2.5, and NOx, NO2, NO, and O3, between the period of restrictions in 2020 and the same period in 2019. Our findings indicated that PM pollutant levels during the lockdown period were significantly different from the same period of the previous year, even if there is variability in the different local areas. The highest variations reduction in the PM10 and PM2.5 levels were observed for the Valncia Centre, Valncia Avd Francia, and Valncia Pista de Silla (all of the urban traffic type) in which there was a reduction of 58%-42%, 56%-53%, and 60%-41% respectively. Moreover, consistent with recent studies, we observed a significant reduction in nitric oxide levels in all the air monitoring stations. In all seven monitoring stations, it was observed, in 2020, NOx, NO2, and NO concentrations decreased by 48.5%-49.8%-46.2%, 62.1%-67.4%-45.7%, 37.4%-35.7%-35.3%, 60.7%-67.7%-47.1%, 65.5%-65.8%-63.5%, 60.0%-64.5%-41.3%, and 60.4%-61.6%-52.5%, respectively. Lastly, overall O3 levels decreased during the lockdown period, although this phenomenon was more closely related to weather conditions. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the meteorological conditions in 2019 and 2020.

This study aimed to evaluate the value of retrieval of HCV-RNA positive lost to follow-up (LTFU) individuals for treatment (ReLink-C strategy) and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. ReLink-C involved a retrospective search in microbiology databases of the Barcelona North Health Area (450,000 inhabitants) to identify and retrieve HCV-RNA positive individuals LTFU. The search encompassed two periods (pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19) and the impact of the pandemic on this strategy was assessed. A Markov model estimated lifetime cases of liver complications, liver-related mortality, and associated costs to compare ReLink-C to no intervention. In total, 1591 HCV-RNA positive individuals were identified during the overall study period; 914 were selected for retrieval and 166 for contact. After 5 calls, 104 individuals were located and 51 agreed to a visit. Ultimately, 41 started and completed DAA treatment.

A segmented regression model was used to estimate the trajectory of HHP rates in the ten weeks leading up to a COVID-19-related milestone event (eg, school closures) and for ten weeks after. RESULTS: Three effects emerged, all of which were significant at p < .01. Average HHP rates increased from 46% to 56% in the months preceding pandemic-related school closures. This was followed by a 6% upward shift at the time school closures occurred. HHP rates remained over 60% for four weeks before declining to 54% at the end of the study period.

Many epithelial changes are driven by the type 2 cytokine IL-13, but the effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection are unknown. OBJECTIVES: We sought to discover how IL-13 and other cytokines affect expression of genes encoding SARS-CoV-2-associated host proteins in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and determine whether IL-13 stimulation alters susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We used bulk and single cell RNA-seq to identify cytokine-induced changes in SARS-CoV-2-associated gene expression in HBECs. We related these to gene expression changes in airway epithelium from individuals with mild-moderate asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We analyzed effects of IL-13 on SARS-CoV-2 infection of HBECs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Transcripts encoding 332 of 342 (97%) SARS-CoV-2-associated proteins were detected in HBECs (1 RPM in 50% samples). 41 (12%) of these mRNAs were regulated by IL-13 (>1.5-fold change, FDR < 0.05). Many IL-13-regulated SARS-CoV-2-associated genes were also altered in type 2 high asthma and COPD. IL-13 pretreatment reduced viral RNA recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and decreased dsRNA, a marker of viral replication, to below the limit of detection in our assay. Mucus also inhibited viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: IL-13 markedly reduces susceptibility of HBECs to SARS-CoV-2 infection through mechanisms that likely differ from those activated by type I interferons.

During COVID-19, routine face-to-face simulation delivery in our Trust has stopped, begging the question of how we can continue to support our colleagues clinical knowledge and skills, bearing in mind that many are now shielding at home.ObjectivesOur solution was to design paediatric emergency simulated scenarios and deliver them virtually to remote learners via video conferencing software, as we believed that this could lead to both effective teaching and learning. We set out to explore the different ways in which this could feasibly be achieved, and through feedback from our learners, establish which methods were most effective. Our goal was the ensure real-time interactivity through engagement from the learners, as this has been a criticism of observing and our involvement with remote simulation in the past.MethodsWe developed 3 distinct forms of virtual simulation:1. Simulation By-Proxy: The set-up was as per traditional face-to-face simulation, with a high-fidelity manikin in a hospital bed surrounded by medical equipment and visible monitoring. The remote learners were shown a webcam view and were asked to work as a team to clearly instruct an in-situ confederate nurse and doctor (with no initiative of their own) to manage a complex child with pneumonia and sepsis.2. Real-time Input: No manakin or bed-space were used. Remote learners were shown a power-point-type presentation which described an evolving clinical case of a paediatric burn. Integrated software allowed real-time group participation in word clouds, prioritisation tasks and multiple-choice questions with anonymous results visible within the presentation (like asking the audience in Who Wants To Be A Millionaire).3. Direct Facilitation: No manakin or bed-space were used. Remote learners were shown a power-point presentation which described an evolving clinical case of paediatric toxic shock syndrome. Learners were numbered upwards from junior to senior, and took turns directing the care of the patient sequentially. Slides showed clinical images such as bedside monitoring, blood gases and laboratory blood results. The scenario was proactively facilitated by the host as the clinical reasoning and management became more complex.ResultsOverall, virtual simulation was very well received in a time when learning has become much more accessible but also more didactic. Our feedback questionnaire from 12 remote learners showed they both enjoyed and engaged with the scenarios, and particular highlights included capturing the sense and pressure of an emergency in methods 1 and 3, passing team leadership on as a baton in method 3, but also the anonymity and group interactivity of method 2.

Despite 86 of 91 cases (94.5%) in South Africa with sequenced virus having the 20H/501Y.V2 variant, vaccine efficacy was 52.0% and 64.0% against moderate to severeCcritical Covid-19 with onset at least 14 days and at least 28 days after administration, respectively, and efficacy against severeCcritical Covid-19 was 73.1% and 81.7%, respectively. Reactogenicity was higher with Ad26.COV2.S than with placebo but was generally mild to moderate and transient. The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the two groups. Three deaths occurred in the vaccine group (none were Covid-19Crelated), and 16 in the placebo group (5 were Covid-19Crelated). CONCLUSIONS: A single dose of Ad26.COV2.S protected against symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and was effective against severeCcritical disease, including hospitalization and death. Safety appeared to be similar to that in other phase 3 trials of Covid-19 vaccines.

Thus, a characterization of the concentration, size, fate, and toxicity of AgNPs under environmental conditions is required. In this study, we present the characterization and optimization of an asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) system coupled with UV/Vis spectrophotometer and dynamic light scattering (DLS) detector as a powerful tool for the size separation and multi-parameter characterization of AgNPs in complex matrices. The hyphenated AF4-UV/Vis-DLS system was first characterized using individual injections of the different size fractions. We used electrostatically stabilized AgNPs of 20-, 50-, and 80-nm nominal diameters coated with lipoic acid. We investigated the effect of applied cross-flows, carrier solutions, focus times, and quantity of injected particles on the nature of the AF4 fractograms and on the integrity of the AgNPs. Best size separation of a 1:1 mixture of 20- and 80-nm AgNPs was achieved using cross-flows of 0.5 and 0.7 mL/min with 1 mM NaCl and 0.05% v/v Mucasol as carrier solutions.

Despite the danger of infection during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Wuhan, many patients still need surgical treatment. Most elective surgeries were delayed because of the public health emergency. However, when patients have life-threatening emergencies or illnesses, surgeries are often needed as soon as possible. Moreover, due to hospital overcrowding during the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare professionals initially struggled to address the issue due to a lack of experience. This is especially true for day surgery centers with higher patient mobility. Methods. We remodeled pathways to separate patients and medical personnel to minimize the COVID-19 infection rate. Further, strategies for medical staff education and potential patient education, ward disinfection and maintenance, setup with 3 more screening stations, patient and companion management, medical staff management, and perioperative management were implemented before starting elective day surgery. Results. From February 11 to March 11 in 2020, 202 day surgeries were performed. These were all elective surgeries and included ultrasound-guided Mammotome biopsy, endoscopic polypectomy, hernia repair, pediatric surgeries, cholecystectomy, choledochoscopy, radical mastectomy, percutaneous transhepatic cholangial drainage, liver biopsy, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, laparoscopic resection of colon cancer, colostomy apotheosis, and varicose vein surgery. On days 7, 14, and 30 after discharge, no postoperative complications were reported or infection of COVID-19 cases was reported. Conclusions. Using scientific and well-designed protocols, day surgery can ensure quality surgical care with while ensuring medical safety during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Using targeted recombination we previously demonstrated that the S gene of the highly neurovirulent MHV-4 conferred a dramatic increase in neurovirulence to the mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59. To identify the genetic determinants of neurovirulence within the MHV-4 spike, we generated isogenic recombinant viruses containing various MHV-4/MHV-A59 chimeric spike genes, and studied their phenotypes in vivo. The MHV-4/MHV-A59 chimeric spike genes consisted of either reciprocal exchanges between the S1 and S2 spike subunits, or smaller exchanges specifically in the hyper-variable region (HVR) of S1. The chimeric spike gene containing recombinants all exhibited efficient replication in vitro, yet many were severely attenuated for virulence in vivo. Furthermore, these attenuated recombinants exhibited decreased titers of infectious virus in the brain relative to the parental recombinant viruses containing the full-length MHV-4 or MHV-A59 spike genes. This is the first report that compares the neurovirulence and pathogenesis of isogenic viruses with defined alterations in the MHV spike protein. From these studies, it appears that the interactions of multiple regions of the MHV spike, including the HVR, act in concert to allow for efficient infection of and virulence in the murine central nervous system.","output":"Multiple regions of the murine coronavirus spike glycoprotein influence neurovirulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite evidence that firearm access in the home is a strong risk factor for firearm injury, firearms are owned more often for self-protection than for any other reason.

METHODS This study employed a cross-over design in healthy female volunteers. Twenty-five milligrams of melatonin was administered intravenously, intravesically, rectally, transdermally, and vaginally. Blood samples were collected at specified time points up to 24 h following intravenous, intravesical, rectal, and vaginal administration, and up to 48 h following transdermal administration. Plasma melatonin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. Sedation was evaluated by a simple reaction-time test, and sleepiness was assessed by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Adverse events were registered for each route of administration. RESULTS Ten participants were included. We documented a mean (SD) time to maximal concentration of 51 (29) min for intravesical, 24 (20) min for rectal, 21 (8) h for transdermal, and 147 (56) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) elimination half-life was 47 (6) min for intravenous, 58 (7) min for intravesical, 60 (18) min for rectal, 14.6 (11.1) h for transdermal, and 129 (17) min for vaginal administration. The mean (SD) bioavailability was 3.6 (1.9)% for intravesical, 36.0 (28.6)% for rectal, 10.0 (5.7)% for transdermal, and 97.8 (31.7)% for vaginal administration. No significant changes in reaction times were observed following administration of melatonin by any of the administration routes. Increased tiredness was documented following transdermal administration only. No serious adverse effects were documented. CONCLUSION Rectally and vaginally administered melatonin may serve as relevant alternatives to standard oral melatonin therapy. Transdermal delivery of melatonin displayed an extended absorption and can be applied if prolonged effects are intended. Intravesical administration displayed, as expected, a very limited bioavailability.

METHODS: An online survey was nationally distributed between 01/09/2020 and 29/10/2020 to registered UK ophthalmologists. Participants indicating a surgical hiatus of 8 weeks or more were included. RESULTS: 232 of 264 responses were analysed. Covid-19 was the most frequent reason for a surgical hiatus (median 15 weeks). Perceived operating difficulties were found in 29.1%. Transient anxiety (51.7%), reduced confidence, and perceived increased surgical time were commonplace.

Eyesi(?) and online videos were the most available and accessed pre-return resources. Childcare was five times more likely to present as a barrier to resource access for females than males. CONCLUSIONS: Technical skills fade such as capsulorhexis difficulties were commonly perceived by trainee surgeons in addition to transient anxiety, reported in more than half of all surgeons following a hiatus as short as 8 weeks.

METHODS: Using a classical epidemiologic framework and parameters estimated from literature published between February 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020, we modeled two non-pharmacologic interventions - shelter-in-place and digital contact tracing - to curb spread of SARS-CoV-2. For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, the number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated. RESULTS: Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in a greater than 90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated. CONCLUSION: Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.","output":"Universal Shelter-in-Place Versus Advanced Automated Contact Tracing and Targeted Isolation: A Case for 21st-Century Technologies for SARS-CoV-2 and Future Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied variability in General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) awareness in relation to digital experience in the 28 European countries of EU27-UK, through secondary analysis of the Eurobarometer 91.2 survey conducted in March 2019 (N = 27,524). Education, occupation, and age were the strongest sociodemographic predictors of GDPR awareness, with little influence of gender, subjective economic well-being, or locality size. Digital experience was significantly and positively correlated with GDPR awareness in a linear model, but this relationship proved to be more complex when we examined it through a typological analysis.

Nonetheless, the TB-related safety of biologics such as adalimumab and secukinumab remains elusive in areas with high TB risk. According to the World Tuberculosis Report 2021, China is the country with the second highest TB burden, but data on TB conversion are also limited. Thus, we performed a retrospective, single-center study to profile the TB infection status conversion ratio among psoriasis patients treated with adalimumab and secukinumab in China. METHODS: Patients were enrolled between April 2019 and February 2021 from West China Hospital, Sichuan University. Baseline and relevant clinical information were summarized, and proper statistical analysis was used under different conditions. RESULTS: Five (5.43%) patients suffered TB conversion in the adalimumab group, two of whom developed active TB within the first 6 months. In the secukinumab group, four (5.26%) patients had TB positive conversion with no reports of active TB. CONCLUSION: Our data show a relatively high rate of TB conversion among these psoriasis patients after mean treatment duration of 17.13 months. We recommend that, in patients who receive adalimumab, TB be reevaluated after the first 3 months and then monitored semiannually for the next 2 years. For patients treated with secukinumab, annual examination is sufficient.","output":"The Tuberculosis Positive Conversion Rate Among Psoriasis Patients Treated with Adalimumab and Secukinumab: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Immunotherapy is revolutionising the treatment of patients diagnosed with melanoma and other cancers. The first immune checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab (targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)), showed a survival advantage over standard chemotherapy. Subsequently the anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab were shown to be more effective than ipilimumab. Ipilimumab combined with nivolumab gives an incremental gain in overall survival compared with nivolumab alone but increases the risk of severe, potentially life-threatening toxicities. In contrast to ipilimumab monotherapy, anti-PD-1 antibodies are licensed to be continued until disease progression. Follow-up of patients recruited to the first trials evaluating 2 years of pembrolizumab showed that three-quarters of responding patients continue responding after stopping treatment. Suggestive of early response, we hypothesised that continuing anti-PD-1 treatment beyond 1 year in progression-free patients may be unnecessary and so designed the DANTE trial. METHODS: DANTE is a multicentre, randomised, phase III, non-inferiority trial to evaluate the duration of anti-PD-1 therapy in patients with metastatic (unresectable stage III and stage IV) melanoma. It uses a two-stage recruitment strategy, registering patients before they complete 1 year of first-line anti-PD-1 +/? CTLA-4 therapy and randomising eligible patients who have received 12 months of treatment and are progression-free at 1 year. At randomisation, 1208 patients are assigned (1:1) to either 1) continue anti-PD-1 treatment until disease progression/ unacceptable toxicity/ for at least 2 years in the absence of disease progression/ unacceptable toxicity or 2) to stop treatment. Randomisation stratifies for baseline prognostic factors. The primary outcome is progression-free survival at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and then, 6-monthly for up to 4-years. Secondary outcomes collected at all timepoints include overall survival, response-rate and duration and safety, with quality of life and cost-effectiveness outcomes collected 3-monthly for up to 18-months. Sub-studies include a qualitative analysis of patient acceptance of randomisation and sample collection to inform future translational studies into response/ toxicity biomarkers. DISCUSSION: DANTE is a unique prospective trial investigating the optimal duration of anti-PD-1 therapy in metastatic melanoma patients. Outcomes will inform future use of these high burden drugs.

First, a desk research of official sources was carried out to learn about the strategies of the four countries under study: Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, and Peru. Secondly, eight focus groups were conducted with primary school teachers from public and private institutions to learn about their perception of their own and their students' media competencies, the impact of the pandemic on their practices and needs, and the emerging challenges in this crisis. The results shed light on the need for relevant ICT training from a media literacy perspective, and strategies to address connectivity gaps, lack of adequate environments and work overload.

Because COVID-19 is primarily manifesting as an acute respiratory illness with interstitial and alveolar pneumonia, the possibility of viral invasions into the other organs cannot be disregarded. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been associated with various viral infections including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and HIV. The prevalence and risks of AKI during the course of COVID-19 have been described in few studies. However, the existing literature demonstrate great disparity across findings amid variations in methodology and population. This article underscores the propensity of AKI among COVID-19 patients, limitations of the exiting evidence, and importance of timely identification during the case management. The prevalence of AKI is variable across the studies ranging from 4.7% to 81%. Evidence suggest old age, comorbidities, ventilator support, use of vasopressors, black race, severe infection, and elevated levels of baseline serum creatinine and d-dimers are independent risk factors of COVID-19 associated with AKI. COVID-19 patients with AKI also showed unsatisfactory renal recovery and higher mortality rate as compared with patients without AKI. These findings underscore that AKI frequently occurs during the course of COVID-19 infection and requires early stratification and management.","output":"Stratification of Acute Kidney Injury in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has evolved into a pandemic of unprecedented scale.

These peptides were designed to retain the &#945;-helical character of the natural structure, to enhance binding affinity, and to display a better solubility profile compared to other designed peptides available in the literature. We employed different docking strategies (PATCHDOCK and ZDOCK) followed by a double-step refinement process (FIBERDOCK) to rank our peptides, followed by stability analysis/evaluation of the interaction profile of the best docking predictions using a 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and a further binding affinity analysis by molecular mechanics with generalized Born and surface area (MM/GBSA) method. Our most promising stapled peptides presented a stable profile and could retain important interactions with the RBD in the presence of the E484K RBD mutation. We predict that these peptides can bind to the viral RBD with similar potency to the control NYBSP-4 (a 30-mer experimentally proven peptide inhibitor).

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has now spread throughout world. There is a serious need to find potential therapeutic agents. The 3C-like protease (Mpro/6LU7) is an attractive molecular target for rational anti-CoV drugs METHODS: The tertiary structure of COVID-19 Mpro was obtained from a protein data bank repository, and molecular docking screening was performed by Molegro Virtual Docker, ver. 6, with a grid resolution of 0.30 ?. Docking scores (DOS) are representative of calculated ligand-receptor (protein) interaction energy; therefore, more negative scores mean better binding tendency. Another docking study was then applied on each of the selected drugs with the best ligands separately and using a more accurate RMSD algorithm. RESULTS: The docking of COVID-19 major protease (6LU7) with 17 selected drugs resulted in four FDA approved viral antiprotease drugs (Temoporfin, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, Ritonavir) showing the best docking scores. Among these 4 compounds, Temoporfin exhibited the best DOS (-202.88) and the best screened ligand with COVID-19 Mpro, followed by Simeprevir (-201.66), Cobicistat (-187.75), and Ritonavir (-186.66). As the best screened ligand, Temoporfin could target the Mpro with 20 different conformations, while Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Ritonavir make 14, 10, and 10 potential conformations at the binding site, respectively. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that the four selected FDA approved drugs can be potent inhibitors against COVID-19; among them, Temoporfin may be more potent for the treatment of the disease. Based on the findings, it is recommended that in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations be conducted to determine the effectiveness of these drugs against COVID-19.","output":"Computation screening and molecular docking of FDA approved viral protease inhibitors as a potential drug against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spike proteins, 1200 amino acids, are divided into two nearly equal parts, S1 and S2.

Current levels of low fertility have important implications for the economy. To assess fertility trends, demographers often look at fertility expectations. Using this metric suggests no cause for concern. Women in their early 30s today, when first asked about their childbearing expectations in their early 20s, expected to have more than two children, similar to previous cohorts. But todays 30-year-olds are much further from their 20-24 expectations than previous cohorts. And a number of trends have emerged in recent years that could suggest lower fertility. This project aims to shed light on whether women are likely to catch up to their fertility expectations and what factors influence their ability to do so. The analysis uses a regression framework to examine factors that drive fertility after age 30 for an older cohort of women surveyed in the NLSY79. The results are then used to predict the completed fertility for the younger cohort of women surveyed in the NLSY97, who are in their early- to mid-30s and still in their childbearing years. The paper found that: ? Fertility expectations are the primary driver of achieved fertility for non-college graduates. ? For college-educated women, other factors such as religion, marital status, and career length affect whether they achieve their fertility expectations. ? Women in the NLSY97 (born in 1980-1984) are projected to have a total of 1.96 children. ? This means that the gap between childbearing expectations in their early 20s and completed fertility will increase to 0.48, much higher than historical averages of 0.30. The policy implications of the findings are: ? While the results seem to suggest that the current 1.71 TFR is capturing tempo effects from delayed childbearing, long-run fertility may be lower than 1.96 for several reasons. ? The results are based on the 1980-1984 cohort, but younger cohorts may have fewer children because they have lower fertility expectations and face more economic uncertainty. ? The gap might also grow since COVID-19 is likely to place downward pressure on fertility, both for the cohort studied and for younger women. ? Therefore, while the current 1.71 TFR may reflect delayed fertility, actual completed fertility, especially for younger cohorts, might be lower than 1.96.","output":"Will Women Catch Up to Their Fertility Expectations?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Individuals with lateral epicondylalgia (LE) have delayed upper limb reaction time (RT); however, it is unknown if the mechanisms of this dysfunction are related to neural processing or the affected forearm muscles. The aim of this study was to examine the timing of processes that occur before and after forearm muscles are activated during the RT task. METHODS Eleven LE (42  11 yr) and 11 healthy controls (42  11 yr) performed rapid wrist extension in response to an audio cue. Intramuscular EMG was obtained from extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum communis (EDC), extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU), and anconeus. Premotor time (PMT) was the duration from an audio cue to the onset of muscle activity, and motor time (MT) was the onset of muscle activity to the onset of wrist extension. Standard clinical assessments of LE were also performed. RESULTS RT was significantly slower (33; 95% CI, 1-66 ms) in the LE group. There were no group differences in PMT and the order of muscle activation. Instead, the MT of ECRB (18; 95% CI, 6-31 ms), EDC (12; 95% CI, 1-23 ms), ECU (28; 95% CI, 9-46 ms), and anconeus (33; 95% CI, 11-56 ms) showed significant delay in LE group. Regression analyses revealed that the duration of LE could predict RT, ECRB, and anconeus PMT, whereas cold pain threshold predicted ECRB MT. CONCLUSIONS Delayed RT in LE was predominantly caused by deficits in ECRB and EDC MT. This study provides preliminary evidence that in the people with longer LE symptoms, duration appeared to have faster RT, although confirmation of this finding is required before firm conclusions can be drawn.","output":"Muscle Activity during Rapid Wrist Extension in People with Lateral Epicondylalgia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Around the world, there will be one new case of dementia every 3 seconds. 152 million people are worldwide living with dementia in 2050, by then 2 billion people will be over 60 years of age.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed by disk diffusion using a panel of 16 antimicrobials. In addition, isolates were screened for the presence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance genes mcr-1 to mcr-5. Samples from 20 (12.4%) of the camels contained antimicrobial resistant (AMR) E. coli, and 85% of the AMR isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR). The highest frequency of resistance was observed to tetracycline (11.7%), followed by ampicillin and streptomycin (both 10.5%), and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (9.9%). Two (1.2%) of the isolates showed intermediate resistance to cefazolin and streptomycin, respectively. All the isolates were susceptible to amoxycillin/clavulanic acid, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, aztreonam and kanamycin, and 86.4% of the isolates were susceptible to all 16 antimicrobials used in this study.

It has already claimed the lives of millions of people around the world. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 can significantly decrease the transmission rate and prevent the virus from spreading around. In this paper, we present deep learning-based methods to detect COVID-19 from given chest X-rays( CXR) image of patient. First, we trained three states of the art algorithms(two efficient net with different initial pre-trained weight and SE-ResNext) that can classify a given X-rays images into three classes: covid, pneumonia, and normal separately. Finally, we ensembled these three algorithms by averaging their outputs for each class to obtain a robust prediction. We evaluated our proposed ensembled method on the Postgraduate (PG) Challenge-COVID-19 Detection via Chest X-rays database with 17958 CXR images for training, 3432 for validation, and 1200 for testing. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves promising performance with an accuracy of 0.9592, a sensitivity of 0.9592, specificity of 0.9597 on the given Test Set Leaderboard.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that the availability of chemical reagent required to carry out the tests is often a bottleneck in increasing a countrys testing capacity. Further, demand is unevenly spread between more affected regions (which require more tests they can perform) and less affected ones (which have spare capacity). These issues hint at the opportunity of increasing test capacity via the optimal allocation of swabs and reagent to laboratories. We prove that this is the case, proposing an Integer Programming formulation to maximise the number of tests a country can perform and validating our approach on both real-life data from Italy and synthetic instances. Our results show that increased inter-regional collaboration and a steadier supply of reagent (i.e., coming from local production sites rather than international shipments) can dramatically increase testing capacity.

It is produced in substantial amounts as co-product from poultry processing plants and pig slaughterhouses. Keratin is packed by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. Based on the secondary structure, keratin can be classified into &#945;-keratin and ?-keratin. Keratinases (EC 3.4.-.- peptide hydrolases) have major potential to degrade keratin for sustainable recycling of the protein and amino acids. Currently, the known keratinolytic enzymes belong to at least 14 different protease families: S1, S8, S9, S10, S16, M3, M4, M14, M16, M28, M32, M36, M38, M55 (MEROPS database). The various keratinolytic enzymes act via endo-attack (proteases in families S1, S8, S16, M4, M16, M36), exo-attack (proteases in families S9, S10, M14, M28, M38, M55) or by action only on oligopeptides (proteases in families M3, M32), respectively. Other enzymes, particularly disulfide reductases, also play a key role in keratin degradation as they catalyze the breakage of disulfide bonds for better keratinase catalysis. This review aims to contribute an overview of keratin biomass as an enzyme substrate and a systematic analysis of currently sequenced keratinolytic enzymes and their classification and reaction mechanisms.

Shortly after that, it was reported that mortality rates in New York City (NYC), the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, were found to be significantly higher in black and Hispanic populations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to evaluate the mortality rates in NYC among the different ethnic groups and the different boroughs as they relate to the obesity rates to see whether this issue merits further evaluation. SETTING: NYC. METHODS: COVID-19 data were obtained from the official New York authorities in relation to total number of cases in the different boroughs of NYC. Age-adjusted COVID-19-related mortality rates of the different ethnic groups were also obtained. These data were cross-compared with historic community health data on obesity rates previously published and also obesity rates among the different ethnic groups in NYC. RESULTS: The 2 NYC boroughs that have the highest mortality rates are the Bronx (6%) and Brooklyn (5.4%). Both the Bronx and Brooklyn were also found to have the highest obesity rates at 32% and 27%, respectively. The 2 ethnic groups with the highest obesity rates (Hispanic and black) were also found to have the highest age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 compared with the other ethnic groups (22.8% and 19.8%, respectively).

Search terms consisted of MEDLINE medical subject headings and other words relevant to this review, including telerehabilitation, musculoskeletal, telemedicine, therapy, chiropractic, ergonomics, and exercise. This review targeted studies of people aged 18 years and older with musculoskeletal concerns. Articles on diagnostic tests, effectiveness of treatment, patient satisfaction, access to care, and cost were included. Results Eleven studies were included in this review. Interrater reliability and agreement were moderate to high for several assessment procedures for the lower limb, elbow, and low back. Two clinical trials demonstrated that provider and patient simultaneous telehealth were equally as effective as in-office care. Patient and provider satisfaction with telehealth were reported to be equal to or higher than for conventional rehabilitation. We found no studies reporting cost or access. Conclusion In the COVID-19 pandemic environment, telehealth is feasible for health care providers to provide rehabilitation services for their patients with various musculoskeletal conditions. Current evidence suggests that for some musculoskeletal disorders, telehealth evaluation may be reliable, treatment may be effective, and patient satisfaction may be good or better than for in-office care.

In this study, the cysteine-rich spikes were subjected to chemical modification to determine whether such structural alterations impact the virus entry process. Ellman reagent, a membrane-impermeant oxidizing agent which reacts with exposed cysteine residues to effect covalent addition of large thionitrobenzoate moieties, was incubated at 37 degrees C with the JHM strain of MHV. Relative to untreated virus, 1 mM Ellman reagent reduced infectivity by 2 log(10) after 1 h. This level of inhibition was not observed at incubation temperatures below 21 degrees C, suggesting that virion surface proteins undergo thermal transitions that expose cysteine residues to modification by the reagent. Quantitative receptor binding and membrane fusion assays were developed and used to show that Ellman reagent specifically inhibited membrane fusion induced by the MHV JHM spike protein. However, this inhibition was strain specific, because the closely related MHV strain A59 was unaffected. To identify the basis for this strain specificity, spike cDNAs were prepared in which portions encoded either JHM or A59 residues. cDNAs were expressed with vaccinia virus vectors and tested for sensitivity to Ellman reagent in the fusion assays. The results revealed a correlation between the severity of inhibition mediated by Ellman reagent and the presence of a JHM-specific cysteine (Cys-1163). Thus, the presence of this cysteine increases the availability of spikes for a thiol modification that ultimately prevents fusion competence.","output":"Murine coronavirus membrane fusion is blocked by modification of thiols buried within the spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The public health community has become increasingly critical of the role that powerful corporations play in driving unhealthy diets, one of the leading contributors to the global burden of disease. While a substantial amount of work has examined the political strategies used by dominant processed food manufacturers that undermine public health, less attention has been paid to their use of market strategies to build and consolidate power. In this light, this paper aimed to systematically review and synthesise the market strategies deployed by dominant processed food manufacturers to increase and consolidate their power. METHODS: A systematic review and document analysis of public health, business, legal and media content databases (Scopus, Medline, ABI Inform, Business Source Complete, Thomas Reuters Westlaw, Lexis Advance, Factiva, NewsBank), and grey literature were conducted. Data extracted were analysed thematically using an approach informed by Porters Five Forces framework. RESULTS: 213 documents met inclusion criteria. The market strategies (n=21) and related practices of dominant processed food manufacturers identified in the documents were categorised into a typological framework consisting of six interconnected strategic objectives: i) reduce intense competition with equivalent sized rivals and maintaining dominance over smaller rivals; ii) raise barriers to market entry by new competitors; iii) counter the threat of market disruptors and drive dietary displacement in favour of their products; iv) increase firm buyer power over suppliers; v) increase firm seller power over retailers and distributors; and vi) leverage informational power asymmetries in relations with consumers. CONCLUSIONS: The typological framework is well-placed to inform general and jurisdiction-specific market strategy analyses of dominant processed food manufacturers, and has the potential to assist in identifying countervailing public policies, such as those related to merger control, unfair trading practices, and public procurement, that could be used to address market-power imbalances as part of efforts to improve population diets.

The demographic and clinical data were compared between survivors and non-survivors, and Cox regression analysis was used to explore risk factors for 28-day mortality. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality after initiation of invasive ventilation. Secondary outcome was the time from admission to intubation. Results: Of 74 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 68.0 years, 53 (71.6%) were male, 47 (63.5%) had comorbidities with hypertension, and diabetes commonly presented. The most frequent symptoms were fever and dyspnea. The median time from hospital admission to intubation was similar in survivors and non-survivors (6.5 days vs. 5.0 days).

Despite high vaccine coverage, pertussis has re-emerged in many countries and caused two large epidemics in Australia since 2007. Here, we undertook a genomic and phylogeographic study of 385 Australian B. pertussis isolates collected from 2008 to 2017. The Australian B. pertussis population was found to be composed of mostly ptxP3 strains carrying different fim3 alleles, with ptxP3-fim3A genotype expanded far more than ptxP3-fim3B. Within the former, there were six co-circulating epidemic lineages (EL1 to EL6). The multiple ELs emerged, expanded, and then declined at different time points over the two epidemics, likely driven by immune selection from pertussis vaccination and natural infection in addition to local and global transmission events. Both hard and soft selective sweeps through vaccine selection pressures determined the current B. pertussis population dynamics. Relative risk analysis found that once a new B. pertussis lineage emerged, it was more likely to spread locally within the first 1.5 years. However, after 1.5 years, any new lineage was likely to expand to a wider region and became no longer spatially structured across the country. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the expansion of ptxP3 strains was also associated with replacement of the type III secretion system allele bscI1 with bscI3.

We completed serological assays using samples collected from health care workers to identify antibody types associated with SARS-CoV-2 protection and COVID-19 symptom duration. Rare SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive antibodies elicited by past CCV infections were not associated with protection; however, the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections was significantly reduced in individuals with higher common betacoronavirus (CoV) antibody titers. Since antibody titers decline over time after CCV infections, individuals in our cohort with higher CoV antibody titers were more likely recently infected with common CoVs compared with individuals with lower antibody titers. Therefore, our data suggest that recent CoV infections potentially limit the duration of symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infections through mechanisms that do not involve cross-reactive antibodies.

Usually, they are composed of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) in time. A class of such models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased populations, the SEIRD model.

Study aim is to investigate the benefits of this new intervention compared to an active control condition within a 12 months follow-up. METHODS: In this randomised controlled proof of concept study, 82 boys with MBID who consumed any alcohol during the last year will be randomised either to the 6 week mindfulness oriented intervention or the control group receiving a control intervention equal in dose and length. The intervention group undergoes mindfulness training combined with interactive drug education, while the control group completes a health training combined with the same education. In the intention-to-treat analysis the primary outcome is the self-reported delay of first post-intervention drunkeness within a 12 months follow-up time span, measured weekly with a short app-based questionnaire. Secondary outcome is the use of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs within 30 days post-intervention. Changes in neurobiological behavioural parameters, such as impulse control, reward anticipation, and decision making, are also investigated. Other secondary outcomes regard trait mindfulness, emotion regulation, psychopathological symptoms, peer networks, perceived stress, and quality of life. In addition, a prospective registry will be established to record specific data on the population of 11C17 year old boys with MBID without any alcohol experience.

In this work, in-situ measurements of light absorption by carbonaceous aerosols and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) concentrations were conducted at Waliguan (WLG) over the northeastern Tibetan Platea of China from January 3 to March 30, 2020. The data was employed to explore the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on atmospheric chemistry in the background-free troposphere. During the sampling period, the light absorption near-infrared (>470 nm) was mainly contributed by BC (>72%), however, BC and brown carbon (BrC) contributed equally to light absorption in the short wavelength (350 nm). The average BC concentrations in the pre-, during and post-lockdown were 0.28  0.25, 0.18  0.16, and 0.28  0.20 g m(?3), respectively, with 35% decreases during the lockdown period. Meanwhile, the CO(2) also showed slight decreases during the lockdown period. The declined BC was profoundly attributed to the reduced emissions (85%), especially for the combustion of fossil fuels. For another, the declined light absorption of BC, primary and secondary BrC decreased the solar energy absorbance by 35, 15, and 14%, respectively.

Since decarbonisation efforts have been slow, and the climate crisis is intensifying, it is increasingly likely that removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere will be necessary to meet internationally-agreed targets. Yet there are fears that pursuing NETs might undermine other mitigation efforts, primarily the reduction (rather than removal) of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the risk of this phenomenon, named mitigation deterrence. Some of us have previously argued that a cultural political economy framework is needed for analysing NETs. Such a framework explains how promises of future NETs deployment, understood as defensive spatio-temporal fixes, are depoliticised and help defend an existing neoliberal political regime, and its inadequate climate policy. Thus they risk deterring necessary emissions reductions. Here we build on that framework, arguing that to understand such risks, we need to understand them as the result of historically situated, evolving, lived practices. We identify key contributing practices, focussing in particular but not exclusively on climate modelling, and discuss how they have been reproduced and co-evolved, here likened to having dug a hole for ourselves as a society. We argue that understanding and reducing deterrence risks requires phronetic knowledge practices, involving not just disembodied, dispassionate technoeconomic knowledge-making, but also strategic attention to political and normative issues, as well as emotional labour. Reflecting on life in the hole hurts.","output":"Life in the hole: practices and emotions in the cultural political economy of mitigation deterrence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in over 225,000 excess deaths in the United States. A moratorium on elective surgery was placed early in the pandemic to reduce risk to patients and staff and preserve critical care resources. This report evaluates the impact of the elective surgical moratorium on case volumes and intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization. METHODS: This retrospective review used a national convenience sample to correlate trends in the weekly rates of surgical cases at 170 Veterans Affairs Hospitals around the United States from January 1 to September 30, 2020 to national trends in the COVID-19 pandemic. We reviewed data on weekly number of procedures performed and ICU bed usage, stratified by level of urgency (elective, urgent, emergency), and whether an ICU bed was required within 24 hours of surgery. National data on the proportion of COVID-19 positive test results and mortality rates were obtained from the Center for Disease Control website. RESULTS: 198,911 unique surgical procedures performed during the study period. The total number of cases performed from January 1 to March 16 was 86,004 compared with 15,699 from March 17 to May 17. The reduction in volume occurred before an increase in the percentage of COVID-19 positive test results and deaths nationally. There was a 91% reduction from baseline in the number of elective surgeries performed allowing 78% of surgical ICU beds to be available for COVID-19 positive patients. CONCLUSION: The moratorium on elective surgical cases was timely and effective in creating bed capacity for critically ill COVID-19 patients. Further analyses will allow targeted resource allocation for future pandemic planning.","output":"A Nation-wide Review of Elective Surgery and COVID-Surge Capacity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, one major point of uncertainty is the impact this novel pathogen will have during the upcoming 2020-2021 flu season. While the influenza virus is a known contributor to human morbidity and mortality, the question of how a coinfection between COVID-19 and influenza might manifest is of utmost concern. The aim of this study was to review the limited cases of COVID-19/influenza coinfection currently available in the literature, along with cases in the community of El Paso, Texas, to determine whether any patterns of clinical presentation and morbidity emerged. An international review of the literature was conducted. Six published articles describing COVID-19/influenza coinfection were identified, with a total of thirteen patients described therein. Three additional patients were identified from the El Paso, Texas data. The most common presenting symptoms were fever and cough. The most common laboratory findings were elevated C-reactive protein and lymphocytopenia. Thirteen patients presented with viral pneumonia findings on CT, and nine had findings of ground-glass opacity. Finally, complications were reported in six patients, with most common complication being acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The results of the review indicate that, due to the similarity in presentation between COVID-19 and influenza, further analysis will be required to understand the effects of coinfection on morbidity and mortality. However, the limited number of coinfection cases in the literature indicates that the implementation of COVID-19 control measures may continue to play a role in limiting the spread of these human respiratory pathogens.

This study took immune-informatics approaches to identify B- and T-cell epitopes for surface glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2, followed by estimating their antigenicity and interactions with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. We identified four B cell epitopes, two MHC class-I and nine MHC class-II binding T-cell epitopes, which showed highly antigenic features. Allergenicity, toxicity and physiochemical properties analysis confirmed the specificity and selectivity of epitopes. The stability and safety of epitopes were confirmed by digestion analysis. No mutations were observed in all the selected B- and T-cell epitopes across all isolates from different locations worldwide.

Meanwhile, full-length VP0, VP3, and VP1 genes were simultaneously cloned from 17 clinical samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all CKoV strains were most closely related to porcine kobuvirus based on amino acid (aa) sequences of VP0 and VP3 proteins, but CKoV strains were closely related to with Aichivirus B strains (ferret, bovine, and sheep kobuvirus) based on aa sequences of the VP1 protein. Interestingly, compared with known CKoV strains in the GenBank database, Chinese CKoV strains have unique amino acid changes in VP0 and VP1 proteins. Moreover, the first Chinese CKoV nearly complete genome was successfully obtained from a diarrheic fecal sample, named SWUN/F11/2019.

Many patients attending primary care services have mental ill-health or social issues that healthcare practitioners currently do not have adequate ways of supporting. This study set out to explore the perspectives of primary healthcare practitioners on Arts on Prescription (AoP) as an additional referral pathway. METHODS: A qualitative exploratory descriptive approach within an interpretive framework using semi-structured interviews was used to explore healthcare practitioners perspectives and experiences of AoP programmes in Sweden. Ten interviews were conducted with healthcare practitioners in primary care. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. RESULTS: The healthcare practitioners interviewed, recognised the need for more holistic approaches to care for those with mental health issues. They perceived that AoP is beneficial for patients in terms of motivation, creating routines, providing social interactions, and increasing self-esteem. In addition, AoP was felt to have the potential to impact upon current service provision and wider society. However, whilst the opportunity to refer patients to AoP in conjunction with conventional treatments was valued, participants reported that time pressures on practitioners and the continuing dominance of the medical model of care were barriers to wider acceptance amongst practitioners at the present time. CONCLUSIONS: AoP enabled primary healthcare practitioners to offer an additional pathway for patients that is an adjunct to the traditional care pathway. However, the programmes tend to be project-based and often time limited. For programmes to be sustainable and be included as part of a wider range of interventions available to healthcare practitioners suitable levels of funding would be required.

These biases can potentially result in misdiagnoses, delayed clinical care, and/or patient mismanagement. A range of interventions exists to mitigate cognitive biases. There is a need to understand the relative efficacy of these interventions within the context of eye care practice. PURPOSE The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the evidence relating to interventions for mitigating cognitive biases associated with clinical decision making by eye care professionals. DATA SOURCES Electronic databases (including Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, PsycINFO) were searched from inception to October 2017 for studies investigating interventions intended to mitigate cognitive biases in the clinical decision making of eye care professionals. This review was undertaken in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guidelines.

In this article, we consider some of these concerns and explore the concept of the ?distributed court? as a potential remedy. Unlike traditional video appearance in court, where a defendant participates remotely while all other players are co-located in the same courtroom, in a distributed court all participants meet in a shared virtual space. Such a configuration is similar to the virtual courts developed worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on a reimagining of co-presence from scholars in the sociology of technology to elaborate the concept of the distributed court. We then present the results of a mock jury study that examines how jurors respond to variations in court technology configurations. We find that appearing by video does not impact the likelihood of a guilty verdict. Rather, a defendant appearing alone in a dock seems to be the most prejudicial location. We find that a distributed court can communicate equality and produce a shared experience of remote participation.

The 2019 outbreak of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, has become a serious global pandemic. Many attempts have been made to forecast the spread of the disease using various methods, including time series models. Among the attempts to model the pandemic, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have used the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) technique to forecast confirmed cases. Objective: The primary objective of this paper is to construct a reliable, robust, and interpretable model for describing, decomposing, and forecasting the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and predicting the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A modified singular spectrum analysis (SSA) approach was applied for the analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. We proposed this approach and developed it in our previous studies regarding the separability and grouping steps in SSA, which play important roles in reconstruction and forecasting. The modified SSA approach mainly enables us to identify the number of interpretable components required for separability, signal extraction, and noise reduction. The approach was examined using different levels of simulated and real data with different structures and signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, we examined the capability of the approach to analyze COVID-19 data. We then used vector SSA to predict new data points and the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Results: In the first stage, the confirmed daily cases on the first 42 days (March 02 to April 12, 2020) were used and analyzed to identify the value of the number of required eigenvalues (r) for separability between noise and signal. After obtaining the value of r, which was 2, and extracting the signals, vector SSA was used to predict and determine the pandemic peak. In the second stage, we updated the data and included 81 daily case values. We used the same window length and number of eigenvalues for reconstruction and forecasting of the points 90 days ahead. The results of both forecasting scenarios indicated that the peak would occur around the end of May or June 2020 and that the crisis would end between the end of June and the middle of August 2020, with a total number of infected people of approximately 330,000. Conclusions: Our results confirm the impressive performance of modified SSA in analyzing COVID-19 data and selecting the value of r for identifying the signal subspace from a noisy time series and then making a reliable prediction of daily confirmed cases using the vector SSA method.","output":"Forecasting the COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia Using a Modified Singular Spectrum Analysis Approach: Model Development and Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The relative resistance of children to severe course of the novel coronavirus infection remains unclear.

AIM: Since we could not find any data on the similar effect caused by EBC in adults, the aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the biological activity of EBC in adults and children in an experimental in vitro model. Furthermore, in order to identify a putative agent responsible for these properties of EBC in children, we attempted to analyse the composition of selected EBC samples. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The influence of EBC samples on metabolic activity of endothelial cell line C-166 was assessed using colorimetric tetrazolium salt reduction assay (MTT assay). Selected EBC samples were fractionated using size exclusion chromatography and subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. RESULTS: Exhaled breath condensates in healthy children, but not in adults, revealed a cytotoxic effect on in vitro cell cultures. This effect was most significant in condensate fraction, which contained a prominent 4.8 kDa peak in the mass spectra.

Some studies suggest that the incidence of mental health problems increased during the pandemic. The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of mental well-being and the risk of developing depression among different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia. METHODS: Data from eight waves of the Slovenian panel web survey SI PANDA was used, namely the 1st wave: from 4th to 6th December 2020 (n = 1001); 8th wave: from 12th to 15th March 2021 (n = 1002). The sample included adults aged 18 to 74 years. In all eight waves, we used The World Health Organisation-Five Well Being Index (WHO 5), which is a short self-reported scale of current mental well-being and also has appropriate validity for screening for depression. Data were analyzed using the SPSS25, we applied the Mantel Haenszel linear trend test and the chi square test. RESULTS: The results show that from the 1st to the 8th wave of the study (from December 4th 2020 to March 15th 2021), mental well being in the whole sample improved slightly (M H test for trend, p < 0,001), both in men and women, across all age groups. In addition, there was a declining trend in the risk of developing depression among the population aged between 30 and 64 years. However, this decrease was not observed in the 65-74 and 18-29 age groups in the mentioned time frame. In the youngest age group we could observe substantial fluctuations in the risk for depression between research waves, whereas in the eldest population a favourable decline in the risk for depression was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of developing depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Slovenia is different among different age groups. Studies suggest that the occurrence of mental health problems increased during the pandemic, but not necessarily in parallel with the level of mental well being experienced by adults, which was also shown in the Slovenian sample.

Molnupiravir use was associated with lower risks of mortality (HR=0{middle dot}61, 95%CI=0{middle dot}46-0{middle dot}82, p<0{middle dot}001) and in-hospital composite outcome (HR=0{middle dot}64, 95%CI=0{middle dot}50-0{middle dot}83, p<0{middle dot}001) than non-use, while that of hospitalization was comparable to controls (HR=1{middle dot}06, 95%CI=0{middle dot}97-1{middle dot}16, p=0{middle dot}191). Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use was associated with lower risks of mortality (HR=0{middle dot}25, 95%CI=0{middle dot}13-0{middle dot}47, p<0{middle dot}001), hospitalization (HR=0{middle dot}69, 95%CI=0{middle dot}60-0{middle dot}79, p<0{middle dot}001), and in-hospital outcome (HR=0{middle dot}47, 95%CI=0{middle dot}31-0{middle dot}71, p<0{middle dot}001) than non-use. Similar protective effects of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir were observed across vaccination status (fully vaccinated versus otherwise) and age (dichotomized at 65 years), whereas those for molnupiravir were less consistent. Findings from case-control analysis broadly confirmed those of primary analysis. InterpretationAmid the Omicron BA.2.2 wave, early initiation of oral antivirals among non-institutionalised COVID-19 patients was associated with reduced risks of mortality and in-hospital outcomes. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use was associated with greater and more consistent protection than molnupiravir. FundingHealth and Medical Research Fund, Food and Health Bureau Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSOral antivirals have been initiating in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients to lower their risks of hospitalization and death, and hence to reduce the burden on healthcare systems. We searched Scopus and PubMed for studies until 25 May 2022 using the search terms \\"SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19\\" AND \\"molnupiravir OR Lagevrio OR EIDD-2801\\" OR \\"nirmatrelvir OR Paxlovid OR PF-07321332\\". Major studies examining the outpatient use of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir are MOVe-OUT and EPIC-HR trials, respectively. Both have been conducted among unvaccinated, non-hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk of progression to severe disease, during a pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. Early initiation of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within five days of symptom onset has been associated with relative risk reduction of hospitalization or death by 30% and 88%, respectively. Considering the real-world evaluation of the two oral antivirals against the currently circulating Omicron variant, only one single-center, retrospective review of solid organ transplant recipients with COVID-19 has been conducted; yet their results are unlikely generalizable to other populations given its specific patient group and small sample size. Real-world effectiveness of oral antivirals is urgently needed to inform their clinical use in COVID-19 patients, considering their vaccination status and the variant of concern. Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first real-world studies exploring the clinical use of oral antivirals during a pandemic wave dominated by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. A territory-wide, retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir in community-dwelling COVID-19 patients. Early initiation of molnupiravir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within five days of symptom onset was associated with significant reduction of all-cause mortality risk by 39% and 75%, respectively, compared to not using any oral antivirals. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use was also associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization by 31%, which was consistently observed across age and vaccination status. In terms of disease progression, both oral antivirals were effective in lowering the risk of in-hospital death, which was again more substantial with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir than molnupiravir. Intriguingly, the need for invasive ventilation might be reduced among molnupiravir users compared to matched controls. Implications of all the available evidenceBased on relative efficacy, our findings give support to current guidelines prioritizing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use over molnupiravir in community-dwelling COVID-19 patients who are at high risk of hospitalization or progression to severe disease, should the former be accessible and clinically appropriate. Amid a pandemic wave of the Omicron variant, real-world effectiveness of oral antivirals in reducing the mortality risk of community-dwelling COVID-19 patients has been demonstrated in this study consisting mostly of the elderly and those who had not been fully vaccinated, extending beyond the evidence demonstrated in clinical trials among those of the Delta variant and who were at risk of severe COVID-19 from being overweight/obese. Several clinical trials (namely RECOVERY and PANORAMIC) and observational studies of the two oral antivirals are ongoing, and further research is needed to confirm our results in other patient populations and healthcare settings.","output":"Real-world effectiveness of molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir against mortality, hospitalization, and in-hospital outcomes among community-dwelling, ambulatory COVID-19 patients during the BA.2.2 wave in Hong Kong: an observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery is the standard surgical treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in patients for who long-term pharmacotherapy is intolerable or ineffective. Advances in anaesthesia and minimally invasive surgery have led to day case treatment being adopted by some centres. The objective of this study is to describe our day case pathway and peri- and postoperative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single centre, retrospective case series review of a prospectively collected database from October 2014 to August 2019 performed in a tertiary centre for upper gastrointestinal surgery. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, indications, complications, length of stay and readmission. RESULTS: A total of 362 patients underwent laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery with or without hiatus hernia repair of up to 10cm, with day case rates of 59%. Unplanned admission following day surgery was 5.1% (13/225) and 30-day readmission was 2.2% (8/362); 90.6% of patients remained in hospital for less than 24 hours. There was one intraoperative complication and one patient required revisional surgery within 30 days. The rate of all postoperative complications was 1.38% (5/362) with one postoperative mortality. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of larger hernias is unusual, as most studies limit size to 5cm or less. Our results show the safety and feasibility of the procedure even when applied to hiatus hernias up to 10cm. Success was multifactorial and based on standardisation of procedures and support from dedicated specialist nursing staff. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery can be performed safely as a day case procedure even in larger hiatus hernias, with a dedicated care pathway and specialist nurse practitioners to support it.","output":"Technique and outcome of day case laparoscopic hiatus hernia surgery for small and large hernias: a five-year retrospective review from a high-volume UK centre"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This article seeks to evaluate and outline the changes made to the trauma and orthopaedic department in a district general hospital in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic We detail the approach in relation to surgical management, workforce optimisation and our general reflections as a department Methods: We interviewed, collated and have subsequently described the adaptations implemented by our department We have collected their shared strategy and reflections on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected our department Results: Alterations were implemented to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic A strategy focused on ensuring the workforce remained healthy, and patient care pathways were altered as minimally as possible Conclusions: As a unit, a sense of heightened vigilance needs to remain for the foreseeable future Decisive action by departmental leadership, alongside a cohesive and open, has allowed for our trauma service to continue largely unchanged This analysis serves as an important aide-memoire for future periods of extreme uncertainty","output":"A District General Hospital Trauma Service Response to COVID-19: Lessons Learnt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: \\"Patharnakh\\" pear, a dominant cultivar in the Punjab province of India, has a shorter storage life as it matures during the hot and humid weather. Studies have reported that postharvest chemical treatments have a major role in improving the storage life of the fruit. In this study, the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) of salicylic acid (SA), a well-known signaling molecule, was explored to overcome browning and maintain the postharvest quality of the Patharnakh pear during cold storage. RESULTS: SA treated pears were better than the untreated fruits in all of the studied parameters. SA application alleviated the rate of weight loss and respiration, and lowered the decay percentage. The efficacy of SA in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which correlates negatively with the total phenolic content, was quite noticeable. The SA treated fruits exhibited a slower oxidation of the total phenol content by inhibiting the action of polyphenol oxidase and retaining the total phenolic content, leading to lower incidence of browning. SA effectively maintained the ascorbic acid content and superoxide dismutase activity. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH of the pears were highest with the SA treatment. CONCLUSION: The 2 mM SA treatment exhibited the best result of reducing fruit decay and tissue browning, and maintaining the postharvest quality parameters of pear up to 60 days of cold storage.

Disruptions to the seasonal transmission patterns of these diseases may have consequences for the timing and severity of future outbreaks. Here we consider the implications of SARS-CoV-2 NPIs for two endemic infections circulating in the United States of America (USA): respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and seasonal influenza. Using laboratory surveillance data from 2020, we estimate that RSV transmission declined by at least 20% in the USA at the start of the NPI period. We simulate future trajectories of both RSV and influenza, using an epidemic model. As susceptibility increases over the NPI period, we find that substantial outbreaks of RSV may occur in future years, with peak outbreaks likely occurring in the winter of 2021-2022. Results for influenza broadly echo this picture, but are more uncertain; future outbreaks are likely dependent on the transmissibility and evolutionary dynamics of circulating strains.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions on the future dynamics of endemic infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, new digital solutions have been developed for infection control. In particular, contact tracing mobile apps provide a means for governments to manage both health and economic concerns. However, public reception of these apps is paramount to their success, and global uptake rates have been low. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to identify the characteristics of individuals or factors potentially associated with voluntary downloads of a contact tracing mobile app in Singapore. METHODS: A cohort of 505 adults from the general community completed an online survey. As the primary outcome measure, participants were asked to indicate whether they had downloaded the contact tracing app TraceTogether introduced at the national level. The following were assessed as predictor variables: (1) participant demographics, (2) behavioral modifications on account of the pandemic, and (3) pandemic severity (the number of cases and lockdown status). RESULTS: Within our data set, the strongest predictor of the uptake of TraceTogether was the extent to which individuals had already adjusted their lifestyles because of the pandemic (z=13.56; P<.001). Network analyses revealed that uptake was most related to the following: using hand sanitizers, avoiding public transport, and preferring outdoor over indoor venues during the pandemic. However, demographic and situational characteristics were not significantly associated with app downloads. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to introduce contact tracing apps could capitalize on pandemic-related behavioral adjustments among individuals. Given that a large number of individuals is required to download contact tracing apps for contact tracing to be effective, further studies are required to understand how citizens respond to contact tracing apps.

METHODS Postmortem skin samples were obtained for histological evaluation from 37 frogs, with and without skin lesions, that died while in captivity at Auckland Zoo between 2000 and 2012. Four frogs with skin lesions were biopsied under general anaesthesia and samples used for both light and transmission electron microscopy. The records of 94 frogs held at the University of Otago and Auckland Zoo between 2000-2012 were reviewed, which included some frogs recently collected from the wild. Information about the occurrence of skin lesions, and mortality associated with skin lesions was collated. RESULTS Grossly the skin lesions varied in appearance; most were circular, pale grey papules, which measured from <0.5-1.5 mm in diameter with no umbilication. The overlying epidermis was not fragile and there was no associated inflammation. Contents often appeared clear or semi-transparent. Lesions were located predominantly on ventral surfaces including trunk, thighs, lower legs and forearms, and gular region, but not on digits. The number ranged from single to multiple, often confluent lesions covering the entire ventral surface of the frog. Histologically the lesions consisted of enlarged proliferating mucous glands that expanded the dermis and elevated the epidermis. They were semi-organised, solid or occasionally cavitated acinar structures with central lumina which sometimes contained mucus. Nuclei showed moderate anisokaryosis and mitotic figures were uncommon. Transmission electron microscopy did not show any infectious agents. Between 2000 and 2012, skin lesions were recorded in 35/94 (37%) frogs. The size and location of skin lesions varied over time, with some resolving and sometimes reappearing. Skin lesions were not associated with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS The skin lesions had the gross and microscopic characteristics of adenomatous hyperplasia of the dermal mucous glands.

The lack of access to diagnostic testing and excessively long turnaround times to result contributes to delays in sepsis identification and initiation of appropriate treatment. This study aims to evaluate the novel InTrays COLOREX Screen and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase for rapid identification of bacterial pathogens causing sepsis and detection of resistance. METHODS Neonates with suspected sepsis admitted to the Harare Central Hospital were prospectively enrolled. One blood culture was collected and incubated using the BacT/ALERT automated system. Positive blood cultures with potential pathogens identified by Gram stain were inoculated on the InTray COLOREX Screen and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase culture plates. RESULTS A total of 216 neonates with suspected sepsis were recruited. Pathogens were isolated from blood cultures in 56 (25.9%) neonates of which 54 were Klebsiella pneumoniae. All K. pneumoniae were resistant to ceftriaxone and 53 (98%) were resistant to gentamicin. Sensitivity and specificity for ceftriaxone-resistant K. pneumoniae detection using InTrays were 100%. InTrays results were interpretable as early as 5-10 hours (median 7 hours, interquartile range 7-7) post blood culture positivity enabling rapid identification and notification of result and leading to a 60% reduction in time to result from blood culture collection.

These are used as controls, and allow measurement and improvement of the accuracy and quality of diagnostic tests. Current reference standards typically represent target genetic material, and act only as positive controls to assess test sensitivity. However, negative controls are also required to evaluate test specificity. Using a pair of chimeric A/B RNA standards, this allowed incorporation of positive and negative controls into diagnostic testing for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The chimeric standards constituted target regions for RT-PCR primer/probe sets that are joined in tandem across two separate synthetic molecules. Accordingly, a target region that is present in standard A provides a positive control, whilst being absent in standard B, thereby providing a negative control. This design enables cross-validation of positive and negative controls between the paired standards in the same reaction, with identical conditions. This enables control and test failures to be distinguished, increasing confidence in the accuracy of results. The chimeric A/B standards were assessed using the US Centres for Disease Control real-time RT-PCR protocol, and showed results congruent with other commercial controls in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples.

METHODS: Participants (n=20 120C25 228 across surveys) reported their daily activities during 3 weekly periods in late November 2020, late December 2020 and mid-February 2021. Deprivation was quantified based on participants residential postcode using English or Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles. We used Poisson mixed-effect models with robust standard errors to estimate the relationship between deprivation and risk of exposure to public activities during each survey period. RESULTS: Relative to participants in the least deprived areas, participants in the most deprived areas exhibited elevated risk of exposure to vehicle sharing (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) range across time points: 1.73C8.52), public transport (aRR: 3.13C5.73), work or education outside of the household (aRR: 1.09C1.21), essential shops (aRR: 1.09C1.13) and non-household contacts (aRR: 1.15C1.19) across multiple survey periods.

To this end, in this study, we present a novel cucumber dataset and propose two data augmentation strategies that help to bridge the context-gap. Experimental results show that 1) the state-of-the-art few-shot object detection model performs poorly on the novel 'cucumber' category;and 2) the proposed augmentation strategies outperform the commonly used ones.","output":"Few-Shot Object Detection in Real Life: Case Study on Auto-Harvest"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study determined the knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19 and assessed the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among healthcare workers and the general population. METHODS: A web-based, cross-sectional study was conducted using convenience sampling in Libya from December 1 to 18, 2020 among the general population and healthcare workers. Data on demographic characteristics, COVID-19 vaccination-related concerns, knowledge, attitudes, and practice regarding COVID-19, and knowledge, attitudes, and acceptance regarding the COVID-19 vaccine were collected using a self-administered survey. A binomial logistic regression was performed with 70% efficacy to determine the association between acceptance of the vaccine and study variables. RESULTS: Valid and complete responses were collected from 15,087 participants. Of these, 6227 (41.3%) were male and 8860 (58.7%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 30.6  9.8 years. Moreover, 485 (3.2%) participants were infected with COVID-19 at the time of the study, while 2000 (13.3%) had been previously infected. Overall, 2452 (16.3%) participants agreed, and 3127 (20.7%) strongly agreed, with \\"having concerns about serious vaccine-related complications.\\" Mask-wearing adherence was reported by 10,268 (68.1%) of the participants. Most participants (14,050, 93.1%) believed that the vaccine should be provided for free, while 7272 (48.2%) were willing to buy it. Regarding vaccine acceptance and efficacy, 12,006 (79.6%) reported their willingness to take the vaccine with an efficacy of 90% or more, 9143 (60.6%) with an efficacy of 70% or more, and only 6212 (41.2%) with an efficacy of 50%. The binomial logistic regression revealed that vaccine acceptance was not associated with belonging to the medical field versus the general population. Acceptance was statistically associated with younger age groups, especially 31-40 (OR = 1.3 [1.09, 1.55]) and 41-50 years (OR = 1.29, [1.09, 1.54]). However, having a family member or friend infected with COVID-19 was positively associated with the likelihood of vaccine acceptance (OR = 1.09 [1.02, 1.18]), while having a friend or family member who died due to COVID-19 was negatively associated with it (OR = 0.89 [0.84, 0.97]). CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine is an essential determinant of vaccine uptake and the likelihood of controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Developing strategies to decrease public hesitation and increase trust is vital for implementing vaccination programs.","output":"Knowledge, attitude, and acceptance of healthcare workers and the public regarding the COVID-19 vaccine: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, every aspect of daily life is being altered in response to the virus The pandemic has altered secondary education Classes online, teachers struggling to learn Zoom and make lessons meaningful and relevant to students Students struggling to make sense of this moment, struggling with mental health issues due to the loss of routine and in many cases contact with adult role models Unfortunately, in times of crisis such as these some of the most disenfranchized people in society are completely overlooked and forgotten, such as refugees However, if more teachers were to leverage the social studies potential of current events such as the Coronavirus, greater empathy would be felt for marginalized people more starkly impacted by the pandemic, leading ultimately to a heightened sense of civic engagement among the next generation The purpose of this paper is to assist teachers in guiding their students through analyzing current events, such as COVID-19s impact on refugees, toward developing civic mindedness In addition to this, the paper will discuss some of the broader societal impacts the virus is having within the United States, as well as ways in which this event may be viewed as a historical subject in the future The paper will begin by building the content knowledge of high school social studies teachers through addressing the following question: What is the difference between a refugee entering the United States now versus one year ago before the COVID-19 pandemic?

Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.","output":"Philosophy for children and mindfulness during COVID-19: Results from a randomized cluster trial and impact on mental health in elementary school students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"T cells play pivotal roles in protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Surprisingly, this length was found to vary throughout infection from ~45 nt immediately after virus entry (at 0 to 4 hpi) to ~65 nt later on (at 6 h to 9 hpi) and from ~65 nt (at 6 h to 9 hpi) to ~30 nt (at 120-144 hpi). With the same method, poly(U) sequences of the same lengths were simultaneously found on the ligated viral negative-strand RNAs. Functional analyses of poly(A) tail length on specific viral RNA species, furthermore, revealed that translation, in vivo, of RNAs with the longer poly(A) tail was enhanced over those with the shorter poly(A). Although the mechanisms by which the tail lengths vary is unknown, experimental results together suggest that the length of the poly(A) and poly(U) tails is regulated. One potential function of regulated poly(A) tail length might be that for the coronavirus genome a longer poly(A) favors translation.

This study investigated the recombinant M protein's immunoreactivity with the sera from COVID-19 convalescents. In silico designed protein was created from the outer N-terminal part (19 aa) and internal C-terminal tail (101-222 aa) of the M protein (YP_009724393.1) and was recombinantly produced and purified.

So, this study aimed to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effect of saponins in comparison with the adjuvant widely used aluminum hydroxide using an isolated and purified L1 protein from BPV as model. In this study, genomic lesions, which after processed without repair can result in mutations, were detected by comet assay.

Strategies are urgently needed to reduce transmission in these high-risk populations. Objective: To evaluate COVID-19 transmission in nursing homes associated with contact-targeted interventions and testing. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical modeling study developed an agent-based susceptible-exposed-infectious (asymptomatic/symptomatic)-recovered model between July and September 2020 to examine SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes. Residents and staff of a simulated nursing home with 100 residents and 100 staff split among 3 shifts were modeled individually; residents were split into 2 cohorts based on COVID-19 diagnosis. Data were analyzed from September to October 2020. Exposures: In the resident cohorting intervention, residents who had recovered from COVID-19 were moved back from the COVID-19 (ie, infected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort to the non-COVID-19 (ie, susceptible and uninfected with SARS-CoV-2) cohort. In the immunity-based staffing intervention, staff who had recovered from COVID-19 were assumed to have protective immunity and were assigned to work in the non-COVID-19 cohort, while susceptible staff worked in the COVID-19 cohort and were assumed to have high levels of protection from personal protective equipment. These interventions aimed to reduce the fraction of people's contacts that were presumed susceptible (and therefore potentially infected) and replaced them with recovered (immune) contacts. A secondary aim of was to evaluate cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections associated with 2 types of screening tests (ie, rapid antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] testing) conducted with varying frequency. Main Outcomes and Measures: Estimated cumulative incidence proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 3 months. Results: Among the simulated cohort of 100 residents and 100 staff members, frequency and type of testing were associated with smaller outbreaks than the cohorting and staffing interventions. The testing strategy associated with the greatest estimated reduction in infections was daily antigen testing, which reduced the mean cumulative incidence proportion by 49% in absence of contact-targeted interventions. Under all screening testing strategies, the resident cohorting intervention and the immunity-based staffing intervention were associated with reducing the final estimated size of the outbreak among residents, with the immunity-based staffing intervention reducing it more (eg, by 19% in the absence of testing) than the resident cohorting intervention (eg, by 8% in the absence of testing). The estimated reduction in transmission associated with these interventions among staff varied by testing strategy and community prevalence. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that increasing the frequency of screening testing of all residents and staff, or even staff alone, in nursing homes may reduce outbreaks in this high-risk setting. Immunity-based staffing may further reduce spread at little or no additional cost and becomes particularly important when daily testing is not feasible.","output":"Estimation of Transmission of COVID-19 in Simulated Nursing Homes With Frequent Testing and Immunity-Based Staffing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although mental distress and quality of life (QoL) impairments because of the pandemic have increased worldwide, the way that each community has been affected has varied.

METHOD: In this cross-sectional community-based online survey, data from 1156 community-dwelling adults were gathered between 11 May and 3 June 2020. We examined independent correlates of depression, anxiety and QoL, including sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, optimism/pessimism and spiritual/religious coping. Dependent variables were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depressive symptoms, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale for anxiety symptoms, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF for QoL. Correlates of depressive and anxiety disorder were estimated using logistic regression. RESULTS: There were high levels of depressive symptoms (41.9%) and anxiety symptoms (29.0%) in participants. Negative spiritual/religious coping was positively correlated with depressive disorder (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14 95% CI 1.63C2.80; P < 0.001) and with anxiety disorder (OR = 2.46 95% CI 1.90C3.18; P < 0.001), and associated with worse social and environmental QoL (P < 0.001).

This study quantifies national and sub-national effect sizes of NPIs during the early months of the pandemic in the US. Methods: Daily county-level COVID-19 cases and deaths during the first wave (January 2020 through phased removal of interventions) were obtained. County-level cases, doubling times, and death rates were compared to four increasingly restrictive NPI levels. Socio-demographic, climate and mobility factors were analyzed to explain and evaluate NPI heterogeneity, with mobility used to approximate NPI compliance. Analyses were conducted separately for the US and for each Census regions (Pacific, Mountain, east/West North Central, East/West South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic and New England). A stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial analysis was used, leveraging the phased implementation of policies. Results: Aggressive (level 4) NPIs were associated with slower COVID-19 propagation, particularly in high compliance counties. Longer duration of level 4 NPIs was associated with lower case rates (log beta ?0.028, 95% CI ?0.04 to ?0.02) and longer doubling times (log beta 0.02, 95% CI 0.01C0.03). Effects varied by Census region, for example, level 4 effects on doubling time in Pacific states were opposite to those in Middle Atlantic and New England states. NPI heterogeneity can be explained by differential timing of policy initiation and by variable socio-demographic county characteristics that predict compliance, particularly poverty and racial/ethnic population. Climate exhibits relatively consistent relationships across Census regions, for example, higher minimum temperature and specific humidity were associated with lower doubling times and higher death rates for this period of analysis in South Central, South Atlantic, Middle Atlantic, and New England states. Conclusion and Relevance: Heterogeneity exists in both the effectiveness of NPIs across US Census regions and policy compliance. This county-level variability indicates that control strategies are best designed at community-levels where policies can be tuned based on knowledge of local disparities and compliance with public health ordinances.","output":"Heterogeneity in the Effectiveness of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions During the First SARS-CoV2 Wave in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fact that many patients all over the world use homeopathic ultra high diluted succussed medicinal products, makes very interesting an explanation about the structure of them since until now only unconfirmed hypotheses are made.

RESULTS 22 events with 839 learners were observed. VIEM distinguished between sessions with low and high engagement. 20% of learners pretended to participate. Half of instructors were comfortable with virtual teaching, but only 1/3 believed was as effective as in-person. 2/3 of teachers believed video learners were more engaged than audio learners. CONCLUSIONS Virtual platforms do not automatically translate into increased engagement. Standard tools such as VIEM may help with assessment of engagement during virtual education.","output":"Assessing learner engagement with virtual educational events: Development of the Virtual In-Class Engagement Measure (VIEM)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across much of the world, cancer care has been sidelined to a variable degree by the global effort against the coronavirus pandemic.

Most veterans with serious mental illnesses like schizophrenia want a greater role in treatment decisions, but there are no interventions targeted for this population. A skills-based intervention is promising because it is well-aligned with the recovery model, uses similar mechanisms as other evidence-based interventions in this population, and generalizes across decisional contexts while empowering veterans to decide when to initiate collaborative decision-making. Collaborative Decision Skills Training (CDST) was developed in a civilian serious mental illness sample and may fill this gap but needs to undergo a systematic adaptation process to ensure fit for veterans. METHODS: In aim 1, the IM Adapt systematic process will be used to adapt CDST for veterans with serious mental illness. Veterans and Veterans Affairs (VA) staff will join an Adaptation Resource Team and complete qualitative interviews to identify how elements of CDST or service delivery may need to be adapted to optimize its effectiveness or viability for veterans and the VA context. During aim 2, an open trial will be conducted with veterans in a VA Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Center (PRRC) to assess additional adaptations, feasibility, and initial evidence of effectiveness. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first to evaluate a collaborative decision-making intervention among veterans with serious mental illness. It will also contribute to the fields understanding of perceptions of collaborative decision-making among veterans with serious mental illness and VA clinicians, and result in a service delivery manual that may be used to understand adaptation needs generally in VA PRRCs.

This is questioned since outcome trials of these drug classes had metformin as background therapy. In this post hoc analysis, the effect of dulaglutide on CV events was investigated according to the baseline metformin therapy by means of a subgroup analysis of the Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Patients in REWIND (n = 9901; women: 46.3%; mean age: 66.2 years) had type 2 diabetes and either a previous CV event (31%) or high CV risk (69%). They were randomized (1:1) to sc. dulaglutide (1.5 mg/weekly) or placebo in addition to standard of care. The primary outcome was the first of a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and death from cardiovascular or unknown causes. Key secondary outcomes included a microvascular composite endpoint, all-cause death, and heart failure. The effect of dulaglutide in patients with and without baseline metformin was evaluated by a Cox regression hazard model with baseline metformin, dulaglutide assignment, and their interaction as independent variables. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by a Cox regression model with adjustments for factors differing at baseline between people with vs. without metformin, identified using the backward selection. RESULTS Compared to patients with metformin at baseline (n = 8037; 81%), those without metformin (n = 1864; 19%) were older and slightly less obese and had higher proportions of women, prior CV events, heart failure, and renal disease. The primary outcome occurred in 976 (12%) participants with baseline metformin and in 281 (15%) without. There was no significant difference in the effect of dulaglutide on the primary outcome in patients with vs. without metformin at baseline [HR 0.92 (CI 0.81-1.05) vs. 0.78 (CI 0.61-0.99); interaction P = 0.18]. Findings for key secondary outcomes were similar in patients with and without baseline metformin. CONCLUSION This analysis suggests that the cardioprotective effect of dulaglutide is unaffected by the baseline use of metformin therapy.","output":"Similar cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes and established or high risk for coronary vascular disease treated with dulaglutide with and without baseline metformin."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"O Informe Dirio de Evidncias  uma produo do Ministrio da Sade que tem como objetivo acompanhar diariamente as publicaes cientficas sobre tratamento farmacolgico e vacinas para a COVID-19 Dessa forma, s?o realizadas buscas estruturadas em bases de dados biomdicas, referentes ao dia anterior desse informe N?o s?o includos estudos pr-clnicos (in vitro, in vivo, in silico) A frequncia dos estudos  demonstrada de acordo com a sua classificao metodolgica (revis?es sistemticas, ensaios clnicos randomizados, coortes, entre outros) Para cada estudo  apresentado um resumo com avaliao da qualidade metodolgica Essa avaliao tem por finalidade identificar o grau de certeza/confian?a ou o risco de vis de cada estudo Para tal, s?o utilizadas ferramentas j validadas e consagradas na literatura cientfica, na rea de sade baseada em evidncias Cabe ressaltar que o documento tem carter informativo e n?o representa uma recomendao oficial do Ministrio da Sade sobre a temtica Foram encontrados 17 artigos e 18 protocolos","output":"Informe dirio de evidncias COVID-19: busca realizada em 14 de julho de 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic is the biggest global health threat in the 21st century.

Because of the remarkable tumor shrinkage achieved by the ICIs plus chemotherapy, adverse events of CRT were tolerable. They were alive without tumor progression as of this report, over 1 year after CRT was terminated. CRT is administered with curative intent, while the intent of immunochemotherapy is palliative.

But what kind of selection regimes are important? A look at the parameters that determine fitness of the two parties suggests that social hosts differ from solitary ones primarily in the structure of transmission pathways. Because transmission is, both, the physical encounter of a new host and infecting it, several different elements determine parasite transmission success. These include spatial distance, genetic distance, or the temporal and ecological niche overlaps. Combing these elements into a generalized transmission distance that determines parasite fitness aids in the identification of the critical steps. For example, short-distance transmission to genetically similar hosts within the social group is the most frequent process under sociality. Therefore, spatio-genetical distances are the main driver of parasite fitness. Vice versa, the generalized distance identifies the critical host defences. In this case, host defences should be primarily selected to defend against the within-group spread of an infection, especially among closely related group members.","output":"Sociality and parasite transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reason of significantly higher transmissibility of SARS Covid (2019 CoV-2) compared to SARS Covid (2003 CoV) and MERS Covid (2012 MERS) can be attributed to mutations reported in structural proteins, and the role played by non-structural proteins (nsps) and accessory proteins (ORFs) for viral replication, assembly, and shedding. Envelope protein E is one of the four structural proteins of minimum length. Recent studies have confirmed critical role played by the envelope protein in the viral life cycle including assembly of virion exported from infected cell for its transmission. However, the determinants of the highly complex viral - host interactions of envelope protein, particularly with host Golgi complex, have not been adequately characterized. CoV-2 and CoV Envelope proteins of length 75 and 76 amino acids differ in four amino acid locations. The additional amino acid Gly (G) at location 70 makes CoV length 76. The amino acid pair EG at location 69-70 of CoV in place of amino acid R in location 69 of CoV-2, has been identified as a major determining factor in the current investigation. This paper concentrates on the design of computational model to compare the structure/function of wild and mutants of CoV-2 with wild and mutants of CoV in the functionally important region of the protein chain pair. We hypothesize that differences of CAML model parameter of CoV-2 and CoV characterize the deviation in structure and function of envelope proteins in respect of interaction of virus with host Golgi complex; and this difference gets reflected in the difference of their transmissibility.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study including women under the age of 42 with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 year prior to treatment, undergoing FET cycles in the first half of 2021, with transfer of embryos generated prior to the infection. Controls were SARS-CoV-2 non-diagnosed, non-vaccinated women matched by age, number, and day of embryo transfer. Demographic and cycle characteristics and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Forty-one recovered women and 41 controls were included. Pregnancy rates were 29% and 49% respectively (p = 0.070). Stratification by time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to transfer into  60 and > 60 days revealed a difference in pregnancy rates, with women in the COVID group having lower pregnancy rates if infected in proximity to the transfer (21% vs. 55%; p = 0.006). In a logistic regression model, infection was a significant variable (p = 0.05, OR 0.325, 95% CI 0.106C0.998).

CONCLUSIONS: In FET cycles of patients with past SARS-CoV-2 infection, in which oocytes were retrieved prior to infection, decreased pregnancy rates were observed, specifically in patients who recovered less than 60 days prior to embryo transfer. Pending further studies, in cases of FET cycles with limited number of embryos, postponing embryo transfer for at least 60 days following recovery from COVID-19 might be considered when feasible.

The combination of the AI and the pre-consultation system can help to raise the efficiency of the clinical work. However, it is still challenging for the AI to analyze and process the complicated electronic health record (EHR) data. Our pre-consultation system uses an automated natural language processing (NLP) system to communicate with the patients through the mobile terminals, applying the deep learning (DL) techniques to extract the symptomatic information, and finally outputs the structured electronic medical records.

Our task is to evaluate the ability of the AI and doctors to obtain the primary diagnosis and to analyze the effect of the consistency between the medical history described by our model and the physicians on the diagnostic performance. The results showed that if we do not consider whether the medical history recorded by the AI and doctors was consistent or not, our model performed worse compared to the physicians and had a lower average F1 score (0.825 vs. 0.912). However, when the chief complaint or the history of present illness described by the AI and doctors was consistent, our model had a higher average F1 score and was closer to the doctors. Finally, when the AI had the same diagnostic conditions with doctors, our model achieved a higher average F1 score (0.931) compared to the physicians (0.92).

During the heating season, interior air buoyancy creates large pressure differentials in vertical shafts that can drive airflow from lower floors into upper floors. This pressure differential can result in the spread of contaminants throughout a building. Most recently, concern over COVID-19 has increased attention to the potential spread of airborne diseases in densely populated buildings. For many multi-unit residential buildings, suite ventilation has traditionally relied upon fresh air supplied through a mechanically pressurized corridor. In cold climates, large pressure differentials created by stack-effect can reduce the effectiveness of this approach. Multizone and CFD simulations are employed to analyze airflow and contaminant spread due to stack effect. Simulations are conducted on an idealized model of a 10-storey building using a range of experimentally derived airtightness parameters. Simulations demonstrate stack effect can reduce corridor ventilation to suites and even reverse the airflow for leakier buildings. Reduced airflow to suites can result in the accumulation of contaminants. Reversal of the airflow can allow contaminants from a suite to spread throughout the building. Contaminant spread is illustrated as a function of mechanical ventilation, building airtightness, and ambient temperatures. Strategies to reduce the influence of stack effect on mechanically pressurized corridors are discussed.","output":"The influence of airtightness on contaminant spread in MURBs in cold climates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This study correlates the mechanical and biological response of commercially available resin-based composites (RBCs) to clinically relevant light-curing conditions.

Distance and exposure times were adjusted so that both LCUs delivered 5 similar levels of radiant exposures (RE) between 1.5 J/cm2 to 25 J/cm2 in the blue wavelength range. Thus, the violet light was additional light. The top and bottom of 2-mm thick specimens were subjected to a depth-sensing indentation test (Martens hardness/HM, Vickers hardness/HV, indentation modulus/YHU, mechanical work/Wtotal, plastic deformation work/Wplas, creep/Cr) was performed at. The viability of human gingival fibroblasts was assessed after three days of exposure to RBC eluates. One and multiple-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post-hoc tests (&#945; = 0.05), t-test and a Spearman correlation analysis were used. RESULTS: As the RE increased, the mechanical properties increased at a greater rate at the top compared to the bottom of the RBCs. Values measured at the bottom of 2-mm increments approached the values measured at the top only when RE > 25 J/cm2 of blue light was delivered. Toxicity decreased with RE and elution cycles and was lower for Venus Pearl. Within one RE level, addition of violet light resulted in significantly improved properties (in 131 out of 150 comparisons, p < 0.05). This effect was stronger for Venus Pearl.

This complex control is important and not yet sufficiently understood, due to its malfunction in serious diseases like diabetes. Due to the involvement of numerous organs and sub-systems, each with their own intra-cellular control, we have developed a multi-level mathematical model, for glucose homeostasis, which integrates a variety of data. Over the last 10 years, this model has been used to insert new insights from the intra-cellular level into the larger whole-body perspective. However, the original cell-organ-body translation has during these years never been updated, despite several critical shortcomings, which also have not been resolved by other modelling efforts. For this reason, we here present an updated multi-level model. This model provides a more accurate sub-division of how much glucose is being taken up by the different organs. Unlike the original model, we now also account for the different dynamics seen in the different organs. The new model also incorporates the central impact of blood flow on insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Each new improvement is clear upon visual inspection, and they are also supported by statistical tests. The final multi-level model describes >300 data points in >40 time-series and dose-response curves, resulting from a large variety of perturbations, describing both intra-cellular processes, organ fluxes, and whole-body meal responses. We hope that this model will serve as an improved basis for future data integration, useful for research and drug developments within diabetes.","output":"An organ-based multi-level model for glucose homeostasis: organ distributions, timing, and impact of blood flow"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and importance Baricitinib has recently been used off-label for COVID-19 because of its potential role in reducing systemic inflammation, lung damage, immune response and viral endocytosis based on preclinical data Aim and objectives To analyse the effectiveness and safety of baricitinib for severe COVID-19 in hospitalised patients Material and methods An observational, retrospective, multidisciplinary, single centre study was conducted in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and receiving treatment with baricitinib in a tertiary hospital between 15 March and 30 April 2020 All adult patients receiving baricitinib for 3 or more days were included The variables collected were: sex, age, admission period, days of treatment, medication during admission, analytical parameters, overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AE) Clinical improvement was measured as the difference in values on a 1-8 scale of clinical status during admission (from 1=hospital discharge without limitation of activities to 8=death) between day +1 of starting baricitinib and day +14 Other COVID-19 treatments were allowed Data were collected from the hospital electronic prescription programme and the electronic medical records Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS V 25, expressing the variables as frequencies and medians (IQR), and the Wilcoxon test Results 43 patients treated with baricitinib were included: 70% men (n=30), aged 70 years (IQR 54-79) Duration of treatment was 6 days (IQR 5-7), with a hospital stay of 12 days (IQR 9-25) from the start of baricitinib Clinical improvement was 3 points (IQR 1-4) on the clinical scale (6 points (IQR 6-4) on day +1 vs 3 points (IQR 2-4) on day +14) with a statistically significant difference (p&lt;0 01) At the end of the study period, the OS rate was 100% (n=43 discharge due to clinical improvement (100%)) All analytical parameters related to a poor prognosis of COVID-19 improved with statistically significant differences (p&lt;0 05) on day +14: IL-6 -50 7 pg/mL, PCR -86 4 mg/l, ferritin -159 0 ng/mL, lymphocytes +0 41103/mm3, platelets +51 0103/mm3 and D-dimers -347 ng/mL No AE of interest associated with baricitinib were found Conclusion and relevance Patients treated with baricitinib for COVID-19 in our study presented statistically significant clinical and analytical improvement without relevant AE The results of ongoing clinical trials will shed more light on its efficacy and safety in treating COVID-19","output":"Baricitinib against severe covid-19: Effectiveness and safety in hospital care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in clinical samples is crucial for assessing the infectivity of coronavirus disease 2019 and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. Here, we describe a digital warm-start CRISPR (WS-CRISPR) assay for sensitive quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. The WS-CRISPR assay combines low-temperature reverse transcription dual-priming mediated isothermal amplification (RT-DAMP) and CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection in one-pot, attributed to the mediation role by pyrophosphatase and phosphorothioated primers. The WS-CRISPR assay is initiated at above 50 {degrees}C and overcomes undesired premature target amplification at room temperature, enabling accurate digital nucleic acid quantification. By targeting SARS-CoV-2's nucleoprotein gene, digital WS-CRISPR assay is able to detect down to 5 copies/l SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the chip within 90 minutes. It is clinically validated by quantitatively determining 32 clinical swab samples and three clinical saliva samples, showing 100% agreement with RT-PCR results. Moreover, the digital WS-CRISPR assay has been demonstrated to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 in heat-treated saliva samples without RNA extraction, showing high tolerance to inhibitors. Thus, the digital WS-CRISPR method, as a sensitive and reliable CRISPR assay, facilitates accurate SARS-CoV-2 detection toward digitized quantification.","output":"Sensitive quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples using digital warm-start CRISPR assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: An outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China has spread quickly nationwide. Here, we report results of a descriptive, exploratory analysis of all cases diagnosed as of February 11, 2020. Methods: All COVID-19 cases reported through February 11, 2020 were extracted from China's Infectious Disease Information System. Analyses included: 1) summary of patient characteristics; 2) examination of age distributions and sex ratios; 3) calculation of case fatality and mortality rates; 4) geo-temporal analysis of viral spread; 5) epidemiological curve construction; and 6) subgroup analysis. Results: A total of 72 314 patient records-44 672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16 186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10567 (14.6%) clinical diagnosed cases (Hubei only), and 889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%)-contributed data for the analysis.

Vitamin D has emerged as a potential treatment able to reduce the disease severity. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the effect of calcifediol [25OHD3] treatment on COVID-19-related outcomes. DESIGN: Observational cohort study from March to May, 2020. SETTING: Patients admitted to COVID-19 wards of Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: A total of 930 patients with COVID-19 were included. Ninety-two were excluded due to previous calcifediol intake. INTERVENTION: Of the remaining 838, a total of 447 received calcifediol (532ug on day one plus 266ug on day 3, 7, 15, and 30) whereas 391 were not treated at the time of hospital admission (Intention-to-Treat). Of the latter, 53 patients were treated later during ICU admission and were allocated in the treated group in a second analysis. In healthy subjects, calcifediol is about 3.2-fold more potent on a weight basis than cholecalciferol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: ICU assistance was required by 102 (12.2%) participants. Out of 447 patients treated with calcifediol at admission, 20 (4.5%) required ICU, compared to 82 (21%) out of 391 non-treated (p-value<0.0001). Logistic regression of calcifediol treatment on ICU admission, adjusted by age, gender, linearized 25OHD levels at baseline, and comorbidities showed that treated patients had a reduced risk to require ICU (OR 0.13 [95% CI 0.07;0.23]). Overall mortality was 10%. In the Intention-to-Treat analysis, 21 (4.7%) out of 447 patients treated with calcifediol at admission died compared to 62 patients (15.9%) out of 391 non-treated (p=0.0001). Adjusted results showed a reduced mortality risk with an OR 0.21 [95% CI 0.10; 0.43]). In the second analysis, the obtained OR was 0.52 [95% CI 0.27;0.99].

The novelty of the recent COVID-19 outbreak has led patients to turn more frequently to the internet to gather more information and to alleviate their concerns about the virus. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to (1) determine the most commonly searched phrases related to COVID-19 in the United States and (2) identify the sources of information for these web searches. METHODS: Search terms related to COVID-19 were entered into Google. Questions and websites from Google web search were extracted to a database using customized software. Each question was categorized into one of 6 topics: clinical signs and symptoms, treatment, transmission, cleaning methods, activity modification, and policy. Additionally, the websites were categorized according to source: World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), non-CDC government, academic, news, and other media. RESULTS: In total, 200 questions and websites were extracted. The most common question topic was transmission (n=63, 31.5%), followed by clinical signs and symptoms (n=54, 27.0%) and activity modification (n=31, 15.5%). Notably, the clinical signs and symptoms category captured questions about myths associated with the disease, such as whether consuming alcohol stops the coronavirus. The most common websites provided were maintained by the CDC, the WHO, and academic medical organizations. Collectively, these three sources accounted for 84.0% (n=168) of the websites in our sample.

Infected healthcare workers do not go back to work until RT-PCR has demonstrated that the virus is no longer present in the upper respiratory tract. The aim of this study is to determine the most efficient time to perform RT-PCR prior to healthcare workers' reincorporation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cohort study of healthcare workers with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Data were collected using the medical charts of healthcare workers and completed with a telephone interview. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to determine the influence of several variables on the time to RT-PCR negativisation. The impact of the variables on survival was assessed using the Breslow test. A Cox regression model was developed including the associated variables. RESULTS: 159 subjects with a positive RT-PCR out of 374 workers with suspected COVID-19 were included. The median time to negativisation was 25 days from symptom onset (IQR 20-35 days). Presence of IgG, dyspnoea, cough and throat pain were associated with significant longer time to negativisation. Cox logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. Only dyspnoea and cough remained in the model as significant determinants of prolonged negativisation time. Adjusted HRs were 0.68 (0.48-096) for dyspnoea and 0.61 (0.42-0.88) for dry cough. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR during the first 3 weeks leads to a high percentage of positive results. In the presence of respiratory symptoms, negativisation took nearly 1 week more.

The results of cross-virus-neutralization tests and phylogenetic analysis of the S1 subunit of spike gene of these vaccine strains and other reference strains showed that strain LJL/110302 was of GI-19 lineage, whereas LLN/111169 was of the GI-1 lineage of the Conn serotype. Further comparative genomic analysis revealed that LLN/111169, an IBV strain with novel traits, originated from multiple recombination events (at least 3 recombination sites) between GI-19 and the Conn and 4/91 vaccine strains. LLN/111169 was pathogenic to specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. This is of prime importance because while IBV prevention measures worldwide are mainly dependent on modified live vaccine strains, our results showed that recombination between field and vaccine strains has produced a novel pathogenic IBV strain.

However, although highly immunogenic in natural infection, core appears to have low immunogenicity in experimental settings. We aimed to design an HCV vaccine prototype based on core, and devise immunization regimens that would lead to potent anti-core immune responses which circumvent the immunogenicity limitations earlier observed. METHODS: Plasmids encoding core with no translation initiation signal (pCMVcore); with Kozak sequence (pCMVcoreKozak); and with HCV IRES (pCMVcoreIRES) were designed and expressed in a variety of eukaryotic cells. Polyproteins corresponding to HCV 1b amino acids (aa) 1C98 and 1C173 were expressed in E. coli. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with four 25-g doses of pCMVcoreKozak, or pCMV (I). BALB/c mice were immunized with 100 g of either pCMVcore, or pCMVcoreKozak, or pCMVcoreIRES, or empty pCMV (II). Lastly, BALB/c mice were immunized with 20 g of core aa 1C98 in prime and boost, or with 100 g of pCMVcoreKozak in prime and 20 g of core aa 1C98 in boost (III). Antibody response, [(3)H]-T-incorporation, and cytokine secretion by core/core peptide-stimulated splenocytes were assessed after each immunization. RESULTS: Plasmids differed in core-expression capacity: mouse fibroblasts transfected with pCMVcore, pCMVcoreIRES and pCMVcoreKozak expressed 0.22  0.18, 0.83  0.5, and 13  5 ng core per cell, respectively. Single immunization with highly expressing pCMVcoreKozak induced specific IFN- and IL-2, and weak antibody response. Single immunization with plasmids directing low levels of core expression induced similar levels of cytokines, strong T-cell proliferation (pCMVcoreIRES), and antibodies in titer 10(3)(pCMVcore). Boosting with pCMVcoreKozak induced low antibody response, core-specific T-cell proliferation and IFN- secretion that subsided after the 3rd plasmid injection. The latter also led to a decrease in specific IL-2 secretion. The best was the heterologous pCMVcoreKozak prime/protein boost regimen that generated mixed Th1/Th2-cellular response with core-specific antibodies in titer  3  10(3). CONCLUSION: Thus, administration of highly expressed HCV core gene, as one large dose or repeated injections of smaller doses, may suppress core-specific immune response. Instead, the latter is induced by a heterologous DNA prime/protein boost regimen that circumvents the negative effects of intracellular core expression.","output":"Enhancement of the expression of HCV core gene does not enhance core-specific immune response in DNA immunization: advantages of the heterologous DNA prime, protein boost immunization regimen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the COVID-19 confinement, we converted our clinical simulation sessions into simulated video consultations.

A learned association between mood and eating may cultivate frequent food cravings, detracting from health goals. Training in mindful eating may target this cycle of emotion-craving-eating by teaching individuals to manage urges when experiencing negative mood. We examined the impact of a mobile mindful eating intervention on the link between negative mood and food cravings among overweight women. METHODS: In a single-arm trial, participants (n = 64, M age = 46.1 years, M BMI = 31.5 kg/m(2)) completed ecological momentary assessments of negative mood and food cravings 3 times/day for 3 days pre- and post-intervention, as well as 1-month post-intervention. Using multilevel linear regression, we compared associations between negative mood and food craving strength at pre- vs. post-intervention (model 1) and post-intervention vs. 1-month follow-up (model 2). RESULTS: In model 1, negative mood interacted with time point ( = ? .20, SE = .09, p = .02, 95% CI [? .38, ? .03]) to predict craving strength, indicating that the within-person association between negative mood and craving strength was significantly weaker at post-intervention ( = 0.18) relative to pre-intervention ( = 0.38). In model 2, negative mood did not interact with time point to predict craving strength ( = .13, SE = .09, p = .10, 95% CI ? .03, .31]); the association did not significantly differ between post-intervention and 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Training in mindful eating weakened the mood-craving association from pre- to post-intervention. The weakened association remained at follow-up. Our findings highlight the mood-craving link as a target-worthy mechanism of mindful eating that should be assessed in clinical trials.

The underlying immune biology is incompletely understood. METHODS We performed comparative mRNA expression profiling of 31 ALK-positive, 40 EGFR-positive and 43 ALK/EGFR-negative lung ADC focused on immune gene expression. The presence and levels of tumor infiltration lymphocytes (TILs) as well as fourteen specific immune cell populations were estimated from the gene expression profiles. RESULTS While total TILs were not lower in ALK-positive and EGFR-positive tumors compared to ALK/EGFR-negative tumors, specific immunosuppressive characteristics were detected in both subgroups: In ALK-positive tumors, regulatory T cells were significantly higher compared to EGFR-positive (fold change: FC = 1.9, p = 0.0013) and ALK/EGFR-negative tumors (FC = 2.1, p = 0.00047). In EGFR-positive tumors, cytotoxic cells were significantly lower compared to ALK-positive (FC = - 1.7, p = 0.016) and to ALK/EGFR-negative tumors (FC = - 2.1, p = 2.0E-05). A total number of 289 genes, 40 part of cytokine-cytokine receptor signaling, were differentially expressed between the three subgroups. Among the latter, five genes were differently expressed in both ALK-positive and EGFR-positive tumors, while twelve genes showed differential expression solely in ALK-positive tumors and eleven genes solely in EGFR-positive tumors. CONCLUSION Targeted gene expression profiling is a promising tool to read out tumor microenvironment characteristics from routine diagnostic lung cancer biopsies. Significant immune reactivity including specific immunosuppressive characteristics in ALK- and EGFR-positive lung ADC, but not a total absence of immune infiltration supports further clinical evaluation of immune-modulators as partners of ICB in such tumors.","output":"Deciphering the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in ALK- and EGFR-positive lung adenocarcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy combined with appropriate patient selection (image-based selection of acute ischaemic stroke patients with large artery occlusion) yields improved clinical outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, with trial sequential analysis to understand the benefits, risks and impact of new trials reporting in 2016 on the magnitude/certainty of the estimates for clinical effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy. Method Random effects' models were conducted of randomised clinical trials comparing mechanical thrombectomy (stent retriever or aspiration devices) with/without adjuvant intravenous thrombolysis with intravenous thrombolysis and other forms of best medical/supportive care in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke. Study inclusion and risk of bias were assessed independently by two reviewers. Functional independence (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) and mortality at 90 days, including symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage rate were extracted. Trial sequential analysis established the strength of the evidence derived from the meta-analyses. Findings Eight trials of mechanical thrombectomy with a total sample size of 1841 (916 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy and 925 treated without mechanical thrombectomy) fulfilled review inclusion criteria. The three most recent trials more precisely defined the effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2; OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.70 to 2.51 based on data from eight trials versus OR = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.88 to 3.04 based on data from five trials). Meta-analyses showed no effect on mortality (OR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.61 to 1.07) or symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 0.80 to 1.85) as found in analysis of first five trials. Trial sequential analysis indicated that the information size requirement was fulfilled to conclude the evidence for mechanical thrombectomy is robust. Discussion The impact of three recent trials on effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy was a more precise pooled effect size for functional independence. Trial sequential analysis demonstrated sufficient evidence for effectiveness and safety of mechanical thrombectomy. Conclusion No further trials of mechanical thrombectomy versus no mechanical thrombectomy are indicated to establish clinical effectiveness. Uncertainty remains as to whether mechanical thrombectomy reduces mortality or increases risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage.","output":"Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy stent retrievers and aspiration devices in the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We carry on an analysis of the size of the contact surface of a Cheeger set $E$ with the boundary of its ambient space $\\\\Omega$.

In the case of existing equipment, 50% of the aerosol is lost to the atmosphere through the vent, during the exhalation phase of respiration. Desired effects of nebulization may not be achieved by neglecting this poor administration technique. There may be adverse effects like bronchospasm and exposure to high drug concentrations. METHODS: The proposed nebulizer is composed of two modes as Compressed Air mode and the Oxygen Therapy mode. The automated triggering from one mode to another will be dependent upon the percentage of oxygen saturation of the patient, monitored from the SpO(2) sensor. The compressed airflow will be delivered to the patient according to the minute ventilation, derived with the aid of a temperature sensorCbased algorithm. The compressor controller circuitry ensures that the patient receives optimum level of compressed air as per the flow rate. At the end of the drug delivery, if the liquid level sensor detects the absence of medication within the nebulizer chamber, the nebulization process will be terminated. The dynamic regulation of the motor speed with respect to the minute ventilation was accomplished. RESULTS: A laminar flow was obtained from the outlet of the compressor towards the nebulizer tubing, and a turbulent flow was obtained within the chamber. No excessive turbulent flows or rotational flow patterns were detected. CONCLUSION: Detecting the drug levels in the nebulizing chamber will prevent continuous workup and useful in situations where back-to-back nebulization is required. Oxygen therapy mode identifies the patients desaturation and important where the patient can be already hypoxic or have a ventilation-perfusion mismatch, but may be disadvantageous in severe COPD patients.

However, the relationships between these SDOH and COVID-19 spatial outbreaks have yet to be determined. We conducted spatial analyses with geographic information systems (GIS) mapping of county-level SDOH and regional COVID-19 infection outbreaks to demonstrate the most impactful SDOH and to provide a pragmatic visual guide to prevent future outbreaks. Methods: We analyzed the geospatial associations of COVID-19 infections and SDOH to identify areas of overlap. Our sample comprised all patients in a North Carolina health care systems registry who tested positive for COVID-19 from March 2020-February 2021. Patients addresses were geo-referenced and analyzed by Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify population-dense outbreaks of COVID-19 (hotspots). A set of 12 SDOH variables for each county were collected from the American Community Survey (ACS-5) and the Economic Research Service. Principal Component Analysis was applied to SDOH variables in order to reduce dimensions down to 3 geographical SDOH categories: Protective SDOH, High-Risk SDOH and Increased Vulnerability for Infection (Table 1). Using Multivariate Clustering Analysis (MCA), three clusters of census tracts were categorized according to SDOH indicators: decreased social disparities (DSD), equivocal social disparities (ESD) and increased social disparities (ISD) (Image A). Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's Post-Hoc adjusted with Bonferroni were utilized to verify any difference in the proportion of patients residing in the different clusters (significance p<0.05). Results: A total of 13,733 patients were included in the study. The patients predominantly reside in Durham County (55.4%), are women (56.96%), and between 40 and 69 years old (41.9%). Further, patients are predominantly white (38.7%), non-Hispanic (79.63%), and single (49.6%). The concomitant analysis of KDE and MCA showed an overlap of COVID-19 hotspots with areas of ISD (Image B). The MCA revealed that there are 308 census tracts constituted by six counties, in which 40 form ISD clusters (vs. 109 ESD;vs. 159 DSD). In addition, ISD clusters have the highest rates of infection, with 179.8 patients per 10,000 (vs. 81.7 ESD;vs. 60.1 DSD). The ISD cluster was the most densely populated and was significantly more densely populated from the ESD and DSD clusters (p=0.01). Conclusion: In this sampling of COVID-19 patients, a disproportionate amount of patients come from areas with increased social disparities, suggesting further research and health policy will need to be directed towards addressing negative and vulnerability SDOH to curtail pandemic-related outbreaks.

Taking into account the special medical and social significance of oncological diseases, as well as taking into account that patients suffering from neoplasms are a special risk group for developing complications of coronavirus infection, it seems relevant to study the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of morbidity and hospital lethality of patients with neoplasms. Aims ' to study the trends of morbidity and hospital lethality due to neoplasms in the Russian Federation before and during the pandemic of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19. Methods. The indicators of primary and general morbidity, hospital lethality from neoplasms of the adult population were calculated on the basis of federal statistical observation data contained in reporting forms No. 12 and No. 14 of all subjects of the Russian Federation for 2015-2020. Results. During the period from 2015 to 2019, an increase in the general (by 14.8%) and primary (by 4.8%) incidence of neoplasms was noted in the Russian Federation. In 2020, compared with 2019, on the contrary, the indicators of general (by 5.0%) and primary (by 17.4%) incidence of neoplasms decreased. Hospital lethality due to neoplasms also increased during 2015-2019, in total it increased by 19.2%, in one year (2020) hospital lethality increased by 6.6%. A similar situation has developed in all federal districts and most regions of the country. Conclusions. The decline in the incidence of neoplasms in 2020, with their previous continuous growth, reflects the difficult situation that has developed during the pandemic of a new coronavirus infection in the healthcare of the Russian Federation. The increase in hospital lethality from neoplasms indicates a more severe course of coronavirus infection in adult patients with malignant neoplasms and a more frequent development of fatal complications in them. ? 2021 Izdatel'stvo Meditsina.

By single-molecule long-read isoform sequencing (SMRT-seq), here we report a total of 26,153,342 subreads (21.24 Gb) and 330,371 circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads after the modification of site mismatch, and 35,414 unigenes were successfully collected. To gain deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms of L. kaempferi response to drought stress, we combined Illumina HiSeq with SMRT-seq to decode full-length transcripts. In this study, we report 27 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the perception and transmission of drought stress signals in L. kaempferi. A large number of DEGs responding to drought stress were detected in L. kaempferi, especially DEGs involved in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, lignin biosynthesis, and sugar metabolism, and DEGs encoding drought stress proteins. We detected 73 transcription factors (TFs) under drought stress, including AP2/ERF, bZIP, TCP, and MYB.

First, most literature is examining the impacts of digitalisation on the HE sector and its subjects alone. I argue that current changes in digitalising HE cannot be studied in isolation from broader changes in the global economy. Specifically, HE digitalisation is embedded in the expansion of the digital economy, which is marked by new forms of value extraction and rentiership. Second, the emerging research on the intersection of marketisation and digitalisation in HE seems to follow the theories of marketisation qua production and commodification. I argue that we need theories with better explanatory power in analysing the current digitalisation dynamics. I propose to move from commodification to assetisation, and from prices to rents. Finally, universities are digitalising in the time when the practice is superseding policy, and there is no regulation beyond the question of data privacy. However, digital data property is already a reality, governed by terms of use, and protected by the intellectual property rights regime. The current pandemic has led to emergency pedagogy, which has intensified overall digitalisation in the sector and is bypassing concerns of data value redistribution.

Moreover, 86% of fatalities concentrated in four Northern Italy regions. The 'explosive' outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardia at the very beginning of pandemic fatally biased the R-like statistics routinely used to control the disease dynamics. To (at least partially) overcome this bias, we propose a new index RI = dH/dI (daily derivative ratio of H and I, given H = Healed and I = Infected), corresponding to the ratio between healed and infected patients relative daily changes. The proposed index is less flawed than R by the uncertainty related to the estimated number of infected persons and allows to follow (and possibly forecast) epidemic dynamics in a largely model-independent way. To analyze the dynamics of the epidemic, starting from the beginning of the virus spreading-when data are insufficient to make an estimate by adopting SIR model-a \\"sigmoidal family with delay\\" logistic model was introduced.

METHODS: Essential workers were selected from a seroprevalence survey cohort in Geneva, Switzerland and were linked to a state centralised registry compiling SARS-CoV-2 infections. Primary outcome was the incidence of virologically confirmed infections from serological assessment (between May and September 2020) to 25 January 2021, according to baseline antibody status and stratified by three predefined occupational groups (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity, involving brief regular contact or others). RESULTS: 10 457 essential workers were included (occupations requiring sustained physical proximity accounted for 3057 individuals, those involving regular brief contact, 3645 and 3755 workers were classified under 'Other essential occupations'). After a follow-up period of over 27 weeks, 5 (0.6%) seropositive and 830 (8.5%) seronegative individuals had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, with an incidence rate of 0.2 (95% CI 0.1 to 0.6) and 3.2 (95% CI 2.9 to 3.4) cases per person-week, respectively. Incidences were similar across occupational groups. Seropositive essential workers had a 93% reduction in the hazard (HR of 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17) of having a positive test during the follow-up with no significant between-occupational group difference. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-fold reduction in the hazard of being virologically tested positive was observed among anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositive essential workers regardless of their sector of occupation, confirming the seroprotective effect of a previous SARS-CoV2 exposure at least 6 months after infection.","output":"Occupational risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and reinfection during the second pandemic surge: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]she makes an argument for an evidence-based direction: \\"The escalating cost of the aggregation of individual decisions within the health system makes it imperative that science address the urgent need for information about the link between health status and health service\\" (p. 20).

This study evaluated the effect of barriers when applied correctly and incorrectly on the radiant power (mW), irradiance (mW/cm2), emission spectrum (mW/nm), and beam profile from a multi-peak light-curing unit (LCU). Methods Five plastic barriers (VALO Grand, Ultradent; TIDIShield, TIDI Products; Disposa-Shield, Dentsply Sirona; Cure Sleeve, Kerr; Stretch and Seal, Betty Crocker) and one latex-based barrier (Curelastic, Steri-Shield) were tested. The radiant power (mW) and emission spectrum (mW/nm) from one multi-peak LCU (VALO Grand, Ultradent) was measured using an integrating sphere. LCU tip internal diameter (mm) was measured, then the tip area and irradiance (mW/cm2) were calculated. The beam profiles were measured using a laser beam profiler. Results When applied correctly, the plastic barriers reduced the radiant power output by 5C8%, and the latex-based barrier by 16 %. When the plastic seam or barrier opaque face was positioned over the LCU tip, the power output was reduced by 8C11%. When the plastic barriers were wrinkled, the power output was significantly reduced by 14C26%. The wrinkled latex-based barrier reduced by 28 %, and further reduced the violet light. The beam profiles illustrated the importance of correctly barrier use without wrinkles over the tip. Conclusions Plastic barriers applied correctly reduced the light output (mW) by 5C8 %.

Viruses and bacteria were identified by multiplex ligationCdependent probe amplification assay and conventional bacterial culture. RESULTS: The ILI incidence in the consecutive seasons was 7.2% and 11.6%, and influenza virus caused 18.9% and 34.2% of ILI episodes. Potential pathogen were detected in 80% of the ILI events with influenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza viruses, and Haemophilus influenzae being the most common.

We have developed a rapid homogenous approach for antibody detection termed LFRET (protein L-based time-resolved F?rster resonance energy transfer immunoassay). In LFRET, fluorophore-labeled protein L and antigen are brought to close proximity by antigen-specific patient immunoglobulins of any isotype, resulting in TR-FRET signal. We set up LFRET assays for antibodies against SP and NP and evaluated their diagnostic performance using a panel of 77 serum/plasma samples from 44 individuals with COVID-19 and 52 negative controls. Moreover, using a previously described SP and a novel NP construct, we set up enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 SP and NP. We then compared the LFRET assays with these ELISAs and with a SARS-CoV-2 microneutralization test (MNT). We found the LFRET assays to parallel ELISAs in sensitivity (90-95% vs. 90-100%) and specificity (100% vs. 94-100%).

Therefore, the present study tested an explorative sequential mediation model regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as a global natural experiment and hypothesized that fear and depression would be serial mediators of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and emotional eating. An online cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was adopted. A total of 362 participants were recruited from Turkey, and each completed a battery of demographic questions and psychometric scales. The standardized instruments used to test the model's constructs were the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21. The model was tested using a bootstrapping method utilizing IBM AMOS 24 software. Results showed that emotional eating was positively associated with intolerance of uncertainty, fear of COVID-19, and depression. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 had positive correlation with intolerance of uncertainty and depression. Significant negative association was also found between age and intolerance of uncertainty. In addition, females significantly reported higher levels of emotional eating and fear of COVID-19 than males. The study's hypothesized sequential mediation model was further supported. It is concluded that depression most likely developed by fear was triggered by intolerance of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic and leading to emotional eating. The study is significant because it advances theories of emotional eating with an investigation examining some of its underlying mechanisms. Also, it is one of a few research studies highlighting to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic-related cognitions and emotions are associated with maladaptive behaviors in the case of emotional eating.","output":"The Mediating Effects of Fear of COVID-19 and Depression on the Association Between Intolerance of Uncertainty and Emotional Eating During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the initial phase of pandemics, swift behavioral responses by individuals, such as social distancing, can temper the speed and magnitude of further infections.

However, the focus on downstream individual-level behavioural approaches to reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity does not account for the SDH and the complexity and contestedness of obesity and pays insufficient attention to how proposals will help to reduce inequalities. Our findings illustrate that individualising of responsibility to respond to what wider evidence shows is structural inequalities, can perpetuate damaging narratives and lead to ineffective interventions, providing caution to academics, practitioners and policy makers (local and national), of the power of problem representation. Our findings also show that the problem framing in The Policy risks reducing important public health aims to encourage healthy diets and increase opportunities for physical activity (and the physical and mental health benefits of both) for children to weight management with a focus on particular children. CONCLUSIONS: We propose an alternative conceptualisation of the policy problem, that obesity rates are illustrative of inequality, arguing there needs to be policy focus on the structural and factors that maintain health inequalities, including poverty and food insecurity. We hope that our findings can be used to challenge and strengthen future policy development, leading to more effective action against health inequalities and intervention-generated inequalities in health.

METHODS: This is the protocol for a study being conducted at an academic hospital in Brazil with 300 adult ICU beds dedicated to COVID-19 patients. We will include adult patients admitted to the ICU with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 during the study period. The main outcome is ICU survival at 28 days. Data will be collected prospectively and retrospectively by trained investigators from the hospitals electronic medical records, using an electronic data capture tool. We will collect data on demographics, comorbidities, severity of disease, and laboratorial test results at admission. Information on the need for advanced life support and ventilator parameters will be collected during ICU stay. Patients will be followed up for 28 days in the ICU and 60 days in the hospital. We will plot Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate ICU and hospital survival and perform survival analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model to identify the main risk factors for mortality.

An analogue of end-tidal concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is measuring exhausted isoflurane concentration from the oxygenator as an estimate to blood and, so, brain concentration. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between oxygenator exhaust and blood concentrations of isoflurane and the BIS score during CPB when administering isoflurane into the sweep gas supply to the oxygenator. METHODS Seventeen patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery using CPB and isoflurane with BIS monitoring were recruited in a single-centre university hospital. Isoflurane gas was delivered via a calibrated vaporiser at the beginning of anaesthetic induction. Radial arterial blood samples were collected after the initiation of CPB and before aortic cross-clamping, which were analysed for isoflurane by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The BIS score and the concentration of exhausted isoflurane from the oxygenator membrane, as measured by an anaesthetic gas analyser, were recorded at the time of blood sampling. RESULTS The mean duration of anaesthetic induction to arterial blood sampling was 90 min (95%CI: 80,100). On CPB, the median BIS was 39 (range, 7-43) and the mean oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was 1.24  0.21%. No significant correlation was demonstrated between BIS with arterial isoflurane concentration (r=-0.19, p=0.47) or oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration (r=0.07, p=0.80). Mixed-venous blood temperature was moderately correlated to BIS (r=0.50, p=0.04). Oxygenator exhaust isoflurane concentration was moderately, positively correlated with its arterial concentration (r=0.64, p<0.01). DISCUSSION In conclusion, in patients undergoing heart surgery with CPB, the findings of this study indicate that, whilst oxygenator exhaust concentrations were significantly associated with arterial concentrations of isoflurane, neither had any association with the BIS scores, whereas body temperature has moderate positive correlation.","output":"Assessing the depth of isoflurane anaesthesia during cardiopulmonary bypass."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has significantly impacted Michigan, with over 60,000 cases and 5,700 deaths to date During the surge, Metropolitan Detroit was the epicenter of the outbreak, accounting for 80% of cases and 86% of deaths statewide Healthcare workers (HCW) are particularly at risk;however, rates of infection based on job category has not been described previously in the United States We describe the impact of the outbreak on our workforce Background Michigan COVID Methods: This was a retrospective review of employees with COVID-19 at Henry Ford Health System (HFHS), a comprehensive, integrated, health care organization in Southeast Michigan includes 5 hospitals and 9 emergency departments from 3/10/2020-6/10/2020 Employees exhibiting symptoms and/or signs consistent with COVID-19 infection were referred to employee health and tested for SARS-CoV-2 All employees with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of upper respiratory tract were included Data were obtained from a dedicated analytics dashboard that tracked all testing and results for employees Rate (number positives/total tested) of infection for each job category was determined Results: A total 5352 (16%) of 33538 employees were tested, of whom 1036 (19%) tested positive The number of infected workers represents approximately 3 1 % of the workforce The sharp increase of COVID-19 admissions correlated with the rise in HCW COVID-19 positivity (Figure 1) The number of HCW tested largely correlated with the disease burden at each hospital (Figure2) Table 1 shows total population of symptomatic HCW tested and demonstrates volume of testing and positivity were higher among HCW with close patient contact The positivity rates in specific clinical support staff are shown in Table 2 Notably, there were high rates of positivity among non-clinical business and management employees tested suggesting community-transmission Conclusion: COVID-19 risk is highest among HCW in high volume settings with close patient contact Community exposure may be an important factor that contributes to this risk Strategies to minimize transmission in healthcare settings should be combined with HCW education emphasizing measures to avoid exposure within the community (Figure Presented)","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers in Southeast Michigan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) may require device-aided therapies (DAT) for adequate symptom control. However, long-term, real-world efficacy and safety data are limited. This study aims to describe real-world, long-term treatment persistence for patients with PD treated with levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG). The study also aims to describe patient profiles, treatment discontinuation rates, co-medication patterns, monotherapy rates, and rates of healthcare visits and their associated costs for patients receiving all forms of DAT (deep brain stimulation [DBS], continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion [CSAI], or LCIG). METHODS: In this retrospective analysis of the Israeli Maccabi Healthcare Services database, adult patients with PD were analyzed in three cohorts, based on DAT (DBS, CSAI, or LCIG). The primary endpoint was LCIG treatment persistence 12 months after initiation. RESULTS: This analysis included 161 DAT-treated patients (LCIG, n = 62; DBS, n = 76; CSAI, n = 23). Among those who discontinued, the mean time to discontinuation was 86.4 months for LCIG and 42.4 months for CSAI (p = 0.046). Twelve months after initiation, 14.3% LCIG, 10.7% DBS, and 5.9% CSAI patients were not receiving any additional anti-parkinsonian therapy. At the last recorded visit, 28.6% LCIG, 13.3% DBS, and 5.9% CSAI patients received DAT as monotherapy. During the first 12 months after initiation, 45.2% LCIG, 65.2% CSAI, and 1.3% DBS patients had no reported hospitalization days. Annual healthcare visit costs decreased following LCIG initiation (US$9491 vs. $8146) and increased following DBS ($4113 vs. $7677) and CSAI ($6378 vs. $8277). CONCLUSION: DAT are well maintained in patients with advanced PD. These retrospective data suggest that patients receiving LCIG may have higher long-term persistence rates compared with patients receiving CSAI. A subgroup of patients was treated with DAT as monotherapy without additional oral anti-parkinsonian therapy, with LCIG showing the highest rates.","output":"Long-Term Persistence and Monotherapy with Device-Aided Therapies: A Retrospective Analysis of an Israeli Cohort of Patients with Advanced Parkinson's Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE In order to evaluate future  cell tracers in vivo, we aimed to develop a standardized in vivo method allowing semiquantitative measurement of a prospective  cell tracer within the pancreas.

Semiquantitative measurement of the imaging results was performed using [(123)I]IPA to delineate the pancreas and [(111)In]Ex3 as a  cell tracer. RESULTS The uptake of [(123)I]IPA was highest in the pancreas. Aside from the kidneys, the uptake of [(111)In]Ex3 was highest in the pancreas and lungs. Autoradiography showed only uptake of [(111)In]Ex3 in insulin-expressing cells. Semiquantitative measurement of [(111)In]Ex3 in the SPECT images based on the delineation of the pancreas with [(123)I]IPA showed a high correlation with the [(111)In]Ex3 uptake data of the pancreas obtained by dissection.

Circulating and kidney resident myeloid and lymphoid cells are all equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Recent reports on PRRs show kidney overexpression of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in inflammaging autoimmune renal diseases, vasculitis, acute kidney injury and kidney transplant rejection. TLR upregulation leads to proinflammatory cytokine induction, fibrosis, and chronic kidney disease progression. TLR2 blockade in a murine model of renal ischemia reperfusion injury prevented the escape of natural killer cells and neutrophils by inflammaging kidney injury.

METHODS: We surveyed adults who underwent COVID-19 testing between March 1, 2020 and October 21, 2020 who agreed to be directly contacted about COVID-19-related research about their perspectives on receiving test results via a patient portal. We evaluated user roles (i.e., patient vs. care partner), demographic information, ease of use, impact of immediate release, notification of results, impact of viewing results on health management, and importance of sharing results with others. RESULTS: Users were mostly patients themselves. Users found the portal easy to use but expressed mixed preferences about the means of notification of result availability (e.g., email, text, or phone call). Users found immediate access to results useful for managing their health, employment, and family/childcare. Many users shared their results and encouraged others to get tested.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 48 clinically and laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were obtained from King Fahad Hospital, Medina (KFHM) between 27th April 2020 to 25th May 2020. The patients' demographics and severity of COVID-19 disease were assessed using 39 clinical and biochemical features. After excluding the demographics, 35 predicting features were included in the analysis (diabetes, chronic disease, viral and bacterial co-infections, PCR cycle number, ICU admission, clot formation, cardiac enzymes elevation, hematology profile, sugar levels in the blood, as well as liver and kidney tests, etc.). Logistic regression, stepwise logistic regression, L-2 logistic regression, L-2 stepwise logistic regression, and L-2 best subset logistic regression were applied to model the features. The consistency index was used with kernel Support-Vector Machines (SVM) for the identification of associated markers. RESULTS: L-2 best subset logistic regression technique outperformed all other fitted models for modeling COVID-19 disease severity by achieving an accuracy of 88% over the test data. Consistency index over L-2 best subset logistic regression identified 14 associated markers that can best predict the COVID-19 severity among COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: A multilevel framework informed interview guide development. Using purposeful sampling, we recruited study participants who were (1) able to speak English or Spanish and (2) resided or employed in Washington Heights or the South Bronx. Participants included community leaders (local government officials, community board members, and employees from community- and faith-based organizations) as well as community members. Trained research staff conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews. Using immersion/crystallization and template style coding, the study team performed thematic analysis until no new relevant themes emerged. RESULTS: Among the 19 female study participants, perceived facilitators to SSB policy and program implementation included sustained partnerships with broad coalitions; continual education and clear messaging; and increased accessibility to healthier beverages. Perceived barriers included systems-level challenges accessing programs that support healthy beverage options, and individual-level lack of access to affordable healthy beverages. Acceptable potential intervention strategies included messaging that emphasizes health in pregnancy and infancy; policies that require healthy beverages as the default option in restaurants; and policies that remove SSBs from childcare settings. Some strongly favored SSB excise taxes while others opposed them, but all participants supported reinvestment of SSB tax revenue into health resources among marginalized communities.

QVIR was evaluated in vitro for its anti-CHIKV potential. QVIR showed strong inhibition of CHIKV infection with an EC(50) (50% effective concentration) value of 2.2  0.49 M without significant cytotoxicity (CC(50) > 200 M) and was chosen for further elucidation of its antiviral mechanism. The infectious viral particle formation was abolished by approximately 72% at a QVIR concentration of 20 M during infection in the BHK-21 cell line, and the CHIKV RNA synthesis was diminished by 84% for nsP2 as well as 74% for E2, whereas the levels of viral proteins were decreased by 69.9% for nsP2 and 53.9% for E2. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed a huge decline in the expression of viral nsP2 and E2 proteins by 71.84 and 67.7%, respectively.

The present study advocates for the first time that QVIR acts as a substantial and potent inhibitor against CHIKV and might be as an auspicious novel drug candidate for the development of therapeutic agents against CHIKV infections.","output":"Inhibition of Chikungunya Virus Infection by 4-Hydroxy-1-Methyl-3-(3-morpholinopropanoyl)quinoline-2(1H)-one (QVIR) Targeting nsP2 and E2 Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic and lockdown control measures threatened to disrupt routine childhood immunisation programmes with early reports suggesting uptake would fall. In response, public health bodies in Scotland and England collected national data for childhood immunisations on a weekly or monthly basis to allow for rapid analysis of trends. The aim of this study was to use these data to assess the impact of different phases of the pandemic on infant and preschool immunisation uptake rates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted an observational study using routinely collected data for the year prior to the pandemic (2019) and immediately before (22 January to March 2020), during (23 March to 26 July), and after (27 July to 4 October) the first UK lockdown. Data were obtained for Scotland from the Public Health Scotland COVID19 wider impacts on the health care system dashboard and for England from ImmForm. Five vaccinations delivered at different ages were evaluated; 3 doses of 6-in-1 diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B vaccine (DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB) and 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. This represented 439,754 invitations to be vaccinated in Scotland and 4.1 million for England. Uptake during the 2020 periods was compared to the previous year (2019) using binary logistic regression analysis. For Scotland, uptake within 4 weeks of a child becoming eligible by age was analysed along with geographical region and indices of deprivation. For Scotland and England, we assessed whether immunisations were up-to-date at approximately 6 months (all doses 6-in-1) and 16 to 18 months (first MMR) of age. We found that uptake within 4 weeks of eligibility in Scotland for all the 5 vaccines was higher during lockdown than in 2019. Differences ranged from 1.3% for first dose 6-in-1 vaccine (95.3 versus 94%, odds ratio [OR] compared to 2019 1.28, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.18 to 1.39) to 14.3% for second MMR dose (66.1 versus 51.8%, OR compared to 2019 1.8, 95% CI 1.74 to 1.87). Significant increases in uptake were seen across all deprivation levels. In England, fewer children due to receive their immunisations during the lockdown period were up to date at 6 months (6-in-1) or 18 months (first dose MMR). The fall in percentage uptake ranged from 0.5% for first 6-in-1 (95.8 versus 96.3%, OR compared to 2019 0.89, 95% CI 0.86C to 0.91) to 2.1% for third 6-in-1 (86.6 versus 88.7%, OR compared to 2019 0.82, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.83). The use of routinely collected data used in this study was a limiting factor as detailed information on potential confounding factors were not available and we were unable to eliminate the possibility of seasonal trends in immunisation uptake. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that the national lockdown in Scotland was associated with an increase in timely childhood immunisation uptake; however, in England, uptake fell slightly. Reasons for the improved uptake in Scotland may include active measures taken to promote immunisation at local and national levels during this period and should be explored further. Promoting immunisation uptake and addressing potential vaccine hesitancy is particularly important given the ongoing pandemic and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.","output":"Uptake of infant and preschool immunisations in Scotland and England during the COVID-19 pandemic: An observational study of routinely collected data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is still spreading worldwide and posing a threat to individuals' physical and mental health including problematic internet use (PIU). A potentially high-risk group for PIU are those with symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity (ADHD symptoms), because of restrictions in their physical activity levels and engagement in computer diversions requiring only short attention spans. METHODS: We used convenience sampling in a cross-sectional survey of university students from 30 universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. We assessed PIU using the Internet Addiction Test and ADHD symptoms using the WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Screening Scale. Using logistic regression and linear regression analyses we adjusted for demographic, epidemic-related and psychological covariates in models of the association between ADHD symptoms and PIU. RESULTS: Among 11,254 participants, we found a 28.4% (95% CI, 27.5%-29.2%) prevalence of PIU, relatively higher than before the pandemic. In our final logistic regression model, participants with ADHD symptoms had approximately two times the risk for PIU (OR: 2.31, 95% CI: 1.89-2.83). Similarly, individuals with depression, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD symptoms and feeling stress during the pandemic had a higher risk of PIU, while those exercising regularly during the pandemic had a lower risk. LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design and reliance on internet based self-reports for ADHD symptoms and PIU assessments, without direct structured interviews for validation, are limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of PIU was high during COVID-19, and those people with ADHD symptoms and other mental illness symptoms appear to be at higher risk of PIU. Regular exercise may reduce that PIU risk and hence should be recommended during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Association of Symptoms of Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity with Problematic Internet Use among University Students in Wuhan, China During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research note (RN) examines the drivers and consequences of proliferation of counterfeit (substandard and falsified) COVID-19 vaccines.

METHODS: We reviewed articles published in 2019-2021 using PubMed, Google Scholar, and CINAHL databases as an electronic database. Data obtained were pathophysiology and rehabilitation management of exercise intolerance in COVID-19 survivors. Types of the article were original articles and systematic or narrative reviews, both published and preprint articles. Articles that were written in English and freely accessible in pdf or HTML format were included. RESULTS: There were 28 articles eligible for this review. Pathophysiology, rehabilitation management, and both pathophysiology and rehabilitation management were explained in 7, 24, and 4 articles, consecutively. DISCUSSION: Exercise intolerance is caused by some pathological processes in the respiratory, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems as a result of systemic inflammation. Fatigue and shortness of breath during the activity were the most common symptom in the early phase of COVID-19 and persisted until the follow-up phase. Hospital admission, especially prolonged use of ventilators and immobilization worsen functional impairment resulting in persistent symptoms. Rehabilitation management begins with a functional assessment consisting of symptom assessment and physical examination of the body systems affected. The goals of rehabilitation management are to increase functional capacity, reduce symptoms, improve the ability to perform daily activities, facilitate social reintegration, and improve quality of life. Exercise is an effective intervention to reach these goals. Several studies recommend breathing, and aerobic exercises, as well as resistance exercises for peripheral and respiratory muscles, to improve symptoms and increase functional capacity.","output":"Pathophysiology and rehabilitation management of exercise intolerance in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 is an emerging pathogen that has caused a global pandemic, with New York City as one of its epicenters Data are still forthcoming if pregnant women are more vulnerable to COVID-19, as they are with influenza Additionally, it is not known if infants born to COVID-19 positive women are at risk of being infected at birth Methods: In March 2020, our hospital instituted a policy of testing all pregnant women presenting for active labor and scheduled C-section or induction of labor, with a nasopharyngeal swab that was sent for RT-PCR qualitative SARSCoV- 2 assay (Roche Cobas? 6800) Upon birth, infants were also tested, unless the parent did not give consent We retrospectively reviewed the COVID-19 test results of all pregnant women and their infants, from March 23 through May 31, 2020 using our infection control surveillance system (VigiLanz?)

A well-designed and effective instrument in the technological toolbox is of utmost importance to overcome the pandemic. METHOD: A multi-methodological design science research approach was applied. In three development and evaluation cycles, we presented, prototyped, and tested user-centered ideas of functional and design improvement. The applied procedure contains (1) a survey featuring 1993 participants from Germany for evaluating the current app, (2) a gathering of recommendations from epidemiologists and from a focus group discussion with IT and health experts identifying relevant functional requirements, and (3) an online survey combined with testing our prototype with 53 participants to evaluate the enhanced tracing app. RESULTS: This contribution presents 14 identified issues of the German COVID-19 tracing app, six meta-requirements, and three design principles for COVID-19 tracing apps and future pandemic apps (e.g., more user involvement and transparency). Using an interactive prototype, this study presents an extended pandemic app, containing 13 potential front-end (i.e., information on the regional infection situation, education and health literacy, crowd and event notification) and six potential back-end functional requirements (i.e., ongoing modification of risk score calculation, indoor versus outdoor). In addition, a user story approach for the COVID-19 tracing app was derived from the findings, supporting a holistic development approach. CONCLUSION: Throughout this study, practical relevant findings can be directly transferred to the German and other international COVID-19 tracing applications. Moreover, we apply our findings to crisis management theoryparticularly pandemic-related appsand derive interdisciplinary learnings. It might be recommendable for the involved decision-makers and stakeholders to forego classic application management and switch to using an agile setup, which allows for a more flexible reaction to upcoming changes. It is even more important for governments to have a well-established, flexible, design-oriented process for creating and adapting technology to handle a crisis, as this pandemic will not be the last one.

The COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic contraction are negatively impacting multiple dimensions of poverty and jeopardising this progress. This paper uses recent assessments of food insecurity and school closures made by UN agencies to inform microsimulations of potential short-term impacts of the pandemic under alternative scenarios. These simulations use the nationally representative datasets underlying the 2020 update of the global MPI. Because these datasets were collected in various years before the pandemic, we develop models to translate the simulated impacts to 2020. Our approach accounts for the country-specific joint distribution of deprivations in the simulations, recent poverty reduction trends, and resulting differences in the responsiveness of the global MPI to the scenarios. Aggregating results across 70 countries that account for 89% of the global poor according to the 2020 global MPI, we find that the potential setback to multidimensional poverty reduction is between 3.6 and 9.9 years under the alternative scenarios. We argue that the extent to which such disruptions result in persistent increases of poverty and deprivations may be attenuated by appropriate policy responses.","output":"Global multidimensional poverty and COVID-19: A decade of progress at risk?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Para athletes reap significant health benefits from sport but are vulnerable to non-accidental harms.

With a series of worked examples for a notional population of 100,000 people, we show that even test systems with a high specificity can yield a large number of false positive results, especially where the population prevalence is low. For example, at a true population prevalence of 5%, using a test with 99% sensitivity and specificity, 16% of positive results will be false and thus 950 people will be incorrectly informed they have had the infection. Further confirmatory testing may be needed.

In this study, we propose a new Speed Prediction of Traffic Model Network (SPTMN). The model is largely based on a Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) and a Graph Convolution Network (GCN). The improved TCN is used to complete the extraction of time dimension and local spatial dimension features, and the topological relationship between road nodes is extracted by GCN, to accomplish global spatial dimension feature extraction. Finally, both spatial and temporal features are combined with road parameters to achieve accurate short-term traffic speed predictions. The experimental results show that the SPTMN model obtains the best performance under various road conditions, and compared with eight baseline methods, the prediction error is reduced by at least 8%.

The misinformation riding upon the infodemic wave poses a major threat to people's health and governance systems. Managing this infodemic not only requires mitigating misinformation but also an early understanding of underlying psychological patterns. In this study, we present a novel epidemic response management strategy. We analyze the psychometric impact and coupling of COVID-19 infodemic with official COVID-19 bulletins at the national and state level in India. We looked at them from the psycholinguistic lens of emotions and quantified the extent and coupling between them. We modified Empath, a deep skipgram-based lexicon builder, for effective capture of health-related emotions. Using this, we analyzed the lead-lag relationships between the time-evolution of these emotions in social media and official bulletins using Granger's causality. It showed that state bulletins led the social media for some emotions such as Medical Emergency. In contrast, social media led the government bulletins for some topics such as hygiene, government, fun, and leisure.

Simultaneously, protein interfaces are being researched to understand the structural and functional mechanism of action. Therefore, we characterized and examined the interfaces of corona viral proteins using a dataset consisting of 366 homomeric and 199 heteromeric protein interfaces. The interfaces were analyzed using six parameters including interface area, interface size, van der Waal, hydrogen bond, electrostatic and total stabilizing energies. We observed the interfaces of corona viral proteins (homomer and heteromer) to be alike. Therefore, we clustered the interfaces based on the percent contribution of vdW towards total stabilizing energy as vdW energy dominant (=60%) and vdW energy subdominant (<60%). We found 91% of interfaces to have vdW energy in dominance with large interface size [14629 (homomer) and 12229 (heteromer)] and interface area [1690683 (homomer) and 1306355 (heteromer)]. However, we also observed 9% of interfaces to have vdW energy in sub-dominance with small interface size [6012 (homomer) and 4120 (heteromer)] and interface area [472174 (homomer) and 310199 (heteromer)].

We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. RESULTS: The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. CONCLUSIONS: In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","output":"Les professionnels de sant face  la pandmie de la maladie  coronavirus (COVID-19) : quels risques pour leur sant mentale ?/ [Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Teaching is mentally and physically draining occupation, and due to Covid-19, education shifted to online methods, which made it even harder.

The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, considering the high-population smoking prevalence in China (26.6%). A systematic review of the literature (PubMed) was performed on April 1. Thirteen studies examining the clinical characteristics of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China and presenting data on the smoking status were found. The pooled prevalence of current smoking from all studies was calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. To address the possibility that some smokers had quit shortly before hospitalization and were classified as former smokers on admission to the hospital, we performed a secondary analysis in which all former smokers were classified as current smokers. A total of 5960 patients were included in the studies identified. The current smoking prevalence ranged from 1.4% (95% CI 0.0-3.4%) to 12.6% (95% CI 10.6-14.6%). An unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed from the pooled analysis (6.5%, 95% CI 4.9-8.2%) as compared to population smoking prevalence in China. The secondary analysis, classifying former smokers as current smokers, found a pooled estimate of 7.3% (95% CI 5.7-8.9%). In conclusion, an unexpectedly low prevalence of current smoking was observed among patients with COVID-19 in China, which was approximately 1/4th the population smoking prevalence. Although the generalized advice to quit smoking as a measure to reduce health risk remains valid, the findings, together with the well-established immunomodulatory effects of nicotine, suggest that pharmaceutical nicotine should be considered as a potential treatment option in COVID-19.","output":"Systematic review of the prevalence of current smoking among hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China: could nicotine be a therapeutic option?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to inherent challenges in maintaining physical distancing in hemodialysis units, the Canadian Society of Nephrology has recommended peritoneal dialysis as the preferred modality for patients requiring maintenance dialysis during the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, pursuing peritoneal dialysis is not without risk due to the requirement for in-person contact during catheter insertion and training, and there is a paucity of data regarding the experience of peritoneal dialysis during the early phases of the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the incidence and outcomes of peritoneal dialysis between March 17 and June 01, 2020 compared to the same time period in preceding years. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: British Columbia, Canada. After the pandemic was declared on March 17, 2020, patients continued to be trained in peritoneal dialysis. In an effort to limit time spent in hospital, patients were preferentially trained in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, training times were truncated for some patients, and peritoneal dialysis catheters were inserted by a physician at the bedside whenever feasible. PATIENTS: All patients aged >18 years who started chronic maintenance dialysis during the period March 17 to June 01 in the years 2018 to 2020 inclusive. The time period was extended to include the years 2010 to 2020 inclusive to evaluate longer term trends in dialysis incidence. MEASUREMENTS: A provincial clinical information system was used to capture the date of commencing dialysis, dialysis modality, and complications including peritonitis. Overall uptake of peritoneal dialysis included new starts and transitions to peritoneal dialysis from in-center hemodialysis during the observation period. METHODS: The incidence of dialysis during the specified time period, overall and by modality, was calculated per million population using census figures for the population at risk. Patients were followed for a minimum of 30 days from the start of peritoneal dialysis to capture episodes of peritonitis and COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 211 patients started maintenance dialysis between March 17 and June 01, 2020. The incidence dialysis rate (41.3 per million population) was lower than that expected based on the 10-year trend from 2010 to 2019 inclusive (expected rate 45.7 per million population, 95% confidence interval 41.7 to 50.1). A total of 93 patients started peritoneal dialysis, including 32 patients who transitioned from in-center hemodialysis, contributing to a higher overall uptake of peritoneal dialysis compared to preceding years. The incidence rate for peritoneal dialysis of 18.2 per million population was higher than that expected (16.3 per million population, 95% confidence interval 14.0 to 19.0). Half of patients (48%) underwent a bedside peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion by a physician. During 30 days of follow-up, 2 (2.2%) patients experienced peritonitis and no patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. LIMITATIONS: Results are short term and generalizable only to regions with similarly low community rates of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that peritoneal dialysis can be safely started and perhaps expanded as a means of mitigating the anticipated surge in in-center hemodialysis during the COVID-19 pandemic. Important contributors to the uptake of peritoneal dialysis in British Columbia were bedside catheter insertions and expediting transitions from in-center hemodialysis to peritoneal dialysis.","output":"Maintaining the Uptake of Peritoneal Dialysis During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Research Letter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is occurring in the middle of flu season. Since the responses to COVID-19 are dramatically different, it is critical to accurately discriminate COVID-19 from seasonal flu and pneumonia caused by other common respiratory pathogens. Methods: : Fifty patients (eight patients with COVID-19, eight with influenza, and 34 with community-acquired pneumonia) were included in our study. Sixteen features, such as clinical symptoms, results of routine blood tests, first reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and chest CT, were collected. The importance of each feature in discriminating COVID-19 from others was ranked by the random forest algorithm. Models with single or multiple features were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, the F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). Results: : An integrated multi-feature model (RT-PCR, CT features and blood lymphocyte percentage) yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86 C 1, P < 0.01), an F1 score of 0.81 and an MCC of 0.78 in the training cohort as well as an F1 score of 0.86 and an MCC of 0.85 in the validation set.

The analysis of these decrees can be used to make a first assessment of the implications of the COVID crisis on labour markets, and also to speculate on mid and long-term developments, since the most and least affected sectors are probably going to continue to operate differently until a vaccine or other long-term solution is found. Using an ad-hoc extraction of EU-LFS data, we apply this classification to the analysis of employment in Germany, Italy and Spain but also UK, Poland and Sweden, in order to cover the whole spectrum of institutional labour market settings within Europe. Our results, in line with recent literature, show that the employment impact is asymmetric within and between countries. In particular, the countries that are being hardest hit by the pandemic itself (Spain and Italy, and also the UK) are the countries more likely to suffer the worst employment implications of the confinement, because of their productive specialisation and labour market institutions. Indeed, these were also the labour markets that were more vulnerable before the crisis: characterised by high unemployment and precarious work (especially temporary contracts).","output":"Employment impact of Covid-19 crisis: from short term effects to long terms prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role-play for pharmacological education has been developed by Yanagita et al. since 2010 and incorporated into the curriculum of more than 20 medical or pharmaceutical universities in Japan.

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter AEC. We determined what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and COPD. METHODS: We obtained lower AEC from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 2-89 years, Newcastle (n = 115) and Perth (n = 30), Australia. The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma (n = 37) and COPD (n = 38). Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was assessed by qPCR, and protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AEC. RESULTS: Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age (P = 0.03) and male sex (P = 0.03), but not with pack-years smoked. When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma patients (P = 0.01). Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in patients with asthma (P = 0.02), while ADAM-17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface, was increased (P = 0.02). ACE2 protein expression was also reduced in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients. CONCLUSION: Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males. Asthma patients have reduced expression. Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not over-represented in those with COVID-19 complications.","output":"ACE2 expression is elevated in airway epithelial cells from older and male healthy individuals but reduced in asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We test the predictive accuracy of forecasts of the number of COVID-19 fatalities produced by several forecasting teams and collected by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the epidemic in the United States.

Second, at longer horizons (3- and 4-week ahead) forecasters are more successful and sometimes outperform the benchmark. Third, one of the best performing forecasts is the Ensemble forecast, that combines all available predictions using uniform weights.

Methods: Systematic review of articles, reports and grey-literature indexed in electronic databases (EMBASE, WHO-Covid19, Web of Science), pre-print repositories, institutional websites, and handsearching. Empirical papers of any study design addressing Covid-19 in PEH or homeless shelters' staff in English were included. (PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020187033) Findings: Of 194 publications, 13 studies were included (two modelling, ten observational and one qualitative study). All were conducted in high-income countries. Random-effect meta-analysis of prevalence estimates yields a baseline SARS-Cov-2 prevalence of 2.14% (95% Confidence-Interval, 95%CI=1.02-3.27) in PEH and 1.72 % (95%CI=0.31-3.12) in staff.

The program includes an introductory presentation, training course, and organized bedside sessions with patients. To evaluate the program, a sample of participants partook in a focus group, written questionnaire, and/or online survey. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2020, 130 students participated in magic therapy rounds, engaging 1391 patients. Nine themes of student benefit emerged from qualitative analysis, including acquisition of familiarity with the hospital and healthcare team, cultivation of communication skills, contribution to improvement of patient affect, development of empathic qualities and techniques, and improvement in psychological health. Students were very satisfied with their experiences and viewed the activity as helpful for patients, parents, staff, and themselves.

Sarcocysts are formed in the muscles or central nervous system of the intermediate host (IH), while sporocysts develop in the small intestine of the definitive host (DH). Various birds of prey have been confirmed to be DH for Sarcocystis spp. Three Sarcocystis species, S. wobeseri, S. halieti and S. falcatula, have been identified in the muscles of birds of prey, of which the latter are known to be pathogenic and can cause encephalitis in various birds. The aim of this study was to identify Sarcocystis spp. in the muscles of birds of prey from Spain. METHODS: Between 2019 and 2020, muscle tissue samples taken from 59 birds of prey admitted to the Wildlife Recovery Centre in Ilundain (Navarra, Spain) were examined for the presence of Sarcocystis spp. Sarcocysts in fresh squashed samples were morphologically characterized under the light microscope (LM). Sarcocystis spp. were identified by means of 28S ribosomal RNA and internal transcribed spacer 1 sequence analysis. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of squashed tissue samples stained with methylene blue revealed the presence of sarcocysts in three of the 59 (5.1%) birds examined. Only one sarcocyst type was observed under the LM. Sarcocysts were thread-like (1050-2160  130-158 m) and had a thin (0.7-1.4 m) and smooth cyst wall. Septa divided the cysts into compartments filled with banana-shaped (5.9  1.7 m) bradyzoites. On the basis of DNA sequence results, S. halieti was identified in the western marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus) and the black kite (Milvus migrans) for the first time. Sarcocysts of S. halieti were shorter and wider compared to those observed in the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and the herring gull (Larus argentatus). According to current knowledge, S. halieti may infect birds belonging to four different orders: Suliformes, Charadriiformes, Strigiformes and Accipitriformes. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of S. halieti in the western marsh harrier and the black kite as IH. So far, little research has been conducted on birds of prey as IH for Sarcocystis spp. These results indicate that further studies combining morphological, histopathological, and molecular methods are required.","output":"Molecular identification of Sarcocystis halieti in the muscles of two species of birds of prey from Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Study Type--Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4. What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Several studies have shown the feasibility of performing both complex and reconstructive laparoendoscopic single site (LESS) surgical procedures in urology. To date, no studies have evaluated the rates of conversion to conventional laparoscopy and complications at the time of LESS procedures in urology. This study, a compilation of results from members of the NOTES working group, is the first study to address the rates of complications and conversions to conventional laparoscopy at the time of LESS surgery in urology. OBJECTIVE ? To present complications and rates of conversion from LESS to conventional laparoscopy (CL) at the time of upper tract LESS urologic procedures. PATIENTS AND METHODS ? Patients undergoing LESS upper tract procedures between September, 2007 and November, 2008 (n = 125) were identified at six high-volume academic centers pioneering urologic LESS procedures. All LESS procedures were performed transperitoneally via a single umbilical incision using either adjacent conventional trocars or a dedicated single-site access device. Reconstructive procedures incorporating a single planned 2 mm accessory needle port were included as LESS procedures and were not considered conversions. ? Patients, undergoing LESS procedures requiring conversion to CL with the placement of additional ports were identified. Conversion was defined as the placement of additional 5 or 10/12 mm ports beyond the primary incision. In each case the operative reports were reviewed, the reason for conversion was determined, and the number and types of additional ports and complications were noted. RESULTS ? Upper tract LESS procedures were performed in 125 patients comprising 13.3% of the total 937 laparoscopic procedures performed at the participating institutions during this time period. Conversion to CL was necessary in 7 patients (5.6%) undergoing LESS requiring the addition of 2-5 ports. ? Reasons for conversion included: facilitate dissection in 3 (43%), facilitate reconstruction in 3 (43%), and control of bleeding in 1 (14%). All attempted LESS cases were completed laparoscopically without need for open conversion. ? Complications occurred in 15.2% of patients undergoing LESS surgery. Three of the 7 patients that required conversion to CL developed postoperative complications (Clavien grade II in two and IIIa in one). ? Limitations of this study included the inability to standardize LESS patient selection criteria, instrumentation and surgical technique as well as the lack of available complete data from a CL control group for comparison. CONCLUSION ? LESS surgery is technically feasible for a variety of upper urinary tract reconstructive and ablative procedures, although it appears to be associated with higher rates of complications than in mature CL series. Conversion to CL occurs infrequently and may be a reflection of stringent patient selection.","output":"Complications and conversions of upper tract urological laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS): multicentre experience: results from the NOTES Working Group."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We examine a pair of graph generative models for the therapeutic design of novel drug candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins.

Check It is a seek-test-treat community-based Ct screening program for African American (AA) men who have sex with women and who are ages 15-24 years. This is an evaluation of adaptations made to the program aimed at improving index/partner notification and treatment rates. METHODS The original Check It intervention included free testing and treatment, contact tracing performed by a third party, expedited index therapy (EIT), and expedited partner therapy (EPT) via pharmacy pickup. The intervention was adapted following a series of in-depth interviews eliciting information to refine the program. Changes included continuity of testing, notification, and treatment by the same staff; expanded hours; and patient-delivered partner therapy (PDPT) with a medication mail-delivery option. Rates of index male and partner treatment were compared using log-binomial models and generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Men in the adapted intervention (n=85) were more likely than men in the original intervention (n=99) to be contacted (RR=1.14; 95% CI=1.02-1.27), make a treatment plan (RR=1.14; 95% CI=1.01-1.27), and complete treatment (RR=1.45; 95% CI=1.20-1.75). Female sexual partners were significantly more likely to complete treatment in post-adaptation (n=153) compared to pre-adaptation (n=161) (RR=3.02; 95% CI=1.81-5.05).

OBJECTIVE To provide preliminary results on the potential therapeutic benefit and tolerability of interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids for SARS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Open-label study of 22 patients diagnosed as having probable SARS at North York General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, between April 11 and May 30, 2003. INTERVENTIONS Thirteen patients were treated with corticosteroids alone and 9 patients were treated with corticosteroids plus subcutaneous interferon alfacon-1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Clinical parameters, including oxygen saturation and requirement, laboratory measures, and serial chest radiography results. RESULTS Resolution of fever and lymphopenia were similar between the 2 treatment groups. Of the 13 patients treated with corticosteroids alone, 5 (38.5%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 3 (23.1%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and 1 (7.7%) died. Of the 9 patients in the interferon alfacon-1 treatment group, 3 (33.3%) were transferred to the intensive care unit, 1 (11.1%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation, and none died. The interferon alfacon-1 treatment group had a shorter time to 50% resolution of lung radiographic abnormalities (median time, 4 days vs 9 days; P =.001), had better oxygen saturation (P =.02), resolved their need for supplemental oxygen more rapidly (median, 10 days vs 16 days; P =.02), had less of an increase in creatine kinase levels (P =.03), and showed a trend toward more rapid resolution of lactate dehydrogenase levels compared with the group receiving corticosteroids alone. CONCLUSIONS In this preliminary, uncontrolled study of patients with SARS, use of interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids was associated with reduced disease-associated impaired oxygen saturation, more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities, and lower levels of creatine kinase. These findings suggest that further investigation may be warranted to determine the role of interferon alfacon-1 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of SARS.","output":"Interferon alfacon-1 plus corticosteroids in severe acute respiratory syndrome: a preliminary study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter documents the logics underpinning farmers management practices of an emerging disease.

This instability is mainly related to numerous and regular poultry infectious diseases and market fluctuations. If international community considers H5N1 as a zoonotic risk and a pandemic threat which asks for emergency tools, H5N1 is framed by the farmers of our study as an epizootic problem manageable through routinised measures.

This study was designed to assess the interplay of antibodies with the systemic cytokine response in SARS-CoV-2 patients. We demonstrate that significant anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production to Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike S1 subunit (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 develops over the first 10 to 20 days of infection. The majority of patients produced antibodies against all three antigens (219/255 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient specimens, 86%) suggesting a broad response to viral proteins. Patient mortality, sex, blood type, and age were all associated with differences in antibody production to SARS-CoV-2 antigens which may help explain variation in immunity between these populations. To better understand the systemic immune response, we analyzed the production of 20 cytokines by SARS-CoV-2 patients over the course of infection. Cytokine analysis of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients exhibited increases in proinflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-18) and chemotactic markers (IP-10, SDF-1, MIP-1{beta}, MCP-1, and eotaxin) relative to healthy individuals. Patients who succumbed to infection produced decreased IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, RANTES, TNF-, GRO-, and MIP-1 relative to patients who survived infection. We also observed that the chemokine CXCL13 was particularly elevated in patients that succumbed to infection. CXCL13 is involved in B cell activation, germinal center development, and antibody maturation, and we observed that CXCL13 levels in blood trended with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody production. Furthermore, patients that succumbed to infection produced high CXCL13 and also tended to have high ratio of nucleocapsid to RBD antibodies.

When infected cells were probed by immunofluorescence laser confocal microscopy, p1a-10, -22, -12, and -15 were detected in discrete foci that were prominent in the perinuclear region but were widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm as well. Dual-labeling experiments demonstrated colocalization of the majority of p1a-22 in replication complexes with the helicase, nucleocapsid, and 3C-like proteinase, as well as with p1a-10, -12, and -15. p1a-22 was also detected in separate foci adjacent to the replication complexes. The majority of complexes containing the gene 1 proteins were distinct from sites of accumulation of the M assembly protein. However, in perinuclear regions the gene 1 proteins and nucleocapsid were intercalated with sites of M protein localization.

Methods: A single-center longitudinal, online-based survey was conducted in healthcare workers from a department of anesthesiology and critical care in Bavaria, the most affected federal state in Germany at the time of assessment. Validated scores for depression, anxiety, somatic disorders, burnout, resilience, and self-management were used and complemented by questions about perceived COVID-19-related stressors. In parallel, patient characteristics in the ICU were collected. Results: 24 and 23 critically ill COVID-19 patients were treated during both observation periods in April/May and November/December 2020, respectively. 87.5% and 78.2% of patients had moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. From March 6, 2020 onwards, the hospital had switched to a command and control-based hospital incident command system (HICS) and increased work forces. Point prevalence of depression-like symptoms (13.6% and 12.8%) and burnout (21.6% and 17.4%) in the departments healthcare professionals was high. Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 did not increase psychological burden. Consequences of the lockdown were rated as highly distressing by a majority of all ICU personnel. High self-reported trait resilience was protective against signs of depression, generalized anxiety, and burnout. Conclusions: During the pandemic, healthcare professionals have been suffering from increased psychological distress compared to reference data for both the general population and ICU personnel. General effects of the lockdown appear more relevant than actual COVID-19 patient contact. High trait resilience has a protective effect, yet vulnerable individuals may require specific support. Prevention against potential after effects of the lockdown, and in particular measures allowing to avoid another lockdown, appear warranted.","output":"Impaired psychological well-being of healthcare workers in a German department of anesthesiology is independent of immediate SARS-CoV-2 exposure C a longitudinal observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to understand the association of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms at initial presentation with clinical outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalization. METHODS: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study included consecutive hospitalized COVID-19 patients from a single, large health system. The presence of GI symptoms was assessed at initial presentation and included one or more of the following: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients were divided into three cohorts: Only GI symptoms, GI and non-GI symptoms and only non-GI symptoms. The primary outcome was association of GI symptoms with mortality. Secondary outcomes included prevalence of GI symptoms and survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1672 COVID-19 patients were hospitalized (mean age: 63  15.8 years, females: 50.4%) in our system during the study period. 40.7% patients had at least one GI symptom (diarrhea in 28.3%, nausea/vomiting in 23%, and abdominal pain in 8.8% patients), and 2.6% patients had only GI symptoms at initial presentation. Patients presenting with GI symptoms (with or without non-GI symptoms) had a lower mortality rate compared to patients presenting with only non-GI symptoms (20% vs. 26%; p < 0.05).

Data from original research articles on SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection second day postinfection were included in this study. In total, there were 7938 published articles on humoral immune response and laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. Of these, 74 were included in this study. The detection, peak and decline period of blood anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgG and total antibodies for point-of-care testing (POCT), ELISA and CLIA vary widely. The most promising of these assays for POCT detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 at day 3 postinfection and peaked on the 15th day; ELISA products detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG at days 2 and 6 then peaked on the eighth day; and the most promising CLIA product detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 at day 1 and peaked on the 30th day. The most promising LFA, ELISA and CLIA that had the best performance characteristics were those targeting total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies followed by those targeting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG then IgM. Essentially, the CLIA-based SARS-CoV-2 tests had the best performance characteristics, followed by ELISA then POCT.

However, there are few in-depth studies investigating the students' own experiences when trying to empathize in concrete clinical encounters. We therefore wanted to explore medical students' perceptions, experiences, and reflections when empathizing with patients expressing emotional issues. METHODS A qualitative content analysis of semi-structured interviews with third year medical students (N = 11) was conducted using video-stimulated recall from their own medical interview with a simulated chronically ill patient. Students were led to believe that the patient was real. RESULTS Five themes which may influence student empathy during history-taking were identified through analysis of interview data: (1) Giving priority to medical history taking, (2) Interpreting the patient's worry as lack of medical information, (3) Conflict between perspectives, (4) Technical communication skill rather than authentic and heart-felt and (5) The distant professional role.

With growing interest in enhancing resilience in physicians, given their high risk for experiencing prolonged or intense stress, effective strategies are necessary to improve resilience and reduce negative outcomes including burnout. The objective of this review was to identify effective interventions to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training, working in any setting. METHODS AND FINDINGS We included randomized controlled trials (RCT), and observational studies (including pilot studies) published in English, French, and Spanish that included an intervention to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. We included studies that implemented interventions to reduce burnout, anxiety, and depression or to improve empathy to ultimately enhance resilience, rather than studies designed solely to reduce stress or trauma-induced stress. We performed a systematic search of Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Cochrane Library with no publication year limit. The last search was conducted on March 29, 2017. We used random effect models to calculate pooled standardized mean differences. Resilience was the primary outcome measure using validated resilience scores. Secondary outcome measures included proxy measures of resilience such as burnout, empathy, anxiety and depression. Our search strategy identified 7,579 records;74 met the criteria for full-text review. Seventeen studies were included in the final review published between 1998 and 2016 of which 9 (4 RCT, 5 observational) had physician data extractable. Interventions varied greatly regarding their approach, duration, and follow-up. Two RCTs measured resilience using validated scales; both found a significant improvement. No meta-analysis for resilience was conducted due to the presence of high clinical and methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review demonstrates that there is weak evidence to support one intervention over another to improve resilience in physicians who have completed training. The quality of evidence for the outcomes ranged from very low to low. There is a need for a consensus on the definition of resilience and how it is measured.

In the most recent review published in 2012, TENS was associated with increased pain relief following cardiothoracic surgery when compared to standard multimodal analgesia. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine if adding TENS to current pain management practices decreases pain and analgesic use and improves pulmonary function for postcardiothoracic surgery patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS CINAHL, MEDLINE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using specific keywords. Covidence was used to screen, select studies, and extract data by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool assessed risk of bias. Visual analog scale (VAS) and pulmonary function data were exported for meta-analysis using a random effects model. RESULTS The search yielded 38 articles. Eight randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the literature review. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis of pain at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively. Data were analyzed using the standard mean difference (SMD). TENS had a significant impact on VAS at rest (-0.76 SMD [95% confidence interval, CI = -1.06 to -0.49], p < 0.00001) and with coughing (-1.11 SMD [95% CI = -1.64 to -0.56], p < 0.0001). FEV1 improved after 72 hours (1.00 SMD [95% CI = 0.66-1.35], p < 0.00001), as did forced vital capacity (1.16 SMD [95% CI = 0.23-2.10], p = 0.01). CONCLUSION The addition of TENS therapy to multimodal analgesia significantly decreases pain following cardiothoracic surgery, increases the recovery of pulmonary function, and decreases the use of analgesics.","output":"Efficacy of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation for Postoperative Pain, Pulmonary Function, and Opioid Consumption Following Cardiothoracic Procedures: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Laser-induced graphene (LIG) is a class of three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon nanomaterial.

Although effective, its efficacy is not absolute, the viral circulation is not prevented and some side effects cannot be denied. Despite this, the determinants of IBV epidemiology and the factors affecting its circulation are still largely unknown and poorly investigated. In the present study, 361 IBV QX (the most relevant field genotype in Italy) sequences were obtained between 2012 and 2016 from the two main Italian integrated poultry companies. Several biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches were used to reconstruct the history of the QX genotype in Italy and to assess the effect of different environmental, climatic and social factors on its spreading patterns. Moreover, two structured coalescent models were considered in order to investigate if an actual compartmentalization occurs between the two integrated poultry companies and the role of a third \\"ghost\\" deme, representative of minor industrial poultry companies and the rural sector. The obtained results suggest that the integration of the poultry companies is an effective barrier against IBV spreading, since the strains sampled from the two companies formed two essentially-independent clades. Remarkably, the only exceptions were represented by farms located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. The inclusion of a third deme in the model revealed the likely role of other poultry companies and rural farms (particularly concentrated in Northern Italy) as sources of strain introduction into one of the major poultry companies, whose farms are mainly located in the high densely populated poultry area of Northern Italy. Accordingly, when the effect of different environmental and urban parameters on IBV geographic spreading was investigated, no factor seems to contribute to IBV dispersal velocity, being poultry population density the only exception. Finally, the different viral population pattern observed in the two companies over the same time period supports the pivotal role of management and control strategies on IBV epidemiology. Overall, the present study results stress the crucial relevance of human action rather than environmental factors, highlighting the direct benefits that could derive from improved management and organization of the poultry sector on a larger scale.","output":"Phylodynamic analysis and evaluation of the balance between anthropic and environmental factors affecting IBV spreading among Italian poultry farms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At an era of Industry 4 0 revolution, when it is said that the automation is buzzword among the all the devices/applications available Still automation in Hospital Management System are far from reality in most developing nations Automation in the field of Healthcare is the need of today's generation This would help in providing a lot of functionalities to a patient with the help of a mobile application and other devices (Wearable devices to complex devices in testing centers) Here in our framework, patient details, which can be collected regularly from wearable devices and/or collected from Testing Centers (Clinics) and the case history from any hospital visited previously, all these vital details are stored in central repository irrespective of the hospital he/she visits At the case of emergency, the patients case history which is stored in Central repository(Cloud) These details at any point of time if made available in any hospital, it can fast track the process in handling the patient Also, understanding the secrecy level to be maintained in the Electronic Health Record and the way the HSM operates nowadays This research work proposes to have a framework wherein, Patient related data collected from the wearable devices to the data stored in the CR (Cloud), utilizes Audio-Steganography as tool for Security aspect The framework proposed would be an ideal solution during the current pandemic COVID-19 situations, with Doctors Forum proposed in the framework would be utilized to the most extent possible way to benefit each citizen at large ? 2020 IEEE","output":"Centralized and automated healthcare systems: A essential smart application post Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel Coronavirus is a highly infectious disease, with over one million confirmed cases and thousands of deaths recorded.

Advanced computational methods using unsupervised machine learning analyses of clinical variables and/or high-throughput omics technologies, clinical variables trajectories modelling overtime or radiomics have provided significant insights on key pathogenic processes that could help defining new subgroups beyond the diffuse/limited subsets.

Despite some improvements over the past decades, mortality remains high at 30C40% in most studies. Pathologic specimens from patients with ARDS most frequently reveal diffuse alveolar damage, and laboratory studies have demonstrated both alveolar epithelial and lung endothelial injury, resulting in accumulation of protein-rich inflammatory edema fluid in the alveolar space.

We analysed how different levels of mandatory NPIs determine how individuals use their leeway for voluntary actions. If mandatory NPIs are too weak, COVID-19 incidence will surge, implying high morbidity and mortality before individuals react; if they are too strong, one expects a rebound wave once restrictions are lifted, challenging the transition to endemicity. Conversely, moderate mandatory NPIs give individuals time and room to adapt their level of caution, mitigating disease spread effectively. When complemented with high vaccination rates, this also offers a robust way to limit the impacts of the Omicron variant of concern.

CONCLUSION: Our study adds a new dimension to the body of literature suggesting that program director-resident relationship quality plays an important role in promoting residents wellbeing and achieving important clinical health outcomes. Such findings imply that the quality of program director-resident relationship could be an important component of residents wellbeing and patient safety. If further research confirms these associations, it will become imperative to determine what interventions might improve the quality of relationships between program directors and residents.","output":"The mediating role of residents wellbeing between program leadership and quality of care: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives We aimed to evaluate sonographic features that may aid in risk stratification and propose a focused cardiac and lung ultrasound (LUS) algorithm in patients with COVID-19 Methods Two hundred consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 underwent comprehensive clinical and echocardiographic examination, as well as LUS, irrespective of clinical indication, within 24 hours of admission as part of a prospective predefined protocol. Assessment included calculation of the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function, hemodynamic and right ventricular (RV) assessment and a calculated LUS score. We performed outcome analysis to identify echocardiographic and LUS predictors of mortality or the composite event of mortality or need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and to assess their adjunctive value on top of clinical parameters and MEWS. Results A simplified echocardiographic risk score comprised of LV ejection fraction< 50% combined with TAPSE< 18 mm, was associated with mortality (p=0.0002) and with the composite event (p=0.0001). Stepwise analyses evaluating echocardiographic and LUS parameters on top of existing clinical risk scores showed that addition of TAPSE and SVI improved prediction of mortality when added to clinical variables but not when added to MEWS. Once echocardiography was added, and patients re-categorized as high risk only if having both high risk MEWS, and high-risk cardiac features, the specificity increased from 63% to 87%, positive predictive value from 28% to 48% and accuracy improved from 66% to 85%. Although LUS was not associated with incremental risk prediction for mortality above clinical and echocardiographic criteria, it improved prediction of need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Conclusions In hospitalized patients with COVID-19, a very limited echocardiographic exam is sufficient for outcome prediction. The addition of echocardiography in patients with high risk MEWS score decreases the rate of falsely identifying patients as high risk to die, and may improve resource allocation in case of high patient load.background","output":"The predictive role of combined cardiac and lung ultrasound in Coronavirus Disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new type of virus that firstly confirmed in Wuhan, China recently. SARS-CoV-2 mainly spread through droplets. Infection characteristics data of SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, especially about asymptomatic infection, familial aggregation infection and infection risk in family member. Methods: From 2nd January 2020 to 23th February 2020, we have screened 22,729 throat swab samples from individuals with either have contact history of imported personnel, out-of-city travel or residence history or flu-like symptoms during the past 14 days.

Rapid tests benefit from providing quick results but suffer from lower sensitivity, while PCR tests usually take longer to provide more reliable results and can be difficult to scale to meet population needs. We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of a Molecular Mirror assay (MMA) using nucleic acid extraction and a nucleic acid extraction-free method to determine its ability to identify SARS-CoV-2 in nasal specimens from individuals suspected of having SARS-CoV-2. We compared the MMA using nucleic acid extraction to the emergency use authorization (EUA)-approved TaqPath reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay to determine its performance characteristics. From 412 total specimens (including 115 previous positives and 297 previous negatives), we found that the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 99.1% (confidence interval [CI], 97.4% to 100.0%) and the negative percent agreement (NPA) was 99.3% (95% CI, 98.4% to 100.0%) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Using the extraction-free method, we analyzed 109 specimens (51 previous positives and 58 previous negatives) and found that the PPA for the more rapid version of the assay was 87.8% (95% CI, 78.5% to 96.9%) and the NPA was 100.0% (95% CI, 100.0%) for virus detection. The extraction method has performance comparable to what is observed in many PCR-based assays. The extraction-free method has lower PPA but has the advantage of being more rapid and having a higher throughput. Our data offer a proof of concept that nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection can be used in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing and may allow for alternative supply chains to increase testing options. IMPORTANCE Accurate diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 infections have been critical for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both high-sensitivity/specificity PCR-based tests and lower-sensitivity/specificity rapid antigen assays have been the subject of worldwide supply chain limitations as individual facilities and countries have struggled to meet their population testing needs. We evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of a Molecular Mirror assay (MMA), which uses nuclear magnetic resonance to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids both with and without full nucleic acid extractions. We found that compared to a U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) approved assay (TaqPath) that uses reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), the MMA had high PPA and NPA with full nucleic acid extractions, and acceptable positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with an extraction-free protocol. In a landscape marred by supply chain shortages across the world, altered SARS-CoV-2 detection methods such as the MMA can add to testing supplies while providing quality SARS-CoV-2 testing results.","output":"Molecular Mirror Technology Facilitates High-Throughput, Accurate SARS-CoV-2 Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries around the world are implementing lock-down measures in a bid to flatten the curve of the new deadly COVID-19 disease. Our paper does not claim to have found the cure for COVID-19, neither does it claim that the suggested model have taken into account all the complexities around the spread of the disease. Nonetheless, the fundamental question asked in this paper is to know if within the conditions taken into account in this suggested model, the integral lock-down is effective in saving human lives. To answer this question, a mathematical model was suggested taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lock-down. Three cases were considered. The first case suggested that there is transmission from dead to the living (medical staffs as they perform postmortem procedures on corpses, and direct contacts with during burial ceremonies). This case has no equilibrium points except for disease free equilibrium, a clear indication that care must be taken when dealing with corpses due to corona-19. In the second case we removed the transmission rate from dead bodies. This case showed an equilibrium point, although the number of deaths, carriers and infected grew exponentially up to a certain stability level. In the last case, we incorporated a lock-down and social distancing effect, using the next generation matrix. We could achieve a zero reproduction number, with number of deaths, infected and carriers decaying very rapidly. This is a clear indication that if lock-down recommendations are observed the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero in few months.While our mathematical model agrees with the effectiveness of the lock-down, it is important to mention damaging effects of inadequate testing. The long waiting period of few days before confirmation of status, can only lead to more infections. The asymptomatic tested person could be positive and spread the infection, or could contact the virus in days after testing and will spread the disease further, after being given a false result. Testing kit that with immediate results are needed for more efficient measures. We used Italy's Data to guide the construction of the mathematical model. To include non-locality into mathematical formulas, differential and integral operators were suggested. Properties and numerical approximations were presented in details. Finally, the suggested differential and integral operators were applied to the model.","output":"Modelling the spread of COVID-19 with new fractal-fractional operators: Can the lockdown save mankind before vaccination?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Introduction: FDA [Food and Drug Administration] plays a critical role in protecting the United States from threats such as emerging infectious diseases, including the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic FDA is committed to providing timely guidance to support response efforts to this pandemic FDA is issuing this guidance to communicate its temporary policy for the compounding of certain human drug products for hospitalized patients by outsourcing facilities that have registered with FDA under section 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U S C 353b) COVID-19 (Disease);United States Food and Drug Administration","output":"Temporary Policy for Compounding of Certain Drugs for Hospitalized Patients by Outsourcing Facilities During the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (Revised)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

Method: An online survey was distributed to a UK community cohort (n=3097) at three points: April (baseline), July-September (T2) and November-December (T3). Participants completed validated measures of depression and anxiety on each occasion and we prospectively explored the role of socio-demographic factors and psychological factors (loneliness, positive mood, perceived risk of and worry about COVID-19) as risk factors.

Multiple studies have attempted to characterize at-risk patients, using various data sources and methodologies. Most of these studies, however, explored condition-specific patient cohorts (eg, hospitalized patients) or had limited access to patients' medical history, thus, investigating related questions and, potentially, obtaining biased results. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 complications from the complete medical records of a nationally representative cohort of patients, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. METHODS: We studied a cohort of all SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples, in a nationwide health organization (covering 2.3 million individuals) and identified those who suffered from serious complications (ie, experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit, or died). We then compared the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, extracted from electronic health records, between complicated and noncomplicated COVID-19 patient cohorts to identify the conditions that significantly increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. RESULTS: Of the 4353 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, 173 (4%) patients suffered from COVID-19 complications (all age &#8805;18 years). Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications. It also indicates that depression (eg, males &#8805;65 years: odds ratio [OR] 2.94, 95% CI 1.55-5.58; P=.01) as well as cognitive and neurological disorders (eg, individuals &#8805;65 years old: OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69-4.17; P<.001) are significant risk factors. Smoking and presence of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis agrees with previous studies on multiple risk factors, including hypertension and obesity. It also finds depression as well as cognitive and neurological disorders, but not smoking and respiratory diseases, to be significantly associated with COVID-19 complications.

As such, these enzymes are prime targets for antiviral therapy, as has recently been demonstrated for hepatitis C virus (HCV). However, peculiarities in the architecture and dynamics of RdRps raise fundamental questions about access to their active site during RNA polymerization. Here, we used molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, starting from the available crystal structures of HCV NS5B in ternary complex with template-primer duplexes and nucleotides, to address the question of ribonucleotide entry into the active site of viral RdRp. Tracing the possible passage of incoming UTP or GTP through the RdRp-specific entry tunnel, we found two successive checkpoints that regulate nucleotide traffic to the active site. We observed that a magnesium-bound nucleotide first binds next to the tunnel entry, and interactions with the triphosphate moiety orient it such that its base moiety enters first. Dynamics of RdRp motifs F1 + F3 then allow the nucleotide to interrogate the RNA template base prior to nucleotide insertion into the active site. These dynamics are finely regulated by a second magnesium dication, thus coordinating the entry of a magnesium-bound nucleotide with shuttling of the second magnesium necessary for the two-metal ion catalysis. The findings of our work suggest that at least some of these features are general to viral RdRps and provide further details on the original nucleotide selection mechanism operating in RdRps of RNA viruses.","output":"The hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase directs incoming nucleotides to its active site through magnesium-dependent dynamics within its F motif."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Children appear to be less commonly and less severely affected by COVID-19 than adults, accounting for 1% to 5% of all COVID-19 cases.

We aimed to identify the type of actions or initiatives by food retail stores intended to support local communities and contribute to well-being. STUDY DESIGN A Scoping Review. METHOD A scoping review was conducted in Scopus, Web of Science, and of grey literature to identify the extent of study of food retail stores in supporting community well-being, types and outcomes recorded from community-oriented actions. Data extraction included: population targeted, the content of initiative/action, outcomes recorded and key insights. Studies were grouped into broad categories relating to their actions and objectives. RESULTS Actions were associated with either strengthening communities or public health prevention or promotion. Few studies reported clearly on impact, and most accounts of impact on well-being and broader community outcomes were narrative accounts rather than objectively measured. Although rigorous capture of outcomes was absent, there were consistent themes around partnership and community insights that are relevant to the development and implementation of future actions in communities. CONCLUSIONS This is an under-researched area that may nevertheless hold potential to support the broader public health effort in communities. To provide clear recommendations for specific investments, there is merit in identifying a subset of health and well-being outcomes most likely to be associated with food retailer community actions in order to assess and capture impact in future. We propose that the theoretical underpinning associated with asset-based approaches, which take account of context and community conditions, would be a useful framework for future study.","output":"Community-oriented actions by food retailers to support community well-being: a systematic scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has compromised and disrupted sexual and reproductive health (SRH) across multiple dimensions: individual-level access, health systems functioning, and at the policy and governance levels.

However, the majority of ID diagnostics are qualitative. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an emerging ID diagnostics and research tool to provide insights, including tracking transmission, evolution, and identifying novel strains. METHODS: We built a novel likelihood-based computational method to leverage pathogen-specific genome-wide NGS data to detect SARS-CoV-2, profile genetic variants, and furthermore quantify levels of these pathogens. We used de-identified clinical specimens tested for SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR, SARS-CoV-2 NGS Assay (hybrid capture, Twist Bioscience), or ARTIC (amplicon-based) platform, and COVID-DX software. A training (n=87) and validation (n=22) set was selected to establish the strength of our quantification model. We fit non-uniform probabilistic error profiles to a deterministic sigmoidal equation that more realistically represents observed data and used likelihood maximized over several different read depths to improve accuracy over a wide range of values of viral load. Given the proportion of the genome covered at varying depths for a single sample as input data, our model estimated the Ct of that sample as the value that produces the maximum likelihood of generating the observed genome coverage data. RESULTS: The model fit on 87 SARS-CoV-2 NGS Assay training samples produced a good fit to the 22 validation samples, with a coefficient of correlation (r2) of ~0.8. The accuracy of the model was high (mean absolute % error of ~10%, meaning our model is able to predict the Ct value of each sample within a margin of 10% on average). Because of the nature of the commonly used ARTIC protocol, we found that all quantitative signals in this data were lost during PCR amplification and the model is not applicable for quantification of samples captured this way. The ability to model quantification is a major advantage of the SARS-CoV-2 NGS assay protocol.

Objective: In this cohort study, we aimed to report the disease characteristics and variables associated with COVID-19 outcome among Turkish patients with IRDs. Methods: Between April and June, 2020, 167 adult IRD patients with COVID-19 were registered from 31 centers in 14 cities in Turkey. Disease outcome was classified in 4 categories; (i) outpatient management, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen requirement, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen requirement, and (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine variables associated with a worse outcome. Results: 165 patients (mean age: 50  15.6 years, 58.2% female) were included. Twenty-four patients (14.5%) recovered under outpatient management, 141 (85.5%) were hospitalized, 49 (30%) required inpatient oxygen support, 22 (13%) were treated in the ICU (17 received invasive mechanic ventilation) and 16 (10%) died.

However, few of these technologies could be applied without a well-trained team. Our goal was to demonstrate that robotic surgery depends more on the patient-side assistant surgeon's abilities than has been previously reported. METHODS In our department, 280 interventions in digestive, thoracic, and gynecological surgery were performed since the acquisition of the robotic equipment. There are three teams trained in robotic surgery with three console surgeons and four certified patient-side surgeons. Four more patient-side assistants were trained at our center. Trocar placement, docking and undocking of the robot, insertion of the laparoscopic instruments, and hemostatic maneuvers with various devices were quantified and compared. RESULTS Assistants trained by using animal or cadaver surgery are more comfortable with the robotic instruments handling and with docking and undocking of the robot. Assistants who finalized their residency or attend their final year are more accurate with the insertion of the laparoscopic instrument to the targeted organ and more skillful with LigaSure or clip applier devices. Interventions that require vivid participation of the assistants have shorter assistant-depending time intervals at the end of the learning curve than at the beginning.

Female resident physicians are more likely to be misidentified as non-physicians. This study utilized a pre-post examination to determine if the usage of a doctor badge by resident physicians at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center influences role identification, gender-based aggressions, and workplace experience. METHODS: Twenty-six psychiatry residents at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System participated in a voluntary, anonymous electronic pre-survey in December 2020 and post-survey in March 2021 to report their experiences with role identification and gender-based aggressions before and after the implementation of a doctor badge. RESULTS: Females were significantly more likely than males to report role misidentification (x(2)(1)=10.8, p=0.001). Females were significantly more likely to experience gender-based aggressions compared to males (x(2)(1)=19.5, p<0.001). Compared to pre-intervention, females who wore the badge were significantly less likely to be misidentified (x(2)(1)=9.6, p=0.002). There was no significance when comparing males who were misidentified pre- to post-intervention (x(2)(1)=1.1, p=0.294). Compared to pre-intervention, females who wore the badge were significantly less likely to experience gender-based aggressions (x(2)(1)=17.3, p=<0.001).

RI panels are popular because of their long-term genetic stability, which enhances reproducibility and integration of data collected across time and conditions. Characterization of their genomes can be a community effort, reducing the burden on individual users. Here we present the genomes of the CC strains using two complementary approaches as a resource to improve power and interpretation of genetic experiments. Our study also provides a cautionary tale regarding the limitations imposed by such basic biological processes as mutation and selection. A distinct advantage of inbred panels is that genotyping only needs to be performed on the panel, not on each individual mouse. The initial CC genome data were haplotype reconstructions based on dense genotyping of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) of each strain followed by imputation from the genome sequence of the corresponding founder inbred strain. The MRCA resource captured segregating regions in strains that were not fully inbred, but it had limited resolution in the transition regions between founder haplotypes, and there was uncertainty about founder assignment in regions of limited diversity. Here we report the whole genome sequence of 69 CC strains generated by paired-end short reads at 30 coverage of a single male per strain. Sequencing leads to a substantial improvement in the fine structure and completeness of the genomes of the CC. Both MRCAs and sequenced samples show a significant reduction in the genome-wide haplotype frequencies from two wild-derived strains, CAST/EiJ and PWK/PhJ. In addition, analysis of the evolution of the patterns of heterozygosity indicates that selection against three wild-derived founder strains played a significant role in shaping the genomes of the CC. The sequencing resource provides the first description of tens of thousands of new genetic variants introduced by mutation and drift in the CC genomes. We estimate that new SNP mutations are accumulating in each CC strain at a rate of 2.4  0.4 per gigabase per generation. The fixation of new mutations by genetic drift has introduced thousands of new variants into the CC strains. The majority of these mutations are novel compared to currently sequenced laboratory stocks and wild mice, and some are predicted to alter gene function. Approximately one-third of the CC inbred strains have acquired large deletions (>10 kb) many of which overlap known coding genes and functional elements. The sequence of these mice is a critical resource to CC users, increases threefold the number of mouse inbred strain genomes available publicly, and provides insight into the effect of mutation and drift on common resources.","output":"Genomes of the Mouse Collaborative Cross"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: As of December 30, 2021, Ontario long-term care (LTC) residents who received a third dose of COVID-19 vaccine []84 days previously were offered a fourth dose to prevent a surge in COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality due to the Omicron variant.

On the basis of positive psychology, the entrepreneurs psychological quality and innovation ability were combined to help explore the entrepreneurs inner psychology and innovation ability. The study first analyzed the current development status and characteristics of new entrepreneurs through the literature review method, and explored the relationship between cross-cultural adaptation and new ventures. Second, it examined the relationship among achievement incentives, knowledge level, and the role of communication and entrepreneurs entrepreneurial intentions from the perspective of positive psychology. Finally, based on the influence relationship and personal experience, research hypotheses and models, the study verified the hypotheses by designing questionnaire surveys, and used the controlled variable method to conduct single-factor test analysis on influencing factors and perform a t-test on the data. The results show that the Cronbachs  coefficient in the QS is 0.894, which has good reliability.

Therefore, we propose an evolutionary deep learning model which is modified PSO-DNN based on DNN for prediction and a modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the kernel hyperparameters of DNN in a self-adaptive evolutionary way. In the modified PSO algorithm, introduce a micro population size setting to improve the search efficiency of the algorithm, as well as use the generalized opposition-based learning strategy to guide the population evolution.

Coxsackievirus A24 (CV-A24) was not originally associated with human disease, but in 1970 a pathogenic \\"variant\\" (CV-A24v) emerged, which is now the main cause of AHC. Initially, this variant circulated only in Southeast Asia, but it later spread worldwide, accounting for numerous AHC outbreaks and two pandemics. While both CV-A24 variant and nonvariant strains still circulate in humans, only variant strains cause AHC for reasons that are yet unknown.

We confirmed that TKI treatment could either antagonize or enhance the effect of ICIs in the co-culture assay using patients tumor cells and PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing that TKIs can have various effects on blood immune cells, which may affect their response to ICIs.

However, the evolving nature of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in emergence of new variants, thereby, posing a greater challenge in the management of the disease. India faced a deadlier second wave of infections very recently and genomic surveillance revealed that B.1.617 variant and its sub lineages are responsible for majority of the cases. These are highly infectious and possibly more lethal and therefore labelled as variants of concern by WHO. Hence, its crucial to determine if the current vaccines available can be effective against these variants. To address this, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on B.1.617 along with K417G variants and other RBD variants. We studied structural alteration of the spike protein and factors affecting antibody neutralization and immune escape. We found in seven of the 12 variants studied, there was a structural alteration in RBD region further affecting its stability and function. Docking analysis of RBD variants and wild type strain demonstrated increase in binding affinity with ACE2 (angiotensin 2 altered enzymes) receptor in these variants. Molecular interaction with CR3022 antibody revealed that binding affinity was less in comparison to wild type, with B.1.617 showing the least binding affinity. These findings from the extensive simulations provides novel mechanistic insights on the conformational dynamics and improves our understanding of the enhanced properties of these variants in terms of infectivity, transmissibility, neutralization potential, virulence and host-viral replication fitness.","output":"Impact of B.1.617 and RBD SARS-CoV-2 Variants on Vaccine Efficacy: An In-silico Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Advance care planning (ACP) for medical decision-making at the end of life has developed around the expectation of death from long-term, progressive chronic illnesses.

Do these observations reflect an exaggeration of usual ageism or a unique manifestation of intergenerational tension rooted in resentments of younger people concerning COVID-related disruptions in their lives believed to be primarily a function of older peoples vulnerability to the disease phenomenon? To address this question, the purpose of this study was to develop and test an instrument to measure ageist tendencies associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Scale items, written to reflect attitudes about paternalism, inconvenience, and sacrifice, were assessed for content validity. Then the 12-item scale was administered to 227 undergraduate and graduate students in the health and social sciences. Analysis showed items have strong internal consistency and concurrent and discriminant validity. Importantly the scale explained unique variance over and above other standard measures of ageism. Ageism is deeply embedded in global and U.S. culture and strongly related to negative outcomes.

Loneliness is associated with sleep-related problems, which in turn can be a risk factor for various psychiatric disorders. However, it is unclear whether loneliness is linked to sleep-related problems during the pandemic. Here, we studied the association between loneliness and sleep-related problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. METHODS: A total of 33,302 individuals who indicated they were employed were surveyed online. The survey responses of 27,036 participants were analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Of those analyzed, 2,750 (10.2%) experienced feelings of loneliness. Further, sleep-related problems were significantly more common among those who felt lonely both in the short term (more than 3 days) and the long term (more than 3 months). The ORs were much weaker after adjusting for factors related to interpersonal connections, such as family and friendships, than after adjusting for factors related to socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: Loneliness may be a risk factor for sleep-related problems in the COVID-19 pandemic.

The analysis focuses on trends and changes in the two most important forms of trade in banking services, namely, cross-border banking flows, which include direct cross-border banking flows and local banking flows of international banks' subsidiaries abroad, and foreign bank presence. It has been concluded that direct cross-border banking flows are more volatile than local banking flows of foreign banks during economic and social upheavals. The period under study has witnessed large increase in foreign bank presence, both in terms of number and local market share. The study determines changes of leading international banks and their home countries, highlighting the weakening position of banks from advanced countries and increase in the role of banks from emerging markets and developing countries. The authors review international expansion strategies of major banks from the post-Soviet states, that are influenced both by the opportunities and goals of banks going abroad, and by the institutional features of their banking systems;countries which these banks are targeting are predominantly comparable to the post-Soviet states in terms of economic development, and are chosen by criteria of their attractiveness, such as high level of trade and political relations with the bank's home country, the presence of diaspora, the degree of saturation and growth dynamics of the banking market in the host country. The reasons behind the banks' geographical expansion decision include, among many others, the dramatic growth of their economies, stimulated by the involvement in globalization processes, and liberal banking reforms. Obstacles of economic and non-economic nature that are hindering this expansion, encompass high level of competition in external banking markets, expensive financial resources of domestic banks, low level of expansion of the post-Soviet states-based enterprises to the non-post-Soviet states, discriminatory qualification requirements for personnel and composition of management bodies, problems related to banking licensing procedures and requirements, aspects of culture and communication;their transformation from local banks, operating in the local market, to banks with a clear manifestation of the tendency of their international expansion amidst changing global environment and uncertainty. ?

defined. METHODS: We identified patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least 1 repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction result a minimum of 90 days after the initial positive test and before 21 January 2021. Those with a repeat positive test were deemed to have reinfection (n = 75), and those with only negative tests were classified as convalescents (n = 1594). Demographics, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity, and treatment histories were obtained from the Boston Medical Center electronic medical record. Humoral responses were analyzed using SARS-CoV-2Cspecific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and pseudovirus neutralizations in a subset of reinfection (n = 16) and convalescent samples (n = 32). Univariate, multivariate, and time to event analyses were used to identify associations. RESULTS: Individuals with reinfection had more frequent testing at shorter intervals compared with the convalescents. Unstable housing was associated with more than 2-fold greater chance of reinfection. Preexisting comorbidities and COVID-19 severity after the initial infection were not associated with reinfection. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G levels and pseudovirus neutralization were not different within the early weeks after primary infection and at a timepoint at least 90 days later in the 2 groups. In the convalescents, but not in those with reinfection, the late as compared with early humoral responses were significantly higher.

This disruption to the economy provided an opportunity to measure change in air pollution when the population spends more time at home with fewer trips. Hourly air pollution observations were obtained for fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone from the Ontario air monitoring network for 2020 and the previous five years. The analysis is focused on a five-week period during the SOE with a previous five-week period used as a control. Fine particulate matter did not show any significant reductions during the SOE. Ozone concentrations at 12 of the 32 monitors were lower than any of the previous five-years; however, four locations were above average. Average ozone concentrations were 1 ppb lower during the SOE, but this ranged at individual monitors from 1.5 ppb above to 4.2 ppb below long-term conditions. Nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario, and both pollutants displayed their lowest concentrations for 22 of 29 monitors. Individual monitors ranged from 1 ppb (nitrogen dioxide) and 5 ppb (nitrogen oxides) above average to 4.5 (nitrogen dioxide) and 7.1 ppb (nitrogen oxides) below average. Overall, both nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen oxides demonstrated a reduction across Ontario in response to the COVID-19 SOE, ozone concentrations suggested a possible reduction, and fine particulate matter has not varied from historic concentrations.","output":"Air pollution in Ontario, Canada during the COVID-19 State of Emergency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design education has traditionally been deemed a face-to-face endeavor causing online learning to be disregarded as a viable teaching option. Nonetheless, the recent impact of COVID-19 pressured design schools to rapidly migrate online, impelling many educators to utilize this unfamiliar and largely dismissed methodology.

Accordingly, this study proposes a set of guidelines targeting design knowledge-building, based on an in-depth look at student experience during an online design course. Data were collected through a 63-item course efficiency survey (n = 59) and a series of semi-structured focus group interviews (n = 16) with the enrolled students.

Henry Ford Hospital serves a diverse multi ethnic population in the inner city and throughout metropolitan Detroit, and thus provided care to a significant percentage of COVID 19 patients in the state of Michigan. Retrospective reviews have described different hematologic abnormalities in patients with COVID-19. Various markers, such as lymphopenia, neutrophilia, elevated ferritin, and DDimer levels have been identified as predictors of poor outcomes, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hematologic characteristics on the risk of intubation and mortality in our unique patient population infected with COVID-19 who required ICU admission. Methods: This was a retrospective medical record review of adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 requiring admission to adult ICU at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, from March 1 to April 15, 2020. The main outcomes assessed were death and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Results: A total of 229 patients met the study inclusion criteria. Of the 76 surviving patients analyzed, 40 (53%) were men and 36 (47%) were women, including 59 (78%) Black and 11 (14%) White patients. The mean age at presentation was 61 (SD, 15) years. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (n=65 patients), followed by diabetes (n=39). Most surviving patients (n=60; 79%) were admitted to general practice units (GPU) and then transferred to ICU, while 49 (64%) patients required intubation. Among the 153 patients who died, 95 (62%) were men and 58 (38%) were women, with 41 (27%) being White and 99 (65%) Black. The mean age at presentation was 69 years (SD, 14.3). Hypertension was the most common presenting co-morbidity (n=118), followed by diabetes (n=72). More non-surviving patients were admitted directly to the ICU (n=71; 46%) and/or required intubation (n=147; 96%). Hematologic laboratory findings of the studied patients are represented in Table 1. Multivariate analysis of variables predictive of death and intubation are summarized in Table 2. Logistic modeling revealed an 18% increase in the odds of death and a 17% increase in odds of intubation for each unit increase in WBC. Also, for each unit increase in ANC, there was a 17% increase in odds of death and 21% increase in odds of intubation. Conclusions: Among patients with COVID-19 who required admission to ICU, Black patients were over-represented. Coronary artery disease (CAD), older age, and a lower oxygen saturation (SpO2) on initial triage in the emergency department were associated with increased mortality. A higher absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and white blood cell count (WBC) was associated with higher risk of intubation and death. Male sex and direct ICU admission were predictors of increased risk of intubation - and these patients were more likely to die. Contrary to other reports, lymphopenia did not increase odds of intubation or death in ICU, and neither the serum ferritin nor DDimer levels on admission were discriminators for death; however, higher peak levels during the hospitalization were linked to increased mortality. Inner city Black populations with advanced age, multiple co-morbidities, and COVID-19 may be at increased risk for ICU admission, and thereby at an increased risk of death. However, not all hematologic characteristics are generalizable with regard to intubation and mortality in ICU.

Utilizing a daily newspaper-based index of financial uncertainty associated with infectious diseases, we examine the association between pandemic-induced market uncertainty and herding behavior in a set of 49 global stock markets. More specifically, we study the pattern of cross-sectional market behavior and examine whether the pandemic-induced uncertainty drives directional similarity across the global stock markets that cannot be explained by the standard asset pricing models. Utilizing a time-varying variation of the static herding model, we first identify periods during which herding is detected. We then employ probit models to examine the possible association between pandemic-induced uncertainty and the formation of herding. Our findings show a strong association between herd formation in stock markets and COVID-19 induced market uncertainty. The herding effect of COVID-19 induced market uncertainty is particularly strong for emerging stock markets as well as European PIIGS stock markets that include some of the hardest hit economies in Europe by the pandemic. The findings establish a direct link between the recent pandemic and herd formation among market participants in global financial markets. Considering the evidence that herding behavior can drive security prices away from equilibrium values supported by fundamentals and further contribute to price fluctuations in financial markets, our findings have significant implications for policy makers and investors in their efforts to monitor investor sentiment and mitigate mis-valuations that might occur as a result.

Covid-19 is a recent worldwide virulent disease pandemic due to severe acute respiratory coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is related to the direct cytopathic effect and exaggerated immune response by which acute lung injury (ALI) and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome might be developed in critical cases. UA may inhibit main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and inhibits the interface flanked by SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and its entry point commonly recognized as angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

In this regards, forthcoming studies are reasonable to substantiate the therapeutic role of UA in Covid-19.

Empirical results illustrate a positive U-shaped nonlinear link between the level of high-tech industry development and CO2 emissions at the national level and regional (high, middle, and low) level. In terms of indirect impacts, high-tech industry development attenuates the reduction of CO2 emissions due to industry structure upgrades, and promotes economic growth to increase CO2 emissions slightly.

Cryo-EM structures of tetrameric rat ALDH1L1 revealed the architecture and functional domain interactions of this complex enzyme. Highly mobile N-terminal domains, which remove formyl from 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, undergo multiple transient inter-domain interactions. The C-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domains, which convert formyl to CO2, form unusually large interfaces with the intermediate domains, homologs of acyl/peptidyl carrier proteins (A/PCPs), which transfer the formyl group between the catalytic domains. The 4'-phosphopantetheine arm of the intermediate domain is fully extended and reaches deep into the catalytic pocket of the C-terminal domain. Remarkably, the tetrameric state of ALDH1L1 is indispensable for catalysis because the intermediate domain transfers formyl between the catalytic domains of different protomers.

The effect of temperature on the recrystallization mechanism is discussed in detail. An important key focus is the issue of anisotropy in stacking fault energy (SFE) in pure Mg and its effect on DRX mechanism. The dislocation slip activities on the low SFE basal plane was responsible for discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DDRX). Whereas, the dislocation slip activities on the high SFE prismatic/pyramidal planes could led to continuous dynamic recovery and recrystallization (CDRR). It was realized that DDRX leads to the formation of new DRX grains having texture, uncorrelated with the parent-deformed grain.

We selectively studied 83 patients (age 72  11, males n = 65) enrolled in the program within 9-month before the lockdown. The usual intervention was based on two daily 8-min sessions of slow intermittent in-home walking prescribed in circa-monthly hospital visits. During the lockdown, the program was updated by phone. Six-minute (6MWD) and pain-free walking distance (PFWD) were measured pre- and post-lockdown as well as body weight (BW), blood pressure (BP), and ankle-brachial index (ABI). Sixty-six patients were measured 117  23 days after their previous visit. A safe, pain-free execution of the prescribed sessions was reported (median distance: 74 km). Overall, the 6MWD was stable, while PFWD improved (p < 0.001). The improvement was not related to age/gender, comorbidities, type of home but to the time of enrollment before lockdown. The new-entry subjects ( 3 months; n = 35) obtained significant improvements post-lockdown for 6MWD and PFWD, while those previously enrolled (> 3 months; n = 31) were stable. Decreased BW with stable BP and ABI values were also recorded, with better outcomes for new-entry subjects. In PAD patients, a structured walking program performed inside home and purposely guided by phone was adhered to by patients and favored mobility and risk factor control during the COVID-19 pandemic, regardless of walking ability, type of home and external conditions.

Viral genomes can provide key insights into transmission chains and pathogenicity. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from thirty-two of the first SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (March 18C30) in Kingston Ontario, Canada. Viral genomes were sequenced using Ion Torrent (n = 24) and MinION (n = 27) sequencing platforms. SARS-CoV-2 genomes carried forty-six polymorphic sites including two missense and three synonymous variants in the spike protein gene. The D614G point mutation was the predominate viral strain in our cohort (92.6%). A heterozygous variant (C9994A) was detected by both sequencing platforms but filtered by the ARTIC network bioinformatic pipeline suggesting that heterozygous variants may be underreported in the SARS-CoV-2 literature. Phylogenetic analysis with 87,738 genomes in the GISAID database identified global origins and transmission events including multiple, international introductions as well as community spread. Reported travel history validated viral introduction and transmission inferred by phylogenetic analysis. Molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics may complement contact tracing and help reconstruct transmission chains of emerging diseases.

Media highlighted these experiences, but much of the focus was on changes in regularly menstruating cis-gendered women and unnecessary concerns about fertility. This was despite ample evidence of vaccine safety for people who were currently pregnant or conceived after vaccination. An overlooked phenomenon was reports of periods, spotting, or other unexpected vaginal bleeding in people who usually do not menstruate, including people assigned female at birth who are transmasculine, trans men, agender, non-binary, and other gender diverse identities. We present preliminary descriptions of post-vaccine menstrual experiences of a vaccinated, non-menstruating, gender diverse sample. METHODS We conducted an online survey to characterize the menstrual experiences of a diverse group of currently and formerly menstruating people from April 7, 2021 through Oct 7, 2021. From over 160,000 responses, we identified 552 people between the ages of 18 and 45 who 1) reported they usually do not menstruate; 2) reported using testosterone and/or gender-affirming hormones (some did not specify testosterone); and 3) were not cis women. In addition to demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender), we asked multiple-choice and open-ended questions about current menstrual status (including why they do not menstruate), hormone medications, contraceptive use, and menstrual symptoms after being vaccinated. Here, we combine experiences for both doses of the vaccine for analysis and group period, spotting, and other menstrual bleeding into one category called \\"breakthrough bleeding\\". RESULTS In this sample (n=552, age=25.6 +/- 5.7 (mean +/-SD)), most respondents (84%, 463/552) selected more than one gender, with the most common for this subsample being transgender (n=460), man or man identified (n=373), non-binary (n=241), and genderqueer/gender non-conforming (n=124). 33% of respondents (180/552) reported breakthrough bleeding after vaccination, 9% (52/552) reported chest or breast soreness, and 46% (254/552) reported having other symptoms they would usually associate with a period. In response to the open-ended question about other period related symptoms, respondents reported common symptoms such as cramping and bloating. A number of respondents also used the open-ended text boxes to report negative mental health in response to their period symptoms, including anxiety, depression, gender dysphoria, panic attacks, and suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS Many gender diverse people who received vaccines for COVID-19 experienced symptoms that are usually associated with menstruation, including unexpected bleeding. Because menstruation is usually considered in relation to fertility, other important aspects of this physiology are overlooked and this impacts people beyond fertile women. Attentiveness to menstruation beyond fertility and more inclusive use of gender in clinical trials is important to prepare people for potential side effects, address medically underserved populations, and reduce vaccine hesitancy.","output":"Menstrual experiences after COVID-19 vaccination in a non-menstruating gender diverse sample."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The Nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 has prompted medical faculty all across Indian sub-continent to start online classes, with no prior sensitization and experience. This study was planned to assess the perceptions of medical students on online teaching. Methods The data was collected from medical students across India, through an anonymous online survey. Their feedback and perceptions regarding online teaching were recorded and analyzed. Results Of the 1256 complete responses received, > 60% of the students reported online lectures to be less interesting, less interactive and less engaging.They disagreed that online learning gives stronger sense of community among students and are capable of replacing the traditional didactic lecture format but were of the opinion that online learning encourages medical students to exert greater control over their learning by allowing flexibility over content and pace.The majority of students felt online teaching is a better opportunity for introvert students to express themselves through chat messages and it requires more self-direction and discipline. Conclusion The results showed that students were not much satisfied with online teaching. The possible reason could be lack of awareness of faculty about the available online teaching-learning strategies. To make online teaching more interesting and interactive, medical educators should more often engage in E-learning in an effort to come up with innovative approaches to train medical students.Teachers must undergo faculty development training to learn the use of technology in teaching.

Therapeutic use of remdesivir (prototype anti-viral drug) was also able to rescue thymic atrophy. While Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2 caused marginal thymic atrophy, delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 exhibited most profound thymic atrophy characterized by severely depleted DP T cells.

A larger set of microRNA changes was observed at 24 h postinfection. When integrated with mRNA expression data, the small RNA-Seq data indicated a role for microRNAs in transcriptional regulation, T cell activation, and cell cycle during HIV infection. As a unique benefit of next-generation sequencing, we also detected candidate novel host microRNAs differentially expressed during infection, including one whose downregulation at 24 h postinfection may allow full replication of HIV to proceed.

Our path analyses showed that both human and national identity predicted empathy and prosocial action intentions toward groups in need. Human identification was a positive, and national identification a negative predictor of political action intention. While both identification with all humanity and national identity united people in caring for others in a crisis, the two forms of identification divided them in questioning governmental measures. Identification with all humanity made people not only sensitive to vulnerable groups, but critical to the government and made them more willing to challenge political decisions.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of multiple CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia on initial presentation in nonelderly patients without underlying medical conditions. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, thirty laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with no known major underlying disease who underwent a chest CT scan and expired of pneumonia within the following 30 days after admission, were included as case group. Sixty control subjects individually matched on their age, gender, without underlying medical conditions, who received same-criteria standard care and were discharged from the hospital in 30-day follow-up were included in the control group. A conditional logistic regression model was applied RESULTS: Applying a univariate conditional logistic regression model, it was revealed that bilateral lung disease, anterior involvement, central extension, GGO, consolidation, air bronchograms, pleural effusion, BMI  25 kg/m2 and CT severity score were the significant preliminary predictors (all p-values < 0.05). Next, by applying a multivariate conditional logistic regression model, it was determined that the CT severity score is the only statistically significant CT predictor of mortality (Odds Ratio = 1.99, Confidence Interval: 1.01-4.06, p-value < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis revealed a score of 7.5 as the cut-off point of CT severity score with the highest sensitivity (0.83) and specificity (0.87). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that CT severity score is a reliable predictor factor of mortality in nonelderly previously healthy individuals with COVID-19 pneumonia. Assessment of disease extension in addition to the morphological pattern is necessary for CT reports of COVID-19 patients. This may alert the clinicians to alter the management for this specific group of patients, even when they are clinically silent or have a mild presentation.","output":"Predictive Value of CT in the Short-term Mortality of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pneumonia in Nonelderly Patients: A Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that causes serious and highly contagious enteric disease in swine worldwide.

PRESENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 vaccine development efforts started in early January 2020 when Chinese scientists shared the Coronavirus genomic sequence in public domain. Approximately 321 research groups initiated the search for a vaccine, out of which 41 have reached phase I/II trails and 11 reached phase-III clinical trials, including approved vaccines for early to limited use. Out of these projects are two labs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia still in early stages of development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Several vaccine attempts are being tested from traditional, attenuated virus methods, to new nucleic acid-based designs. However, no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials and reached public domain. In spite of the challenges faced during previous vaccine trials, researchers have found that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 is structurally similar to the (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Both SARS strains show identical affinity towards the type-II alveolar pneumocytes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor binding domains and therefore, similar pathogenicity. The race to develop the vaccine is predominantly for individuals at high risk of developing the infection, i.e. population groups who are most susceptible to experiencing fatal symptoms of the coronavirus. These include patients with comorbidities, above the age of 60 years and people at risk of contracting large viral loads, such as healthcare providers caring for critical admissions in in-patient wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Room settings. SUMMARY: Many different vaccine strategies are under development throughout different stages of the research timeline; however, it is estimated that none will show favorable results before end of 2020. For any immunization or interventional prevention/therapy system to reach the public and patients at high risk, it needs to undergo multiple phase trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. In this scoping review we aim to map the literature on COVID-19 vaccines and provide recommendations related to gaps in research, applicability and expected challenges for implementation of nationwide vaccination in Saudi Arabia.","output":"Status of the Current COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates: Implications in the Saudi Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 since the first quarter of the year 2020, Nigerian education has not remained the same. Different stakeholders in the education sector have invested their idea in ensuring compliance with the paradigm shift brought about by the new normal. However, the mode of ICT infrastructures and other amenities in almost all the States in Nigeria that can support virtual academic activities is in hibernation. Critically examined in this paper are the roles played by the virtual methods as teaching and learning methodologies in Nigerian schools since the COVID-19 outbreak. The paper thoroughly scanned the new normal global trends in virtual education and the important roles played by ICT. Responsive academic website design and adoption, adoption of blended teaching/learning model, and use of social networks among others were identified as best practices to adopt to secure a place for education in Nigeria in the face of the imminent change in teaching methodologies post COVID-19. Furthermore, the study considered perceived challenges both teachers and learners may be confronted with in deploying relevant ICT infrastructures geared towards transitioning from traditional to online provision of services in support of teaching and learning. The paper recommended dynamism in the method of teaching delivery, urgency in the acquisition of new skill sets by academics in Nigeria, while also calling on relevant stakeholders to provide adequate funding for academic institutions to be able to deploy relevant ICT infrastructures needed to adequately support teaching and learning in a virtual environment.","output":"COVID-19 and Virtual World: The Implications on Nigeria Education (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To study the distribution and frequencies of ABO and Rhesus (Rh) blood groups among confirmed cases of Covid19 infection .We also studied the relation between ABO blood group system and lymphopenia and studied the gender association in COVID19 patients.

However, the clinical efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is unclear. Methods: The Pass ive I mmunity T rial for O ur N ation (PassITON), is a multicenter, placebo-controlled, blinded, randomized clinical trial being conducted in the United States to provide high-quality evidence on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma as a treatment for adults hospitalized with symptomatic disease. Adults hospitalized with COVID-19 with respiratory symptoms for less than 14 days are eligible. Enrolled patients are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 unit (200-399 mL) of COVID-19 convalescent plasma that has demonstrated neutralizing function using a SARS-CoV-2 chimeric virus neutralization assay. Study treatments are administered in a blinded fashion and patients are followed for 28 days. The primary outcome is clinical status 14 days after study treatment as measured on a 7-category ordinal scale assessing mortality, respiratory support, and return to normal activities of daily living. Key secondary outcomes include mortality and oxygen-free days. The trial is projected to enroll 1000 patients and is designed to detect an odds ratio a 0.73 for the primary outcome. Discussion: This trial will provide the most robust data available to date on the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma for the treatment of adults hospitalized with acute moderate to severe COVID-19. These data will be useful to guide the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the current pandemic and for informing decisions about whether developing a standardized infrastructure for collecting and disseminating convalescent plasma to prepare for future viral pandemics is indicated.

Contact tracing is shown to be remarkably effective in a workplace environment and the effectiveness depends strongly on the minimum duration of contact required to initiate quarantine. In a realistic social network, we find that forward contact tracing with immediate isolation can reduce an epidemic by more than 70%.

Several therapeutic options are currently emerging but none with universal consensus or proven efficacy. Solid organ transplant recipients are perceived to be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 because of their immunosuppressed conditions due to chronic use of immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs). It is therefore likely that solid organ transplant recipients will be treated with these experimental antivirals. METHODS: This article is not intended to provide a systematic literature review on investigational treatments tested against COVID-19; rather, the authors aim to provide recommendations for therapeutic drug monitoring of ISDs in transplant recipients infected with SARS-CoV-2 based on a review of existing data in the literature. RESULTS: Management of drugCdrug interactions between investigational anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs and immunosuppressants is a complex task for the clinician. Adequate immunosuppression is necessary to prevent graft rejection while, if critically ill, the patient may benefit from pharmacotherapeutic interventions directed at limiting SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Maintaining ISD concentrations within the desired therapeutic range requires a highly individualized approach that is complicated by the pandemic context and lack of hindsight.

The continuous spread and great pandemic potential of MERS-CoV make it necessarily important to develop effective vaccines. We previously demonstrated that the application of Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particles as a bacterial vector displaying the MERS-CoV receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS vaccine candidate that is capable of producing potential neutralization antibodies. We have also used the rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector to design a recombinant vaccine by expressing the MERS-CoV S1 (spike) protein on the surface of the RV. In this study, we compared the immunological efficacy of the vaccine candidates in BALB/c mice in terms of the levels of humoral and cellular immune responses. The results show that the rabies virus vector-based vaccine can induce remarkably earlier antibody response and higher levels of cellular immunity than the GEM particles vector. However, the GEM particles vector-based vaccine candidate can induce remarkably higher antibody response, even at a very low dose of 1 g. These results indicate that vaccines constructed using different vaccine vector platforms for the same pathogen have different rates and trends in humoral and cellular immune responses in the same animal model. This discovery not only provides more alternative vaccine development platforms for MERS-CoV vaccine development, but also provides a theoretical basis for our future selection of vaccine vector platforms for other specific pathogens.","output":"Characterization of the Immune Response of MERS-CoV Vaccine Candidates Derived from Two Different Vectors in Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID\\\\19 is a global pandemic with a daily increasing number of affected individuals.

While few thermodynamic stability data are available for S-protein mutants, many systematic experimental data exist for their expression. In this paper, we explore whether such expression levels relate to the thermodynamic stability of the mutants. We studied mutation-induced SARS-CoV-2 S-protein fold stability, as computed by three very distinct methods and eight different protein structures to account for method- and structure-dependencies. For all methods and structures used (24 comparisons), computed stability changes correlate significantly (99% confidence level) with experimental yeast expression from the literature, such that higher expression is associated with relatively higher fold stability. Also significant, albeit weaker, correlations were seen for ACE2 binding. The effect of thermodynamic fold stability may be direct or a correlate of amino acid or site properties, notably the solvent exposure of the site. Correlation between computed stability and experimental expression and ACE2 binding suggests that functional properties of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein mutant space are largely determined by a few simple features, due to underlying correlations.

Furthermore, whether VOCs trigger Fc functions with altered specificity, as has been reported for neutralization, is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the Beta VOC partially evades Fc effector activity in individuals infected with the original (D614G) variant. However, not all functions are equivalently affected, suggesting differential targeting by antibodies mediating distinct Fc functions. Furthermore, Beta infection triggered responses with significantly improved Fc cross-reactivity against global VOCs compared to either D614G infected or Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals. This suggests that, as for neutralization, the infecting spike sequence impacts Fc effector function.

Lockdown measures implemented in many countries have delayed virus spread. However, a considerable number of people have faced unprecedented pressure, especially pregnant and breast-feeding women, because face-to-face professional support has been reduced during the lockdown in many countries. OBJECTIVES: To compare the delivery and infant feeding experiences of women who delivered before (BL) versus during (DL) the Covid-19 pandemic in Beijing, China and to investigate predictors of breastfeeding at 6-months. METHODS: Women aged 18 years with an infant 18 months of age completed an anonymous survey. Information/links were shared online and via local clinics in Beijing. Logistic regression was performed to assess predictors of breastfeeding during the first 6-months. RESULTS: One thousand eight hundred seven women provided data; BL 1231 (68.1%), DL 576 (31.9%). Significantly more mothers in DL group reported the lockdown had moderate to high impact to their household income (p = 0.013) and the convenience of purchasing daily necessities(p = 0.014). Compared to BL mothers, significantly more mothers in the DL groups thought their birth location and breastfeeding intention had been effected by the COVID-19 (p < 0.001, p = 0.036 respectively). Mostly breastfeeding (MBF, mainly breastfeeding with few non-formula fluids added) at 6 months was predicted by delivery during the lockdown period (OR1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08, 1.90), younger maternal age (OR 0.96, 95%CI 0.93, 0.99), getting support from friends or relatives (OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.06, 3.59), and discussing health issues in online groups > four times a week (OR 1.66, 95%CI 1.09, 2.53).

Type I IFNs can influence dendritic cell (DC) activation, maturation, migration, and survival, but also directly enhance natural killer (NK) and T/B cell activity, thus orchestrating various innate and adaptive immune effector functions. Therefore, type I IFNs have long been considered essential in the host defense against virus infections. More recently, it has become clear that depending on the type of virus and the course of infection, production of type I IFN can also lead to immunopathology or immunosuppression. Similarly, in bacterial infections type I IFN production is often associated with detrimental effects for the host. Although most cells in the body are thought to be able to produce type I IFN, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have been termed the natural IFN producing cells due to their unique molecular adaptations to nucleic acid sensing and ability to produce high amounts of type I IFN. Findings from mouse reporter strains and depletion experiments in in vivo infection models have brought new insights and established that the role of pDCs in type I IFN production in vivo is less important than assumed. Production of type I IFN, especially the early synthesized IFN, is rather realized by a variety of cell types and cannot be mainly attributed to pDCs. Indeed, the cell populations responsible for type I IFN production vary with the type of pathogen, its tissue tropism, and the route of infection. In this review, we summarize recent findings from in vivo models on the cellular source of type I IFN in different infectious settings, ranging from virus, bacteria, and fungi to eukaryotic parasites. The implications from these findings for the development of new vaccination and therapeutic designs targeting the respectively defined cell types are discussed.","output":"Sources of Type I Interferons in Infectious Immunity: Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Not Always in the Driver's Seat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic has been a significant disruptor to traditional medical care. Burn patients are an interesting population in which to evaluate this disruption due to the complicated, multidisciplinary nature of injury management. Understanding the current landscape of burn care during the pandemic is a crucial first step in preparing for future pandemic impacts. The purpose of this study was to identify the current status of burn treatment during COVID by evaluating existing literature surrounding burns and COVID. METHODS: A literature review of articles published between March 2020 and August 2021 was conducted to determine trends in studies evaluating burn patients and burn center operation during this time frame. All ABA abstracts published in 2020 containing the key words burn, COVID, and/or coronavirus were reviewed. Additionally, a Pubmed search was conducted using the same keywords. Each abstract and article was sorted into one of four themes: Census/Etiology, Burn patients with COVID, Safe Practices/Protocols, and Telemedicine. RESULTS: A total of 23 ABA abstracts and 126 articles were collected in the initial search. 63 articles were ultimately excluded because they did not report on burn patients. By theme, the following trends were seen: 1. Census/Etiology: Data on demographics of burn patients during this period was varied. Admissions for adult and/or pediatric burns increased for multiple burn centers, while others reported decreases. Consistently, the most common etiology of burn injury was scald, and an increased proportion of injuries were found to occur at home. Changes in the rates of first, second, and third-degree burns were also observed. 2. Burn patients with COVID: Overall, numerous reports indicated decreases in patient length of stay. However, several groups found no differences in length of stay, surgery rate, and length of follow-up. 3. Safe Practices: A recurring trend was observed of numerous burn centers having to implement increased safety protocols due to COVID-19. Select burn centers updated prevention guidelines for burn surgeons and patient care. 4. Telemedicine: The implementation of telemedicine helped minimize risk and maximize resources, However, much remains to be standardized, including the quality of images used. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of the current literature identified several overarching themes in the care of burn patients. Continued evaluation can identify innovations from the past year that should become best practices, as well as optimize preparation efforts for future disruptions in care.","output":"759 Burn Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Assessing the Current Literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM Nosocomial infections (NI) in neonates are associated with prolonged hospitalisation, adverse neurodevelopmental outcome and high mortality.

METHODS PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for evidence regarding epidemiology and prevention of NI in neonates. Extracted studies were synthesised in a narrative form with experiential reflection. RESULTS Despite the abundance of geographically defined incidence proportions, an epidemiological overview of NI is difficult to provide, given the lack of consensus definition for neonatal NI and different baseline populations being compared. Successful prevention efforts have focused on implementing evidence-based practices while eliminating outdated strategies. The most promising model for reduction in infection rates is based on quality improvement (QI) collaboratives and benchmarking, involving identification and implementation of best practices, selection of measurable outcomes and fostering a sense of community and transparency.

Each of the three mutations confers asynchronous development of two main cortical neuronal lineages-?3-aminobutyric-acid-releasing (GABAergic) neurons and deep-layer excitatory projection neurons-but acts through largely distinct molecular pathways. Although these phenotypes are consistent across cell lines, their expressivity is influenced by the individual genomic context, in a manner that is dependent on both the risk gene and the developmental defect. Calcium imaging in intact organoids shows that these early-stage developmental changes are followed by abnormal circuit activity.

The viral lineages responsible for Uruguayan urban outbreaks were defined by a set of between four and 11 mutations (synonymous and non-synonymous) with respect to the ancestral B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 viruses that arose in Brazil, supporting the notion of a rapid genetic differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 subpopulations spreading in South America. Although Uruguayan borders have remained essentially closed to non-Uruguayan citizens, the inevitable flow of people across the dry border with Brazil allowed the repeated entry of the virus into Uruguay and the subsequent emergence of local outbreaks in Uruguayan border localities. Implementation of coordinated bi-national surveillance systems is crucial to achieve an efficient control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread across this kind of highly permeable borderland regions around the world.","output":"Recurrent Dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 Through the Uruguayan-Brazilian Border"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Brasil was reported on February 25th, 2020, and by April 3rd, 8076 were confirmed in the country.

Preliminary data on SARS-CoV-2 infection suggest that some immunocompromised hosts experience worse outcomes. We performed a retrospective matched cohort study to characterize outcomes in HIV-positive patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: Leveraging data collected from electronic medical records for all patients hospitalized at NYU Langone Health with COVID-19 between March 2, 2020, and April 23, 2020, we matched 21 HIV-positive patients with 42 non-HIV patients using a greedy nearest-neighbor algorithm. Admission characteristics, laboratory test results, and hospital outcomes were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Although there was a trend toward increased rates of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality in HIV-positive patients, these differences were not statistically significant. Rates for these outcomes in our cohort are similar to those previously published for all patients hospitalized with COVID-19. HIV-positive patients had significantly higher admission and peak C-reactive protein values. Other inflammatory markers did not differ significantly between groups, although HIV-positive patients tended to have higher peak values during their clinical course. Three HIV-positive patients had superimposed bacterial pneumonia with positive sputum cultures, and all 3 patients died during hospitalization. There was no difference in frequency of thrombotic events or myocardial infarction between these groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that HIV coinfection does not significantly impact presentation, hospital course, or outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, when compared with matched non-HIV patients. A larger study is required to determine whether the trends we observed apply to all HIV-positive patients.","output":"Outcomes Among HIV-Positive Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pneumonia is characterized by ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidations on Chest CT, although these CT features cannot be considered specific, at least on a qualitative analysis. The aim is to evaluate if Quantitative Chest CT could provide reliable information in discriminating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 31, 2020 until April 18, 2020, patients with Chest CT suggestive for interstitial pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled and divided into two groups based on positive/negative COVID-19 RT-PCR results. Patients with pulmonary resection and/or CT motion artifacts were excluded. Quantitative Chest CT analysis was performed with a dedicated software that provides total lung volume, healthy parenchyma, GGOs, consolidations and fibrotic alterations, expressed both in liters and percentage. Two radiologists in consensus revised software analysis and adjusted areas of lung impairment in case of non-adequate segmentation. Data obtained were compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients and p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Performance of statistically significant parameters was tested by ROC curve analysis. RESULTS: Final population enrolled included 190 patients: 136 COVID-19 patients (87 male, 49 female, mean age 66  16) and 54 non-COVID-19 patients (25 male, 29 female, mean age 63  15). Lung quantification in liters showed significant differences between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients for GGOs (0.55  0.26L vs 0.43  0.23L, p = 0.0005) and fibrotic alterations (0.05  0.03 L vs 0.04  0.03 L, p < 0.0001).

However, comparative analyses focusing on identifying regulatory elements and patterns that led to distinct venom composition are still scarce. Among venomous snakes, Bothrops cotiara and Bothrops fonsecai represent ideal models to complement our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of venom production. These recently diverged species share a similar specialized diet, habitat, and natural history, but each presents a distinct venom phenotype. Here, we integrated data from the venom gland transcriptome and miRNome and the venom proteome of B. fonsecai and B. cotiara to better understand the regulatory mechanisms that may be acting to produce differing venom compositions. We detected not only the presence of similar toxin isoforms in both species but also distinct expression profiles of phospholipases A2 (PLA2) and some snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and snake venom serine proteinases (SVSPs) isoforms. We found evidence of modular expression regulation of several toxin isoforms implicated in venom divergence and observed correlated expression of several transcription factors. We did not find strong evidence for miRNAs shaping interspecific divergence of the venom phenotypes, but we identified a subset of toxin isoforms whose final expression may be fine-tuned by specific miRNAs. Sequence analysis on orthologous toxins showed a high rate of substitutions between PLA2s, which indicates that these toxins may be under strong positive selection or represent paralogous toxins in these species. Our results support other recent studies in suggesting that gene regulation is a principal mode of venom evolution across recent timescales, especially among species with conserved ecotypes.","output":"Differences in PLA2 Constitution Distinguish the Venom of Two Endemic Brazilian Mountain Lanceheads, Bothrops cotiara and Bothrops fonsecai"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has proven to be a disruptive and world-altering event often forcing professional salespeople to rapidly change the manner in which they do business.

Bricolage is a combination of making do under environmental conditions of resource constraint. Bricolage characterizes a salesperson's ability to utilize available resources effectively by assessing available resources and working to reconfigure them in order to meet new challenges and create opportunities. Drawing on qualitative and quantitative research from professional salespeople, this study identifies a salesperson's creativity, learning-orientation, and grit as three important antecedents to salesperson bricolage. Moreover, this study shows that salesperson bricolage relates positively to sales performance under conditions shaped by the COVID-19 disruption; with salesperson bricolage becoming more strongly related to sales performance when sales environments are more highly disrupted by the pandemic.","output":"An examination of salesperson bricolage during a critical sales disruption: Selling during the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"p97 processes ubiquitinated substrates and plays a central role in cellular protein homeostasis.

A key feature of these structures is the critical conformational changes of the inter-subunit signaling (ISS) motifs, which tightens the binding of nucleotides and neighboring subunits, and contributes to the spiral staircase conformation of the D1 and D2 rings. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of human p97 in complex with NMS-873, the most potent p97 inhibitor. The structures showed that NMS-873 binds at a cryptic groove in the D2 domain and interacts with the ISS motif, preventing its conformational change, thus blocking substrate translocation allosterically.","output":"Mechanistic insight into substrate processing and allosteric inhibition of human p97"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this paper is to explore why impulsive buying happens under emergency and crisis situations, such as that of COVID-19.

Through a multilevel structural equation model (MSEM) analysis, we found that the daily perceived uncertainty on COVID-19 affected daily information overload, which in turn stimulated daily information anxiety, ultimately determining the daily impulsive buying. Namely, daily information overload and daily information anxiety played a complete chain-mediating role between the daily perceived uncertainty on COVID-19 and daily impulsive buying.

The objective of this report is to describe the characteristics and outcome observed among 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest academic hospital in KSA, and assess co-infection with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Methods: This single-center case series data included select epidemiological, clinical, radiological features and laboratory findings of all confirmed hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC), Riyadh, KSA, from March 22 until May 31, 2020, followed through June 6, 2020. We conducted retrospective analysis of listed data from 99 hospitalized patients and present characteristics and factors associated with severity in percentages and univariate odds ratios. Cases were confirmed using nasopharyngeal or throat swab by real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and MERS-CoV by RT-PCR. Results: The 99 hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in this analysis constitute 16% of 632 positive SARS-CoV-2 among 6633 persons who were tested at the KSUMC (positivity rate, 9.4%). MERS-CoV PCR was negative in all 99 patients tested. The majority of these 99 hospitalized patients were males (66%), had a mean age of 44 years (range, 19C87), and a quarter (25.3%) were health care workers. Patients with comorbid conditions accounted for 52.5% of patients including the 8.1% who were asymptomatic; diabetes mellitus being the most frequent (31.3%), followed by hypertension (22.2%). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (67.7%), cough (60.6%), dyspnea (43.4%), upper respiratory symptoms (27.3%), fatigue (26.3%), diarrhea (19.2%) and loss of smell (9.1%). The clinical conditions among these 99 patients included upper respiratory tract infection (47.5%), abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers a fifth (21%) of patients had moderate pneumonia, while 7% had severe pneumonia with 22.2% requiring admission to the intensive care unit and 12.1% died. Late presentation with severe disease, an abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, high inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, and procalcitonin), and end organ damage (high creatinine or high aspartate aminotransferase) were predictors for admission to critical care unit or died. Conclusion: We observed no MERS-CoV co-infection in this early cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were relatively young, more than half had comorbid conditions, presented with fever and/or cough, an abnormal chest X-ray, lymphopenia, and high inflammatory markers.

METHODS Twenty-four male BALB/c mice were randomly separated into a control group (CON), ovalbumin (OVA) group, and an OVA + RSV group, (n=8 mice/group). At the end of experiments, we evaluated the RSV-infected asthma model using Wright-Giemsa staining, histopathology and immunoglobulin E (IgE) level using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Next, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) was measured using Buxco's modular and invasive system. Furthermore, IL cytokine expression were measured using ELISA. Moreover, feces were collected for 16S ribosome RNA (16S rRNA) sequencing and data analysis. RESULTS We observed that the total BAL fluid lung cells in the OVA + RSV group was significantly higher than other group. we revealed that the inflammatory infiltration, edema, and collagen hyperplasia were more severe in the OVA + RSV group. The AHR of RSV-infected mice was aggravated compared with the other groups, (P<0.05 and P<0.01). We observed a higher expression of IgE, interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-25, and IL-33 levels in mice from the OVA and OVA + RSV groups (P<0.05 and P<0.01).

Historically, RNA viruses produced in cell cultures have been identified using electron microscopy, in which virus identification is performed by eye. Such an approach is time consuming and depends on manual controls. Moreover, detailed knowledge about RNA viruses is required. This study introduces the Entropy-Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System (Entropy-ANFIS method), which can be used to automatically detect RNA virus images. This system consists of four stages: pre-processing, feature extraction, classification and testing the Entropy-ANFIS method with respect to the correct classification ratio. In the pre-processing stage, a center-edge changing method is used, in which the Euclidian distances are calculated from the center pixels to the edges of the imaged object. In this way, the distance vector is obtained. This calculation is repeated for each RNA virus image. In feature extraction, stage norm entropy, logarithmic energy and threshold entropy values are calculated to form the feature vector. The obtained feature vector is independent of the rotation and scale of the RNA virus image. In the classification stage, the feature vector is given as input to the ANFIS classifier, ANN classifier and FCM cluster. Finally, the test stage is performed to evaluate the correct classification ratio of the Entropy-ANFIS algorithm for the RNA virus images.

Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalized or discharged from a single referral center. Patients who were unable to answer (intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased) or unreachable by telephone were excluded. Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria; 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and 3 refused. Exposures Sinonasal manifestations reported before COVID-19 diagnosis were studied with a validated questionnaire: Italian Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (I-SNOT-22). If reduction of taste and/or smell was documented by item 5 of the I-SNOT-22, further inquiries were made to score them separately on a scale from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no problem and 5 indicating problem as bad as it can be. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of sinonasal manifestations preceding COVID-19 diagnosis. Results Among the 204 patients enrolled (110 [53.9%] male; mean [SD] age, 52.6 [14.4] years), the median I-SNOT-22 total score was 21 (range, 0-73). I-SNOT-22 identified 116 patients (56.9%) with reduction of taste and/or smell, 113 (55.4%) with taste reduction (median score, 5; range, 2-5), and 85 (41.7%) with smell reduction (median score, 5; range, 1-5). Eighty-two patients (40.2%) reported both. Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7%), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3%). Only 12 patients (14.8%) with severe taste reduction and 12 patients (16.7%) with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. Severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female vs male patients (odds ratios, 3.16 [95% CI, 1.76-5.67] vs 2.58 [95% CI, 1.43-4.65]) and middle-aged vs younger patients (effect sizes, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.21-0.78] vs 0.85 [95% CI, 0.55-1.15]). No significant association was observed between smoking habits and severe reduction of taste (odds ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.53-1.71) and/or smell (odds ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.35-1.21). Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this telephone survey study suggest that reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of COVID-19. Nasal obstruction was not commonly present at the onset of the disease in this study. The general practitioner may play a pivotal role in identifying potential COVID-19 in patients at an early stage if taste and/or smell alterations manifest and in suggesting quarantine before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.","output":"Prevalence of Taste and Smell Dysfunction in Coronavirus Disease 2019."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We measure the effect of different public health regulations to the spread of COVID-19, based on a SEIRA model -- a SEIR model including asymptomatic transmissions.

Given that many students reportedly use prescription stimulants for academic purposes, empirical investigations are needed to identify those students at risk for prescription stimulant misuse (PSM). The purpose of the current study was to examine the role of coping styles on the association between prescription stimulant use and related consequences. We hypothesized that more maladaptive (vs. adaptive) coping strategies would mediate this association, particularly for underclassmen (freshmen/sophomores) and men.Method: Participants were n = 787 college students across seven universities in the United States who completed an online survey assessing substance use and coping behaviors. Prior to hypothesis testing, we conducted factor analysis on the COPE measure and found support for a three-factor solution, which we named maladaptive coping, adaptive coping, and supportive coping.Results: Prescription stimulant use was positively related to stimulant-related negative consequences. Multiple mediation analyses indicated that the maladaptive coping factor partially mediated this direct association. Multi-group analyses revealed that maladaptive coping style was a significant mediator for college women in the sample, but not men.

We conducted a systematic review to assess the extent to which health services related to the care and management of acute cardiovascular events have been impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, MedRxiv and Google Scholar were searched for observational studies published up to August 12, 2020 for studies that assessed the impact of the pandemic on the care and management of people with acute CVD. RESULTS: In total, 27 articles were included. Of these, 16 examined the impact on acute coronary syndromes (ACS), eight on strokes, one on ACS and strokes, and 2 on other types of CVD. When comparing the COVID-19 period to non-COVID-19 periods, eleven studies observed a decrease in ACS admissions ranging between 40 and 50% and five studies showed a decrease in stroke admissions of between 12 and 40%. Four studies showed a larger reduction in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMI) compared to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMI). A decrease in the number of reperfusion procedures, a shortening in the lengths of stay at the hospital, and longer symptom-to-door times were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial decrease in the rate of admissions for acute CVD, reductions in the number of procedures, shortened lengths of stay at the hospital and longer delays between the onset of the symptoms and hospital treatment.

This cohort is compared to a cohort of patients treated with a traditional open approach. RESULTS: Patients treated with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) had no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics compared to patients treated with open procedures. Patients treated with MIS had decreases in complication rates, estimated blood loss, and length of stay in the hospital compared to the patients treated with open procedures, but these differences did not reach levels of statistical significance.

It remains unclear how changes in adolescents' daily physical and social behaviours affect their sleep. The present study examined the daily and average effects of physical activity and social media use (i.e., video chatting, texting, and social networking sites) on adolescent girls' sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescent girls aged 12-17 years (N = 93; 69% White) from a larger longitudinal study completed a 10-day daily diary protocol during state-mandated stay-at-home orders. Girls reported on daily sleep (duration, timing, quality), physical activity, and social media use during COVID-19. Multilevel modelling was used to examine the within- and between-person effects of physical activity and social media on sleep duration, timing, and quality during the 10-day period. Between-person associations indicate that youth with greater social media use (texting, video chatting, and social networking) and less physical activity had later sleep timing across the 10-day study period. Only video chatting was associated with shorter sleep duration. There were no within-person effects of physical activity or social media activities on sleep outcomes. Findings indicate that physical activity and social media use may impact later adolescent sleep timing during the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be critical for research to examine the potential long-term costs of delayed sleep timing, and whether targeting specific youth behaviours associated with sleep and circadian disruption improve mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","output":"Daily and average associations of physical activity, social media use, and sleep among adolescent girls during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exacerbated and persistent innate immune response marked by pro-inflammatory cytokine expression is thought to be a major driver of chronic COVID-19 pathology. Although macrophages are not the primary target cells of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, viral RNA and antigens in activated monocytes and macrophages have been detected in post-mortem samples, and dysfunctional monocytes and macrophages have been hypothesized to contribute to a protracted hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19 patients. In this study, we demonstrate that CD169, a myeloid cell specific I-type lectin, facilitated ACE2-independent SARS-CoV-2 fusion and entry in macrophages. CD169-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry in macrophages resulted in expression of viral genomic and sub-genomic (sg) RNAs with minimal viral protein expression and no infectious viral particle release, suggesting a post-entry restriction of the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. Intriguingly this post-entry replication block was alleviated by exogenous ACE2 expression in macrophages. Restricted expression of viral gRNA and sgRNA in CD169(+) macrophages elicited a pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (TNF, IL-6 and IL-1) in a RIG-I, MDA-5 and MAVS-dependent manner, which was suppressed by remdesivir pre-treatment. These findings suggest that de novo expression of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in macrophages contributes to the pro-inflammatory cytokine signature and that blocking CD169-mediated ACE2 independent infection and subsequent activation of macrophages by viral RNA might alleviate COVID-19-associated hyperinflammatory response.","output":"CD169-mediated restrictive SARS-CoV-2 infection of macrophages induces pro-inflammatory responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While elective cardiac surgeries have been postponed to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission and to reduce resource utilization, patients with urgent indications necessitating surgery may still be at risk of contracting the disease throughout their postoperative recovery.

The inspiration of CHIO is originated from the herd immunity concept as a way to tackle coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). The speed of spreading coronavirus infection depends on how the infected individuals directly contact with other society members. In order to protect other members of society from the disease, social distancing is suggested by health experts. Herd immunity is a state the population reaches when most of the population is immune which results in the prevention of disease transmission. These concepts are modeled in terms of optimization concepts. CHIO mimics the herd immunity strategy as well as the social distancing concepts. Three types of individual cases are utilized for herd immunity: susceptible, infected, and immuned. This is to determine how the newly generated solution updates its genes with social distancing strategies. CHIO is evaluated using 23 well-known benchmark functions. Initially, the sensitivity of CHIO to its parameters is studied. Thereafter, the comparative evaluation against seven state-of-the-art methods is conducted. The comparative analysis verifies that CHIO is able to yield very competitive results compared to those obtained by other well-established methods. For more validations, three real-world engineering optimization problems extracted from IEEE-CEC 2011 are used. Again, CHIO is proved to be efficient. In conclusion, CHIO is a very powerful optimization algorithm that can be used to tackle many optimization problems across a wide variety of optimization domains.","output":"Coronavirus herd immunity optimizer (CHIO)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A dad sat down in March 2020 and started a Google doc to keep a record of resources for friends and family, track the progress of life and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and tried to stay sane.

COVID-19 outcomes were derived from Public Health England SARS-CoV-2 testing data, hospital admissions data, and death certificates (until 18 August 2020). Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between smoking status and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, and COVID-19-related death. Inverse variance-weighted MR analyses using established genetic instruments for smoking initiation and smoking heaviness were undertaken (reported per SD increase). RESULTS: There were 421 469 eligible participants, 1649 confirmed infections, 968 COVID-19-related hospitalisations and 444 COVID-19-related deaths. Compared with never-smokers, current smokers had higher risks of hospitalisation (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.29) and mortality (smoking 1C9/day: OR 2.14, 95% CI 0.87 to 5.24; 10C19/day: OR 5.91, 95% CI 3.66 to 9.54; 20+/day: OR 6.11, 95% CI 3.59 to 10.42).

The aim of this study is to clarify the differences in menstruation-related symptoms before and during menstruation in university students living alone and university students living with their family in Japan. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey to assess menstruation-related symptoms before and during menstruation using the menstrual distress questionnaire (MDQ). Among 135 students; the proportion of students living alone was 60.7% and the proportion of students living with their family was 39.3%. Before menstruation; the MDQ total score and the scores for negative affect and behavior change were significantly higher in students living alone than in students living with their family. During menstruation; scores for negative affect and impaired concentration were also significantly higher in students living alone.

Since the course of these infections is unpredictable with potential fast deterioration into respiratory failure, infants are easily admitted to the hospital for observation. The aim of this study was to examine whether systemic inflammatory markers can be used to predict severity of disease in children with respiratory viral infections. METHODS: Blood and nasopharyngeal washings from children <3 years of age with viral LRTI attending a hospital were collected within 24 hours (acute) and after 4C6 weeks (recovery). Patients were assigned to a mild (observation only), moderate (supplemental oxygen and/or nasogastric feeding) or severe (mechanical ventilation) group. Linear regression analysis was used to design a prediction rule using plasma levels of C reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum amyloid P component and properdin. This rule was tested in a validation cohort. RESULTS: One hundred and four children (52% male) were included. A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was a better indicator of severe disease compared with any of the individual makers and age (69% sensitivity (95% CI 50 to 83), 90% specificity (95% CI 80 to 96)). Validation in 141 patients resulted in 71% sensitivity (95% CI 53 to 85), 87% specificity (95% CI 79 to 92), negative predictive value of 64% (95% CI 47 to 78) and positive predictive value of 90% (95% CI 82 to 95). The prediction rule was not able to identify patients with a mild course of disease. CONCLUSION: A combination of CRP, SAA, PTX3 and properdin was able to identify children with a severe course of viral LRTI disease, even in children under 2 months of age. To assess the true impact on clinical management, these results should be validated in a prospective randomised control study.","output":"Prospective observational study in two Dutch hospitals to assess the performance of inflammatory plasma markers to determine disease severity of viral respiratory tract infections in children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic resulted in many countries implementing restrictions on group gatherings and educational events, creating imperatives for educators to move curricula online with short notice.

Many patients with COVID-19 develop a hypercoagulable state that has been associated with an increased risk of death. Current treatment guidelines do not support the use for or against empiric anticoagulation. We present a case of a 57-year-old Caucasian male with COVID-19 who was started on full-dose anticoagulation empirically based on an elevated D-Dimer level and was later found to have bilateral pulmonary emboli with right heart strain and pulmonary infarction. Patient had a medical history significant for diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and presented to the hospital on 4/18/20 with fever, fatigue, myalgias, weakness, productive cough, shortness of breath, non-bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, after testing positive for COVID-19 outpatient on 4/1/20. His O2 saturation was 72% on pulse oximetry. He had no prior pulmonary history. In the ED, chest x-ray demonstrated no abnormality (image 1) and D-dimer was 5325 ng/mL. In light of significantly elevated D-dimer, the patient was started empirically on systemic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin drip. Due to low pre-test probability and trying to limit further exposure to COVID-19, doppler ultrasound of bilateral lower extremities was chosen to rule out VTE. It was negative. Patient clinically improved over the next day and was subsequently transferred out of the ICU. Prior to discharge the patient underwent CTA to rule out PE on 4/21/20. Results demonstrated acute bilateral pulmonary emboli, including large saddle embolism left main pulmonary artery distally, with right heart strain and pulmonary infarction. Since the patient was hemodynamically stable, no systemic or catheter-based thrombolysis was indicated. Patient was started on a DOAC and discharged on 4/23/20 with oxygen only at night. Although the exact etiology of VTE associated with COVID-19 remains unclear, the available data has shown it to cause a prothrombotic state. Studies have shown the risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU to be around 2.5-5 times higher than the general ICU population. Our case serves to highlight the need for heightened vigilance for VTE as well as question the utility of common risk stratification tools such as the Well's score in COVID-19. Further studies are needed to identify when and how to anticoagulate patients with COVID-19 in addition to validating risk stratification tools that may aid clinicians in these situations.","output":"A case of submassive pulmonary embolism in covid-19 patient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In comparison with the major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) of typical mammals, the chicken MHC is simple and compact with a single dominantly expressed class I molecule that can determine the immune response.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions and death rates associated with coronary events in a Brazilian large-scale private health system. Methods From March 18 - Sep 30, 2020 we evaluated the administrative database of UNIMED-BH, a cooperative Brazilian private insurance, with over 1.25 million clients from a large urban center. We collected data from admissions in all owned and accredited hospitals related to urgent and elective coronary events (acute coronary syndromes, coronary interventions, clinical management of coronary artery disease and invasive diagnostic procedures). Admissions in 2020 were compared to the 2-year historical series (2018, 2019), and rates/100,000 were calculated considering the mean covered population. Outcomes were assessed until October 15th, 15 days after the last enrollment. Results In the 196-day period, the number of coronary admissions in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were, respectively, 2,789, 3,519 and 2,348, and patients had a median age of 67 [58-76] years, being 59% men. The mean length of hospital stay was 6.79.3 days, and 27% had &gt;1 admission in 3 years. The adjusted rates of admissions were 221, 278 and 184/100,000 clients, resulting in a significant 26% (95% CI 22 - 30) reduction in 2020 compared to the historical series (p&lt;0.001). The reduction was more pronounced from March to May (36%) - when social isolation started - compared to the peak of the pandemic (June to September, 19%). In-hospital mortality was also significantly higher in 2020 (5.4%, 95% CI 4.5 - 6.4) compared to 2018/2019 (3.6%, 95% CI 3.2 - 4.1), p&lt;0.001, despite the similar age (67 [57-76) vs. 67 [58-76], p=0.15) and length of hospital stay (6.98.9 vs. 6.79.5 days, p=0.43). Conclusion There was a significant decrease in admissions due to coronary events during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, in parallel with increased in-hospital mortality.

However, meta-analyses show unclear results leading to uncertainty regarding the safety of PPI use during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted a nationwide observational study including all SARS-CoV-2 cases (n=83,224) in Denmark as of December 1, 2020. The association of current PPI use with risk of infection was examined in a case-control design. We investigated the risk of severe outcomes, including mechanical ventilation, ICU admission or death, in current PPI users (n=4,473) compared to never users. Propensity score matching was applied to control for confounding. Finally, we performed an updated meta-analysis on risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 mortality attributable to PPI use. Results Current PPI use was associated with increased risk of infection; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.08 (95% CI 1.03-1.13). Among SARS-CoV-2 cases, PPI use was associated with increased risk of hospital admission; adjusted relative risk (RR) 1.13 (1.03-1.24), but not with other severe outcomes. The updated meta-analysis showed no association between PPI use and risk of infection or mortality; pooled OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.75-1.32) and RR 1.33 (95% CI 0.71-2.48). Conclusion Current PPI use may be associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospital admission, but these results with minimally elevated estimates are most likely subject to residual confounding.

Despite the importance of respiratory system neuroplasticity, and its dependence on estrogen in males, little is known about pLTF expression or mechanisms of estrogen signaling in females. Here, we tested the hypotheses that (1) pLTF expression in young, gonadally intact female rats would be expressed during estrous cycle stages in which 17-estradiol (E2) is naturally high (e.g., proestrus vs estrus), (2) pLTF would be absent in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and in physiological conditions in which serum progesterone, but not E2, is elevated (e.g., lactating rats, 3-10 d postpartum), and (3) acute E2 administration would be sufficient to restore pLTF in OVX rats. Recordings of phrenic nerve activity in female Sprague Dawley rats (3-4 months) revealed a direct correlation between serum E2 levels and pLTF expression in cycling female rats. pLTF was abolished with OVX, but was re-established by acute E2 replacement (3 h, intraperitoneal). To identify underlying E2 signaling mechanisms, we intrathecally applied BSA-conjugated E2 over the spinal phrenic motor nucleus and found that pLTF expression was restored within 15 min, suggesting nongenomic E2 effects at membrane estrogen receptors. These data are the first to investigate the role of ovarian E2 in young cycling females, and to identify a role for nongenomic estrogen signaling in any form of respiratory system neuroplasticity.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia induces phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF), a form of spinal respiratory motor plasticity that improves breathing in models of spinal cord injury. Although pathways leading to pLTF are well studied in males and estradiol (E2) is known to be required, it has seldom been investigated in females, and underlying mechanisms of E2 signaling are unknown in either sex. We found that while ovariectomy abolished pLTF, it could be restored by acute systemic E2, or by intraspinal application of the membrane-impermeable E2 (BSA-conjugated E2; 15 min). The ability of nongenomic estrogen signaling within the cervical spinal cord to recover respiratory neuroplasticity in disorders of respiratory insufficiency suggests that membrane estrogen receptors may represent novel therapeutic targets to restore breathing in both sexes.","output":"Nongenomic Actions of 17- Estradiol Restore Respiratory Neuroplasticity in Young Ovariectomized Female Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The declared aim of personalized, stratified or precision approaches is to place individual variation, as ascertained through genomic and various other biomarkers, at the heart of Scientific Medicine using it to predict risk of disease or response to therapy and to tailor interventions and target therapies so as to maximize benefit and minimize risk for individual patients and efficiency for the health care system overall.

Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate the RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, molecular docking was employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.","output":"Small Molecule Therapeutics to Destabilize the ACE2-RBD Complex: a Molecular Dynamics Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Trail Making test (TMT) is a widely used neuropsychological test to assess the cognitive function of patients.

Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe and complex obesity resulting in significant and sustained weight loss. In Sweden, most bariatric surgery patients are referred by primary care physicians. We aimed to explore barriers for physicians to refer patients with severe and complex obesity for bariatric surgery. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was in 2019 emailed to 1100 primary care physicians in the Sk?ne and Kronoberg regions in south Sweden. The survey focused on referral patterns, knowledge and attitudes towards bariatric surgery and concerns about postoperative complications. We created different statistical indices for referral patterns, knowledge, attitudes and concerns about bariatric surgery. To analyze the correlation between these indices, we did Spearmans correlations and regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 1100 email respondents, we received 157 (14%) completed surveys. Among 157 physician respondents, 73% answered that they had good knowledge about the referral criteria for bariatric surgery, whereas 55 and 60% answered correctly to two items on criteria for bariatric surgery. A majority of respondents (84%) stated that their patients initiated referral to bariatric surgery. Half of the respondents had concerns about postoperative medical and surgical complications, but another half had a positive attitude to bariatric surgery as a treatment for obesity comorbidities. Almost half of the respondents (44%) answered that they needed to learn more about bariatric surgery. We found significant positive correlations between high knowledge and referral patterns (r = 0.292, p < 0.001) and positive attitudes (r = 0.235, p < 0.001) respectively. We found significant reverse correlations between concerns and referral patterns (r = ? 0.355, p < 0.001) and between positive attitudes and concerns (r = ? 0.294, p < 0.001). In logistic regression high levels of concerns explained low willingness to refer for bariatric surgery (Odds Ratio 0.2, 95% confidence interval 0.1C0.7). CONCLUSION: According to this Swedish survey among primary care physicians, high levels of concerns about bariatric surgery among physicians seemed to be a barrier to refer patients with severe and complex obesity for bariatric surgery. Since high knowledge about obesity and bariatric surgery correlated negatively to concerns and positively to favorable attitudes to bariatric surgery, more knowledge about obesity and bariatric surgery is warranted.

Background Influenza acquired in pregnancy can have serious sequalae for both mother and fetus. Recent studies have demonstrated that influenza vaccine in pregnancy is both safe and effective. Despite this, evidence suggests that vaccine uptake in pregnancy is suboptimal in both Australia and worldwide. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the role of midwives in the promotion and provision of antenatal influenza vaccine and, to provide a statistical and thematic description of the barriers and enablers midwives encounter. Methods This mixed method study incorporated a cross sectional on-line survey and in-depth interviews conducted with midwives, employed in urban and regional South Australia. Findings Quantitative data were available for 137 midwives and 10 midwives participated in the interviews. Recruitment for the interview phase was through the last question on the survey. Whilst all midwives indicated that education and vaccine promotion were part of their role, immunization knowledge varied between Registered Nurse/Midwives (RM/RN) 80% and Registered Midwives (RM) 48.90% (p=0.001). Quantitative data showed that only 43% of midwives felt sufficiently educated to provide the vaccine. Midwives who had received formal immunization training were more likely to recommend the vaccine 93.7% (p =0.001). Qualitative data confirmed these results and identified the lack of immunization education as a barrier to practise. Conclusion Midwives identified an immunization knowledge deficit. Midwives who had received immunization education were more likely to actively promote and provide the vaccine to pregnant women. These findings indicate the need for more immunization education of midwives in both tertiary and practice settings.","output":"An exploration of midwives role in the promotion and provision of antenatal influenza immunization: A Mixed Methods Inquiry."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To compare psychological outcomes, experiences and sources of stress over the COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand in essential workers (healthcare and other essential workers) with that of workers in nonessential work roles. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Conducted in New Zealand over level 4 lockdown in April/May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Findings from employed participants (2495) are included in this report; 381 healthcare workers, 649 other essential workers and 1465 nonessential workers. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10)), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7)), well-being (WHO-5), alcohol use, subjective experiences and sources of stress. Differences between work categories were quantified as risk ratios or (2) tests. RESULTS: After controlling for confounders that differed between groups of essential and nonessential workers, those in healthcare and those in other essential work were at 71% (95% CI 1.29 to 2.27) and 59% (95% CI 1.25 to 2.02) greater risk respectively, of moderate levels of anxiety (GAD-7 10), than those in nonessential work. Those in healthcare were at 19% (95% CI 1.02 to 1.39) greater risk of poor well-being (WHO-5 <13). There was no evidence of differences across work roles in risk for psychological distress (K10 12) or increased alcohol use. Healthcare and other essential workers reported increased workload (p<0.001) and less uncertainty about finances and employment than those in nonessential work (p<0.001). Healthcare and nonessential workers reported decreased social contact. No difference by work category in health concerns was reported; 15% had concerns about participants own health and 33% about other peoples health. CONCLUSIONS: During the pandemic lockdown, essential workers (those in healthcare and those providing other essential work) were at increased risk of anxiety compared with those in nonessential work, with those in healthcare also being at increased risk of poor well-being.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that mast cells can drive corticosteroid insensitivity in airway smooth muscle cells, a key player in asthma pathogenesis. Conditioned media from resting or Fc?R1-activated human lung mast cells were incubated with serum-deprived ASM cells (1:4 dilution, 24 h) to determine their impact on the anti-inflammatory action of fluticasone on ASM cell chemokine expression induced by TNF (10 ng/ml). Conditioned media from Fc?R1-activated mast cells (but not that from non-activated mast cells or control media) significantly reduced the ability of 100 nM fluticasone to suppress ASM TNF-dependent CCL5 and CXCL10 production at both mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, fluticasone inhibition of CXCL-8 production by TNF was still preserved in the presence of activated mast cell conditioned media. Transcriptomic analysis validated by individual qPCR assays revealed that activated mast cell conditioned media dramatically reduced the number of anti-inflammatory genes induced by fluticasone in ASM cells. Our study demonstrates for the first time that conditioned media from Fc?R1-activated mast cells blunt the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids in ASM cells by altering their transactivation properties. Because infiltration of mast cells within the ASM bundles is a defining feature of asthma, mast cell-derived mediators may contribute to the glucocorticoid insensitivity present in severe asthma.","output":"Human Lung Mast Cells Impair Corticosteroid Responsiveness in Human Airway Smooth Muscle Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The third outbreak of coronavirus (CoV) infection (after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) caused by a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) of the genus Beta-coronavirus has become a global pandemic. CoVs are enveloped viruses whose proteins include spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) which are embedded in the viral envelope. The glycosylated S protein, which forms homo-trimeric spikes on the surface of the viral particle, mediates viral entry into host cells. SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, uses the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) cell surface protein for cellular entry. An attractive anti-viral approach is targeting virus entry into cells, for which three strategies are suggested: 1) direct targeting of the viral glycoprotein; 2) targeting the viral receptor on the cell surface; and 3) using soluble (s) ACE2 that binds to S protein thereby neutralizing the virus. In this article, the advantages and disadvantages of these strategies are explained. Moreover, we propose that fusion of the sACE2 to anti-CD16 to produce a bi-specic molecule could be a promising anti-viral strategy.","output":"An immunotherapeutic method for COVID-19 patients: a soluble ACE2-Anti-CD16 VHH to block SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we consider the problem of making distributionally robust, skeptical inferences for the multi-label problem, or more generally for Boolean vectors.

DESIGN Prospective cohort study METHODS: Ninety-one eyes of 91 patients with narrow angles were consecutively enrolled in this prospective interventional study. All patients were classified into primary angle-closure suspect (PACS), primary angle-closure (PAC) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). If both eyes were eligible, one eye was randomly selected for study inclusion. ACV, ACD and ACA were evaluated using Scheimpflug imaging technology at three time points: at baseline (T0), 45 min after application of pilocarpine before LPI (T1) and at one-month post-LPI (T2). RESULTS PACS, PAC and PACG groups included 25 (27.4%), 24 (26.3%) and 42 (46.1%) eyes, respectively. At both time points T1 and T2, mean pupil diameter, ACV and ACA changed significantly (P = 0.00). In all subgroups, ACD decreased significantly at T1 and then increased significantly at T2. ACA was widened by 6 degrees in angles < 26 degrees as compared to 3 degrees in > 26 degrees eyes. In PACG group, mean ACV increased significantly between T0 and T2 (P = 0.0). Other parameters like mean cornea volume (P = 0.27), central corneal thickness (P = 0.29) showed no significant change between time points (T0, T1 and T2).

METHOD: We modelled the deaths using spatiotemporal architectures and Poisson probability distributions using a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. RESULTS: Both total deaths and confirmed deaths showed similar spatial patterns. Mortality was higher in men and increased with age. The most critical period regarding mortality occurred between the 20th and 23rd epidemiological weeks, followed by an apparent stabilisation of the epidemiological trend. The risk of death was greater in areas with the worst social conditions during the study period. However, this pattern was not uniform over time, since we identified a shift of high risk from the areas with the best socio-economic conditions to those with the worst conditions.

Infection and inflammatory processes such as those caused by COVID-19 produce a disequilibrium in the NO bioavailability and/or a delay in the interactions of NO with other molecules contributing to the onset and evolution of cardiocerebrovascular diseases. A link between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and NO is introduced. Recent experimental observations of intracellular transport of metabolites in the brain and the NO trapping inside endothelial microparticles (EMPs) suggest the possibility of anomalous diffusion of NO, which may be enhanced by disease processes. A novel space-fractional reaction-diffusion equation to model NO biotransport in the brain is further proposed. The model incorporates the production of NO by synthesis in neurons and by mechanotransduction in the endothelial cells, and the loss of NO due to its reaction with superoxide and interaction with hemoglobin. The anomalous diffusion is modeled using a generalized Ficks law that involves spatial fractional order derivatives.

To examine the spread of SARS-CoV-2, we combined both Reverse transcription-PCR testing and serology in children in the most affected region in France, Paris, during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: From 14 April 2020 to 12 May 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, prospective, multicentre study. Healthy controls and pauci-symptomatic children from birth to age 15 years were enrolled by 27 ambulatory paediatricians. A nasopharyngeal swab was taken for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Reverse transcription-PCR and a microsample of blood for micromethod serology. RESULTS: Among the 605 children, 322 (53.2%) were asymptomatic and 283 (46.8%) were symptomatic. Reverse transcription-PCR and serology results were positive for 11 (1.8%) and 65 (10.7%) children, respectively, with no significant difference between asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic children. Only three children were Reverse transcription-PCR-positive without any antibody response detected. The frequency of Reverse transcription-PCR SARS-CoV-2 positivity was significantly higher for children with positive than negative serology results (12.3% vs 0.6%, p<0.001).

Remarkably, while the group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses all have M proteins with N-linked sugars, the M proteins of the group 2 coronaviruses [e.g., mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)] are O-glycosylated. The conservation of the N- and O-glycosylation motifs suggests that each of these types of carbohydrate modifications is beneficial to their respective virus. Since glycosylation of the M protein is not required for virus assembly, the oligosaccharides are likely to be involved in the virusChost interaction. In order to investigate the role of the M protein glycosylation in the host, two genetically modified MHVs were generated by using targeted RNA recombination. The recombinant viruses carried M proteins that were either N-glycosylated or not glycosylated at all, and these were compared with the parental, O-glycosylated, virus. The M protein glycosylation state did not influence the tissue culture growth characteristics of the recombinant viruses. However, it affected their interferogenic capacity as measured using fixed, virus-infected cells. Viruses containing M proteins with N-linked sugars induced type I interferons to higher levels than viruses carrying M proteins with O-linked sugars. MHV with unglycosylated M proteins appeared to be a poor interferon inducer. In mice, the recombinant viruses differed in their ability to replicate in the liver, but not in the brain, whereas their in vivo interferogenic capacity did not appear to be affected by their glycosylation status. Strikingly, their abilities to replicate in the liver correlated with their in vitro interferogenic capacity. This apparent correlation might be explained by the functioning of lectins, such as the mannose receptor, which are abundantly expressed in the liver but also play a role in the induction of interferon- by dendritic cells.","output":"The glycosylation status of the murine hepatitis coronavirus M protein affects the interferogenic capacity of the virus in vitro and its ability to replicate in the liver but not the brain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent Coronavirus COVID-19 is a very infectious disease that is transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales So, people must wear a face mask to reduce the power of the transition of this virus Governments around the world have imposed the use of face masks in public spaces and supermarkets In this paper, we propose to build a face mask detection system based on a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the YOLO object detection framework to implement it on an embedded low power device The object detection framework was designed using a single Convolutional Neural Network for object detection in real-time To make the YOLO framework suitable for embedded implementation, we propose to build a lightweight Convolutional Neural Network and quantize it by using a single bit for weight and 2 bits for activations The proposed network called Pynq-YOLO-Net was implemented on the Pynq Z1 platform The computation was divided between the software and the hardware The features extraction part was executed on the hardware device and the output part was executed on the software This configuration has allowed reaching real-time processing with a very good detection accuracy of 97% when tested on the combination of collected datasets","output":"Pynq-YOLO-Net: An Embedded Quantized Convolutional Neural Network for Face Mask Detection in COVID-19 Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pre-existing gender-based disparities in academia may have worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Being cited as an expert source in newspaper articles about COVID-19 may increase an individuals research or leadership profile. In addition, visibility in a newspaper article is an important component of representation in academia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether women were underrepresented as COVID-19 expert sources in print newspapers in the USA. DESIGN: We undertook a cross-sectional study of English-language newspaper articles that addressed the COVID-19 pandemic and that were published in the top 10 most widely read newspapers in the USA between April 1 and April 15, 2020. MAIN MEASURES: We extracted the names of all people cited as expert sources and categorized the gender of each expert source based on pronoun usage within the article or on a business, university, or organization website. The professional role of each expert was assigned based on their description in the article. KEY RESULTS: Of 2297 expert sources identified, 35.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 33.9C37.8%; n = 824) were women and 63.7% were men (95% CI 61.8C65.7%; n = 1464). This result was similar when considering unique experts in each newspaper and for all included newspapers; of the 1738 unique experts per newspaper, 34.6% were women (95% CI 32.3C36.8%; n = 601), and of the 1593 unique experts in all newspapers, 36.5% were women (95% CI 34.1C38.9%; n = 581). Of articles with multiple experts referenced (n = 374), 102 cited only men experts (27.3%) and 44 cited only women experts (11.8%). Women were underrepresented as experts as Healthcare Workers and Professionals, Non-STEM Experts, Public Health Leaders, and STEM Scientists. There were no differences in the proportion of women experts between newspapers or between different regions of the USA.

While disgust-motivated avoidance occurs in bonobos and chimpanzees, humans show uniquely high levels of contamination sensitivity. Current theory postulates that human disgust is primarily a genetic adaptation, side-lining social transmission and denying parental modelling. Here, we test whether this strong view is warranted by simulating 100000 years of cultural and biological evolution in various scenarios. We modelled disgust as a trait that governed the extent to which individuals forewent potentially contaminated nutrition. This lowered their risk of gastrointestinal illness, at the cost of increasing starvation risk and birth-interval. As environmental levels and costs of contamination rose, so did relative fitness of high-disgust individuals. Evolutionary shifts in disgust as polygenic trait occurred as a consequence of germ-cell mutations, but were most prominent in populations with high initial genetic variance. Crucially, cultural transmission between generations operated at a higher rate, even if parental modelling was eliminated. This study serves not only as evidence of cultural evolution shaping the behavioural immune system, but also as an illustration of emerging theories that paint affective and cognitive mechanisms as socially transmitted rather than biologically determined functions.","output":"The human behavioural immune system is a product of cultural evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare the differences between the no tympanomeatal flap approach and the tympanomeatal flap approach in endoscopic myringoplasty.

A growing number of studies have explored the association between pregnancy complications, pregnancy outcomes, and stroke. Limited studies, however, have investigated links involving infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth, which could plausibly be associated via a background of endocrine conditions, endothelial dysfunction, and chronic systematic inflammation. This review aims to summarize current evidence and provide up-to-date information on the associations of infertility, miscarriage, and stillbirth, with stroke incidence. METHODS A comprehensive literature search was conducted for cohort and case-control studies on associations between infertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, and stroke up to September 26, 2020. Seven databases were searched: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINIHL, PsyclNFO, Wanfang, and CNKI. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS Sixteen cohort studies and 2 case-control studies enrolling 7 808 521 women were included in this meta-analysis. Women who had experienced miscarriage or stillbirth were at higher risk of stroke (miscarriage: HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.00-1.14]; stillbirth: HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.11-1.71]) than other women. The HRs of stroke for each additional miscarriage and stillbirth were 1.13 (95% CI, 0.96-1.33) and 1.25 (95% CI, 1.06-1.49), respectively. In subgroup analysis, increased risk of stroke was associated with repeated miscarriages and stillbirths (miscarriage 3: HR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.05-1.90]; stillbirth 2: HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.26]). Associations between infertility and stroke were inconsistent and inconclusive (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87-1.32]).

NSP9 of SARS-CoV2 encodes for a replicase enzyme which is essential for the virus replication in the host cell. In search of potent inhibitors, we have screened FDA approved drugs against NSP9 using in silico methods. Five drugs fluspirilene, troglitazone, alvesco, dihydroergotoxine and avodart were found to have highest affinities with the replicase. The molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) studies demonstrated strong drugs binding and stable NSP9-drugs complexes formation. The findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, radius of gyration, and hydrogen bond analysis of the complexes. Principal component analysis showed the stable conformation of NSP9 upon drug binding.

The influence of the pandemic on the burden of disease of trauma care remains to be elucidated. METHODS: All patients with traumatic injuries that were presented to the emergency departments (ED) of the Amsterdam University Medical Center, Location Academic Medical Center (AMC) and VU medical center (VUMC) and the Northwest Clinics (NWC) between March 10, 2019 and May 10, 2019 (non-COVID) and March 10, 2020 and May 10, 2020 (COVID-19 period) were included. The primary outcome was the difference in ED admissions for trauma patients between the non-COVID and COVID-19 study period. Additionally, patient- and injury characteristics, health care consumption, and 30-day mortality were evaluated. RESULTS: A 37% reduction of ED admissions for trauma patients was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic (non-COVID n = 2423 and COVID cohort n = 1531). Hospital admission was reduced by 1.6 trauma patients per day. Fewer patients sustained car- and sports-related injuries. Injuries after high energetic trauma were more severe in the COVID-19 period (Injury Severity Score 17.3 vs. 12.0, p = 0.006).

In this pilot study, we investigated the effects of low-intensity tFUS on blood-brain barrier opening, the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglu), and cognition in patients with AD. METHODS: After receiving institutional review board approval, four patients with AD received tFUS to the hippocampus immediately after an intravenous injection of a microbubble ultrasound contrast agent. Sonication was delivered at low-intensity, at a pressure level below the threshold for blood-brain barrier opening. Patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography, and neuropsychological assessments before and after the tFUS procedure. A whole-brain voxel-wise paired t test was conducted to compare rCMRglu before and after tFUS. RESULTS: The sonication, as anticipated, did not show evidence of active blood-brain barrier opening on T1 dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. rCMRglu in the superior frontal gyrus (P<0.001), middle cingulate gyrus (P<0.001), and fusiform gyrus increased after tFUS (P=0.001).

The nano catalyst obtained is characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transition electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunaueur Emmett Teller (BET) analysis, UVCVis diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS-UVCVis) etc. The mesoporosity of the particle was examined using Barrett Joyner Halenda (BJH) model. The enhanced photo catalytic efficiency (about 97.7%) of templated nano titania due to calcination is verified against Congo red, a textile dye under optimized conditions. The nano catalyst produced can be easily separated, recycled to support its economic feasibility.","output":"Effect of calcination temperature on the properties and applications of bio extract mediated titania nano particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The aim of the article is to determine the differences in the attitude towards the risk of running one's own business between women and men. The authors tried to find an answer to the question of how the observations and experiences of the pandemic affect the attitudes of young women towards entrepreneurship. Design/Methodology/Approach: The theoretical part uses a critical analysis of the literature on the subject. In the empirical part, the method of online surveys was applied using a tool in the form of a Google form created by the authors of the article, conducted among 170 students at a non-public university with an economic profile in Pozna. Findings: The results of empirical research proved that a relatively large group of respondents, as many as 48.8%, was interested in running their own business. Among women, such plans were taken by 44.9% of respondents, and among men by 55.6%. Women slightly more often answered that they did not plan to run their own business or did not know what their plans were in this matter. The chi-square NW test, however, did not show any significant correlation between the respondents' gender and planning to set up one's own enterprise (p> 0.05). Moreover, although men assessed the risk of running their own business slightly lower, the Mann-Whitney U test did not show a significant difference in the level of opinions on the perception of the risk of running a business between women and men (p> 0.05). It is important that as many as 60.9% of respondents said that the pandemic did not affect their plans to start their own business. The Mann-Whitney U test showed no significant difference in the level of opinion on the impact of the pandemic on the change in the perception of running one's own business between women and men (p> 0.05). Practical Implications: The results of the research show that it is worth strengthening the proactive, entrepreneurial attitudes of young women to overcome the negative effects of the pandemic thanks to the development of the SME sector. Originality/Value: Contemporary socio-economic changes necessitate the search for new solutions that will contribute to building a stronger and entrepreneurial society.","output":"The Risk of Undertaking Business Activity from the Perspective of Women in the Context of Covid-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are recognized as causal agents in a wide range of human diseases. However, researchers lack sufficient data on the exact HAdV species and serotypes associated with adult acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). To detect and characterize HAdV infections in adults in China, clinical specimens were collected from 10,310 adults with ARTIs from May 2005 to July 2010. The partial HAdV hexon gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. HAdVs were detected in 86 samples (0.8%), of which 67 (77.9%) were species B (HAdV-3, -7, -11, and -14), 7 (8.1%) were species C (HAdV-1, -2, and -6), and 12 (14%) were species E (HAdV-4). HAdV-3 was the most frequently detected serotype (41/86, 47.7%), followed by HAdV-7 (13/86, 15.1%), HAdV-4 (12/86, 14.0%), and HAdV-11 (11/86, 12.8%). Patients 14C25 years old (60.5%) exhibited a higher rate of adenovirus detection than older patients.

Most of the previous researches focused on analyzing the similarities and differences of the thoughts of Confucianism and Legalism, and few of them analyzed their motivational tendencies. This paper conducted a word frequency analysis of pre-Qin Confucian and Legalist classics with CC-LIWC, an independently developed program for classical text analysis, and made comparative research into the motivational tendencies of the two schools of thought in terms of psycholinguistic differentials. According to our research results, the use of words representing power (M = 0.1377, SD = 0.0104, p = 0.014) and reward (M = 0.0151, SD = 0.0042, p = 0.037) is more frequent in Legalist classics than in Confucian classics, whereas the use of words representing affiliation (p = 0.066), risk (p = 0.086), and achieve (p = 0.27) shows no significant difference between Confucian and Legalist classics. This paper believes that both Confucianism and Legalism are mainly motivated by power, which is the most distinct feature of their motivational tendencies, and that Legalism is more motivated by power and reward than Confucianism; both Confucianism and Legalism are outcomes of the monarchy society with the former showing the reserved side of monarchy and the latter showing the uninhibited side of monarchy; an effective political methodology is absent in Confucianism, while utilitarianism constitutes the cornerstone of the political philosophy of Legalism.","output":"Motivational Tendency Differences Between the Pre-qin Confucianism and Legalism by Psycholinguistic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this brief report is to review an assessment paradigm for conducting virtual neuropsychological pre-surgical evaluations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The neuropsychologists explored evidence-based methods of virtual evaluation and developed a systematic decision-making process for youth requiring a Phase II evaluation. We propose models of assessment which prioritize teleneuropsychology when possible to reduce the risk of infection: (1) evaluation with directly administered tests through a completely virtual format;(2) virtual/in-person hybrid evaluation;and (3) clinical observation/interview in a virtual format supplemented by survey data. These models are illustrated by three cases. Using virtual assessment models, the team was able to meet the urgent patient care needs and collect useful data while minimizing the risk of virus spread.

Virtual and simulator-based learning is not widely available in LMIC. It is imperative to analyze feedback of CV fellow-in-training regarding this mode of learning before large scale implementation. METHODOLOGY: This was an observational study conducted between JulyCAugust 2020. A multicentered survey was conducted. Survey questionnaire was disseminated to FIT (fellow-in-training) via Google Forms. The questionnaire contained a total of 24 questions about virtual and simulator-based learning during the pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 68 FIT responded to the survey. The mean age was 29.9 years. There were 37% females and 63% males. Majority (75%) agreed that it was easier for them to reach for online sessions than physical sessions. 60% FIT were confident in asking questions or giving comments during the online sessions. 57.4% FIT felt it easier to go through cardiovascular imaging/illustrations via online platforms. 50% (34) were confident that if online sessions had to continue, they would have enough academic learning before they graduated from the program and 54.4% (37) wanted online sessions to continue even beyond the pandemic days. 37.5% (18 out of 48) agreed that the simulator-based teaching was helping them practice skills in times of less clinical exposure. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted cardiovascular FIT learning curve because of less hands-on and lack of physical teaching sessions. LMIC have lack of robust e-learning platforms. Virtual learning is convenient for academic learning with growing acceptance amongst fellows.

COVID-19 Symptoms: Bleeding ? thrombosis Medication:  Clinical Procedure: Thoracentesis ? video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) Specialty: Hematology ? Infectious Diseases OBJECTIVE: Unknown ethiology ? Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 in the United States. It has been associated with high mortality and morbidity all over the world. COVID-19 can cause a significant inflammatory response leading to coagulopathy and this hypercoagulable state has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in these patients. The published data regarding the presence of lupus anticoagulant in critically ill COVID-19-positive patients is limited and indicates varying conclusions so far. CASE REPORT: Here, we present a case of a 31-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia, complicated with superadded bacterial empyema and required video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with decortication. This patient also had prolonged prothrombin time on preoperative labs, which was not corrected with mixing study. Further workup detected positive lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin IgM along with alteration in other coagulation factor levels. The patient was treated with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K before surgical intervention. He had an uneventful surgical course. He received prophylactic-dose low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and did not experience any thrombotic events while hospitalized. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection creates a prothrombotic state in affected patients. The formation of micro-thrombotic emboli results in significantly increased mortality and morbidity. Routine anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin can prevent thrombotic events and thus can improve patient outcomes. In patients with elevated prothrombin time, lupus anticoagulant/anti-cardiolipin antibody-positivity should be suspected, and anticoagulation prophylaxis should be continued perioperatively for better outcomes.","output":"A 31-Year-Old Man with COVID-19-Associated Empyema and Lupus Anticoagulant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on detecting Tuberculosis (TB) findings on chest radiographs (or Chest X-rays: CXR) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has demonstrated superior performance due to the emergence of publicly available, large-scale datasets with expert annotations and availability of scalable computational resources. However, these studies use only the frontal CXR projections, i.e., the posterior-anterior (PA), and the anterior-posterior (AP) views for analysis and decision-making. Lateral CXRs which are heretofore not studied help detect clinically suspected pulmonary TB, particularly in children. Further, Vision Transformers (ViTs) with built-in self-attention mechanisms have recently emerged as a viable alternative to the traditional CNNs. Although ViTs demonstrated notable performance in several medical image analysis tasks, potential limitations exist in terms of performance and computational efficiency, between the CNN and ViT models, necessitating a comprehensive analysis to select appropriate models for the problem under study. This study aims to detect TB-consistent findings in lateral CXRs by constructing an ensemble of the CNN and ViT models. Several models are trained on lateral CXR data extracted from two large public collections to transfer modality-specific knowledge and fine-tune them for detecting findings consistent with TB. We observed that the weighted averaging ensemble of the predictions of CNN and ViT models using the optimal weights computed with the Sequential Least-Squares Quadratic Programming method delivered significantly superior performance (MCC: 0.8136, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.7394, 0.8878, p < 0.05) compared to the individual models and other ensembles.

The study cohort was divided into two groups: Group A consisted of patients who received RT in the first 6 months and Group B comprised patients who received RT in the second 6 months. RESULTS The age distribution was similar in both groups. The analysis of the intent of treatment showed that 585 (55%) patients were treated with a radical intent in Group A, whereas only 478 (45%) were treated with a radical intent in Group B.

Cells were cultured at different temperatures and membrane changes involving the Golgi apparatus and Golgi apparatus-associated membrane structures were monitored by electron microscopy and quantitated. With 30 min of incubation, membranes of the Golgi apparatus stack increased in amount at temperatures of 16C and below compared to temperatures above 18C. The increase was greatest along the major polarity axis as evidenced by an increased stack height. Neither the number of cisternae per stack nor the average stack diameter (width) was affected by temperature. The response was maximal between 15 and 30 min of low temperature treatment of the cells. Results with cells infected and uninfected with feline immunodeficiency virus were similar. The increase in stack height was due primarily to an increase of membranes at the cis face (cis Golgi apparatus network). At 18C, membranes of the trans Golgi apparatus network accumulated suggesting that import from the cis Golgi network could proceed at this temperature, whereas exit from the trans Golgi network was still at least partially blocked. Also increased at 16C and below were numbers of transition vesicles in the space between the Golgi apparatus and the transitional endoplasmic reticulum associated with the cis Golgi apparatus face. The results suggested interruption of the orderly flux of membranes into the Golgi apparatus at 16C and below. Moreover, the block appeared to be reversible.

As we transfer into the COVID-19 recovery phase, it is important to maximise the value of the health impact but also the social, economic and environmental impact of PHIs. Exploration is required to understand how the social value and impact of PHIs is, or can be, captured and measured. Existing research has illustrated the potential link between Health Impact Assessment (HIA) which assesses health and well-being through the lens of the determinants of health, and economic methods such as Social Return on Investment (SROI). This research aims to understand the current role which PHIs have, in order to strengthen advocacy for investment in public health and prevention in order to protect and improve population health. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: A scoping survey was designed and distributed digitally to national and regional PHIs via international networks. Semi-structured interviews were also used to add a qualitative value to the research to allow for triangulation of results. The survey data was analysed descriptively and interview data analysed thematically and coded. RESULTS: The results of the research present an understanding of the meaning of investment, social value and health impact within PHIs including how it is measured using SROI and HIA. It also highlights whether PHIs have considered how capturing social value and health impact can contribute to the recovery from COVID-19, and whether they believe that SROI and HIA have a role in achieving this. LESSONS: This innovative work aims to develop a picture of how PHIs are capturing and measuring the wider social, economic and environmental value of their programmes and services. Survey results will be used to help develop a framework for capturing the wider impact and value of public health at an international level, with an aim to achieving sustainable investment in future public health.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the medical activities initiated and difficulties in implementing quarantine on a cruise ship. METHODS: Reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 were performed for all 3711 people (2666 passengers and 1045 crew) on board. RESULTS: Of those tested, 696 (18.8%) tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of which 410 (58.9%) were asymptomatic. We also confirmed that 54% of the asymptomatic patients with a positive RT-PCR result had lung opacities on chest computed tomography. There were many difficulties in implementing quarantine, such as creating a dividing traffic line between infectious and noninfectious passengers, finding hospitals and transportation providers willing to accept these patients, transporting individuals, language barriers, and supporting daily life. As of March 8, 2020, 31 patients (4.5% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) were hospitalized and required ventilator support or intensive care, and 7 patients (1.0% of patients with positive RT-PCR results) had died.

In particular, we have chosen one representative form of epilepsy for each one of its actual known etiologies. A better understanding of the mechanistic link between neuroinflammation and epilepsy would be important to improve subject-based therapies, both for prophylaxis and for the treatment of epilepsy.","output":"Neuroinflammation: A Signature or a Cause of Epilepsy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact caused by the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in different parts of the world, currently reaches 745, 308 infected and 35,307 deaths according to the latest reports.

The objectives of this short communication were 1) to assess the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs in seven provinces in Afghanistan before the COVID-19 pandemic, and 2) to elucidate the relevance of these patterns with the number of reported HCW infections from COVID-19 in the mentioned provinces. METHODS: We analyzed secondary data from the 2018-19 Afghanistan Service Provision Assessment survey, which included 142 public and private HCFs in seven major provinces in Afghanistan. Data on COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Afghanistan Ministry of Public Health Data Warehouse. Weighted prevalence of WASH services and standard precautions were calculated using frequencies and percentages. ArcGIS maps were used to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases, and scatter plots were created to visualize the relevance of WASH services and standard precautions to COVID-19 cases in provinces. RESULTS: Of the 142 facilities surveyed, about 97% had improved water sources, and over 94% had improved toilet for clients. Overall, HCFs had limited availability of hygiene services and standard precautions, which was lower in private than public facilities. More than half of the facilities had safe final disposal and appropriate storage of sharps and medical waste. Of the seven provinces, Herat province had the highest cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population and reported lower availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs compared to other provinces. CONCLUSION: Our findings show disparities in the availability of WASH services and standard precautions in public and private facilities. Private facilities had a lower availability of hygiene services and standard precautions than public facilities. Provinces with higher availability of WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs had a lower cumulative COVID-19 case rate among HCWs per 100,000 population. Pre-pandemic preparation of adequate WASH services and standard precautions in HCFs could be potentially important in combating infectious disease emergence.

Although the benefits of feedback between theoretical and empirical research are widely acknowledged by ecologists, this link is still not as strong as it could be in ecological research. This is in part because theory, particularly when expressed mathematically, can feel inaccessible to empiricists who may have little formal training in advanced math. To address this persistent barrier, we provide a general and accessible guide that covers the basic, step-by-step process of how to approach, understand, and use ecological theory in empirical work. We first give an overview of how and why mathematical theory is created, then outline four specific ways to use both mathematical and verbal theory to motivate empirical work, and finally present a practical tool kit for reading and understanding the mathematical aspects of ecological theory. We hope that empowering empiricists to embrace theory in their work will help move the field closer to a full integration of theoretical and empirical research.","output":"An Empiricist's Guide to Using Ecological Theory."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food waste negatively impacts the three dimensions of sustainability. Environmentally and financially, it represents a waste of natural resources and increases the cost respectively. Socially, it represents an ethical issue as about 800 million people are suffering from hunger worldwide. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explore if and how resilience contributes to food waste reduction in fruits and vegetables distribution in the Brazilian market. Multiple case studies were conducted in the supplier-retailer dyad of four retail chains. Results have shown that resilience plays the role of both enabler and barrier to food waste reduction. On the positive side, collaboration, communication, flexibility, innovation, knowledge management, leadership, security technologies and supply chain design contributed to food waste reduction;especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the negative side, financial health and redundancy increased the level of food waste. Additionally, it was observed that flexibility can reduce or increase food waste. Our findings have implications for academics and practitioners as the developed framework summarizes the role of resilience to food waste reduction. As a social impact, the implementation of food waste reduction initiatives by non-governmental organizations and retailer associations can result in increased communication, knowledge diffusion, and training about how to build resilience and improve food waste reduction practices among different agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that explores the relationship among elements of resilience and food waste.

Existing female-specific literature highlights breast asymmetry and cosmetic reconstruction. We sought to evaluate gender differences in cardiopulmonary function. METHODS: Cardiac MRIs, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and cardiopulmonary exercise tests (CPETs) were reviewed in 345 patients undergoing preoperative evaluation for PE. Regression modeling was used to evaluate associations between gender and clinical endpoints of cardiopulmonary function. RESULTS: Mean age was 15.2 years, 19% were female, 98% were white. Pectus indices included median Haller Index (HI) of 4.8, mean depression index (DI) of 0.63, correction index (CI) of 33.6%, and Cardiac Compression Index (CCI) of 2.79.

Mutant viruses are incapable of inducing XC cell syncytium formation and are 100-fold less efficient than wild-type viruses at rendering cells resistant to superinfection. Envelope glycoproteins bearing the lysine mutation are found in reduced amounts on the surface of infected cells, and as a result mutant virions contain significantly less envelope protein than do wild-type virions.

We took an unbiased approach to studying IAV-nucleolar interactions by using stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in conjunction with LC-MS/MS to quantify changes in the nucleolar proteome following infection with A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Udorn/72 (H3N2) strains of the virus. Only a minority of nucleolar proteins showed significant changes in abundance after infection; these alterations were mostly different between the two strains but could be validated by confocal microscopy of infected cells. Many of the affected proteins comprised functional groupings, including components of ribonuclease P, RNA polymerase I, the MLL1 histone methyltransferase complex, as well as nuclear paraspeckles and the RNA editing apparatus.

METHODS: A total of 82 735 confirmed cases released officially by the Chinese authorities from December 8, 2019 to April 18, 2020 were collected. The estimated diagnosis dates of deaths and cured cases were calculated based on the median cure time or median death time of individual cases.

Genetically the three variant IBV strains, designated CA557/03, CA706/03, and CA1737/04, were not related to each other. GenBank BLAST database search and phylogenetic analysis of the hypervariable region of the S1 subunit of the spike gene to determine the most closely related viruses to the three variants showed the CA557/03 variant to be 81.8% similar to the CAV/CA56b/91 whereas the CA706/03 and CA1737/04 variant viruses were only distantly related to Dutch/D1466/81 (72.2%), a vaccine strain used in Europe, and Korea/K142/02 (72.7%), a Korean field isolate, respectively. Cross virus-neutralization testing showed that none of the 2003-04 California IBV variant viruses were serologically related to each other or to Ark, Conn, or Mass vaccine strains. In addition the CA1737/04 isolate was also tested against DE072 and found not to be serologically related.

We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial to clarify the efficacy of the originally developed local infusion analgesia technique in total knee arthroplasty. METHODS Forty patients were randomly allocated to the local infusion analgesia or control group. Patients in the local infusion analgesia group received intermittent bolus intra-articular injection of analgesics consisting of ropivacaine, dexamethasone, and isepamicin until postoperative 48 h. Primary outcome was pain severity at rest using 100-mm visual analogue scale. RESULTS Pain severity in patients of the local infusion analgesia group was lower than control group, and there were significant differences between groups at POD1 (p = 0.025) and POD3 (p = 0.007). Reduction of postoperative pain was associated with a decrease in C-reactive protein level and earlier achievement of straight leg raise.

We here investigated the magnitude, kinetics and protective efficacy of the multi-faceted humoral immunity induced by vaccination in healthy adult volunteers with a Matrix M adjuvanted virosomal H5N1 vaccine. Vaccinees were given escalating doses of adjuvanted vaccine (1.5g, 7.5g, or 30g), or a non-adjuvanted vaccine (30g). An evaluation of sera from vaccinees against pseudotyped viruses covering all (sub)clades isolated from human H5N1 infections demonstrated that the adjuvanted vaccines (7.5g and 30g) could elicit rapid and robust increases of broadly cross-neutralizing antibodies against all clades. In addition, the adjuvanted vaccines also induced multifaceted antibody responses including hemagglutinin stalk domain specific, neuraminidase inhibiting, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity inducing antibodies. The lower adjuvanted dose (1.5g) showed delayed kinetics, whilst the non-adjuvanted vaccine induced overall lower levels of antibody responses. Importantly, we demonstrate that human sera post vaccination with the adjuvanted (30g) vaccine provided full protection against a lethal homologous virus challenge in mice.

Parents were willing to pay US$228-$291 for a vaccine for themselves and US$243-US$321 for their children. A positive impact on WTP was found with self-reported parent health status but not children. The findings of this study have important implications for policy programs which require detailed cost-benefit analyses. WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine is crucial to determine the partial benefits of vaccinating to reduce the risk of repetitive widespread outbreaks.","output":"Parents' willingness to pay for a COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hydration of aromatic molecules is a fundamental chemical process. Herein, microhydration framework of the prototypical neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), naphthalene (naphthalene-(water)n3), is investigated by infrared spectroscopy inside helium nanodroplets. The measured data are analyzed by quantum chemical calculations at the MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. This combined experimental and theoretical approach demonstrates that water binds to the naphthalene ring via  hydrogen bond (H-bond) for n = 1 case. Further addition of the solvent molecules occurs via the formation of a H-bonded water network facilitated by the nonadditive cooperative force. No isomers are observed in which the solvent molecules separately bind to the aromatic ring. For n = 3 case, we observe the formation of a cyclic H-bonded water moiety. Comparison with corresponding cationic and anionic naphthalene-(water)n clusters demonstrates the charge-induced modification of the hydration motif. Our results are further compared with the prototypical benzene-(water)n complexes to comprehend the effect of an additional phenyl ring on the solvation network.","output":"Unravelling the microhydration frameworks of prototype PAH by infrared spectroscopy: naphthalene-(water)1-3."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads worldwide, reports about the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 are excessively increasing. However, there is still insufficient high-throughput data on neuronal cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 to help predict its neural pathogenesis. HCoV-OC43 is another member of the beta coronavirus family that has confirmed neuro-invasive effects and has available neural omics data. This study predicts the critical genes, biological processes, and pathways mediating in SARS-CoV-2 neurological manifestations using a systems biology approach. Method: We retrieved raw data related to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-OC43 infections from gene expression omnibus datasets (GSE147507 and GSE13879 respectively). We constructed gene regulatory networks for both infections, detected significant regulatory motifs by FANMOD software, and created their subnetworks. We also constructed PPI networks and identified the MCODE clusters. In the intersection of merged subnetworks of two viruses, the most critical genes were verified in GRN & PPI networks. We drug-repurposed for the selected target genes and performed the functional enrichment analysis using DAVID and String databases. Results: : Some of the top KEGG pathway results included NF-kappa B, Toll-like receptor, NOD-like receptor, MAPK, and Neurotrophin signaling pathways. The most essential identified genes included IL6, TNF, HOXA5, POU2F2, ITGB3, STAT1, YY1, E2F6, ESR1, FOXO3, FOXO1, MEF2A, ATF3, ATF4, DDIT3, TCF4, BCL2L2, and BMP4. These genes were also involved in mechanisms of other viral infections of the nervous system. This study repurposes nine medicines with effects on COVID-19 neurological complications. Some of the repurposed drugs were previously registered in clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment. Conclusion: We recommended some identified crucial genes and medications to investigate further their potential role in treating COVID-19 neurological complications.","output":"Deciphering The Molecular Pathogenesis Behind Neurological Manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 And Drug Repurposing, A Systems Biology Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing effective mental health care in Emergency Departments (ED) is a fundamental expectation, as EDs increasingly become the first point of contact with health services for people in mental distress.

Social bots are involved in various cybercrimes like cyberbullying and rumor dissemination, which have seriously affected the normal order of OSNs. Nowadays, existing studies in this field almost focus on English OSNs like Twitter and Facebook. However, it is difficult to directly apply these detection technologies to Sina Weibo, which is one of the largest Chinese microblogging services in the world. In addition, social bots are evolving rapidly and time-consuming feature engineering may not perform well in detecting newly emerging social bots. In this paper, we propose a new joint approach with Temporal and Profile information for social bot detection (TPBot). The approach includes data collection module, feature extraction module, and detection module. To begin with, data collection module uses a web crawler to obtain user data from Sina Weibo. Next, the feature extraction module regards the user posts as temporal data to extract temporal-semantic and temporal-metadata features. Furthermore, this module extracts features based on users profile. Finally, a detection model based on BiGRU and attention mechanism is designed in the detection module. The results show that TPBot performs better than baselines with the F1-score of 0.9837 on the Sina Weibo dataset. Moreover, we have also conducted an experiment on the two datasets collected from Twitter to evaluate the generalization ability of TPBot. It is found that TPBot outperforms baselines on the new datasets and has good generalization ability.","output":"A New Joint Approach with Temporal and Profile Information for Social Bot Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Background and Objectives: Stigma around COVID-19 is a major barrier in global efforts to control the COVID 19 pandemic Limited data is available regarding stigma faced by COVID-19 patients in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) The aim of the current study was to explore the stigma experienced by hospitalized patients with COVID-19 illness in Lahore, Pakistan Methods: Following Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent, patients were assessed using modified HIV short form stigma scale and open-ended questions Questions focused on experiences, feelings, and opinions as to how patients feel and how they were treated prior to and during the hospitalization Data analysis for quantitative data was performed using SPSS-20, while qualitative responses were interpreted by content analysis method Results: One hundred and fourteen patients were interviewed (Mean age 38 8 years + 15 3) with 53 5% being males Widespread experience of stigma was reported by patients particularly for concerns about public attitudes (7 43 + 1 43) and disclosure (6 89 + 1 45) Main themes which emerged from the qualitative responses were social stigma and rejection, humiliating behaviour of others, breach of confidentiality, loss of trust/respect, and impact of COVID-19 diagnosis on their business Conclusions: Existence of significant stigma among COVID-19 patients isolated in a tertiary care hospital in a LMIC highlights the need for culturally sensitive strategies to address it","output":"Scarlett Letter: A study based on experience of stigma by COVID-19 patients in quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aerobic exercise improves executive functionwhich tends to decline with ageand dual-task training with aerobic exercise improves the global cognitive function.

From the perspective of transaction cost theory, the deficiencies of the mechanism primarily reflect three types of transaction costs: agency cost, bargaining cost, and administrative cost, all of which can be economized via the digitalization of international tax dispute resolution (ITDR) processes. The impetus for the development of digital ITDR becomes more prominent considering the current Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, compared with dispute resolution mechanisms in many other domains, the ITDR process particularly lends itself to digital facilitation. However, data from peer review reports under Action 14 of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Project shows that the international practice of the digital ITDR still remains at a rudimentary stage. This underdevelopment can largely be attributed to a decentralized approach to the ITDR development at the international level. In this regard, it is proposed that the OECD can play a greater role in leading and coordinating the development of digital ITDR at the global level.

RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of thrombotic disease in individuals affected by COVID-19 is reported as high as 31%. A significant mortality benefit has been observed with the use of therapeutic anticoagulation in high-risk individuals. Literature supports the use of scoring systems, such as the sepsis-induced coagulopathy score, to risk-stratify individuals who might benefit from anticoagulation. SUMMARY: COVID-19-induced hypercoagulability has been demonstrated to play a significant role in overall COVID-19 outcomes.

Live streaming broadcasts events in real-time, with very different characteristics compared to video-on-demand (VoD), being more sensitive to variations in delay, jitter, and packet loss. The use of adaptive streaming techniques over HTTP is massively deployed on the Internet, adapting the video quality to instantaneous condition of the network. Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) is the most popular adaptive streaming technology. In DASH, the client probes the network quality and adjusts the quality of requested video segment according to the bandwidth fluctuations. Therefore, DASH is an over-the-top application using unmanaged networks to distribute content in the best possible quality. In order to maintain a seamless playback, VoD applications commonly use a large reception buffer. However, in live streaming, the use of large buffers is not allowed because of the induced delay. Active Queue Management (AQM) arises as an alternative to control the congestion in routers queue, pressing the traffic sources to reduce their transmission rate when it detects incipient congestion. In this article, we evaluate the performance of recent AQM strategies for real-time adaptive video streaming. Furthermore, we propose a new AQM algorithm to improve the user-perceived video quality. The results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than competing AQM algorithms and improves the video quality in terms of average peak signal-to-noise ratio while keeping the fairness among concurrent flows.","output":"Application of active queue management for real-time adaptive video streaming"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) across the country has been widely discussed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that PPE shortages persist amidst continually increasing caseloads nationwide. Additionally, there have been reports of poor-fitting masks, a problem which is magnified by shortages. The lack of adequate access to conventional N95 masks pushed for some to pursue 3D printing and locally distributing their own manufactured masks as substitutes when PPE, including N95 masks, were not readily available. The design presented, the snorkel mask adapter, is one such design born from the local maker community in partnership with local physicians and hospitals. This article discusses the design, manufacturing, and validation of the snorkel mask adapter and its immediate use in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future use as stopgap PPE. Methods The design presented is an adapter which can be used with a commercially available snorkel mask in order to serve as a full face respirator in either the case of a PPE shortage or more pertinently for those who are unable to pass fit testing with the available N95 respirators at their respective facilities. Mask components were 3D printed, assembled, and then fit tested by qualitative fit testing (QLFT) at The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) in Kansas City, KS as a proof of concept. Results At TUKHS, the mask was fit tested on 22 individuals who required an N95 mask but were not able to pass qualitative fit testing with the masks available to them at the time. Of the 22 tested, all 22 of them were able to pass QLFT with the snorkel mask, adapter, and viral/bacterial filter combination. Conclusion The results of the fit testing at TUKHS is promising for this N95 alternative. More extensive testing can and should be done, including quantitative fit testing. Persistently increasing caseloads and PPE shortages necessitates an urgent dissemination of these preliminary results. The authors do not advocate for this design as a replacement of traditional N95 masks or other PPE but do endorse this design as a stopgap measure, proven to be effective in situations of dire PPE shortage or for individuals who have failed fit testing with conventional PPE.","output":"3D Printed Snorkel Mask Adapter for Failed N95 Fit Tests and PPE Shortages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent growth in publicly available sequence data has introduced new opportunities for studying microbial evolution and spread. Because the pace of sequence accumulation tends to exceed the pace of experimental studies of protein function and the roles of individual amino acids, statistical tools to identify meaningful patterns in protein diversity are essential.

To meet this need, a novel computational method is introduced that is easily executed in parallel using a cluster environment and can handle thousands of sequences with minimal subjective input from the user. The usefulness of this kind of machine learning is demonstrated by applying it to nearly 5000 haemagglutinin sequences of influenza A/H3N2.Antigenic and 3D structural mapping of the results show that the method can recover the major jumps in antigenic phenotype that occurred between 1968 and 2013 and identify specific amino acids associated with these changes.

This study aimed to examine impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on change of influenza vaccination acceptance and identify factors associated with acceptance of potential COVID-19 vaccination. METHOD: A cross-sectional self-administered anonymous questionnaire survey was conducted among nurses in Hong Kong, China during 26 February and 31 March 2020. Their previous acceptance of influenza vaccination and intentions to accept influenza and COVID-19 vaccination were collected. Their relationship with work-related and other factors were examined using multiple multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Responses from 806 participants were retrieved. More nurses changed from vaccination refusal to hesitancy or acceptance than those changed from acceptance to vaccination hesitancy or refusal (15.5% vs 6.8% among all participants, P < 0.001). 40.0% participants intended to accept COVID-19 vaccination, and those in private sector (OR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.11-2.51), with chronic conditions (OR: 1.83, 95%CI: 1.22-2.77), encountering with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients (OR: 1.63, 95%CI: 1.14-2.33), accepted influenza vaccination in 2019 (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.47-2.81) had higher intentions to accept it. Reasons for refusal and hesitation for COVID-19 vaccination included \\"suspicion on efficacy, effectiveness and safety\\", \\"believing it unnecessary\\", and \\"no time to take it\\". CONCLUSION: With a low level of COVID-19 acceptance intentions and high proportion of hesitation in both influenza and COVID-19 vaccination, evidence-based planning are needed to improve the uptake of both vaccinations in advance of their implementation. Future studies are needed to explore reasons of change of influenza vaccination acceptance, look for actual behaviour patterns of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance and examine effectiveness of promotion strategies.","output":"Intention of nurses to accept coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination and change of intention to accept seasonal influenza vaccination during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Many breast cancer patients are vulnerable to poor nutritional status and may benefit from nutrition education, but existing materials are not generally tailored to the needs of low-literacy immigrant and minority patients.

This is because a recurrent neural network can deal with the order dependence of the data to a certain extent and the one-dimensional convolution can extract local features. Although these methods have good performance in sentiment analysis tasks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) cannot be parallelized, resulting in time-inefficiency, and the standard 1D-CNN can only extract a single sample feature, with the result that the feature information cannot be fully utilized. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multichannel two-dimensional convolutional neural network based on interactive features and group strategy (MCNN-IFGS) for Chinese sentiment analysis. Firstly, we no longer use word encoding technology but use character-based integer encoding to retain more fine-grained information. Besides, in character-level vectors, the interactive features of different elements are introduced to improve the dimensionality of feature vectors and supplement semantic information so that the input matches the model network. In order to ensure that more sentiment features are learned, group strategies are used to form several feature mapping groups, so the learning object is converted from the traditional single sample to the learning of the feature mapping group, so as to achieve the purpose of learning more features. Finally, multichannel two-dimensional convolutional neural networks with different sizes of convolution kernels are used to extract sentiment features of different scales. The experimental results on the Chinese dataset show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline and state-of-the-art methods.","output":"Multichannel Two-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Based on Interactive Features and Group Strategy for Chinese Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To determine the incidence of acute cardiac injury (ACI), the factors associated with ACI and the in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe patients.

Univariate and Firth logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with ACI and in-hospital mortality, and Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate cumulative in-hospital mortality. Among 1031 patients included, 215 (20.7%) had ACI and 501 (48.6%) were severe cases. Overall, 165 patients died; all were from the severe group, and 131 (79.39%) had ACI.

The rapid global spread of this novel virus led the World Health Organization declare a pandemic with > 30,000,000 confirmed cases, 946,000 deaths and > 21,000,000 recoveries reported as of 18 September 2020, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Initial reports from Asia suggested that elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, specifically diabetes, hypertension, and obesity were at an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. As data on these risks have evolved, evidence has increasingly shown that patients with cancer are indeed a particularly vulnerable group. However, the effects of various confounding factors, including an older than average patient population who often have underlying comorbidities including a suppressed immune system and/ or a hypercoagulable state, have been difficult to separate from the effects of having cancer. Common presenting symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 including dyspnoea, cough, fever, fatigue, dysgeusia and, less commonly, diarrhoea and/ or a hyperinflammatory syndrome are equally confusing to clinicians as they all are common symptoms of both cancer and toxicity from anti-cancer therapy. Furthermore, the radiographic dilemma of distinguishing between immune-checkpoint inhibitor-induced pneumonitis from that caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection and conflicting data on the effects of certain therapies on patient outcomes has left clinicians with considerable angst on how to help patients with acute or worsening symptoms in an optimal way. Predicted increase in mortality follows not only from the delay in discovery and progress resulting from temporary closing of research laboratories at cancer centers but also from diversion of resources to patient care and temporary suspension of clinical trial enrolment both by companies and local institutions. The possibilities of travelling to specialized medical centers whose activities are essential for the delivery and improvement of patient care were reduced, too. Viral mutations might also occur during transmission and spread; this leads to a statement that SARS-CoV-2 will forever remain a looming threat to the oncological community. What is crucial to remember is that cancer itself is a pandemic with > 18,000,000 people dia-gnosed worldwide every year. Many societies, including the European Society for Medical Oncology and the American Society of Clinical Oncology, are providing clinical recommendations for the management of patients with cancer during this challenging time, recognizing that continuation in the precise treatment of our patients is critical for our role of physicians. PURPOSE: The aim of the presentation is to point out the contact or overlapping areas of both mentioned disease entities for the purpose of possible simplification of dia-gnostic and therapeutic management of a cancer patient with suspected or already proven COVID-19 disease.","output":"COVID-19 and oncological disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is one of the leading causes of death due to foodborne illness, affecting the elderly, pregnant women, neonates and the immune compromised. Serologically, Lm can be classified into 13 serotypes, though only four are typically linked with food contamination and illness. Since 2000, a shift in serotypes involved in listeriosis outbreaks was observed, suggesting that tracking of serotypes could help identify emerging trends. A PCR method developed in 2004 allowed detection of the four major serotypes as molecular serogroups, corresponding to broad phylogenetic groups. In this study, a novel qPCR method was developed that uses two multiplex qPCRs, one to confirm the Listeria genus and Lm species, and the second for Lm molecular serogrouping. This method was compared with the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) method for Lm and the sero-agglutination method, using a 208-strain panel. Comparison of the genus/species qPCR assay with the BAM methods found an equal or slightly higher accuracy for the qPCR method (>98%), as compared to the BAM protocol (>96%), when evaluated against independent characterization data. Molecular serogrouping using the qPCR method (96.6%) was more accurate than the sero-agglutination assay (75.6%). The qPCR method identified Lm 4bV strains, which could not be resolved using sero-agglutination. The qPCR could not identify lineages III and IV serotype 4b strains but did correctly identify 16 of 18 lineage III/IV strains. The qPCR method performed genus identification for Lm, L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. ivanovii, and L. seeligeri. Additionally, the method performed species identification for Lm, and serogrouped Lm into six molecular serogroups, 2A, 2B, 2C, 4B, NT, and 4bV. This method provided a rapid and accurate confirmation of Lm and serogroup determinations; furthermore, it could help identify otherwise unlinked strains by enabling WGS analysis based on broad phylogeny, independent of other information.","output":"Development and validation of a qPCR method for species verification and serogroup determination of Listeria monocytogenes isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of August 30, 2020, Brazil ranked second among countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, with the city of S?o Paulo as the national epidemic epicenter.

OBJECTIVE The purpose of our scoping review is to describe what is known about the quality of primary care for adults with ASD and identify knowledge gaps. METHODS Prior to beginning the literature search, we reviewed literature related to defining both primary care and primary care quality to establish the context and concept of the research question. The search strategy was designed and executed by a research librarian. The MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases were searched for relevant literature. Grey literature will include relevant reports from government websites and associations with a focus on ASD. Two members of the research team will independently screen the academic and grey literature. Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods study designs involving the quality of primary care services or patient-centered care for adults with ASD are eligible for inclusion in our scoping review. Studies that make it past the full-text review will undergo data extraction and quality appraisal by 2 independent reviewers. The data extraction results will be presented in a tabular format to clearly present what is known about the quality of primary care for adults with ASD; this table will be accompanied by a narrative synthesis.

During the COVID-19 surge (April - June 2020) with centralization of paediatric surgical care and risks from anaesthetics to both patients and staff a NOM pathway was used to manage clinically diagnosed appendicitis in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC). Methods Prospective data collection was undertaken of all children (<16 years) diagnosed with appendicitis who entered the NOM pathway in RBHSC from 01/04/2020 to 30/06/2020. This was compared to a cohort from the same timeframe in 2019. Primary end-points were inpatient success rate of NOM and 30-day success rate of NOM (success defined as no appendectomy performed). Results 47 patients completed the NOM pathway, with 43% (20/47) suspected to have complicated appendicitis. The cohort was similar to that of 2019 in terms of age (p=0.1) and sex (p=0.8), but was 155% larger (42 v. 20).For those with simple appendicitis, there was a 96% (26/27) success rate of NOM on discharge, with a 93% (25/27) 30-day success rate. For complicated appendicitis, there was a 40% (8/20) success rate on discharge, with a 30% (6/20) 30-day success rate. Conclusion The use of a NOM pathway for paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in Northern Ireland was safe and effective for staff and patients. With a small sample size and restricted follow up more evidence is required to prove if this is an effective treatment modality with a return to normal theatre availability. In the interests of antibiotic stewardship we would not advocate NOM pathways utilisation by non-surgical clinicians.","output":"A surge in appendicitis: Management of paediatric appendicitis during the COVID-19 surge in the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elizabethkingia spp. is a ubiquitous pathogenic bacterium that has been identified as the causal agent for a variety of conditions such as meningitis, pneumonia, necrotizing fasciitis, endophthalmitis, and sepsis and is emerging as a global threat including in Southeast Asia. Elizabethkingia infections tend to be associated with high mortality rates (18.2C41%) and are mostly observed in neonates and immunocompromised patients. Difficulties in precisely identifying Elizabethkingia at the species level by traditional methods have hampered our understanding of this genus in human infections. In Southeast Asian countries, hospital outbreaks have usually been ascribed to E. meningoseptica, whereas in Singapore, E. anophelis was reported as the main Elizabethkingia spp. associated with hospital settings. Misidentification of Elizabethkingia spp. could, however, underestimate the number of cases attributed to the bacterium, as precise identification requires tools such as MALDI-TOF MS, and particularly whole-genome sequencing, which are not available in most hospital laboratories. Elizabethkingia spp. has an unusual antibiotic resistance pattern for a Gram-negative bacterium with a limited number of horizontal gene transfers, which suggests an intrinsic origin for its multidrug resistance. Efforts to prevent and further understand Elizabethkingia spp. infections and limit its spread must rise to this new challenge.","output":"Epidemiology and Characteristics of Elizabethkingia spp. Infections in Southeast Asia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Learning skills are fundamental 21st century skills that enable people to thrive in an increasingly uncertain future.

Despite an increase in clinical instances of Pseudomonas infection, there is currently no effective vaccine or treatment available. The major membrane protein candidate of the P. aeruginosa bacterial cell is known to be a critical component for cellular bacterial susceptibility to antimicrobial peptides and survival inside the host organisms. Therefore, the current computational study aims to examine P. aeruginosas major membrane protein, OprF, and OprI, in order to design linear B-cell, cytotoxic T-cell, and helper T-cell peptide-based vaccine constructs. Utilizing various immune-informatics tools and databases, a total of two B-cells and twelve T-cells peptides were predicted. The final vaccine design was simulated to generate a high-quality three-dimensional structure, which included epitopes, adjuvant, and linkers. The vaccine was shown to be nonallergenic, antigenic, soluble, and had the best biophysical properties. The vaccine and Toll-like receptor 4 have a strong and stable interaction, according to protein-protein docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, in silico cloning was employed to see how the developed vaccine expressed in the pET28a (+) vector. Ultimately, an immune simulation was performed to see the vaccine efficacy. In conclusion, the newly developed vaccine appears to be a promising option for a vaccine against P. aeruginosa infection.

METHODS: We linked population based surveillance of acute respiratory illness hospitalizations to national administrative data, to estimate seasonal RSV hospitalization rates among adults aged 18-80 years with certain pre-existing CMCs: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Age and ethnicity adjusted rates stratified by age group were estimated. RESULTS: Among 883,999 adult residents aged 18-80 years, 281 RSV positive hospitalizations were detected during 2012-2015 winter seasons. Across all ages, RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with COPD, asthma, CHF, and CAD compared to those without each corresponding condition. RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with ESRD aged 50-64 years and adults with DM aged 65-80 years compared to adults in each age group without these conditions. No increased risk was seen for adults with CVA. The CMC with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization was CHF (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range: 4.6-36.5 across age strata) and COPD (IRR range: 9.6-9.7). Among RSV positive adults, CHF and COPD were independently associated with increased length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with specific CMCs are at increased risk of RSV hospitalizations.

METHODS We evaluated 6075 students concerning their agreement with the government's restrictions, as well as their health anxiety, trait positive and negative affect, and current symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. We performed MANOVAs, ANOVAs, path analysis, and binary logistic regressions. RESULTS We found some differences in compliance with government restrictions concerning gender, geographic location, and major of study. Psychological variables did not play a significant role in predicting compliance with restriction measures and making a call for medical help. However, health anxiety predicted higher levels of worries about having contracted the virus.

In Canada, Quebec had the highest COVID-19 burden and its earlier March school break, taking place two weeks before those in other provinces, could have shaped early transmission dynamics. METHODS: We combined a semi-mechanistic model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with detailed surveillance data from Quebec and Ontario (initially accounting for 85% of Canadian cases) to explore the impact of case importation and timing of control measures on cumulative hospitalizations. RESULTS: A total of 1544 and 1150 cases among returning travelers were laboratory-confirmed in Quebec and Ontario, respectively (symptoms onset &#8804;03-25-2020). Hospitalizations could have been reduced by 55% (95% CrI: 51%-59%) if no cases had been imported after Quebec's March break. However, if Quebec had experienced Ontario's number of introductions, hospitalizations would have only been reduced by 12% (95% CrI: 8%-16%). Early public health measures mitigated the epidemic spread as a one-week delay could have resulted in twice as many hospitalizations (95% CrI: 1.7-2.1). CONCLUSION: Beyond introductions, factors such as public health preparedness, responses and capacity could play a role in explaining interprovincial differences. In a context where regions are considering lifting travel restrictions, coordinated strategies and proactive measures are to be considered.","output":"The role of case importation in explaining differences in early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Canada-A mathematical modeling study of surveillance data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract State Machine (ASM) theory is a well-known state-based formal method to analyze, verify, and specify software and hardware systems. Nowadays, as in other state-based formal methods, the proposed specification languages for ASMs still lack easy-to-comprehend language constructs for type abstractions to describe reusable and maintainable specifications. Almost all built-in behaviors are implicitly defined inside a concrete ASM language implementation and thus, the behavior is hidden from the language user. In this paper, we present a new ASM syntax extension based on traits, which allows the specifier (language user) to define new type abstractions in the form of structure and behavior definitions to reuse, maintain, structure, and extend the functionality in ASM specifications. We describe the proposed language construct by defining its syntax and semantics. The decision to use a trait-based syntax extension over other object-oriented language constructs like interfaces or mixins was motivated and driven by the results of previously conducted empirical studies. Moreover, we outline details about the implementation of the trait-based syntax extension in our Corinthian Abstract State Machine (CASM) language implementation.","output":"Structuring the State and Behavior of ASMs: Introducing a Trait-Based Construct for Abstract State Machine Languages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study calculates and elucidates the minimum size of respiratory particles that are potential carriers of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); furthermore, it evaluates the aerosol generation potential of SARS-CoV-2.

Hence, the minimum size of a respiratory particle that can contain SARS-CoV-2 is calculated to be approximately 4.7 m. The minimum size of the particles can decrease due to the evaporation of water on the particle surfaces. There are limitations to this analysis: (a) assumption that the viruses are homogeneously distributed in respiratory fluid particles and (b) considering a gene copy as a single virion in unit conversions. However, the study shows that high viral loads can decrease the minimum size of respiratory particles containing SARS-CoV-2, thereby increasing the probability of aerosol generation of the viruses.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by [Formula: see text]), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy [Formula: see text] 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.","output":"Mathematical assessment of the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on curtailing the 2019 novel Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic resistance or susceptibility to infectious diseases has been largely associated with the avian major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.

Also, the presence of an ossified superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL) was identified. Results The ligament was partially ossified in 8 specimens (25.8%), fully ossified in 6 (19.35%), and not ossified in the remaining 17 (54.85%). The mean middle-transverse diameter of the SN was 9.06 mm (standard deviation [SD] = 3.45). The corresponding for type-I notches was 8.64 mm (SD = 3.34), 8.86 mm (SD = 3.12) was for type-II, and 14.5 mm (SD = 1.02) was for type III. Middle-transverse diameter was shorter when an ossified ligament was present (mean = 5.10 mm, SD = 0.88 mm), comparing with a partially ossified ligament (mean =7.67 mm, SD = 2.24 mm) and a nonossified one (mean = 11.12 mm, SD = 2.92 mm). No statistically significant evidence was found that the middle-transverse diameter depends on the number of the elements, passing below the STSL. Conclusion Our results suggest that SSN compression could be more likely to occur when both suprascapular vessels pass through the notch. Compression of the nerve may also occur when an ossified transverse scapular ligament is present, resulting to significant reduction of the notch's area.","output":"Morphometry and Contents of the Suprascapular Notch with Potential Clinical Implications:  Cadaveric Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Pilgrims returning from the Hajj can augment the international spread of viral respiratory infections In this study the prevalence of non-influenza viral infection in pilgrims returning from the Hajj was investigated Method(s): A cross-sectional study in which 120 pilgrims returning from the Hajj participated Nasal and throat swab specimens were obtained from patients hospitalized for respiratory complications and who tested negative for influenza viruses All samples were examined for adenovirus using nested-PCR, bocavirus using PCR, rhinovirus using nested-RT-PCR, and RSV, HCov-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HMPV using real-time PCR Result(s): Over 44 0% (n = 53) of participants showed viral-related symptoms Viruses detected were: adenovirus (n = 24, 20 0%);rhinovirus (n = 19, 15 8%);HCoV-OC43 (n = 3, 2 5%), detected for the first time in Iran;HCov-229E (n = 2, 1 6% and bocavirus (n = 1, 0 8%) RSV, HMPV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were not detected Co-infection was diagnosed in six participants (5 0%) Conclusion(s): The annual Hajj ritual lasts for at least five days and over three million people participate from around the world Because antivirals and vaccines are only available for influenza, to prevent other respiratory infections healthcare education during or prior to Hajj, including the importance of using alcohol-based hand scrubs, is recommended","output":"Detection of non-influenza related viral respiratory infections among returning hajj pilgrims, the Islamic Republic of Iran 2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contact tracing has widely been adopted to control the spread of Coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19).

STUDY DESIGN: Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. SETTINGS: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 m. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. RESULTS: The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols &#8804;3.30 m, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols &#8804;14.1 m. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols &#8804;14.1 m, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. CONCLUSION: Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","output":"Droplet and Aerosol Generation With Endonasal Surgery: Methods to Mitigate Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The meaning of vaccine diplomacy (VD) is defined as the use of vaccines to increase a country's diplomatic relations and influence over other nations. The golden era of vaccine science diplomacy started during the time of Cold War between the United States (US) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) with the development of a prototype of oral polio vaccine by the US Scientist Dr Albert Sabin working along with his Soviet counterparts. The foundation stone was already laid down by Edward Jenner when he shared his technique of the smallpox vaccine with other major countries to curb the spread of smallpox. Eventually, such a step led to the eradication of such a deadly disease. Only time has changed, not the tide. Even today, vaccines continue to remain as one of the important tools for achieving Millennium Developmental Goals (MDGs) and other targets in developing countries like India. During the wake of the Corona Virus Diseases-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, India's role in developing its vaccine science diplomacy has been a point of attraction. The phase-3 trial of Covaxin being developed by Bharat Biotech started in Lucknow and Gorakhpur in October 2020, and it is widely considered as the forerunner for the Indian vaccine market. As per the Union Health Ministry of India- The Union Government is working on at least five distinct ways, ranging from free vaccines to guaranteed supply, in which it can help its immediate neighbours and countries in West Asia, Africa and even Latin Americaofficials familiar with the plan said on conditions of anonymity. The idea is to leverage the country's standing as the world's vaccine factory to merge diplomatic ties. Historically, it is observed that by the development and introduction of newer vaccines from time to time, many dismaying hurdles to vaccine science diplomacy (VSD) arise from ongoing wars and political instability. The current scenario is that both VSD and VD are at crossroads, and there is a possibility of getting a good direction if we make a piggyback policy approach of vaccine diplomacy along with the foreign policy. The lessons learned from the past must be followed now and, in the future, to make a better world for all. We acknowledge that the COVID-19 episode has again highlighted the dire need for VSD, and we assume that not only COVID-19 but in future, emerging and re-emerging diseases will occur so we have to prepare ourselves for combatting those future emerging and re-emerging diseases.","output":"Role of vaccine science diplomacy in low-middle-income countries for eradicating the vaccine-preventable diseases: Targeting the LAST MILE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has been detrimental to small businesses like independent theaters that exist to engage with the public offline Independent theaters across the US have temporarily closed their doors and turned to various technologies to increase their virtual presence and (re)connect with their communities online We present an investigation into theaters' strategies of 1) attracting existing patrons, 2) encouraging commitment, and 3) fostering contribution in an unforeseen public health crisis where face-to-face interactions are no longer possible Our results suggest that emphasizing shared identity and relying on technologies to facilitate new forms of interactions that were not available offline are critical to the migration of offline community to online settings ? 2020 Owner/Author","output":"Engaging offline communities online Amid COVID-19: A case study of independent theaters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious acute respiratory disease, which caused by a novel coronavirus. The disease disrupts health systems and resulting in social, political, and economic crises. Health professionals are in front of this pandemic and always work in a high-risk environment. The best prevention for COVID-19 is avoiding exposure to the virus. Some studies reported health professional's practice of precautionary measures for COVID-19. Nevertheless, a few have identified factors affecting. As such, this study aimed to fill those research gaps in the study setting. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 428 health professionals involved from the public health facilities of the Gamo zone, southern Ethiopia. A simple random sampling method employed, and the data collected by the interviewer-administered Open Data Kit survey tool and observational checklist. The data analyzed in Stata version 15, and a binary logistic regression model used to identify factors. In this study, a statistically significant association declared at P< 0.05. RESULTS: In this study, 35.3% (95%CI: 30.7%, 39.8%) of health professionals' had a good practice on precautionary measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. Use hand sanitizer or wash hands continuously with soap and water (68.9%), cover nose and mouth with a tissue during sneezing or coughing (67.3%), and use facemask in crowds (56.8%) were the most common practice reported by study participants.

Among them, ORF8 is distinguished in being rapidly evolving, possessing a unique insert and a hypervariable position among SARS-CoV-2 genomes in its predicted ligand-binding groove. We also uncover many Ig proteins from several metazoan viruses which are distinct in sequence and structure but share an architecture comparable to that of CoV Ig domain proteins. Hence, we propose that deployment of Ig domain proteins is a widely-used strategy by viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 is a potential pathogenicity factor which evolves rapidly to counter the immune response and facilitate the transmission between hosts.","output":"Novel Immunoglobulin Domain Proteins Provide Insights into Evolution and Pathogenesis Mechanisms of SARS-Related Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The knowledge of scripts, common chains of events in stereotypical scenarios, is a valuable asset for task-oriented natural language understanding systems.

OBJECTIVE: To identify trends in incidence and presentation of pediatric new-onset T1D and T2D during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted. Demographics, anthropometrics, and initial laboratory results from patients ages 0 through 21 years who presented with new-onset diabetes to a pediatric tertiary care center were recorded. RESULTS: During the pandemic, incident cases of pediatric T1D increased from 31 in each of the prior 2 years to 46; an increase of 48%. Incident cases of pediatric T2D increased by 231% from 2019 to 2020. The number of incident cases of pediatric T2D increased significantly more than the number of incident cases of pediatric T1D (P = 0.009). Patients with T2D were more likely to present in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), though this was not statistically significant (P = 0.093). Severe DKA was higher compared with moderate DKA (P = 0.036) in incident cases of pediatric T2D. During the pandemic, for the first time, incident cases of T2D accounted for more than one-half of all newly diagnosed pediatric diabetes cases (53%). CONCLUSIONS: There were more incident pediatric T1D and T2D cases as well as an increase in DKA severity in T2D at presentation during the COVID-19 pandemic. More importantly, incident T2D cases were higher than the incident T1D during the pandemic.

Simplification of the method can increase diagnostic efficiency which can benefit patients and help in infection control, consequently saving time and lives. Aim: To evaluate the diagnostic value of four methods (that omit extraction step) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 against the traditional extraction method. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis for evaluating diagnostic accuracy of four methods for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR), conducted in the Department of Microbiology, SMS Medical College, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India, in October 2020. Ninety four SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive samples and 20 negative samples were taken for this study. Automated extraction system was used for Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) extraction and four different approaches were compared to the traditional extraction method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Results: The automated RNA extraction method was compared to the method of direct addition of samples with (Heat processed Direct Viral transport medium Sample (HDVS)) and without heating (Direct Viral transport medium Sample (DVS)), directs addition of diluted (1:5) sample with (Heat processed diluted VTM sample (HdVS)) and without heating (Diluted VTM sample (dVS)) as well as after addition of Proteinse K (PK) to the diluted samples that came either negative/invalid. Out of four methods, the HdVS method gave the best results, considering extraction with Perkin Elmer as standard, this method showed sensitivity of 96.74%, specificity of 100%.

Five millions of people had emigrated from Wuhan before the city lockdown, which potentially represent a source of virus spreaders. Case distribution and its correlation with population emigration from Wuhan in early epidemic are of great importance for early warning and prevention of future outbreak. METHODS: The officially reported cases of 2019-nCoV pneumonia were collected as of January 30, 2020. Time and location information of these cases were extracted analyzed with ArcGIS and WinBUGS. Population migration data of Wuhan City and Hubei province were extracted from Baidu Qianxi and analyzed for their correlation with case number. FINDINGS: The 2019-nCoV pneumonia cases were predominantly distributed in Hubei and other provinces of South China. Hot spot provinces included Sichuan and Yunnan provinces that are adjacent to Hubei. While Wuhan city has the highest number of cases, the time risk is relatively stable. Numbers of cases in some cities are relatively low, but the time risks are continuously rising. The case numbers of different provinces and cities of Hubei province were highly correlated with the emigrated populations from Wuhan. Lockdown of 19 cities of Hubei province, and implementation of nationwide control measures efficiently prevented the exponential growth of case number. INTERPRETATION: Population emigrated from Wuhan was the main infection source for other cities and provinces. Some cities with low case number but were in rapid increase.

The daily data are fed to a deep learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the accumulated number of COVID-19 cases in the next two weeks. A significant average correlation was achieved (r=0.83 (p = 0.005)) between the model predicted and actual accumulated cases in the interval from August 1, 2020 until January 22, 2021. The model predictions had r > 0.7 for 87% of the counties across the United States. A lower correlation was reported for the counties with total cases of <1000 during the test interval. The average mean absolute error (MAE) was 605.4 and decreased with a decrease in the total number of cases during the testing interval.

In two independent studies, SARS-CoV-2-infected cats were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days post primary challenge (DPC) and necropsies performed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-secondary challenge (DP2C). Sentinels were co-mingled with the re-challenged cats at 1 DP2C. Clinical signs were recorded, and nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, blood, and serum were collected and tissues examined for histologic lesions. Viral RNA was transiently shed via the nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal cavities of the re-challenged cats. Viral RNA was detected in various tissues of re-challenged cats euthanized at 4 DP2C, mainly in the upper respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues, but less frequently and at lower levels in the lower respiratory tract when compared to primary SARS-CoV-2 challenged cats at 4 DPC. Viral RNA and antigen detected in the respiratory tract of the primary SARS-CoV-2 infected cats at early DPCs were absent in the re-challenged cats.

We tested the hypothesis that spontaneous remyelination in the toxic nonimmune model of lysolecithin-induced demyelination can be enhanced by manipulating the inflammatory response. In PBS-treated SJL/J mice, the number of remyelinating axons per square millimeter of lesion area increased significantly 3 and 5 weeks after lysolecithin injection in the spinal cord. However, methylprednisolone or a monoclonal antibody (mAb), SCH94.03, developed for its ability to promote remyelination in the Theiler's virus murine model of demyelination, further increased the number of remyelinating axons per lesion area at 3 weeks by a factor of 2.6 and 1.9, respectively, but did not increase the ratio of myelin sheath thickness to axon diameter or the number of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine in the lesion. After 3 weeks, the number of remyelinating axons in the methylprednisolone or mAb SCH94.03 treatment groups was similar to the spontaneous remyelination in the 5 week PBS control-treated group, indicating that these treatments promoted remyelination by increasing its rate rather than its extent. To address a mechanism for promoting remyelination, through an effect on scavenger function, we assessed morphometrically the number of macrophages in lesions after methylprednisolone and mAb SCH94.03 treatment.

Secondary outcomes: mortality from the date of randomization until the last day of the study which will be the day all of the patients have had at least one of the following outcomes: 1) Improvement of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale. 2) Discharge from the hospital 3) Death. Improvement of SPO2 during the hospitalization, duration of hospitalization from date of randomization until the date of hospital discharge or death, whichever comes first. The incidence of new mechanical ventilation uses from the date of randomization until the last day of the study and the duration of it will be extracted. Please note that we are trying to add further secondary outcomes and this section of the protocol is still evolving. RANDOMIZATION: Eligible patients with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infections will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two therapeutic arms using permuted, block-randomization to balance the number of patients allocated to each group. The permuted block (three or six patients per block) randomization sequence will be generated, using Package randomizeR in R software version 3.6.1. and placed in individual sealed and opaque envelopes by the statistician. The investigator will enroll the patients and only then open envelopes to assign patients to the different treatment groups. This method of allocation concealment will result in minimum selection and confounding biases. BLINDING (MASKING): The present research is open-label (no masking) of patients and health care professionals who are undertaking outcome assessment of the primary outcome - time to clinical improvement. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): Of the 100 patients randomised, 50 patients will be assigned to receive high dose Interferon beta-1a plus lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), 50 patients will be assigned to receive low dose Interferon beta 1a plus lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra). TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.2.1. Recruitment is finished, the start date of recruitment was on August 20(th) 2020, and the end date was on September 4(th) 2020. Last point of data collection will be the last day on which all of the 100 participants have had an outcome of clinical improvement or death, up to 14th days after hospitalization.

There are also studies that suggest that a history of response to ECT might indicate a higher response rate to VNS. VNS was suggested as treatment for a patient who received maintenance ECT for treatment resistant unipolar depression during 9 years. 3 months after VNS was implanted, ECT was stopped due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have published a recommended exposure limit of 85-decibels (dB) for workplace exposure to prevent NHL. Despite these recommendations for workplace noise exposure, little is known about the noise levels generated during gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. We aimed to investigate the noise generated by suction during GI endoscopy. Methods: Sound levels were measured using the NIOSH Sound Level Meter smart phone application. The noise generated from an adult colonoscope (Olympus HQ190) at various levels of suction were measured using Neptune 3 (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI) mobile surgical suction device (SSD) that allows a wide range of suction pressure levels versus traditional wall suction (WS). Measurements were obtained as average levels over a 30-second interval in a quiet, outpatient ambulatory endoscopy room. Noise measurements were obtained at various positions within the room (endoscopist, nurse/ technician) as well as next to the endoscope suction button. The measurements were obtained with the endoscopist applying no suction, partial suction and complete suction. Results: With the SSD, sound levels increased as suction pressure increased. The highest sound levels were generated when no endoscopic suction was applied. None of the measurements exceeded recommended exposure limits set by the NIOSH (Table 1). With pressure levels set at 200 mmHg (traditional wall suction maximums) sound levels at the endoscopist for SSD and WS were 54.3 dB and 47.1 dB, respectively, e.g. more than 7 times louder. Conclusion: Little is known about the occupational safety of noise levels in endoscopy nor the contribution suction contributes. In this study, noise levels did not exceed the recommended exposure limit set by the NIOSH. However, SSD generates significantly more noise than WS at the same pressure levels. While these levels may not constitute an occupational hazard, they make communication more difficult especially in the COVID era of enhanced PPE (e.g. face shield, N95). The techniques developed during the study offer a simple process that can be implemented in any GI endoscopy suite to assess the contributions of suction to workplace noise..","output":"Assessing occupational noise generated from surgical suction devices vs traditional wall suction in gastrointestinal endoscopy: A quality improvement project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The entry of falsified and substandard medicines into the legitimate pharmaceutical supply chain has negative impacts on healthcare systems, patient safety, and patient access to medicine. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of access to safe medicine through legitimate pharmaceutical supply chains and the willingness of criminals to target medical products such as PPE (personal protective equipment) and COVID-19 treatments. In this article, we analyse data from the United Kingdom (UK) national medicine alert and recall database to identify and understand recent cases of substandard and falsified medicine in the UKs healthcare systems. Using the UK as a case study, we describe that national drug alert and recall data are useful in their current form to record and understand cases of substandard and falsified medicines in the supply chain. However, if regulatory agencies published further data, these drug recall databases may be useful to support longitudinal and international comparative medicine quality studies. We suggest that regulatory agencies publish the number of affected medicine packs in each recalled batch, as part of the recall process.

Currently, HER2 status is assessed by tumour biopsy, but this may not be representative of the larger tumour mass or other metastatic sites, risking misclassification and selection of suboptimal therapy. The designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) G3 binds HER2 with high affinity at an epitope that does not overlap with trastuzumab and is biologically inert. We hypothesized that radiolabelled DARPin G3 would be capable of selectively imaging HER2-positive tumours, and aimed to identify a suitable format for clinical application. METHODS G3 DARPins tagged with hexahistidine (His6) or with histidine glutamate (HE)3 and untagged G3 DARPins were manufactured using a GMP-compatible Pichia pastoris protocol and radiolabelled with (125)I, or with (111)In via DOTA linked to a C-terminal cysteine. BALB/c mice were injected with radiolabelled G3 and tissue biodistribution was evaluated by gamma counting. The lead construct ((HE)3-G3) was assessed in mice bearing HER2-positive human breast tumour (BT474) xenografts. RESULTS For both isotopes, (HE)3-G3 had significantly lower liver uptake than His6-G3 and untagged G3 counterparts in non-tumour-bearing mice, and there was no significantly different liver uptake between His6-G3 and untagged G3. (HE)3-G3 was taken forward for evaluation in mice bearing HER2-positive tumour xenografts. The results demonstrated that radioactivity from (111)In-(HE)3-G3 was better maintained in tumours and cleared faster from serum than radioactivity from (125)I-(HE)3-G3, achieving superior tumour-to-blood ratios (343.7  161.3 vs. 22.0  11.3 at 24 h, respectively). On microSPECT/CT, (111)In-labelled and (125)I-labelled (HE)3-G3 could image HER2-positive tumours at 4 h after administration, but there was less normal tissue uptake of radioactivity with (111)In-(HE)3-G3. Preadministration of trastuzumab did not affect the uptake of (HE)3-G3 by HER2-positive tumours. CONCLUSION Radiolabelled DARPin (HE)3-G3 is a versatile radioligand with potential to allow the acquisition of whole-body HER2 scans on the day of administration.","output":"Development of the designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin) G3 for HER2 molecular imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a huge challenge for clinical teaching due to contact restrictions and social distancing. Medical teachers have to balance potential risks and benefits of bedside teaching, especially in course formats intended to foster practical clinical skills. In this context, we aimed to address the question, whether presence-based teaching formats without patient involvement are suitable to teach practical skills. METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, presence-based teaching formats with and without patient contact were retrospectively compared regarding their effects on medical students theoretical knowledge and practical skills, i.e. the performance and clinical interpretation of the neurological exam. To this end, evaluations from 102 students and their lecturers participating in a neurological bedside teaching course at a German university hospital between October 2020 and April 2021 were obtained. Students were initially randomly assigned to course dates. However, 53 students assigned to courses in November and December 2020, were not able to go bedside due to contact restrictions. These students formed the interventional group and the remaining 49 students the control group. The primary outcome measures were students overall grading of the course (school grades, 1C6) as well as ratings of knowledge and skills provided by the students themselves and their lecturers on a numerical rating scale (0C10). Comparison between groups was performed using frequentist and Bayesian t-statistics. RESULTS: The teaching format without patient contact received a significantly poorer overall grade by the students (p = 0.018). However, improvements in the students self-ratings of knowledge and skills did not differ between the two formats (all p > 0.05, BF(10max) = 0.42). Moreover, especially practical skills were even rated significantly better in the group without patient contact by the lecturers (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Teaching formats without patient contact are less well-received by the students. However, they are able to teach practical skills regarding the performance and clinical interpretation of examination techniques. Still, the evaluations obtained might not adequately capture the importance of bedside teaching in preparing future physicians for their practice. Perspectively, hybrid teaching approaches including flipped-classroom concepts hold considerable potential to enhance effectiveness of bedside teaching in the present pandemic situation and in the future.","output":"Effectiveness of non-bedside teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic: a quasi-experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Millions of goods and services are now unavailable in many countries due to the current coronavirus pandemic, dramatically impacting on the construction of key economic statistics used for informing policy.

While lethality is highest in the elderly, transmission and case numbers are highest in the young. Due to limited vaccine availability, a strategy of first vaccinating the elderly is widely used. Vaccines elicit enhanced immune responses in younger persons compared to the elderly, but even in the latter, mRNA vaccines are effective, implying that in the young, lower vaccine doses might suffice for protection, thereby increasing the number of persons that can be vaccinated. Methods: Using published immunogenicity data of the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine, we examined the value of tailored-dose vaccination strategies, using a modeling approach that incorporates age-related vaccine immunogenicity, social contact patterns, population structure, Covid-19 case and death rates in the U.S. in late January 2021. Reduced dose vaccination in the young multiplies the number of individuals vaccinated early. Results: Age-tailored dosing strategies led to faster case reduction and thereby shortened the pandemic, reducing the delay to reaching <100'000/day from 64 to 30 days and avoiding 25'000 deaths within 100 days in the USA. While regular vaccination of the elderly can continue, the main protection of the elderly resulted from stopping the pandemic by vaccinating a large number of young persons by age-adapted dosing. Conclusion: Rapid reduction of Covid-19 case and death rate in the U.S. can be best achieved by using highly effective vaccines in an age-tailored dosing regimen. Protecting the vulnerable is most effectively achieved by dose tailored vaccination of all population segments, while an 'elderly first' approach costs more lives, even in the elderly.","output":"Minimizing loss of life in Covid-19 in a 100 day period in the U.S.A. by age-tailored dosing and distribution of a limited vaccine supply"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in millions of deaths and affected socioeconomic structure worldwide and the search for new antivirals and treatments are still ongoing.

This report aims to inform about the changes in training volume and intensity distribution and their effects on functional performance due to a 7-week home-confinement period in professional road cyclists from a Union Cycliste Internationale Pro Team. METHODS: A total of 18 male professional cyclists (mean [SD] age = 24.9 [2.8] y, body mass = 66.5 [5.6] kg, maximal aerobic power = 449 [39] W; 6.8 [0.6] W/kg) were monitored during the 10 weeks before the lockdown (outdoor cycling) and the 7-week lockdown (indoor cycling turbo trainer). Data from the mean maximal power output (in watts per kilogram) produced during the best 5-minute and best 20-minute records and the training intensity distributions (weekly volumes at power-based training zones) were collected from WKO5 software. RESULTS: Total training volume decreased 33.9% during the lockdown (P < .01). Weekly volumes by standardized zones (Z1 to Z6) declined between 25.8% and 52.2% (effect size from 0.83 to 1.57), except for Z2 (P = .38). There were large reductions in best 5-minute and best 20-minute performance (effect size > 1.36; P < .001) with losses between 1% and 19% in all the cyclists. CONCLUSIONS: Total indoor volumes of 12 hours per week, with 6 hours per week at low intensity (Z1 and Z2) and 2 hours per week at high intensity over the threshold (Z5 and Z6), were insufficient to maintain performance in elite road cyclists during the COVID-19 lockdown.

However, the role of LL-37 as a T cell self-antigen in the context of atherosclerosis remains unclear. The objective of this study was to test for the presence of T cells reactive to LL-37 in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Furthermore, the role of T cells reactive to LL-37 in atherosclerosis was assessed using apoE?/? mice immunized with the LL-37 mouse ortholog, mCRAMP. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ACS were stimulated with LL-37. PBMCs from stable coronary artery disease (CAD) patients or self-reported subjects served as controls. T cell memory responses were analyzed with flow cytometry. Stimulation of PBMCs with LL-37 reduced CD8+ effector T cell responses in controls and patients with stable CAD but not in ACS and was associated with reduced programmed cell death protein 1 (PDCD1) mRNA expression. For the mouse studies, donor apoE?/? mice were immunized with mCRAMP or adjuvant as controls, then T cells were isolated and adoptively transferred into recipient apoE?/? mice fed a Western diet. Recipient mice were euthanized after 5 weeks. Whole aortas and hearts were collected for analysis of atherosclerotic plaques. Spleens were collected for flow cytometric and mRNA expression analysis. Adoptive transfer experiments in apoE?/? mice showed a 28% reduction in aortic plaque area in mCRAMP T cell recipient mice (P < 0.05). Fifty six percent of adjuvant T cell recipient mice showed calcification in atherosclerotic plaques, compared to none in the mCRAMP T cell recipient mice (Fishers exact test P = 0.003). Recipients of T cells from mice immunized with mCRAMP had increased IL-10 and IFN- expression in CD8+ T cells compared to controls. In conclusion, the persistence of CD8+ effector T cell response in PBMCs from patients with ACS stimulated with LL-37 suggests that LL-37-reactive T cells may be involved in the acute event. Furthermore, studies in apoE?/? mice suggest that T cells reactive to mCRAMP are functionally active in atherosclerosis and may be involved in modulating plaque calcification.","output":"The Role of T Cells Reactive to the Cathelicidin Antimicrobial Peptide LL-37 in Acute Coronary Syndrome and Plaque Calcification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Influenza A and B viruses constantly evolve and cause seasonal epidemics and sporadic outbreaks. Therefore, epidemiological surveillance is critical for monitoring their circulation pattern. Trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine formulations are available in Panama (until and since 2016, respectively). Herein, we analysed influenza A and B epidemiological patterns in Panama. METHODS: This was a retrospective descriptive analysis of all laboratory-confirmed influenza nasopharyngeal samples recorded between 2011 and 2017 in the nationwide surveillance database of Gorgas Memorial Institute for Health Studies. The analysis involved data relative to demographic information, virus type, subtype and lineage, geographic region, treatment and outcomes. The percentage level of mismatch between circulating and vaccine-recommended B lineage was assessed for each MayCOctober influenza season. RESULTS: Among 1839 influenza cases, 79.6% were type A and 20.4% were type B. Most of them were observed in Panama City (54.7%) followed by the West (23.2%) and Central (16.7%) regions; across all regions, influenza A and B cases were distributed in a 4:1 ratio. Overall, approximately half were hospitalized (52.0% for type A; 45.5% for type B) and 11 (0.6%) died. Treatment, usually antimicrobial, was administered in 15.1% of cases. Children less than 2 years old were the most affected by this disease. Influenza type A circulated every year, while influenza B only circulated in 2012, 2014 and 2017. In the 2012 MayCOctober influenza B season, the predominant lineage was B/Victoria and a switch to B/Yamagata was observed in 2014. Both lineages co-circulated in 2017, leading to a 38.9% B-lineage-level vaccine mismatch. CONCLUSION: Influenza A was predominant among all ages and children less than 2 years and inhabitants of Panama City reported the highest circulation rate. In 2017, co-circulation of both B lineages led to a vaccine mismatch. Continuous monitoring of seasonal influenza is critical to establish immunization recommendations.

The authors established a direct injection technique to analyze levetiracetam (LEV) concentrations in human serum and studied its application in therapeutic drug monitoring. METHODS Serum samples were prepared by hollow fiber centrifugal ultrafiltration and the filtrate was directly injected into a UHPLC apparatus (Waters UPLC BEH C18 column: 50 mm  2.1 mm, 1.7 m) for analysis. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (8:92) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The column temperature was maintained at 30C. The detected wavelength was 210 nm. RESULTS A linear relationship was obtained for LEV from 0.625 to 80 g/mL (r = 0.999). The limit of detection (LOD) for the analysis of LEV was 0.125 g/mL. The analysis time was shortened to 4 min. The recovery rate of LEV based on the current method was 96.6-100.1%, whereas the absolute recovery rate was 93.2-96.8%. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of intraday and interday precision was <7.3%. Stability was achieved at room temperature for 24 hr after 3 freeze-thaw cycles and at -80 C for 21 days. The method was successfully applied to determine LEV concentrations in the serum of 19 patients. CONCLUSION The present method is simple, accurate, and sensitive and can improve biosafety with the direct injection technique.

A 56-year-old woman presented with worsening lower extremity weakness, imbalance, and ambulation difficulty. Her strength was 3/5 in her right lower extremity (RLE) and 4/5 in her left lower extremity (LLE). She had an incomplete T4 sensory level and hyperreflexia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a heterogeneous 'popcorn'-appearing expansile intradural intramedullary 2.21.2-cm lesion at T4-5, consistent with a cavernous malformation. Angiography was deferred given the characteristic MRI appearance. Given her progressive symptomology (including weakness), lesion size, and good health, she was recommended for resection. Using neurologic monitoring, a T4-5 laminectomy, midline myelotomy, and piecemeal microsurgical resection of the lesion was performed, clearly identifying the cavernoma-spinal cord interface and avoiding spinal cord retraction. Histopathology confirmed a cavernoma. Postoperatively, the patient had improved LLE strength and stable RLE strength except worsened dorsiflexion (1/5), which improved with rehabilitation. At one-year follow-up, she had full strength in the LLE and was 4/5 in the RLE, with mild paresthesias below T10.

These risks come from the re\\\\emergence of pathogens kept in laboratories or from pathogens that are retained in the permafrost, which become available upon thawing due to climate change. We here focus on the effects of such re\\\\emergence in natural host populations based on evolutionary theory of virulence and long\\\\term studies, which investigate hostCpathogen adaptations. Pathogens tend to be locally and temporally adapted to their co\\\\occurring hosts, but when pathogens from a different environment or different time enter the host community, the degree to which a new hostCpathogen interaction is a threat will depend on the specific genotypic associations, the time lag between the host and the pathogen, and the interactions with native or recent host and pathogen species. Some insights can be obtained from long\\\\term studies using a resurrection ecology approach. These long\\\\term studies based on time\\\\shift experiments are essential to obtain insight into the mechanisms underlying hostCpathogen coevolution at several ecological and temporal scales. As past pathogens and their corresponding host(s) can differ in infectivity and susceptibility, strong reciprocal selective pressures can be induced by the pathogen. These strong selective pressures often result in an escalating arms race, but do not necessarily result in increased infectivity over time. Human health can also be impacted by these resurrected pathogens as the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, which are infectious diseases originating from animal populations naturally transmitted to humans. The sanitary risk associated with pathogen emergence from different environments (spatial or temporal) depends on a combination of socioeconomic, environmental, and ecological factors that affect the virulence or the pathogenic potential of microbes and their ability to infect susceptible host populations.","output":"Back to the future in a petri dish: Origin and impact of resurrected microbes in natural populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Older adults with multimorbidity and complex care needs (CCN) are among those most likely to experience frequent care transitions between settings, particularly from hospital to home. Transition periods mark vulnerable moments in care for individuals with CCN. Poor communication and incomplete information transfer between clinicians and organizations involved in the transition from hospital to home can impede access to needed support and resources. Establishing digitally supported communication that enables person-centered care and supported self-management may offer significant advantages as we support older adults with CCN transitioning from hospital to home. OBJECTIVE: This protocol outlines the plan for the development, implementation, and evaluation of a Digital Bridge co-designed to support person-centered health care transitions for older adults with CCN. The Digital Bridge builds on the foundation of two validated technologies: Care Connector, designed to improve interprofessional communication in hospital, and the electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePRO) tool, designed to support goal-oriented care planning and self-management in primary care settings. This project poses three overarching research questions that focus on adapting the technology to local contexts, evaluating the impact of the Digital Bridge in relation to the quadruple aim, and exploring the potential to scale and spread the technology. METHODS: The study includes two phases: workflow co-design (phase 1), followed by implementation and evaluation (phase 2). Phase 1 will include iterative co-design working groups with patients, caregivers, hospital providers, and primary care providers to develop a transition workflow that will leverage the use of Care Connector and ePRO to support communication through the transition process. Phase 2 will include implementation and evaluation of the Digital Bridge within two hospital systems in Ontario in acute and rehab settings (600 patients: 300 baseline and 300 implementation). The primary outcome measure for this study is the Care Transitions MeasureC3 to assess transition quality. An embedded ethnography will be included to capture context and process data to inform the implementation assessment and development of a scale and spread strategy. An Integrated Knowledge Translation approach is taken to inform the study. An advisory group will be established to provide insight and feedback regarding the project design and implementation, leading the development of the project knowledge translation strategy and associated outputs. RESULTS: This project is underway and expected to be complete by Spring 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Given the real-world implementation of Digital Bridge, practice changes in the research sites and variable adherence to the implementation protocols are likely. Capturing and understanding these considerations through a mixed-methods approach will help identify the range of factors that may influence study results. Should a favorable evaluation suggest wide adoption of the proposed intervention, this project could lead to positive impact at patient, clinician, organizational, and health system levels.

Remdesivir is an investigational drug studied in clinical trials for COVID-19 and is available to children and pregnant women through compassionate use access, but is not yet FDA-approved. In early May, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services began to distribute remdesivir donated by Gilead Sciences, Inc., to hospitals and state health departments for emergency use; multiple shipments have since been distributed.

Most important, the risk for inadvertent thermal injury during electrosurgery can be minimized by a sound comprehension of the predictable behaviors of electricity in living tissue.Guided by the Hippocratic charge of primum non nocere, the ultimate aim of energy-assisted surgery is the attainment of anatomic dissection and hemostasis with the least amount of collateral damage and subsequent scar tissue formation.Ideally, the surgeons final view of the operative field should accurately approximate the topography discoverable after postoperative healing. Despite the continued innovation of products borne to reduce thermal damage and then marketed as being comparatively safer, it is the hands and mind of the surgeon that serve to preserve tissue integrity by reducing the burden of delayed thermal necrosis and taking steps to prevent excessive devitalization of tissue. Regardless of the chosen modality, the inseparable and exponentially linked elements of time and the quantity of delivered energy must be integrated while purposefully moderating to attain the desired tissue effect. Ultimately, the reduction of unwanted thermal injury is inherently linked to good surgical judgment and technique, a sound comprehension of the applied energy modality, and the surgeons ability to recognize anatomic structures within the field of surgical dissection as well as those within the zone of significant thermal change.During the use of any energy-based device for hemostasis, out of sight must never mean out of mind.

Severe infections induce hyperinflammatory responses that are often intensified by host adaptive immune pathways to profoundly advance disease severity. Proinflammatory responses are triggered by CoV entry mediated by host cell surface receptors. Interestingly, five of the seven strains use three cell surface metallopeptidases (CD13, CD26, and ACE2) as receptors, whereas the others employ O-acetylated-sialic acid (a key feature of metallopeptidases) for entry. Why CoV evolved to use peptidases as their receptors is unknown, but the peptidase activities of the receptors are dispensable, suggesting the virus uses/benefits from other functions of these molecules.

Early diagnosis of OA-associated cartilage alterations would be beneficial for disease prevention and control, and for the development of disease-modifying treatments. However, early diagnosis is still hampered by a lack of quantifiable readouts in preclinical models. DESIGN In this study, we have shown the potency of contrast-enhanced nanofocus x-ray computed tomography (CE-nanoCT) to be used for virtual 3-dimensional (3D) histopathology in established mouse models for OA, and we compared with standard histopathology. RESULTS We showed the equivalence of CE-nanoCT images to histopathology for the modified Mankin scoring of the cartilage structure and quality. Additionally, a limited set of 3D cartilage characteristics measured by CE-nanoCT image analysis in a user-independent and semiautomatic manner, that is, average and maximum of the noncalcified cartilage thickness distribution and loss in glycosaminoglycans, was shown to be predictive for the cartilage quality and structure as can be evaluated by histopathological scoring through the use of an empirical model. CONCLUSIONS We have shown that CE-nanoCT is a tool that allows virtual histopathology and 3D morphological quantification of multitissue systems, such as the chondro-osseous junction. It provides faster and more quantitative data on cartilage structure and quality compared with standard histopathology while eliminating user bias.

Seventy-seven patients were identified as asymptomatic carriers (n=64) or SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive before symptom onset (n=13). The positive rates of SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 80.4% and 96.8%, respectively.

The IgM and IgG levels of asymptomatic patients (median titers, 8.3 AU/mL and 100.3 AU/mL) were much lower than those in symptomatic patients (median titers, 38.0 AU/mL and 158.2 AU/mL). A much lower of IgG level was observed in critical ill patients 42 to 60 days after symptom onset. There were 153 patients with viral RNA shedding after IgG detection. These patients had a higher proportion of critical illness during hospitalization (P<0.001) and a longer hospital stay (P<0.001) compared to patients with viral clearance after IgG detection.

Results showed that inter-country mobility fluctuation could explain 80%, 35%, and 12% of the variance in imported cases and could prevent 20 million, 5 million, and 40 million imported cases in India, Japan and China, respectively. The critical time for screening and monitoring of imported cases is 2 weeks at minimum and 4 weeks at maximum, according to the time when the Pearsons Rs between R(t) and imported cases reaches a peak (>0.8). We also found that if local transmission is initiated, a 1% increase in intra-country mobility would result in 1430 (501), 109 (181), and 10 (1) additional bed shortages, as estimated using the D(oc) in India, Japan, and China, respectively. Our findings provide vital reference for governments to tailor their pre-vaccination policies regarding mobility, especially during future epidemic waves of COVID-19 or similar severe epidemic outbreaks.","output":"Reduction of Human Mobility Matters during Early COVID-19 Outbreaks: Evidence from India, Japan and China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Parenting interventions like the Family Check-Up have demonstrated effects on child physical and behavioral health outcomes. However, access to these programs is limited, particularly for populations experiencing health disparities. Primary care settings have become recognized as a potential delivery system in which these programs may be implemented at scale. The purpose of this trial is to test the effectiveness of the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) program, an adaptation of the FCU for primary care, and assess program implementation in an integrated primary care setting. Methods We will conduct a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial in partnership with a primary care clinic in a low-income, majority Latino community. Families with 2- to 5-year-old children will be eligible to participate. Families will be randomized to receive the intervention (n = 130) or services as usual (n = 70) and will be assessed annually over three years. Outcomes are informed by the RE-AIM framework (i.e., reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). Effectiveness outcomes include child health behaviors (e.g., Dietary Screener Questionnaire), behavioral health (e.g., Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and parenting (e.g., Proactive Parenting). Early stage implementation outcomes are also included (e.g., cost, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility). Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed via intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Implementation outcomes will be primarily descriptive with comparisons to prior trials of FCU4Health and the original FCU.

There is a lack of interventional data investigating whether providing nutritional support during the hospital stay in patients at risk for malnutrition presenting with lower respiratory tract infection lowers mortality. METHODS: For this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial (EFFORT), we analyzed data of a subgroup of patients with confirmed lower respiratory tract infection from an initial cohort of 2028 patients. Patients at nutritional risk (Nutritional Risk Screening [NRS] score 3 points) were randomized to receive protocol-guided individualized nutritional support to reach protein and energy goals (intervention group) or standard hospital food (control group). The primary endpoint of this analysis was all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: We included 378 of 2028 EFFORT patients (mean age 74.4 years, 24% with COPD) into this analysis. Compared to usual care hospital nutrition, individualized nutritional support to reach caloric and protein goals showed a similar beneficial effect of on the risk of mortality in the subgroup of respiratory tract infection patients as compared to the main EFFORT trial (odds ratio 0.47 [95%CI 0.17 to 1.27, p = 0.136] vs 0.65 [95%CI 0.47 to 0.91, p = 0.011]) with no evidence of a subgroup effect (p for interaction 0.859). Effects were also similar among different subgroups based on etiology and type of respiratory tract infection and for other secondary endpoints. CONCLUSION: This subgroup analysis from a large nutrition support trial suggests that patients at nutritional risk as assessed by NRS 2002 presenting with bronchopulmonary infection to the hospital likely have a mortality benefit from individualized inhospital nutritional support. The small sample size and limited statistical power calls for larger nutritional studies focusing on this highly vulnerable patient population.

The addition of SiCp and Mo to Zr-Cu-based composite filler metal improves the nuclear properties of the composite filler metal and its joint, reduces the coefficient of thermal expansion of the composite filler metal and SiC ceramic joint, and improves the mechanical properties of the joint. The shear properties of the joint increase with the increase of the content of SiCp and Mo in the Zr-Cu composite filler metals.

However, in the absence of seroprevalence surveys, the true infection rate remains unknown. In this population-based study we assessed the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in eighteen cities of Iran.Methods: We randomly selected and invited study participants from the general population (N = 3,547) and occupations with high risk of COVID-19 exposure, defined as high-risk population (e.g., supermarket employees) (N = 5,391), in eighteen cities of Iran. SARS-CoV-2 ELISA kits were used to detect antibody against COVID-19. Crude, population weight adjusted, and test performance adjusted seroprevalence rates were estimated.Findings: The population weight adjusted and test performance adjusted prevalence rates of antibody seropositivity in general population were 131% (95% CI 116-148%) and 185% (95% CI 161-213%), respectively. The population-weighted seroprevalence estimate implies that 3,290,633 (95% CI 2,907185-3,709,167) individuals, from the eighteen included cities in this study, were infected by end of April 2020.The overall prevalence rate was higher among individuals aged  60 years (320%, 95% CI 239-408%) and with comorbidity condition (237%, 95% CI 185-288%). The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies varied greatly by city and the highest population test-adjusted prevalence rates were in Rasht 781% (95% CI 583-983%) and Qom (665%, 95% CI 399-954%) cities. The test-adjusted prevalence did not differ between low and high-risk populations and was about 20.0%.Interpretations: The findings of this study imply that prevalence of seropositivity is likely much higher than the reported prevalence rates based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Iran. Despite the high seroprevalence rates in a few cities, the low overall prevalence estimates indicate that a large proportion of population is still susceptible to the virus.

The aim of our study was to analyze COVID-19 severity in transplant recipients and to compare the difference of COVID-19 clinical outcomes in early (<1 year) vs. late (>1 year) post-transplant period. Methods: 41 post-living donor liver transplant recipients with COVID-19 infection were studied retrospectively from 1st April 2020 to 28th February 2021. Results: The median age was 49.00 years with a male preponderance (80.49%). Fifteen patients had infection within 1 year of transplant and 26 were infected after 1 year of transplant. The overall median interval between transplantation and COVID-19 diagnosis was 816.00 days. Fever and malaise were the common presenting symptoms. The most common associated comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (65.85%) and hypertension (46.34%). The severity of illness was mild in 28 (68.29%), moderate in 4 (9.76%), severe in 6 (14.63%) and critical in 3 (7.32%). To identify associated risk factors, we divided our patients into less severe and more severe groups. Except for lymphopenia, there was no worsening of total bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma-glutamyl transferase in the more severe group. Eight (19.51%) patients required intensive care unit admission and three (7.32%) died, while none suffered graft rejection. In recipients with early vs. late post transplant COVID-19 infection, there were similar outcomes in terms of severity of COVID-19 illness, intensive care unit care need, requirement of respiratory support, and death.

It is based on anatomical characteristics each of which makes surgical resection of an AVM more difficult, namely, deep venous drainage, eloquence of surrounding tissue, and large nidus size. A higher score correlates with more complications after treatment. Although this grading system has proven reliable over time, it does not reflect the major determinants of risk associated with endovascular treatment. The authors developed a grading system unique to endovascular treatment of cerebral AVMs. METHODS The proposed grading system accounts for the principal AVM anatomical and physiological features that make endovascular embolization more difficult and, thus, the likelihood of complications greater. These include number of arterial pedicles, diameter of arterial pedicles, and eloquent location of AVM nidus. The proposed grading system was retrospectively applied to 50 patients undergoing endovascular AVM embolization, and its ability to predict complications was compared to the Spetzler-Martin grading system. RESULTS Perioperative complications among the 50 patients included 4 major and 9 minor complications. The proposed grading system was predictive of complication risk, with an increasing rate of perioperative complications associated with an increasing AVM grade.

Compared to successful interventions, the incidences of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (82% vs. 70%, P = 0.34) and infrapopliteal occlusive disease were similar (47% vs. 31%, P = 0.20). \\"Failure-to-cross\\" procedures were just as long as successful procedures; there were no significant differences in fluoroscopy time (27  10 vs. 24  14 min, P = 0.52), in-room time (106  98 vs. 103  44 min, P = 0.84), or contrast dye volume utilization (73  37 vs. 96  54 mL, P = 0.12). As expected, \\"failure-to-cross\\" procedures incurred far higher hospital charges and costs compared to noninterventional diagnostic angiograms (charges $13,311  6,067 vs. $7,690  1,942, P < 0.01; costs $5,289  2,099 vs. $2,826  1,198, P < 0.01). Despite the additional time and effort spent attempting to cross difficult lesions, the operators were reimbursed at the same low rate as a purely diagnostic procedure (average fee charge $7,360; average reimbursement $992). After 1 year, the 17 patients in whom lesions could not be crossed were treated with advanced interventional procedures with success (n = 2), surgical bypass grafting (n = 5), extremity amputation (n = 4), or no additional intervention in their salvaged limb (n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Patients whose lesions cannot be crossed during PPI fare worse than patients undergoing successful interventions. Hospital costs and charges appropriately reflect the high technical difficulty and resource utilization of extended attempts at endovascular therapy. For practitioners, crossing lesions during PPI is truly a \\"pay-for-performance\\" procedure in that only successful procedures are reasonably reimbursed.","output":"\\"Failure-to-Cross\\" in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Peripheral Intervention: The Nonreimbursed Procedure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Just as teacher education programs depend upon practicing teachers for the quality and integrity of their programs, they have a responsibility for playing a role in ongoing support for these educators We begin by describing how we think about a pedagogy of connection for teacher education, building upon the earlier contributions of education scholars, and then briefly discuss the role of teacher education programs in cultivating this pedagogical strategy with teacher candidates and practicing teachers Teacher educators may also benefit from participating in virtual communities alongside teacher candidates and practicing teachers Teacher educators' ability to foster a pedagogy of connection with teacher candidates and practicing teachers is necessary to help them understand the full scope of students' academic, social, and emotional needs and how to effectively respond ([1]) [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Journal of Teacher Education is the property of Sage Publications Inc and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"The Teacher Support Imperative: Teacher Education and the Pedagogy of Connection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Investigation into the lifeways of freedman George White suggest a successful farmer who purchased and kept approximately 600 acres, emancipated his family and built a safe community for them.

We aimed to develop a risk map for rubella epidemics in Japan by geographic location via analysis of seroepidemiological data and accounting for the abundance of foreign visitors. METHODS: Geographic age distribution and seroprevalence were used to compute the age- and sex-dependent next-generation matrix in each region. We computed the probability of a major epidemic using the assumed number of untraced imported rubella cases proportionally modeled to the number of foreign travelers. RESULTS: Risks of a major epidemic were high in areas with capital cities, while areas with a greater fraction of older people yielded smaller effective reproduction numbers, a lower volume of foreign travelers, and thus a lower probability of a major epidemic. The volume of susceptible adult males was larger in urban geographic regions, having a greater number of foreign travelers than remote areas. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings are consistent with the observation of multiple large clusters of rubella cases in urban areas during 2012C2014 and 2018C2019.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research was to assess the black box of positive COVID-19 vaccination beliefs to determine the relative importance of each factor and thus inform well-targeted and tailored health promotion efforts. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a sample of U.S. adults (N = 1656), assessing the influence of demographic characteristics, cognitive effects, public confidence, and news source variety and evaluation on positive COVID-19 vaccination beliefs. RESULTS: Overall, the strongest predictor of positive beliefs was high confidence in public health officials and political institutions to handle the COVID-19 pandemic effectively, yet negative sentiments toward COVID-19 research and science and COVID-19 vaccine ambivalence reduced the likelihood that beliefs were positive. Cognitive effects and public confidence were identified as key predictors of positive COVID-19 vaccination beliefs over and above party identification. Importantly, high levels of confidence in science and government were mostly driven by positive evaluations of liberal news sources. High levels of COVID-19 science backlash were mostly driven by positive evaluations of conservative news sources. CONCLUSIONS: To motivate COVID-19 vaccination among hesitant or resistant groups in the population, health promotion efforts should seek to reinforce positive COVID-19 vaccination beliefs by increasing public confidence and by reducing COVID-19 science backlash, largely by choosing specific news media and social media platforms (e.g., Breitbart, Fox News, and Facebook) as channels for health promotion and health information dissemination.","output":"Inside the black box of COVID-19 vaccination beliefs: Revealing the relative importance of public confidence and news consumption habits()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of COVID-19 has resulted in a global rush to find the right antiviral treatment to conquer the pandemic and to treat patients.

To address this problem, efficient running of theatres with optimal theatre utilisation was paramount. However, as new processes were introduced to reduce transmission risk, 'last-minute' cancellations of patients were inevitable. We report our experience of resuming elective work, with particular focus on surgical cancellations, and lessons learned. Methods: This was a retrospective, single centre audit at a specialist elective orthopaedic hospital. We identified and examined all cancellations in foot and ankle cases between June and October 2020. Data was analysed and cancellations were categorised into groups by reason of cancellation. Results: There were 36 cancellations out of 193 patients listed (19%). Twenty-one cancellations (57%) were directly related to COVID-19 and its processes. These comprised six patients (17%) with COVID-19 swab related issues including: booking errors, transport problems, non-attendance, and invalid swabs. Three patients (8%) contracted COVID-19 preoperatively. Nine patients (25%) cancelled their procedure at short notice amidst fears of contracting COVID-19 perioperatively. Three (8%) cancellations were due to the patient being unfit on the day of surgery - these issues were not routinely identified at pre-assessment appointments as face-to-face pre-assessment clinics had been suspended. A further 15 cancellations (42%) were due to non- COVID-19 reasons including lack of beds, unwell patients, and patients cancelling for other personal reasons. Conclusion: Mitigation of cancellations is a key factor in maintaining theatre utilisation. Based on our experience we recommend thorough counselling of patients regarding the importance of self-isolation prior to surgery and of the pre-operative swab. Having a designated team to manage COVID-19 swabs is also critical. Reinstatement of face-to-face pre-operative assessments may help identify evolving issues and prevent last-minute cancellations.

A cross-sectional community sample (N = 2,329) was gathered to assess community cohesion buffering against heath anxiety and perceived stress during the first peak of the pandemic in the UK, using structural equation modeling analyses. Community cohesion acted as a protective mechanism against both health anxiety and stress during the first national lockdown. A strong positive association was also found between health anxiety and stress. Stress and health anxiety scores peaked in the first weeks of the imposed quarantine; as the lockdown was extended, participants reported lower stress, health anxiety and community cohesion scores. The reduction of community cohesion scores was greater for those younger than 45 while the positive association between stress and health anxiety was stronger among males during the lockdown. While community cohesion effects against health anxiety were enhanced for females, community's buffering against stress were greater for males. Strengthening citizens' psychological sense of community through the publicization and support of local initiatives and mutual-aid groups and utilizing methodically green (and blue) spaces to boost neighborhood attraction might be viable strategies within which stress and health anxiety can be suppressed.

Nitric oxide synthase plays a central role in oncogenic signaling modulation and redox landscape.

Although the main function of NOS is the production of nitric oxide (NO), it can be a source of ROS in some pathological conditions. Decreased tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) cofactor availability is involved in NOS dysfunction, leading to ROS production and reduced levels of NO.

In New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, COVID-19 case numbers have to date been relatively low. However, that does not mean the state's healthcare system has been unaffected. Preparations to create sufficient capacity to accommodate a COVID-19 surge resulted in widespread deferment of scheduled medical procedures and appointments. Patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviour changed, with a reluctance to visit healthcare settings. The aim of this study was to quantify the changes in activity seen in the NSW health system in the first half of 2020. METHODS: Healthcare data were drawn from multiple sources, including primary care, ambulance, emergency departments and inpatient settings. Volumes of healthcare activity in 2020, overall, by urgency of cases and by reasons for care were compared with the figures for the same period in 2019. Changes in the modality of care provision were also examined.

Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50-79 years, and 75% in those aged 18-49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 158 (95% credible intervals [CI] 136-184) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800-173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 483% (95% CI 481-485) and 160% (157-163) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

The reduction in STEMI was 29% (54 less), in NSTEMI was 38.9% (74 less) and elective procedures dropped by 83% (133 less). Conclusion During peak COVID hospital admission period in England, we report a 48.5% reduction in coronary catheterisation in our tertiary hospital. These results are consistent with reports from other countries, and highlight the worrying potential consequences for these patients arising from delays in presentation with MI, and the challenges for restoring services post-pandemic.","output":"Decrease in cardiac catheterization and MI during COVID pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of microscopic vessel invasion (MVI) and visceral pleural invasion (VPI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). BACKGROUND VPI is included in the current tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification in NSCLC; however, MVI is not incorporated in TNM classification. METHODS From August 1992 to December 2009, 2657 consecutive patients with pathological T1-4N0-2M0 NSCLC underwent complete resection. In addition to conventional staging factors, we evaluated MVI histologically and analyzed its significance in NSCLC recurrence prognosis. The recurrence-free period in several NSCLC subgroups was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS The proportion of patients with a 5-year recurrence-free period was 52.6% and 87.5%, respectively, in those with and without MVI (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that MVI, similarly to VPI, was found to be an independently significant predictor of recurrence [hazard ratio (HR): 2.78]. In particular, MVI and VPI were the 2 strongest significant independent predictors of recurrence in 1601 patients with pathological stage I disease treated without adjuvant chemotherapy (HR: 2.74 and 1.84, respectively). In each T subgroup analysis, evident and significant separation of the recurrence-free proportion curves were observed among the 3 groups (VPI and MVI absent, VPI or MVI present, and VPI and MVI present). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated that MVI was a significant independent risk factor for recurrence in patients with a resected T1-4N0-2M0 NSCLC. Further data on MVI prognostic impact should be collected for the next revision of the TNM staging system.","output":"Prognostic impact of microscopic vessel invasion and visceral pleural invasion in non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective analysis of 2657 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent measles outbreaks in regions with a high overall vaccination coverage have drawn attention to other factors - aside from the overall immunity level - determining the spread of measles in a population, such as heterogeneous social mixing behavior and vaccination behavior. As households are an important context for measles transmission, the clustering of susceptible individuals within households can have a decisive effect on the risk for measles outbreaks. However, as the population ages and household constitutions change over the next 20 years, that effect may change as well. To adequately plan for the control and eventual elimination of measles, we need to understand how the effect of within-household susceptibility clustering will evolve. Individual-based models enable us to represent the different levels of heterogeneity in a population that are necessary to understand the spread of a disease in a highly immunized population. In this paper, we use such an individual-based model to investigate how the effect of household-based susceptibility clustering is expected to change over the next two decades in Flanders, Belgium. We compare different scenarios regarding the level of within-household susceptibility clustering for three different calendar years between 2020 and 2040, using projections for the age distribution of the population, the constitution of households and age-specific immunity levels. We find that a higher level of susceptibility clustering within households increases the risk for measles outbreaks and their potential to spread through the population, in current as well as in future populations.","output":"Using Individual-Based Models to Look Beyond the Horizon: The Changing Effects of Household-Based Clustering of Susceptibility to Measles in the Next 20 Years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The paper provides new evidence from a survey of 2000 individuals in the US and UK related to predictors of Covid-19 transmission. Specifically, it investigates work and personal predictors of transmission experience reported by respondents using regression models to better understand possible transmission pathways and mechanisms in the community. Three themes emerge from the analysis. Firstly, transport roles and travelling practices are significant predictors of infection. Secondly, evidence from the US especially shows union membership, consultation over safety measures and the need to use public transport to get to work are also significant predictors. This is interpreted as evidence of the role of deprivation and of reactive workplace consultations. Thirdly and finally, there is some, often weaker, evidence that income, car-owership, use of a shared kitchen, university degree type, riskaversion, extraversion and height are predictors of transmission. The comparative nature of the evidence indicates that the less uniformly stringent nature of the US lockdown provides more information about both structural and individual factors that predict transmission. The evidence about height is discussed in the context of the aerosol transmission debate. The paper concludes that both structural and individual factors must be taken into account when predicting transmission or designing effective public health measures and messages to prevent or contain transmission.","output":"Work-Related and Personal Predictors of COVID-19 Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The role of parks and nature to support well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain.

It is not structurally related to other major apolipoproteins and has been known as a small, soluble carrier protein of lipophilic molecules that is mostly expressed in neurons and glial cells within the central and peripheral nervous system. Recent data indicate that ApoD not only supplies cells with lipophilic molecules, but also controls the fate of these ligands by modulating their stability and oxidation status. Of particular interest is the binding of ApoD to arachidonic acid and its derivatives, which play a central role in healthy brain function. ApoD has been shown to act as a catalyst in the reduction of peroxidized eicosanoids and to attenuate lipid peroxidation in the brain. Manipulating its expression level in fruit flies and mice has demonstrated that ApoD has a favorable effect on both stress resistance and life span. The APOD gene is the gene that is upregulated the most in the aging human brain. Furthermore, ApoD levels in the nervous system are elevated in a large number of neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and stroke. There is increasing evidence for a prominent neuroprotective role of ApoD because of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. ApoD emerges as an evolutionarily conserved anti-stress protein that is induced by oxidative stress and inflammation and may prove to be an effective therapeutic agent against a variety of neuropathologies, and even against aging.","output":"Apolipoprotein D takes center stage in the stress response of the aging and degenerative brain()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic situation, patients with suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are also treated by emergency medical services (EMS).

Reducing the burden of HAIs through the observation and enforcement of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices remains a priority. Despite growing emphasis on HAI prevention in low- and middle-income countries, limited evidence is available to improve IPC practices to reduce HAIs. This study examined the perspectives of healthcare providers (HPs) and mothers in the neonatal intensive care unit on HAIs and determined the major barriers and facilitators to promoting standard IPC practices. This study draws on data from an ethnographic study using 38 in-depth interviews, four focus group discussions and participant observation conducted among HPs and mothers in neonatal intensive care units of a secondary- and tertiary-level hospital in Ghana. The qualitative data were analysed using a grounded theory approach, and NVivo 12 to facilitate coding. HPs and mothers demonstrated a modest level of understanding about HAIs. Personal, interpersonal, community, organizational and policy-level factors interacted in complex ways to influence IPC practices. HPs sometimes considered HAI concerns to be secondary in the face of a heavy clinical workload, a lack of structured systems and the quest to protect professional authority. The positive attitudes of some HPs, and peer interactions promoted standard IPC practices. Mothers expressed interest in participation in IPC activities. It however requires systematic efforts by HPs to partner with mothers in IPC. Training and capacity building of HPs, provision of adequate resources and improving communication between HPs and mothers were recommended to improve standard IPC practices. We conclude that there is a need for institutionalizing IPC policies and strengthening strategies that acknowledge and value mothers roles as caregivers and partners in IPC. To ensure this, HPs should be better equipped to prioritize communication and collaboration with mothers to reduce the burden of HAIs.","output":"Perspectives and practices of healthcare providers and caregivers on healthcare-associated infections in the neonatal intensive care units of two hospitals in Ghana"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DISCLAIMER In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

PURPOSE Burnout in healthcare can have serious consequences, as it decreases patient care quality. Recent studies have found pharmacy employees have high rates of burnout, but formalized pharmacy well-being programs are not reported in the literature. METHODS We developed a departmental pharmacy well-being program and focused residency well-being program in October and July 2020, respectively. The program committees sent anonymous surveys to all pharmacy employees to identify opportunities to improve well-being. The feasibility and impact of ideas were assessed by committee members and presented to pharmacy leadership who endorsed and supported all proposed initiatives prior to implementation. Pharmacist distress scores were measured using the Well-Being Index (WBI). RESULTS The WBI was completed by 49% of invited pharmacists (137 of 278) in November 2020 and 41% (116 of 283) in June 2021. There was a numerical improvement in mean (SD) WBI scores from 2.06 (2.47) in November 2020 to 1.52 (2.49) in June 2021 (P = 0.09). Pharmacy residents had significantly higher distress scores than nonresident pharmacists (P = 0.01). However, pharmacy resident scores improved by almost 50% between the 2 time points, from 4.43 (2.13) to 2.40 (2.42); P = 0.03. CONCLUSION The development of a system-wide pharmacy well-being program creates a structure to collect ideas from employees, implement well-being initiatives, measure burnout using a validated tool such as the WBI, and continue to build, evaluate, and adapt new interventions. Importantly, the program went beyond addressing individual needs and addressed institutional opportunities that impact well-being. This can serve as a model for other pharmacy departments looking to implement similar programs.","output":"Development and implementation of pharmacy department and pharmacy resident well-being programs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Document ranking is an important process in information retrieval (IR). It presents retrieved documents in an order of their estimated degrees of relevance to query. Traditional document ranking methods are mostly based on the similarity computations between documents and query. In this paper we argue that the similarity-based document ranking is insufficient in some cases. There are two reasons. Firstly it is about the increased information variety. There are far too many different types documents available now for user to search. The second is about the users variety. In many cases user may want to retrieve documents that are not only similar but also general or broad regarding a certain topic. This is particularly the case in some domains such as bio-medical IR. In this paper we propose a novel approach to re-rank the retrieved documents by incorporating the similarity with their generality. By an ontology-based analysis on the semantic cohesion of text, document generality can be quantified.

The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between pre-/post-treatment 3-month RDW levels and changes in RDW with 3-year prognosis of prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 348 patients with prostate cancer were recruited between June 1, 2012 and June 1, 2017 and were followed up for at least 3 years. RDW was measured with the Mindray BC-6800Plus automatic blood counting system at pre- and post-treatment 3-month. Demographic and clinical information of the participants were also collected. The overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed using the KaplanCMeier method. Cox regression and competing risk regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 51 (14.66%) deaths occurred. The levels of pre- and post-treatment RDW levels were significantly higher in the death group than in the survival group (p<0.001). In the death group, the level of RDW continued to rise in most subjects, and the mean level of RDW was significantly higher at post-treatment than pre-treatment, contrary to the results observed in the survival group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high pre-treatment RDW, high post-treatment RDW, and persistently higher RDW were independently associated with OS and CSS (p<0.001). Similar results were observed in the competing risk regression analysis. KaplanCMeier analysis revealed that patients with higher pre-treatment RDW levels, higher post-treatment RDW levels, and persistently higher RDW levels had poorer 3-year OS and CSS rates (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The levels of and changes in RDW before and after treatment were associated with the 3-year prognosis of prostate cancer, suggesting that RDW might be an efficient prognostic predictor in patients with prostate cancer.","output":"Association Between Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment 3-Month Red Cell Distribution Width with Three-Year Prognosis of Prostate Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lung Cancer Screening provides a mechanism to detect lung cancers at stages more amendable to curative resection. Nonetheless, data suggests Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) is underutilized as a screening tool;preventing medically eligible patients from diagnosis at earlier stages;leading to reduced treatment options and, ultimately, decreased survival. The Duke Cancer Network (DCN) consists of 12 affiliated cancer programs in 5 states. As several affiliates shared a common goal of improving the uptake of LDCT screening in the community, the DCN created a platform for process improvement in LDCT screening, individualized for participating sites. Methods: DCN-developed surveys for patients and providers explored attitudes toward LDCT screening, and identified targetable access issues and barriers to LDCT screening at DCN-affiliated community cancer centers (aCCC). Armed with the survey data, five aCCC self-selected to work with an experienced Quality/Process Improvement coach to develop individualized projects focusing on one or more aspects of the LDCT screening process. The Q/PI coaches utilized Bite-Size-QI software to facilitate the project and train participants in the QI/PI process. Results: Information from 312 patient and 28 of 50 surveyed providers identified numerous targetable LDCT screening barriers: Lack of knowledge about and educational materials to address the benefits of LDCT and tools/analytics to track patients following LDCT screening. Additional, more systematic, barriers identified included: Lack of consistent national guidelines for screening, variable insurance coverage and limited availability of smoking cessation programs. Five aCCC self-selected to create individualized process improvement activities were matched to experienced Q/PI coaches. Four sites completed the yearlong project. Three of the aCCC were able to realize improvement in LDCT screening rates with 38%, 27% and 8% increase in rates, respectively, despite overlap with COVID-19 driven shutdowns. Conclusions: An assessment of current state linked to formal Q/PI activities improved uptake of LDCT screening in the majority of participating community cancer programs despite limited resources. Geographically variable COVID-19 required closures did compromise the outcomes. The process led to creation of a number of tools and process improvements to increase awareness of LDCT screening through education and foster collaboration among providers with streamlined referral processes and improved mechanisms of tracking patients.

Uncontrolled RH and RfH were defined by the presence of uncontrolled blood pressure BP (140 and/or 90 mm Hg) despite the use of 3 but 5 antihypertensive drugs (for RH) and 5 antihypertensive drugs, including a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (for RfH). Clinical examination, lab tests were performed. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and vasoreactivity of middle cerebral artery (MCA) using both breath-holding and hyperventilation test were measured by high-resolution ultrasound. RESULTS The prevalence of refractory hypertension in patients with and without DM was similar (30% vs 28%, respectively). No differences in BP levels, data of echocardiography and clinical phenotype were found between the diabetic groups, but value of HOMA index, plasma resistin level and postprandial glycaemia were higher in patients with RfH. FMD and MCA reactivity to the breath-holding test were worse in patients with RfH, and they had a more pronounced vasoconstrictor response of MCA to the hyperventilation test compared to patients with RH.

However, respiratory tract infections in nose, larynx and/or bronchi, either viral or bacterial or both, are by far the commonest cause of acute cough. These are especially frequent and hazardous in the elderly, and community living and institutionalisation may aggravate this problem. A variety of viruses and bacteria have been incriminated, with rhinovirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Bordetella pertussis being especially important. Viral infections can readily lead to community-acquired pneumonia. Successful diagnosis should point to successful treatment, and in this respect clinical examination and patient history are paramount, supplemented by chest X-ray, viral and bacterial culture and serological testing. Depending on the results of these tests, specific antibacterial therapy may be called for, although there is dispute as to the merits of antibacterial therapy in cases of uncertain diagnosis. Prevention and prophylaxis for influenza and S. pneumoniae infections are now commendably routine in the elderly, especially those in communities. Treatment, as well as the use of antibacterials, may also be directed against the inflammatory and infective processes in the airways. Non-specific antitussive therapy is common and usually highly desirable to prevent the adverse effects of repeated coughing.

Regardless of the overall increase in the prevalence and mortality, there are disagreements about the consequences of exposure and contracting COVID-19, specifically in rural areas. Rural areas have inherent characteristics that increase their vulnerability to contracting COVID-19. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in death rates from COVID-19 between urban and rural areas in the United States. METHODS This study used county-level data. The data set consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths along with county-level demographics. The sample consisted of all counties in the 50 US states and DC. Counties were designated as metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural. A zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to estimate county-level number of deaths conditional on contracting COVID-19. The study focused on COVID-19-related mortality from February 10, 2020, to June 12, 2020. FINDINGS After controlling for county-level characteristics, the rate of COVID-19 deaths was 70.3% (P < .001) for rural counties and 53.4% (P < .001) for micropolitan counties, both significantly lower than metropolitan counties during the study time period.

A part of the mother solution of the complex 1 and THF yielded single crystals in a triclinic space group and are found same from the crystals obtained from another mixture of the mother solution and ethyl acetate. Single crystal XRD studies have confirmed the mononuclear complex formation and absence of any interactions between the Mn(II) centers. A solution of the complex 1 in chloroform, conversely, yielded a crystallographically different complex [Mn(H2L)Cl2]?CHCl3 (1a) in monoclinic and is also characterised with single crystal XRD. The ligand is coordinated through thione sulfur atom to form a square pyramidal geometry around Mn(II) center in both the complexes. The molecular packing of the complexes is found influenced by the nature of solvent inclusion, and are stabilized by different non-covalent interactions in the lattice. The intermolecular interactions are quantified by Hirshfeld surface analyses, which reveal that HCl interactions has maximum contribution to the total Hirshfeld surface in the complex 1a. This is the first crystal structure study of a manganese(II) complex of a bisthiocarbohydrazone ligand. The molecular and electronic structures of the complexes are studied by DFT quantum chemical calculations. The band gap (Eg) of the complex 1 was estimated as 2.45 eV using Kubelka-Munk model and is in agreement with the electronic spectral calculations of the complex at TD-DFT level. Molecular docking studies of both the ligand and the complex reveal their greater propensity towards SARS-CoV-2 main protease compared to B-DNA dodecamer. Also, the binding potential of the ligand and the complex with SARS-CoV-2 main protease is found higher than that with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. ? 2021","output":"A novel manganese(II) bisthiocarbohydrazone complex: Crystal structures, Hirshfeld surface analysis, DFT and molecular docking study with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The microbiome residing in anaerobic digesters drives the anaerobic digestion (AD) process to convert various feedstocks to biogas as a renewable source of energy. This microbiome has been investigated in numerous studies in the last century. The early studies used cultivation-based methods and analysis to identify the four guilds (or functional groups) of microorganisms. Molecular biology techniques overcame the limitations of cultivation-based methods and allowed the identification of unculturable microorganisms, revealing the high diversity of microorganisms involved in AD. In the past decade, omics technologies, including metataxonomics, metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metametabolomics, have been or start to be used in comprehensive analysis and studies of biogas-producing microbiomes. In this chapter, we reviewed the utilities and limitations of these analysis methods, techniques, and technologies when they were used in studies of biogas-producing microbiomes, as well as the new information on diversity, composition, metabolism, and syntrophic interactions of biogas-producing microbiomes.

While poor public adherence to COVID-19 precautionary practices is evident, factors associated with it are not well studied. We aimed to assess the level of practice of COVID-19 precaution and associated factors. METHODS: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study conducted from February 1(st) to 15(th), 2021 at Saint Pauls Hospital Millennium Medical College, a tertiary teaching hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We used a structured questionnaire to conduct a face-to-face exit interview with clients visiting the hospital. Systematic random sampling was employed to recruit study participants. Binary and multivariable logistic regressions were implemented to examine factors associated with precautionary practices. Statistical significance was declared at p-value <0.05. The Crude odds ratio (COR) and Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) were reported with a 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: We analyzed data obtained from 262 participants. The mean age of participants was 36 (SD+12) years. The majority (207, 79%) of the study participants had a favorable attitude towards prevention and control measures of COVID-19. A little over half (116, 55.7%) of the respondents had a satisfactory level of practice of COVID-19 precautions. Living in an area with strict enforcement of COVID-19 precautionary measures [AOR: 2.25, 95% CI (1.22C4.15)], and having a favorable attitude of COVID-19 prevention [AOR: 4.88, 95% CI (2.08C11.68)] were significantly associated with satisfactory COVID-19 precautionary practices. CONCLUSIONS: The level of practice of COVID-19 precaution was unsatisfactory. Favorable attitude and stricter enforcement of COVID-19 preventive measures might have contributed more to adherence to precautionary practices. The findings highlight the need for a public health education strategy targeted at improving attitudes of the community on COVID-19 focusing on the effectiveness of preventive measures.","output":"COVID-19 precautionary practices and associated factors among clients visiting a tertiary hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the past decade, social media platforms have been recognized as an important tool in the dissemination of science among the research community and as an interface between scientists and the general public.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) from 2008 to 2020 in the SUS and to assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the number of procedures and death rate of CABG performed in 2020 through the database DATASUS. METHODS: This study is based on publicly available material obtained from DATASUS, the Brazilian Ministry of Health's data processing system, on numbers of surgical procedures and death rates. Only isolated CABG procedures were included in our study. We used the TabNet software from the DATASUS website to generate reports. RESULTS: We identified 281,760 CABG procedures performed from January 2008 to December 2020. The average number of procedures until the end of 2019 was of 22,104. During 2020 there was a 25% reduction CABG procedures, to 16,501. There was an increase in the national death rate caused by a statistical significant increase in death rates in Brazil's Southeast and Central-west regions. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic remains a global challenge for Brazil's health care system. During the year of 2020 there was a reduction in access to CABG related to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

Many viruses manipulate mitochondrial function, but the exact mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 virus effect remain unclear. We tested the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 virus may affect mitochondrial energy production and endogenous biosynthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). METHODS: Ten patients after COVID-19 and 15 healthy individuals were included in the study. Platelets isolated from peripheral blood were used as an accessible source of mitochondria. High-resolution respirometry for the evaluation of platelets mitochondrial function, and HPLC method for CoQ10 determination were used. Oxidative stress was evaluated by TBARS concentration in plasma. RESULTS: Platelet mitochondrial respiratory chain function, oxidative phosphorylation and endogenous CoQ10 level were reduced in the patients after COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We assume that a reduced concentration of endogenous CoQ10 may partially block electron transfer in the respiratory chain resulting in a reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the patients after COVID-19. Targeted mitochondrial therapy with CoQ10 supplementation and spa rehabilitation may improve mitochondrial health and accelerate the recovery of the patients after COVID-19.

The inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease is necessary for the blockage of the viral replication. Here, in this study, we have utilized a blind molecular docking approach to identify the possible inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, by screening a total of 33 molecules which includes natural products, anti-virals, anti-fungals, anti-nematodes and anti-protozoals. All the studied molecules could bind to the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 protease (PDB: 6Y84), out of which rutin (a natural compound) has the highest inhibitor efficiency among the 33 molecules studied, followed by ritonavir (control drug), emetine (anti-protozoal), hesperidin (a natural compound), lopinavir (control drug) and indinavir (anti-viral drug). All the molecules, studied out here could bind near the crucial catalytic residues, HIS41 and CYS145 of the main protease, and the molecules were surrounded by other active site residues like MET49, GLY143, HIS163, HIS164, GLU166, PRO168, and GLN189.

In this study, we built a SEL framework and a SEL measurement tool from the ground up that assess children's development of skills with communities of the Baka ethnic group in Cameroon. We conducted a participatory and interactive study to develop a SEL framework and measurement tool that is specific to the context of indigenous Baka communities in Cameroon. Using a quick ethnography methodology and an emic approach, a researcher team comprised mainly of Baka community members engaged parents, teachers, and others in iterative cycles of data collection, analysis, and reflection to develop the framework and assessments. The resulting Baka SEL framework includes skills and domains distinct from predominant SEL frameworks, underscoring the importance of drawing SEL priorities from communities themselves. Shared foundational constructs underlying the Baka SEL framework and other frameworks indicate possible universal human expectations for emotional and relational skills. Two SEL measurement tools were produced: a caregiver tool and a teacher tool, each using storytelling to elicit specific, honest, and detailed information about child behavior. These tools allow us to capture child behavior in the school and the home, and to collect data on all participating children within a specific time period. The described approach is a simple, practical, and culturally appropriate strategy for collaborating with rural communities to articulate their understanding of SEL.

As many patients are hospitalized during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and nurses are directly in contact with these patients; their preparedness enables them to respond to this situation more effectively and protects their health. Therefore, the present study aimed to design and validate a questionnaire to measure the nurses preparedness in response to COVID-19 in Iran in 2020. METHODS: This study was a mixed research aiming to develop and validate a psychometric research instrument in 2020. Based on the review of the literature regarding COVID-19 and other viral respiratory infections, the items were extracted, rewritten, and validated. In the quantitative phase, the validity of the questionnaire was evaluated in terms of face, content, and construct validity, and its reliability was evaluated based on internal consistency and stability (Cronbachs alpha and Intra-class Correlation Coefficient [ICC]). To fill out the questionnaire, the nurses were selected by random sampling. Data analysis was done by the SPSS software, version 23 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: The designed questionnaire included 9 dimensions and 50 items. The dimensions included (1) Incident Command System (ICS); (2) risk assessment and management; (3) information and communication management; (4) psychological approaches; (5) personal protective equipment; (6) prevention of contamination, isolation, and quarantine; (7) education and training; (8) patient management; and (9) features of the new coronavirus. The content and face validity of the questionnaire were approved by the specialists and experts of nursing and health in disasters and emergencies. The content validity ratio was > 0.7 for all items. The content validity index was also approved for all items. The Cronbachs alpha coefficient and ICC were respectively 0.71 and 0.72 for the total questionnaire. The total score was determined based on 5 ranges, including 50C89 (very low preparedness), 90C129 (low preparedness), 130C170 (medium-level preparedness), 171C210 (high preparedness), and 211C250 (very high preparedness). CONCLUSION: Nurses preparedness to respond to this pandemic requires multilateral measures. Measuring the nurses preparedness can clarify the challenges in hospital measures taken to respond to this crisis. Evaluating the nurses, determining the challenges and priorities, and finding solutions to resolve them can improve the nurses performance in providing health care services. Preparation of nurses during pandemics can reduce the damages to this group and maximize their efforts to protect the patients.

Its role as a tool of communication by the Public Health Departments in the U.S. remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media following of the Public Health Departments of the 50 States of the U.S. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were collected by visiting the Public Health Department web page for each social media platform. State-level demographics were collected from the U.S. Census Bureau. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention was utilized to collect information regarding the Governance of each State's Public Health Department. Health rankings were collected from \\"America's Health Rankings\\" 2019 Annual report from the United Health Foundation. The U.S. News and World Report Education Rankings were utilized to provide information regarding the public education of each State. EXPOSURE: Data were pulled on 3 separate dates: first on March 5th (baseline and pre-national emergency declaration (NED) for COVID-19), March 18th (week following NED), and March 25th (2 weeks after NED). In addition, a variable identifying the total change across platforms was also created. All data were collected at the State level. MAIN OUTCOME: Overall, the social media following of the state Public Health Departments was very low. There was a significant increase in the public interest in following the Public Health Departments during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: With the declaration of National Emergency, there was a 150% increase in overall public following of the State Public Health Departments in the U.S. The increase was most noted in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. The overall following in the pandemic \\"hotspots,\\" such as New York, California, and Florida, was significantly lower. Interesting correlations were noted between various demographic variables, health, and education ranking of the States and the social media following of their Health Departments.

Yet, because not all regions are affected equally, this research aims to understand whether the relative growth rate of the initial outbreak in early 2020 varied significantly between the US states and counties. STUDY DESIGN: Based on publicly available case data from across the USA, the initial outbreak is statistically modeled as an exponential curve. METHODS: Regional differences are visually compared using geo maps and spaghetti lines. In addition, they are statistically analyzed as an unconditional model (one-way random effects analysis of variance estimated with HLM 7.03); the bias between state- and county-level models is evidenced with distribution tests and Bland-Altman plots (using SPSS 26). RESULTS: At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days). But there is a low degree of reliability between state-wide and county-specific data reported (Intraclass correlation coefficient ICC = 0.169, P < 0.001), with a bias of 0.070 (standard deviation 0.062) as shown with a Bland-Altman plot. Hence, there is a significant variation in the outbreak between the US states and counties. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the need for policy makers to look at the pandemic from the smallest population subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented, and critical resources provided effectively. Further research is needed to understand the reasons for these regional differences.","output":"Variation in COVID-19 outbreaks at the US state and county levels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What we know What we need to know","output":"Respiratory infections and asthma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to play key roles in various biological processes.

Prior studies have built predictive models that relied on structured data from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict the risk of 30-day rehospitalization for patients with HF. Structured data mostly included simple vocabularies such as age, and ethnicity. Rarely do prior studies include clinical narrative data in a free-text format (i.e., unstructured data). No previous study has focused on using clinical narrative notes specifically for Medicare patients with HF in the acute-care setting. Aim To identify clinical notes for building a predictive model for risk of 30-day rehospitalization among Medicate patients with HF. Methods This study first used free-text discharge summary notes and nursing care plans collected from June 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019, for a randomly selected 500 Medicare patients with HF. Natural Language Processing (NLP): we iterated over standard text pre-processing steps, exploring the impact of n-gram length, term document-frequency, word stemming, and the added value of parts-of-speech. We chose two models: 1) the classification model called Bag-of Words (BOW), where each document is represented by a vector based on the pre-processed text, and 2) Document Embedding, where document terms are mapped to a dimension-reducing layer (length equals 300). The latter runs exceptionally fast (on the order of tens-of-seconds for 2,000 documents). Machine Learning (ML): the output of the NLP BOW and Document Embedding models were fed to six different conventional machine learning systems (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, k-nearest neighbor clustering, a three-layer neural network, and Na?ve Bayes). Results The mean age was 777.9, and the average of length of hospital stay was 4.9 days  4.8. The best BOW model we found using discharge summaries (n=387) produced an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC) of 0.71 and F1 score of 0.65. The best Document Embedding model yielded an AUC of 0.65 and an F1 score of 0.61. Using nursing care notes as the unit of analysis (n = 2,046), the NLM/ML performed far better. The best BOW model on care plans found an AUC of 0.85 and F1 score of 0.77. The best Document Embedding produced an AUC of 0.83 and an F1 score of 0.75. In all cases we held out 33% of the data set for validation, repeating a random draw 10 times and averaging the performance results. Conclusions We conclude that nursing care plans are a better predictor of 30-day rehospitalization risk than discharge summaries. Because nursing care plans are shorter than discharge summaries, they have the added advantage of faster processing. Since the faster Document Embedding model's performance is comparable to that of BOW, we suggest its use in future work in the area of 30-day rehospitalization risk in Medicare patients with HF.","output":"Predictive Model for Risk of 30-Day Rehospitalization Using a Natural Language Processing/Machine Learning Approach Among Medicare Patients with Heart Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in fomites which suggests the virus could be transmitted via inanimate objects. However, there is uncertainty about the mechanistic pathway for such transmissions. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from primary studies and systematic reviews assessing the role of fomites in transmission. Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on five criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We found 64 studies: 63 primary studies and one systematic review (n=35). The settings for primary studies were predominantly in hospitals (69.8%) including general wards, ICU and SARS-CoV-2 isolation wards. There were variations in the study designs including timing of sample collection, hygiene procedures, ventilation settings and cycle threshold. The overall quality of reporting was low to moderate. The frequency of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests across 51 studies (using RT-PCR) ranged from 0.5% to 75%. Cycle threshold values ranged from 20.8 to 44.1. Viral concentrations were reported in 17 studies; however, discrepancies in the methods for estimation prevented comparison. Eleven studies (17.5%) attempted viral culture, but none found a cytopathic effect. Results of the systematic review showed that healthcare settings were most frequently tested (25/35, 71.4%), but laboratories reported the highest frequency of contaminated surfaces (20.5%, 17/83). Conclusions: The majority of studies report identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA on inanimate surfaces; however, there is a lack of evidence demonstrating the recovery of viable virus. Lack of positive viral cultures suggests that the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through fomites is low. Heterogeneity in study designs and methodology prevents comparisons of findings across studies.

First, it was demonstrated that the co-cultured ileocytes and colonocytes were susceptible to an archival rotavirus strain RVA/pig-tc/BEL/RV277/1977/G1P[7] and different other rotavirus genotypes (fecal samples containing G5P[7], G5P[13], G9P[23], G4P[6]). Next, the TGEV Purdue strain infected both ileocytes and colonocytes whereas the Miller strain only infected ileocytes. Last, the PEDV CV777 Vero adapted and non-adapted (fecal suspension) strains could infect co-cultured ileocytes but not colonocytes. The infectivity of the CV777 Vero adapted strain was higher when the cells were cultured without fetal bovine serum and the CV777 fecal suspension only infected the ileocytes cultured without fetal bovine serum.

However, the possible effects of vaccination in a patient already experiencing the symptoms of a relapse represent an unusual scenario that has not been described. Patients and Methods This is a retrospective case series of four patients from three major tertiary referral centers that received mRNA COVID-19 vaccination after starting with symptoms of acute demyelination of the central nervous system due to non-recognized MS. A detailed description of each case, including MRI studies, serum light-neurofilament levels, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine profile, is provided. Case Description All patients presented exacerbation of ongoing symptoms after vaccination (range 14C112 days first dose). All patients presented MRI features suggestive of highly active MS and fulfilled McDonald 2017 criteria at the time of presentation. All patients presented high serum light-neurofilament levels and oligoclonal G bands restricted to the CSF. Higher levels of interleukin-6 in the CSF were present in the more severe cases.

It highlighted that for transmitting the virus, global temperature played an important role and a moderately cool environment was the most favourable state. The risk from the virus was reduced significantly for warm places and countries. Based on the temperature of March and April, various degrees of vulnerability were identified and countries were specified. The maximum reported case, as well as death, was noted when the temperature was in the range of around 275 K (2 C) to 290 K (17 C). Countries like the USA, UK, Italy and Spain belonged to this category. The vulnerability was moderate when the temperature was less than around 275 K (2 C), e.g. Russia, parts of Canada and a few Scandinavian countries. For temperature 300 K (27 C) and above, a significantly lesser degree of vulnerability was noted.

METHODS: Mice were randomized into two experiments. Experiment 1 with na?ve mice contained four groups (n = 6) while experiment 2 with LPS contains five groups (n = 6). Mice in experiments 1 and 2 were fed on CAFD (5%, 10%, and 20%) in na?ve (6 weeks) and LPS (250 g/kg, i.p.) in the 7th week, respectively. Cognitive performance was tested using Y-maze test (YMT) and novel object recognition test (NORT) in the na?ve and LPS mice. Brain samples were obtained for determination of oxido-inflammatory parameters and acetylcholinesterase activity. RESULTS: The CAFD significantly enhanced cognitive performance in the YMT and NORT in na?ve and LPS mice, as evidenced by increased % alternation and discrimination index, respectively. CAFD supplementation significantly reduced acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity while it attenuated depletion of reduced glutathione and catalase activities in brains of naive and LPS-treated animals.

First of all, it is necessary to offer an interpretive overview of Cicero's claim about the supremacy of welfare and salvation of the people and the Republic in the historical context of the Roman political and legal circumstances, in order to gain a complete insight into the reception of the claim, especially in legal doctrine and practice. The actuality of Cicero's claim in the form of constitutional provisions (Articles 16, 17 and 101 of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia) on states of emergency and crisis has particular relevance against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, but also for some new controversies, as demonstrated by the case study of recent decisions taken by the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia.","output":"Suvremena recepcija Ciceronove prirodnopravne postavke o vrhovnosti dobrobiti i spasa naroda u kontekstu izvanrednih stanja aktualiziranih pandemijom COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite available diagnostic tests and recent advances, diagnosis of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis (IPA) remains challenging. We performed a longitudinal case-control pilot study to identify host-specific, novel, and immune-relevant molecular candidates indicating IPA in patients post allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Supported by differential gene expression analysis of six relevant in vitro studies, we conducted RNA sequencing of three alloSCT patients categorized as probable IPA cases and their matched controls without Aspergillus infection (66 samples in total). We additionally performed immunoassay analysis for all patient samples to gain a multi-omics perspective. Profiling analysis suggested LGALS2, MMP1, IL-8, and caspase-3 as potential host molecular candidates indicating IPA in investigated alloSCT patients. MMP1, IL-8, and caspase-3 were evaluated further in alloSCT patients for their potential to differentiate possible IPA cases and patients suffering from COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) and appropriate control patients. Possible IPA cases showed differences in IL-8 and caspase-3 serum levels compared with matched controls. Furthermore, we observed significant differences in IL-8 and caspase-3 levels among CAPA patients compared with control patients. With our conceptual work, we demonstrate the potential value of considering the human immune response during Aspergillus infection to identify immune-relevant molecular candidates indicating IPA in alloSCT patients. These human host candidates together with already established fungal biomarkers might improve the accuracy of IPA diagnostic tools.","output":"Molecular Profiling Reveals Characteristic and Decisive Signatures in Patients after Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation Suffering from Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New viral infections, due to their rapid spread, lack of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, kill millions of people every year. The global pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in 2019C2021 has shown that new strains of viruses can widespread very quickly, causing disease and death, with significant socio-economic consequences. Therefore, the search for new methods of combating different pathogenic viruses is an urgent task, and strategies based on nanoparticles are of significant interest. This work demonstrates the antiviral adsorption (virucidal) efficacy of nanoparticles of porous silicon (PSi NPs) against various enveloped and non-enveloped pathogenic human viruses, such as Influenza A virus, Poliovirus, Human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus, and Hepatitis virus. PSi NPs sized 60 nm with the average pore diameter of 2 nm and specific surface area of 200 m(2)/g were obtained by ball-milling of electrochemically-etched microporous silicon films. After interaction with PSi NPs, a strong suppression of the infectious activity of the virus-contaminated fluid was observed, which was manifested in a decrease in the infectious titer of all studied types of viruses by approximately 10(4) times, and corresponded to an inactivation of 99.99% viruses in vitro. This sorption capacity of PSi NPs is possible due to their microporous structure and huge specific surface area, which ensures efficient capture of virions, as confirmed by ELISA analysis, dynamic light scattering measurements and transmission electron microscopy images. The results obtained indicate the great potential of using PSi NPs as universal viral sorbents and disinfectants for the detection and treatment of viral diseases.","output":"Antiviral adsorption activity of porous silicon nanoparticles against different pathogenic human viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Associations between community-level risk factors and COVID-19 incidence have been used to identify vulnerable subpopulations and target interventions, but the variability of these associations over time remains largely unknown. We evaluated variability in the associations between community-level predictors and COVID-19 case incidence in 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts from March to October 2020. METHODS: Using publicly available sociodemographic, occupational, environmental, and mobility datasets, we developed mixed-effect, adjusted Poisson regression models to depict associations between these variables and town-level COVID-19 case incidence data across five distinct time periods from March to October 2020. We examined town-level demographic variables, including population proportions by race, ethnicity, and age, as well as factors related to occupation, housing density, economic vulnerability, air pollution (PM(2.5)), and institutional facilities. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRR) associated with these predictors and compared these values across the multiple time periods to assess variability in the observed associations over time. RESULTS: Associations between key predictor variables and town-level incidence varied across the five time periods. We observed reductions over time in the association with percentage of Black residents (IRR = 1.12 [95%CI: 1.12C1.13]) in early spring, IRR = 1.01 [95%CI: 1.00C1.01] in early fall) and COVID-19 incidence. The association with number of long-term care facility beds per capita also decreased over time (IRR = 1.28 [95%CI: 1.26C1.31] in spring, IRR = 1.07 [95%CI: 1.05C1.09] in fall). Controlling for other factors, towns with higher percentages of essential workers experienced elevated incidences of COVID-19 throughout the pandemic (e.g., IRR = 1.30 [95%CI: 1.27C1.33] in spring, IRR = 1.20 [95%CI: 1.17C1.22] in fall). Towns with higher proportions of Latinx residents also had sustained elevated incidence over time (IRR = 1.19 [95%CI: 1.18C1.21] in spring, IRR = 1.14 [95%CI: 1.13C1.15] in fall). CONCLUSIONS: Town-level COVID-19 risk factors varied with time in this study. In Massachusetts, racial (but not ethnic) disparities in COVID-19 incidence may have decreased across the first 8 months of the pandemic, perhaps indicating greater success in risk mitigation in selected communities. Our approach can be used to evaluate effectiveness of public health interventions and target specific mitigation efforts on the community level.","output":"Time-varying associations between COVID-19 case incidence and community-level sociodemographic, occupational, environmental, and mobility risk factors in Massachusetts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally and is associated with a number of co-morbidities including sepsis and sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite thrombo-inflammation underlying these co-morbidities, its pathogenesis remains complicated and drug discovery programs aimed at reducing and resolving the detrimental effects remain a major therapeutic challenge. The objective of this study was to assess whether the anti-inflammatory pro-resolving protein Annexin A1 (AnxA1) was able to reduce inflammation-induced thrombosis and suppress platelet activation and thrombus formation in the cerebral microvasculature. Using two distinct models of pathological thrombo-inflammation (lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and sickle transgenic mice (STM)), thrombosis was induced in the murine brain using photoactivation (light/dye) coupled with intravital microscopy. The heightened inflammation-induced microvascular thrombosis present in these two distinct thrombo-inflammatory models was inhibited significantly by the administration of AnxA1 mimetic peptide AnxA1(Ac2-26) (an effect more pronounced in the SCD model vs. the endotoxin model) and mediated by the key resolution receptor, Fpr2/ALX. Furthermore, AnxA1(Ac2-26) treatment was able to hamper platelet aggregation by reducing platelet stimulation and aggregation (by moderating (IIb)(3) and P-selectin). These findings suggest that targeting the AnxA1/Fpr2/ALX pathway represents an attractive novel treatment strategy for resolving thrombo-inflammation, counteracting e.g., stroke in high-risk patient cohorts.","output":"Targeting AnxA1/Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 Pathway Affords Protection against Pathological Thrombo-Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving. Although it is primarily a respiratory illness, other manifestations, such as Guillain-Barr syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, and immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, have been described. We present a case of a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab with a marked biochemical improvement. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we present a Caucasian patient with COVID-19 who developed a marked elevation of inflammatory parameters with ferritin 36,023 g/L, but also elevated C-reactive protein 334 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase 1074 U/L, 1 week after admission to the intensive care unit. He met five of eight criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but he lacked the high fever and cytopenia seen in the majority of cases. He was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, and over the next days, a rapid decrease in ferritin and C-reactive protein levels was observed. However, his respiratory failure only improved gradually, and he was weaned off the respirator 11 days later. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may induce a hyperinflammatory clinical picture and in some cases develop into hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In our patients case, therapeutic interleukin-6 blockade abrogated signs of hyperinflammation but did not seem to improve pulmonary function. Measurement of ferritin and C-reactive protein, as well as quantification of interleukin-6 on indication, should be performed in patients with severe COVID-19. Specific treatment in such patients must also be contemplated, preferably in randomized controlled trials.","output":"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis in a patient with COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare providers (HCPs) working at point of care with patients have experienced health-, home- and work-related stressors from the COVID-19 pandemic.

This study was designed to explore how the pandemic influences HCP well-being, professional practice, inter-professional collaboration and the education and supports that would assist them during the pandemic recovery period. The article reports on the qualitative portion of a mixed-methods study, which included 56 HCPs who work in a large mental healthcare facility in Ontario. Witnessing the impact of the pandemic restrictions on patients was a significant source of stress for HCPs. HCPs recommended strategies, such as learning new therapeutic modalities and participating in the redesign of health services as key strategies to support them during the pandemic as these would promote patient well-being. Lastly, the pandemic provided opportunities for HCPs to deepen their understanding of other professions. This awareness was viewed as a strength that could support interprofessional collaboration and enhance health services redesign.

The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The co-primary endpoint was the incidence of the composite outcome of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE: cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, or hospitalization for cardiovascular causes). The mean follow-up duration was 6  2 months. The incidence of all-cause death was 4.7%. At multivariate analysis, age was the only independent predictor of mortality (aHR 1.08, 95% CI 1.01C1.16).

Thus, it is fundamental to elucidate the effects of insecticides on bees. This study investigated the damage caused by a sublethal concentration of thiamethoxam - TMX (0.0227 ng/L of feed) in the head and midgut of Africanized Apis mellifera, by analyzing the enzymatic biomarkers, oxidative stress, and occurrence of lipid peroxidation. The data showed that the insecticide increased acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), whereas carboxylesterase (CaE3) activity decreased in the heads. Our results indicate that the antioxidant enzymes were less active in the head because only glutathione peroxidase (GPX) showed alterations. In the midgut, there were no alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) responses and a decrease in the activity of CaE was observed. Otherwise, there was an increase in GPX, and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay also showed differences in the midgut. The results showed enzymes such as CaE3, GST, AChE, ALP, SOD, and GPX, as well as the TBARS assay, are useful biomarkers on bees.

Steam activation predominantly enhanced the development of microporosity, without significant pore widening. Prolonging the steam activation time exponentially increased the removal efficiency of Cu2+ at a constant adsorbent dose, as a result of an increase in the number of micropores and acidic-oxygenated groups. Moreover, for LWACF activated for 220 min at 800 C, the removal efficiency of Cu2+ increased from 55.2% to 99.4%, when the porous carbon fiber dose went from 0.1 to 0.5 g/L.

Six themes were common to both barriers and facilitators (clinical, cultural, evidence, design and quality assurance, financial and organisational) and two themes contained facilitators alone (patient factors and other (non-financial) resource use). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study demonstrate the complex motivations of stakeholders in the adoption of POCT. Most themes were common to both barriers and facilitators suggesting that good device design, stakeholder engagement and appropriate evidence provision can increase the likelihood of a POCT device adoption.

The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the relationship between cerebrovascular autoregulation and neurologic outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest. METHODS Children resuscitated from cardiac arrest had autoregulation monitoring during the first 72h after return of circulation with an index derived from near-infrared spectroscopy in a pilot study. The range of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) with optimal vasoreactivity (MAPOPT) was identified. The area under the curve (AUC) of the time spent with MAP below MAPOPT and MAP deviation below MAPOPT was calculated. Neurologic outcome measures included placement of a new tracheostomy or gastrostomy, death from a primary neurologic etiology (brain death or withdrawal of support for neurologic futility), and change in the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (PCPC). RESULTS Thirty-six children were monitored. Among children who did not require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), children who received a tracheostomy/gastrostomy had greater AUC during the second 24h after resuscitation than those who did not (P=0.04; n=19). Children without ECMO who died from a neurologic etiology had greater AUC during the first 48h than did those who lived or died from cardiovascular failure (P=0.04; n=19). AUC below MAPOPT was not associated with PCPC when children with or without ECMO were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS Deviation from the blood pressure with optimal autoregulatory vasoreactivity may predict poor neurologic outcomes after pediatric cardiac arrest.

The negative pressure inside the hood is generated by a fan-filter-unit (FFU) through which infectious aerosols from a patient are filtered. The outside area is kept clean which decreases the risk of nosocomial infections in hospital wards. We tried new applications of the hood. Methods The negative pressure hood was newly applied in an intensive care unit (ICU) as a place where a staff performs the practice of suctioning that generates much aerosol from the patient, as well as a waiting space for patients. Furthermore, the possibility that the hood can be converted to a positive pressure hood as a clean hood by switching the airflow direction of FFU was assessed. The cleaning efficacy of the inside of the hood was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. Results The hood, named Barrihood, was found to be competent to be used (I) for tracheal suctioning in ICU, (II) as a waiting space for a child in a nursery who suddenly showed symptoms of the disease and waiting to be picked-up by the guardian, and (III) as a waiting space in a special outpatient clinic in a hospital for COVID-19 suspected cases to prevent dissemination of airborne pathogens. The positive pressure hood was also competent in keeping clean air quality that meets the standard class 100 of NASA's bio-clean room category. Conclusions The proposed new applications will broaden the range of the hood's usage.

Four months after participating in a study assessing their social distancing behavior, 2,120 participants indicated whether they had contracted COVID-19. Importantly, the assessment of social distancing involved not only a self-report measure of how strictly participants had followed social distancing recommendations but also a series of virtual behavior measures of social distancing. These simulations presented participants with graphical depictions mirroring specific real-world scenarios, asking them to position themselves in relation to others in the scene.

Ethical clearance was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Witwatersrand, South Africa. RESULTS: Majority (90%) were of African ethnicity and symptomatic (53%). The commonest symptom, comorbidity and laboratory abnormality was cough (62%), hypertension (23%) and high LDH (20%), respectively. Thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia occurred among 9% and 15% of the women, respectively. Although association was not significant, symptoms were more common among comorbid, HIV positive and women with abnormal results. Commonest complications were preterm labor (8%) and macerated stillbirths (6%). Six (6%) mothers died. CONCLUSION AND GLOBAL HEALTH IMPLICATIONS: COVID positive pregnant South African women were commonly symptomatic but incidence of adverse fetal outcomes was low. High rate of preterm labor, macerated stillbirths and maternal deaths was a concern. This study has several strengths. It included all COVID positive women over a 6 months period at all level of healthcare facilities such as clinics, community health centers/midwifery units, and district, regional and tertiary hospitals, conducted in an African country. Previous studies included mainly hospitals raising a high probability of including mainly severely ill women. The study might benefit the health care workers in other African countries.","output":"Clinical Features and Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection among Pregnant Women in South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 introduced unexpected critical structural changes into a rather conservative sector of drilling services In a situation where the confirmed volumes of work are unpredictably transferred, postponed, halted, or re-negotiated, the leaders of high-tech service companies providing technical and technological support for oil and gas drilling, had to make a number of strong-willed decisions in order to continue to support the telemetry equipment fleet and retain a team of engineers by staying in the market Of course, there are those who are not ready for this In this article, we will look at the technical side of this reboot through a careful optimization of resources used by drilling service companies ? 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG","output":"New Reality of Directional Drilling Services During Production Decline and Coronavirus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A high proportion of dogs suffer from respiratory disease when they are placed in kennels for vacation or re-homing. The role of Mycoplasma cynos as an initiating agent in canine infectious respiratory disease was investigated by examining the serological response of dogs to this organism at the time of entry into a large re-homing kennel. Forty-two paired serum samples from dogs (21-day interval) were examined for antibody to M. cynos using Western blotting. The development of antibody in the serum was related to clinical disease recorded over the same period. Sixty seven per cent of the dogs showed a two-fold or greater rise in antibody to M. cynos during the first 3 weeks in the kennel. Reactivity with a 45 kDa antigen was dominant. Of those showing a positive serological reaction, 80% had recorded clinical respiratory disease while 20% remained healthy. The findings of this study show that an antibody response to M. cynos is common in dogs entering the re-homing kennel and is positively related to the development of clinical respiratory disease.","output":"Serological evidence of Mycoplasma cynos infection in canine infectious respiratory disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human memory consists of sensory memory (SM), short-term memory (STM), and long-term memory (LTM). SM enables a large capacity, but decays rapidly. STM has limited capacity, but lasts longer. The traditional view of these memory systems resembles a leaky hourglass, the large top and bottom portions representing the large capacities of SM and LTM, whereas the narrow portion in the middle represents the limited capacity of STM. The \\"leak\\" in the top part of the hourglass depicts the rapid decay of the contents of SM. However, recently, it was shown that major bottlenecks for motion processing exist prior to STM, and the \\"leaky hourglass\\" model was replaced by a \\"leaky flask\\" model with a narrower top part to capture bottlenecks prior to STM. The leaky flask model was based on data from one study, and the first goal of the current paper was to test if the leaky flask model would generalize by using a different set of data. The second goal of the paper was to explore various block diagram models for memory systems and determine the one best supported by the data. We expressed these block diagram models in terms of statistical mixture models and, by using the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), found that a model with four components, viz., SM, attention, STM, and guessing, provided the best fit to our data. In summary, we generalized previous findings about early qualitative and quantitative bottlenecks, as expressed in the leaky flask model and showed that a four-process model can provide a good explanation for how visual information is processed and stored in memory.","output":"Capacity and Allocation across Sensory and Short-Term Memories"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - Coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused upheaval in university teaching practices.

Despite the valuable contribution of I-IONM to the thyroidectomy, it still has limitations regarding the recording electrodes and stimulation probe. New approaches for overcoming the limitations of I-IONM and developing the method are taking attention. Most of the technical issues of IONM with surface electrode-based ETT are related with inadequate contact of electrodes to the vocal cords. Nowadays, efficiency of various recording electrodes is under investigation. Recording electrodes such as needle electrodes applied to thyroarytenoid or posterior cricoarytenoid muscle (PCA), surface electrodes applied to the PCA, and needle or adhesive electrodes applied to the tracheal cartilage or skin, can make safe recordings similar to the ETT electrodes. Despite their invasiveness, needle electrodes record higher electromyography (EMG) amplitudes than tube electrodes do. Adhesive surface electrodes make safe EMG recordings, although amplitudes of these electrodes are usually lower than those of the tube electrodes. These different types of electrodes are less affected by tracheal manipulations and amplitude changes are lower compared to the tube electrodes. During C-IONM, an additional stimulation probe is applied to the vagus nerve after dissecting the nerve circumferentially. Recently, without applying a probe, a new continuous monitorization method called laryngeal adductor reflex CIONM (LAR-CIONM) using sensorial, central, and motor components of LAR arch which is an automatic, primitive brainstem reflex protecting the tracheoesophageal tree from foreign body aspiration, has been implemented. Afferent track of LAR communicates laryngeal mucosa to the brainstem by internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve and efferent track reaches larynx through recurrent laryngeal nerve. Total outcome of LAR activation is the closure of laryngeal entry by bilateral vocal cord adduction. In LAR-CIONM, a stimulus is given by an electrode from one side of surface electrode-based ETT and amplitude response of the LAR at the vocal cord is followed on the operation side. Recently, it has been reported that real-time EMG response can be obtained with stimulation probe cables applied to dissectors or energy devices during the dissection through I-IONM.","output":"Recent Developments of Intraoperative Neuromonitoring in Thyroidectomy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Versatile liquid manipulating surfaces combining patternable and controllable wettability have recently motivated considerable attention owing to their significant advantages in droplet-solid impacting behaviors, microdroplet self-removal, and liquid-liquid interface reaction applications.

In this paper, a strategy for the fabrication of liquid manipulating surfaces with patternable and controllable wettability on Polyimide (PI) film based on femtosecond laser thermal accumulation engineering is proposed. Because of its controllable micro-/nanostructures and chemical composition through adjusting the local thermal accumulation, the wettability of PI film can be tuned from superhydrophilicity (~ 3.6) to superhydrophobicity (~ 151.6). Furthermore, three diverse surfaces with patternable and heterogeneous wettability were constructed and various applications were successfully realized, including water transport, droplet arrays, and liquid wells. This work may provide a facile strategy for achieving patternable and controllable wettability efficiently and developing multifunctional liquid steering surfaces.","output":"Femtosecond Laser Thermal Accumulation-Triggered Micro-/Nanostructures with Patternable and Controllable Wettability Towards Liquid Manipulating."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To effectively control the spread of COVID-19, it is essential that all jurisdictions have the capacity to rapidly contact trace all close contacts of each and every case.

Since COVID-19 is a novel disease, autopsy is crucial to understand its pathophysiology. This study was conducted to analyze the microscopic and macroscopic findings of various organs in COVID-19 and to associate those findings with clinical observations and laboratory findings. Methods: Conventional invasive autopsies were performed on 33 patients with COVID-19 from September 7, 2020 to December 23, 2020. All the organs were removed by routine dissection techniques and preserved in 10 per cent formalin. The tissues were processed and stained according to standard practices using haematoxylin-eosin (H & E) and periodic acid-schiff (PAS) stain. Results: The study included 28 males and 5 females with a median age of 61 yr (range 30-90 yr). Massive pulmonary oedema and thrombi in the lungs were the characteristic features macroscopically. On microscopic examination, diffuse alveolar damage in the exudative/proliferative phase was found in 29 (87.88%) cases. Among the other notable microscopic findings were bronchopneumonia and lung abscesses due to secondary bacterial infection (n=17, 51.52%), acute tubular injury (n=21, 63.64%) and thrombi in the lungs, heart, and kidneys. Interpretation & conclusions: COVID-19 primarily affected the respiratory and the renal systems in the vast majority of severely affected patients in our study. We also found signs of hypercoagulability, as evidenced by widespread thrombi in multiple organs, along with a raised d-dimer level and a hyperinflammatory state manifested by elevated inflammatory markers.

Our study aimed to investigate the immediate psychological consequences of the pandemic on Italian parents and children focusing on internalizing and post-traumatic symptoms. We also wanted to explore the impact of possible risk and resilience factors, e.g., lifestyle and behaviors, emotional and cognitive beliefs, on parents and childrens reaction to the emergency distress. An online survey was administered during the countrys nationwide lockdown to 721 Italian parents of at least one child aged between 6 and 18 years. The respondent completed the survey for himself/herself and his/her child. The survey included socio-demographic items and validated questionnaires on parents post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety levels, and on childrens internalizing problems. Parents were asked to fill the questionnaires twice: once referring to the current emergency condition and once recalling how they and their child felt a few months before Covid-19 outbreak. Multiple regression analyses showed that specific demographic characteristics (i.e., sex and age) and psychological factors of children and parents, such as fear of contagion and the opportunity to think about possible secondary positive effects of the pandemic, had a predictive value on the presence of internalizing symptoms of both parents and children. Moreover, parents behaviors during the lockdown period (i.e., employment status and sport practiced) were significantly related to their own internalizing symptoms; these symptoms, in turn, had a strong and positive predictive value on childrens internalizing problems. Besides, analyses of variance showed that internalizing symptoms of parents and children were significantly higher during the Covid-19 pandemic than before it started. In addition to showing a direct effect of the pandemic on the psychological health of parents and children, the present results also give a series of important information on how parents perceive, and therefore influence, their children in this period of emergency. Our findings thus highlight the urgent need to provide parents with adequate support to take care of their own psychological wellbeing and to help their children coping with the direct and indirect effects of the pandemic.","output":"Stuck Outside and Inside: An Exploratory Study on the Effects of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Italian Parents and Childrens Internalizing Symptoms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The performance of inflammatory markers in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by different pathogens has not been fully studied.

Complete leukocyte counts and the concentration of HBP and PCT were measured, and the differences were compared with nonparametric tests. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the significant differences in the sensitivity and specificity of the indicators. The leukocyte and neutrophils counts and the concentrations of HBP and PCT in the viral group were significantly lower than those in the other two groups (p < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the concentration of HBP and PCT as well as leukocyte and neutrophils counts were 0.927, 0.892, 0.832 and 0.806 for distinguishing bacterial from viral infection, respectively. The best cut-off value was 20.05 ng/mL for HBP, with a sensitivity of 0.861 and specificity of 0.939.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review explored how NLP methods have been used in research to better understand bipolar disorder and identify opportunities for further use of these methods. METHODS: A systematic, computerized search of index and free-text terms related to bipolar disorder and NLP was conducted using 5 databases and 1 anthology: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and the ACL Anthology. RESULTS: Of 507 identified studies, a total of 35 (6.9%) studies met the inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the data, and the studies were grouped into four objectives: prediction and classification (n=25), characterization of the language of bipolar disorder (n=13), use of EHRs to measure health outcomes (n=3), and use of EHRs for phenotyping (n=2).

Animals grow slowly under conditions of oxidative stress. In addition, long-term oxidative stress can impair immune function, as well as accelerate aging and death. This study aimed to elucidate the pathogenesis of REV from the perspective of changes in oxidative-antioxidative function following REV infection. METHODS: A total of 80 one-day-old specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens were randomly divided into a control group (Group C) and an REV-infected group (Group I). The chickens in Group I received intraperitoneal injections of REV with 10(4.62)/0.1 mL TCID(50).

RESULTS: In chickens infected with REV, the levels of H(2)O(2) and MDA in the thymus increased, the levels of TAC, SOD, CAT, and GPx1 decreased, and there was a reduction in CAT and Gpx1 mRNA expression compared with the control group. The thymus index was also significantly reduced. Morphological analysis showed that REV infection caused an increase in the thymic reticular endothelial cells, inflammatory cell infiltration, mitochondrial swelling, and nuclear damage.

Materials & Methods: We performed a retrospective single-centre cohort study of patients undergoing robotic surgery in the initial 2-months period of COVID-19 focusing on safety. Patients COVID-19 infection status was assessed by telephone follow-up at a minimum of 14 days (median: 48) after robotic surgery. All healthcare workers involved in robotic surgery including console surgeons, bedside surgeons, anesthetists, scrub nurses and anesthesia nurses were investigated for presence of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs at three different time points during the study period from 12 March to 11 May 2020. Results: After 61 robotic surgeries, 1 patient (1.6%) had a COVID-19 infection. 60 healthcare workers (4 console surgeons, 8 bedside surgeons, 21 anesthetists, 13 scrub nurses and 14 anesthesia nurses) that were cumulatively exposed to 1,187 hours of robotic surgery had no COVID-19 infection.

Statins are foundational lipid-lowering therapeutics for cardiovascular disease and also possess beneficial immune-modulating properties. Because of these immune-modulating properties, some have suggested their use in COVID-19. We sought to investigate the association between statin use and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Five thousand three hundred seventy-five COVID-19 patients admitted to Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York between February 27, 2020, and December 3, 2020, were included in this analysis. Statin use was classified as either non-user, low-to-moderate-intensity user, or high-intensity user. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate in-hospital mortality rate. Considered covariates were age, sex, race, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Compared to non-statin users, both low-to-moderate-intensity (adjusted hazard ratio; aHR 0.62, 95% confidential intervals; CI 0.51C0.76) and high-intensity statin users (aHR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43C0.65) had a reduced risk of death. Subgroup analysis of 723 coronary artery disease patients showed decreased mortality among high-intensity statin users compared to non-users (aHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36C0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a reduced in-hospital mortality. The protective effect of statin was greater in those with coronary artery disease. These data support continued use of statin therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are needed to prospectively determine if statin use is effective in lowering the mortality in COVID-19 and other viral infections.

DESIGN: Rapid review and narrative synthesis. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase and Google, as well as the websites of relevant national health departments, were searched from 1 January 2020 to 24 April 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Documents included must be issued by a national health authority, must be specific to COVID-19 care, directed at healthcare workers or managers, and must refer to the role of primary care in the COVID-19 response. RESULTS: We identified 17 documents from 14 countries. An adapted framework on primary care challenges and responses to pandemic influenza framed our analysis. Guidelines generally reported on COVID-19 service delivery and mostly made specific recommendations for ensuring continued delivery of essential primary care services through telehealth or other virtual care modalities. Few offered guidance to support surveillance as a public health function. All offered guidance on implementing outbreak control measures, largely through flexible and coordinated organisational models with partners from various sectors. There was a lack of guidance to support supply chain management and practice resilience in primary care, and lack of personal protective equipment represents a serious threat to the provision of quality care during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Current national primary care guidelines for COVID-19 provide guidance on infection control and minimising the risk of spread in primary care practices, while supporting the use of new technology and coordinated partnerships. However, to ensure primary care practice resilience and quality of care are upheld, guidelines must offer recommendations on supply chain management and operational continuity, supported by adequate resources.","output":"National primary care responses to COVID-19: a rapid review of the literature"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic is a global crisis severely impacting many people across the world.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The aim of this prospective/retrospective study was to characterize the long-term consequences of this infection from a sex-perspective. For this purpose, we enrolled 223 patients (89 F and 134 M) who experienced a SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the acute phase of the illness, females reported more frequently than males: weakness, dysgeusia, anosmia, thoracic pain, palpitations, diarrhoea, and myalgia without significant differences in breathlessness, cough, and sleep disturbance. After a mean follow-up time of 5 months after the acute phase, females were significantly more likely than males to report weakness, thoracic pain, palpitations, and sleep disturbance but not myalgia and cough. At the multivariate logistic regression, women were statistically significantly likely to experience persistent symptoms such as dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain, and palpitations. On the contrary, myalgia, cough and sleep disturbance were not influenced by sex. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that females were more symptomatic than males not only in the acute phase but also at follow-up. Sex was found to be an important determinant of Long-COVID syndrome because it is a significant predictor of persistent symptoms in females, such as dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain, and palpitations.

Indeed, from analysis of closely related lineages, in SARS-CoV-2, the Ka/Ks ratio was previously estimated as 1.008, suggesting no within-host selection. By contrast, we find a higher number of observed SNPs at 4-fold degenerate sites than elsewhere and, allowing for the viruss complex mutational and compositional biases, estimate that the mutation rate is at least 49C67% higher than would be estimated based on the rate of appearance of variants in sampled genomes. Given the high Ka/Ks one might assume that the majority of such intrahost selection is the purging of nonsense mutations. However, we estimate that selection against nonsense mutations accounts for only 10% of all the missing mutations. Instead, classical protein-level selective filters (against chemically disparate amino acids and those predicted to disrupt protein functionality) account for many missing mutations. It is less obvious why for an intracellular parasite, amino acid cost parameters, notably amino acid decay rate, is also significant. Perhaps most surprisingly, we also find evidence for real-time selection against synonymous mutations that move codon usage away from that of humans. We conclude that there is common intrahost selection on SARS-CoV-2 that acts on nonsense, missense, and possibly synonymous mutations.

It was striking that many of the patients affected had only mild symptoms. In this case study it was investigated to what extent SARS-CoV?2 can cause lung involvement even with minor symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study five outpatient radiological centers and two inpatient hospitals in North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Wrttemberg in Germany were involved. The retrospective analysis included outpatients with radiologically detected viral pneumonia, who were examined in March or April 2020. The clinical symptoms were divided into severity levels 1C5 using a simplified clinical score. The lung images were evaluated with respect to features specific for COVID-19 . The presence of a SARS-CoV?2 infection was verified using PCR, antibody testing and/or typical computed tomography (CT) morphology. RESULTS: A total of 50 patients were included, all of whom had radiological signs of viral pneumonia. The majority had no or only few non-specific symptoms (26/50). This was followed by mild symptoms of a flu-like infection (17/50). Severe forms were rare in outpatients (7/50).

Bedeutet das aber, dass sie lediglich eine Ansammlung kettenartig aneinandergefgter Gene sind? Aus allen cytologischen Beobachtungen schlie?en wir, dass die Chromosomen, und damit die Gene, in Mitose und Meiose gleichmig auf die Tochterzellen verteilt werden. Dazu werden die Centromerenbereiche der Chromosomen benutzt, die als Ansatzpunkte fr die Mikrotubuli des Spindelapparates dienen. So werden die Chromosomen oder deren Untereinheiten, die Chromatiden, bei der Zellteilung auf die Tochterzellen aufgeteilt. Auch bei der DNA-Replikation haben Chromosomen eine wichtige Aufgabe zu erfllen. Der normale Replikationsmechanismus linearer DNA-Molekle fhrt in jedem Replikationszyklus zu einer Verkrzung der DNADoppelhelix von den Enden her, da die RNA-Primer am Ende der DNA zwar entfernt, aber nicht durch DNASequenzen ersetzt werden k?nnen. Au?erdem muss eine spezielle Struktur sicherstellen, dass die freien Enden der DNA im Chromosom nicht von Exonukleasen abgebaut werden oder durch Reparaturenzyme mit den freien Enden der DNA eines anderen Chromosoms verschmelzen. Das wird durch besondere terminale Dom?nen, die Telomere, gew?hrleistet. Bei der weiteren Untersuchung der molekularen Struktur des Genoms machte man die unerwartete Entdeckung, dass das eukaryotische Genom zum grten Teil nicht aus Protein-kodierenden DNA-Sequenzen besteht. Ein gro?er Teil der DNA-Sequenzen geh?rt zur repetitiven DNA, die, wie der Name schon sagt, in vielen, teils identischen, teils voneinander strukturell abweichenden, aber ?hnlichen Kopien im Genom vorhanden ist. Ein Teil dieser DNA, vor allem hochrepetitive Sequenzen, ist in heterochromatischen Chromosomenabschnitten lokalisiert. Andere sind in Einzelkopien ber das gesamte Genom verstreut. Die erstaunlich gro?en Unterschiede im DNA-Gehalt der Genome h?herer Organismen mssen haupts?chlich Unterschieden in der Menge repetitiver DNA zugeschrieben werden. Sie beruhen also nicht auf wesentlichen Unterschieden in der Zahl Protein-kodierender Gene. Chromosomen sind dynamische Strukturen, die strukturell und funktionell eng mit dem Stoffwechsel und dem Differenzierungsgrad der jeweiligen Zelle verbunden sind. Ihre Bedeutung geht weit ber das hinaus, was man von einem reinen ?Gen-Depot erwarten wrde. So hat die unterschiedliche Konstitution der Geschlechtschromosomen in den beiden Geschlechtern zur Folge, dass die Anzahl der Kopien der auf diesen Chromosomen gelegenen Gene im m?nnlichen und weiblichen Geschlecht unterschiedlich ist. Solche quantitativ unbalancierten Genkonstitutionen werden in der Regel vom Organismus nicht toleriert. Verschiedene Organismengruppen haben daher spezifische Mechanismen entwickelt, um fr einen funktionellen Ausgleich (Dosiskompensation) der verschiedenen Genkopienzahlen zu sorgen. In S?ugetieren wird eines der beiden X-Chromosomen des weiblichen Geschlechts inaktiviert, so dass ein der hemizygoten X-Chromosomenkonstitution des m?nnlichen Geschlechts funktionell gleichwertiger Zustand zustande kommt. In Drosophila erfolgt der Ausgleich in der Genaktivit?t durch erh?hte Aktivit?t der X-chromosomalen Gene im M?nnchen. Die Inaktivierung des S?uger-X-Chromosoms l?sst verschiedene wesentliche biologische Mechanismen erkennen. Abgesehen von der Feststellung, dass ganze Chromosomen innerhalb eines Genoms gerichtet funktionell inaktiviert oder hyperaktiviert werden k?nnen, ist es von grundlegender Bedeutung, dass eine einmal erfolgte Inaktivierung innerhalb eines Organismus im Allgemeinen erhalten bleibt. Das Chromosom muss mithin eine Information aufnehmen, die dafr sorgt, dass es in allen folgenden Zellgenerationen inaktiv bleibt. Man bezeichnet eine solche Information als chromosomale Pr?gung (Imprinting). Eine weitere Konsequenz der X-Chromosomeninaktivierung ist, dass verschiedene Zellen von S?ugerweibchen eine unterschiedliche Konstitution hinsichtlich der aktiven X-chromosomalen Gene besitzen k?nnen. S?ugerweibchen sind daher funktionelle Mosaike in Bezug auf die Auspr?gung geschlechtsgebundener Gene. Wir wissen, dass die chromosomale DNA in einer ersten Verpackungsstufe in der Form von kompakten Nukleosomen organisiert wird. Sie windet sich hierzu zweimal um einen Komplex aus Histonproteinen. Eine Kette derartiger DNA-Histonpartikel formt eine Chromatinfibrille von 10 nm Durchmesser. Diese Fibrille wird jedoch zus?tzlich in Fibrillen h?herer Ordnung organisiert. Aktives und inaktives Chromatin unterscheiden sich dabei in dem Ausma? der Kondensation; Insulator-Elemente sind an der Ausbildung offener Chromatinstrukturen und an der Anheftung der Chromatiden an der Kernmembran beteiligt. Die Kompartimentierung des Zellkerns in chromosomale Territorien und Interchromatindom?nen erlaubt die r?umliche Trennung verschiedener funktioneller Abl?ufe im Zellkern, wie Transkription und Reifung der RNA.","output":"Molekulare Struktur eukaryotischer Chromosomen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a hyperinflammatory response observed in children several weeks to months after acute infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). On review of all published cases of thromboembolism (TE) as a complication of MIS-C, 33 cases of TE were found with incidence ranging from 1.4 to 6.5%. TE occurred mostly in children aged 12 years and above. One-third of the cases were cerebral infarcts and the remaining cases included intracardiac and radial arterial thromboses, upper and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and splenic infarcts. Five were asymptomatic cases and 3/33 (9%) patients (all three with cerebral infarcts) died. To conclude, TE appears to be a significant complication of MIS-C caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, associated with morbidity and/or mortality. Patients 12 years are affected more often, and TE occurs despite thromboprophylaxis in some patients. Thromboprophylaxis should be considered in all cases after reviewing the concomitant bleeding risk. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of standard-dose thromboprophylaxis and to explore whether higher-dose thromboprophylaxis is required in certain high-risk patients with MIS-C.

Since the initial identification of MERS, few studies have investigated the role of comorbidities that could potentially lead to mortality in cases of the infectious disease. This study aimed to examine the association between comorbidities and MERS mortality in KSA. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study. We retrieved the data published by the World Health Organization (WHO) between January 2017 and November 2019, and analysed the association between comorbidities and mortality. RESULTS: We found 572 MERS-CoV cases reported by WHO in KSA during the defined period. Of these, 387 (68%) had a history of chronic illness. The overall mortality rate was found to be 25%. Diabetes mellitus was the most prevalent comorbiditythe mortality rate in the diabetics was 32% as opposed to 12% in the non-diabetics (p-value <0.01). Hypertension was second, with a mortality rate of 35%, as opposed to 15% in the non-hypertensive patients (p-value <0.001). The mortality rate in cases with cardiovascular disease was 39% as opposed to 21% in those without cardiovascular disease (p-value <0.05).

Most research regarding CAVD is based on experiments using two-dimensional (2D) cell culture or artificially created three-dimensional (3D) environments of valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Because the valvular ECM has a powerful influence in regulating pathological events, we developed an in vitro AV tissue culture model, which is more closely able to mimic natural conditions to study cellular responses underlying CAVD. AV leaflets, isolated from the hearts of 6-8-month-old sheep, were fixed with needles on silicon rubber rings to achieve passive tension and treated in vitro under pro-degenerative and pro-calcifying conditions. The degeneration of AV leaflets progressed over time, commencing with the first visible calcified domains after 14 d and winding up with the distinct formation of calcium nodules, heightened stiffness, and clear disruption of the ECM after 56 d. Both the expression of pro-degenerative genes and the myofibroblastic differentiation of VICs were altered in AV leaflets compared to that in VIC cultures. In this study, we have established an easily applicable, reproducible, and cost-effective in vitro AV tissue culture model to study pathological mechanisms underlying CAVD.

The reference case was the Brazilian context for using and consuming Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Two types of face masks were defined for analysis: handmade reusable face masks made with cotton fabric and single-use face masks made with nonwoven fabric. To achieve this goal, the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) steps following ISO 14040 and the Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) by the Ellen Macarthur Foundation were applied. The results obtained show that the reuse of face masks has a better environmental performance over five uses. The comparative analysis between the ReCiPe 2016 and IMPACT World+ methods shows that the impact categories linked to human health are the most important in terms of environmental impact. Nevertheless, the trend toward improved environmental performance for the handmade reusable face mask has continued. The possibility of recycling shows that the reintegration of material after the use of the product could improve the environmental performance of both face masks. Finally, the reuse increases the circularity of cotton fabric masks compared to nonwoven fabric masks according to MCI. In this way, it is possible to observe that the handmade reusable face mask has a better environmental performance and a higher circularity than the single-use face mask. Thus, the results of the environmental performance and circularity of the face masks may support the decision of government agents to guide the public in the use of face masks, not only contributing to the protection of health against Covid-19, but also reducing the environmental impact of PPE. Furthermore, the methodological steps adopted in the study gives greater reliability in the conclusions obtained.","output":"Life cycle assessment and circularity evaluation of the non-medical masks in the Covid-19 pandemic: a Brazilian case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infoveillance is an application from Infodemiology field with the aim to monitor public health and create public policies.

This immune evasion strategy is directed in part by tandem repeat protein (TRP) effectors. Specifically, the TRP120 effector activates and regulates Notch signaling through interactions with the Notch receptor and the negative regulator, F-Box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7). However, the specific molecular interactions and motifs required for E. chaffeensis TRP120-Notch receptor interaction and activation have not been defined. To investigate the molecular basis of TRP120 Notch activation, we compared TRP120 with endogenous canonical/non-canonical Notch ligands and identified a short region of sequence homology within the tandem repeat (TR) domain. TRP120 was predicted to share biological function with Notch ligands, and a function-associated sequence in the TR domain was identified. To investigate TRP120-Notch receptor interactions, colocalization between TRP120 and endogenous Notch-1 was observed. Moreover, direct interactions between full length TRP120, the TRP120 TR domain containing the putative Notch ligand sequence, and the Notch receptor LBR were demonstrated. To molecularly define the TRP120 Notch activation motif, peptide mapping was used to identify an 11-amino acid short linear motif (SLiM) located within the TRP120 TR that activated Notch signaling and downstream gene expression. Peptide mutants of the Notch SLiM or anti-Notch SLiM antibody reduced or eliminated Notch activation and NICD nuclear translocation. This investigation reveals a novel molecularly defined pathogen encoded Notch SLiM mimetic that activates Notch signaling consistent with endogenous ligands. Importance E. chaffeensis infects and replicates in mononuclear phagocytes, but how it evades innate immune defenses of this indispensable primary innate immune cell is not well understood. This investigation reveals the molecular details of a ligand mimicry cellular reprogramming strategy that involves a short linear motif (SLiM) which enables E. chaffeensis to exploit host cell signaling to establish and maintain infection. E. chaffeensis TRP120 is a moonlighting effector that has been associated with cellular activation and other functions including ubiquitin ligase activity. Herein, we identify and demonstrate that a SLiM present within each tandem repeat of TRP120 activates Notch signaling. Notch is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway responsible for many cell functions including cell fate, development, and innate immunity. The proposed study is significant because it reveals the first molecularly defined pathogen encoded SLiM that appears to have evolved de novo to mimic endogenous Notch ligands. Understanding Notch activation during E. chaffeensis infection provides a model in which to study pathogen exploitation of signaling pathways and will be useful in developing molecularly-targeted countermeasures for inhibiting infection by a multitude of disease-causing pathogens that exploit cell signaling through molecular mimicry. Author Summary E. chaffeensis is a small, obligately intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium that has evolved cellular reprogramming strategies to subvert innate defenses of the mononuclear phagocyte. Ehrlichial TRP effectors interface with the host cell and are involved in pathogen-host interplay that facilitates exploitation and manipulation of cellular signaling pathways; however, the molecular interactions and functional outcomes are not well understood. This study provides molecular insight into a eukaryotic mimicry strategy whereby secreted effectors of obligately intracellular pathogens activate the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway through a short linear motif ligand mimetic to promote intracellular infection and survival.","output":"Ehrlichia SLiM ligand mimetic activates Notch signaling in human monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scientific community has reported several cases of microbes that exhibit elevated rates of antibiotic resistance in different regions of the planet.

No specific methods have been identified to predict, detect and quantify the microvascular alterations during COVID-19. Our aim was to assess microvasculature through nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed NVC in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Elementary alterations were reported for each finger according to a semi-quantitative score. Capillary density, number of enlarged and giant capillaries, number of micro-hemorrhages and micro-thrombosis (NEMO score) were registered. RESULTS: We enrolled 82 patients (mean age 58.8  13.2 years, male 68.3%) of whom 28 during the hospitalization and 54 after recovery and hospital discharge. At NVC examination we found abnormalities classifiable as non-specific pattern in 53 patients (64.6%). Common abnormalities were pericapillary edema (80.5%), enlarged capillaries (61.0%), sludge flow (53.7%), meandering capillaries and reduced capillary density (50.0%). No pictures suggestive of scleroderma pattern have been observed. Acute COVID-19 patients, compared to recovered patients, showed a higher prevalence of hemosiderin deposits as a result of micro-hemorrhages (P = .027) and micro-thrombosis (P < .016), sludge flow (P = .001), and pericapillary edema (P < .001), while recovered patients showed a higher prevalence of enlarged capillaries (P < .001), loss of capillaries (P = .002), meandering capillaries (P < .001), and empty dermal papillae (P = .006). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients present microvascular abnormalities at NVC.

Exclusions were placement of a bare-metal stent within 6 weeks, placement of a drug-eluting stent within 1 year, or receipt of nonstudy aspirin within 72 hours before surgery. Intervention Aspirin therapy (overall trial, n = 4998; subgroup, n = 234) or placebo (overall trial, n = 5012; subgroup, n = 236) initiated within 4 hours before surgery and continued throughout the perioperative period. Of the 470 subgroup patients, 99.9% completed follow-up. Measurements The 30-day primary outcome was death or nonfatal myocardial infarction; bleeding was a secondary outcome. Results In patients with prior PCI, aspirin reduced the risk for the primary outcome (absolute risk reduction, 5.5% [95% CI, 0.4% to 10.5%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.50 [CI, 0.26 to 0.95]; P for interaction = 0.036) and for myocardial infarction (absolute risk reduction, 5.9% [CI, 1.0% to 10.8%]; HR, 0.44 [CI, 0.22 to 0.87]; P for interaction = 0.021). The effect on the composite of major and life-threatening bleeding in patients with prior PCI was uncertain (absolute risk increase, 1.3% [CI, -2.6% to 5.2%]).

Second, we propose a practical approach to obtaining the correct number of topics in hierarchical topic models and show how model hyperparameters should be tuned for that purpose. We test this approach on the datasets with the known number of topics, as determined by the human mark-up, three of these datasets being in the English language and one in Russian. In the numerical experiments, we consider three different hierarchical models: hierarchical latent Dirichlet allocation model (hLDA), hierarchical Pachinko allocation model (hPAM), and hierarchical additive regularization of topic models (hARTM). We demonstrate that the hLDA model possesses a significant level of instability and, moreover, the derived numbers of topics are far from the true numbers for the labeled datasets. For the hPAM model, the Renyi entropy approach allows determining only one level of the data structure.

METHODS: This cross-sectional, survey-based, isolation area-stratified study collected demographic data, sleep status and emotional measurements from 1036 HPCD in nine medical institutions from March 5 to 9, 2020 in Wuhan, China, which was the epicenter of the epidemic. HPCD who worked in isolation areas with COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. The severity of symptoms of sleep disorders, insomnia and emotional self-efficacy were assessed by the Chinese versions of the 10-item Self-rating sleeping situation scale, the seven-item Insomnia Severity Index and the 12-item Regulatory emotional self-efficacy questionnaire, respectively. Univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with sleep disturbances. A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed via AMOS to explore the relationship among the four components. RESULTS: A total of 1036 out of 1075 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 96.4%. A total of 925 (89.3%) were aged 20-39 years, and 755 (72.9%) were women. Among all participants, 874 (84.4%) were nurses, and 162 (15.6%) were physicians; 538 (51.9%) worked in intensive care isolation units; 843 (81.4%) worked in isolation areas for 4 h straight, and 395 (38.1%) perceived COVID-19 peer exposure. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of sleep disorders (543, 52.4%). Exposure status and length of work were the main factors affecting sleep status, which had indirect effects on sleep status by mediating regulatory emotional self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: In this survey of HPCD for patients with COVID-19 in China, participants reported experiencing sleep disturbance burdens, especially those having exposure experience and working long shifts. Regulatory emotional self-efficacy (RESE) is an important resource for alleviating sleep disturbances and improving sleep quality.

METHODS: With increasing environmental concerns, we analysed the differences between the environmental footprint of a paediatric cardiology webinar with a hypothetical conference. Travel data was collected, with assumptions made on the amount of computer use, internet use and accordingly the overall use of electricity for both forms of conference. Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used (OpenLCA and Ecovinvent v 3.7). RESULTS: We showed that the theoretical environmental impact of a virtual conference is significantly less (4 tons CO2 equivalent) than the traditional international face-to-face conference (192 tons CO2 equivalent). The life cycle assessment methodology showed that resource use for a face-to-face conference lasting 2.5 days for 1374 attendees is equivalent to 400 times what an average person would use in one year, the climate change and photochemical ozone formation approximately 250 times and the eutrophication terrestrial equivalent to 225 times. However, using carbon equivalent emissions to measure environmental harm from flying is an under estimate of the potential damage, when one considers the additional production of airplane contrails. Notwithstanding this, there is a 98% reduction in climate change impact when meetings are held virtually. CONCLUSIONS: While the virtual conference may never completely replace the traditional in-person paediatric cardiology conference, due to networking benefits, the significant theoretical benefits to the environment highlighted in this study, warrants consideration for the virtual conference taking a more common place in sustainable academia.","output":"Webinars reduce the environmental footprint of pediatric cardiology conferences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitro-fatty acids are a class of endogenous electrophilic lipid mediators with anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects in a wide range of inflammatory and fibrotic disease models.

Bioinformatic analyses revealed that nitro-alkylated proteins are highly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and transmembrane proteins, and are overrepresented in lipid metabolism and transport pathways. This study significantly expands the scope of protein substrates targeted by nitro-fatty acids in living cells and provides a useful resource towards understanding the pleiotropic biological roles of nitro-fatty acids as signaling molecules or as multi-target therapeutic agents.","output":"Chemoproteomic profiling reveals cellular targets of nitro-fatty acids."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant populations of microorganisms. Clearly, one can see the need to develop new, more effective, antimicrobial agents that go beyond the explored chemical space. In this regard, their unique modes of action (e.g., reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, redox activation, ligand exchange, depletion of substrates involved in vital cellular processes) render metal complexes as promising drug candidates. Several Ru (II/III) complexes have been included in, or are currently undergoing, clinical trials as anticancer agents. Based on the in-depth knowledge of their chemical properties and biological behavior, the interest in developing new ruthenium compounds as antibiotic, antifungal, antiparasitic, or antiviral drugs has risen. This review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ru (II/III) frameworks as antimicrobial agents. Some aspects regarding the relationship between their chemical structure and mechanism of action, cellular localization, and/or metabolism of the ruthenium complexes in bacterial and eukaryotic cells are discussed as well. Regarding the antiviral activity, in light of current events related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Ru (II/III) compounds used against SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., BOLD-100) are also reviewed herein.","output":"Ruthenium Complexes in the Fight against Pathogenic Microorganisms.

However, the extent to which these phenotypes share genetic architecture is unclear. This question is of great relevance to determining key risk factors for suicide, and to alleviate the societal burden of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). To help address the question of heterogeneity, consortia efforts have recently shifted from a focus on suicide within the context of major psychopathology (e.g. major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) to suicide as an independent entity. Recent molecular studies of suicide risk by members of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the International Suicide Genetics Consortium have identified genome-wide significant loci associated with SA and with suicide death, and have examined these phenotypes within and outside of the context of major psychopathology. This review summarizes important insights from epidemiological and biometrical research on suicide, and discusses key empirical findings from molecular genetic examinations of STBs. Polygenic risk scores for these phenotypes have been observed to be associated with case?control status and other risk phenotypes. In addition, estimated shared genetic covariance with other phenotypes suggests specific medical and psychiatric risks beyond major depressive disorder. Broadly, molecular studies suggest a complexity of suicide etiology that cannot simply be accounted for by depression.

We included randomized controlled trial (RCT) and non-randomized studies (NRS), addressing the primary objective. We extracted data in duplicate an independent manner. We used RevMan to conduct a meta-analysis for RCTs and NRS using the random effects models to calculate the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the incidence of infection. Statistical heterogeneity was determined using the I 2 statistic. We assessed the risk of bias for all included studies and rated the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. We conducted a meta-regression using the R package to meta-explore whether age, sex, and invasive mechanical ventilation modified the risk of infection with immune-based therapies. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021229406.Findings: We identified 74 eligible publications (16 RCT and 58 NRS).

Combining estimates using appropriate statistical methodology from multiple candidate models is important to better understand the variation of these outcome measures to help inform decision making. In this paper, we combine these estimates for specific UK nations and regions using random effects meta analyses techniques, utilising the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method to estimate the heterogeneity variance parameter, and two approaches to calculate the confidence interval for the combined estimate: the standard Wald-type intervals; and the Knapp and Hartung (KNHA) method. As estimates in this setting are derived using model predictions, each with varying degrees of uncertainty, equal weighting is favoured over the more standard inverse-variance weighting in order avoid potential up-weighting of models providing estimates with lower levels of uncertainty that are not fully accounting for inherent uncertainties. Utilising these meta-analysis techniques has allowed for statistically robust combined estimates to be calculated for key COVID-19 outcome measures.

It has allowed patients to save time and money on clinic visits, and physicians to communicate with patients who live remotely. Telemedicine has also been valuable in plastic surgery during initial consultations, transfers, and follow up visits. However, given the often-sensitive nature of plastic surgery, the professionalism and expectations of telemedicine have to be reviewed. A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through October 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine and its use in plastic surgery. Data on the effectiveness, challenges, and professionalism of telemedicine were collected. Our review suggests that telemedicine can be an effective mode of communication in many realms of plastic surgery, including cleft care and craniofacial deformities. However, many plastic surgeons are unfamiliar with the existing platforms, and there are no clear guidelines on the most optimal platforms. Physicians have to recognize that patients might have low digital health literacy or may not even possess digital device for telemedicine. There also needs to be an overall improvement in patient education. Given that telemedicine use will continue to increase after the COVID-19 pandemic, regulations on Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant platforms and specific guidelines on telemedicine visits, such as undressing, chaperones, privacy matters, need to be established while maintaining a professional relationship between the patient and the physician.","output":"The Doctor Will \\"See\\" You Now - Unmet Expectations of Telemedicine in Plastic Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although a highly ambiguous and contested idea, Universal Health Coverage (UHC) is the hegemonic concept in international debates on health system reforms.

However, when included as a predictor in a model, it is conventionally modeled linearly, dichotomously, or categorically. We comprehensively examined different ways of modeling FBG to assess the risk of being admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Utilizing COVID-19 data from Kuwait, we fitted conventional approaches to modeling FBG as well as a nonlinear estimation using penalized splines. RESULTS: For 417 patients, the conventional linear, dichotomous, and categorical approaches to modeling FBG missed key trends in the exposure-response relationship. A nonlinear estimation showed a steep slope until about 10 mmol/L before flattening. CONCLUSIONS: Our results argue for strict glucose management on admission. Even a small incremental increase within the normal range of FBG was associated with a substantial increase in risk of ICU admission for COVID-19 patients.","output":"Fasting Blood Glucose and COVID-19 Severity: Nonlinearity Matters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Machine learning (ML) is a domain of artificial intelligence that allows computer algorithms to learn from experience without being explicitly programmed. OBJECTIVE To summarize neurosurgical applications of ML where it has been compared to clinical expertise, here referred to as \\"natural intelligence.\\" METHODS A systematic search was performed in the PubMed and Embase databases as of August 2016 to review all studies comparing the performance of various ML approaches with that of clinical experts in neurosurgical literature. RESULTS Twenty-three studies were identified that used ML algorithms for diagnosis, presurgical planning, or outcome prediction in neurosurgical patients. Compared to clinical experts, ML models demonstrated a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 13% (interquartile range 4-21%) and 0.14 (interquartile range 0.07-0.21), respectively. In 29 (58%) of the 50 outcome measures for which a P-value was provided or calculated, ML models outperformed clinical experts (P < .05). In 18 of 50 (36%), no difference was seen between ML and expert performance (P > .05), while in 3 of 50 (6%) clinical experts outperformed ML models (P < .05). All 4 studies that compared clinicians assisted by ML models vs clinicians alone demonstrated a better performance in the first group. CONCLUSION We conclude that ML models have the potential to augment the decision-making capacity of clinicians in neurosurgical applications; however, significant hurdles remain associated with creating, validating, and deploying ML models in the clinical setting. Shifting from the preconceptions of a human-vs-machine to a human-and-machine paradigm could be essential to overcome these hurdles.","output":"Natural and Artificial Intelligence in Neurosurgery: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has been associated with overt and subclinical myocardial dysfunction. We observed a recurring pattern of reduced basal left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain on speckle-tracking echocardiography in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and subsequently aimed to identify characteristics of affected patients. We hypothesized that patients with COVID-19 with reduced basal LV strain would demonstrate elevated cardiac biomarkers. METHODS AND RESULT: Eighty-one consecutive patients with COVID-19 underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography. Those with poor quality speckle-tracking echocardiography (na?=a?2) or a known LV ejection fraction of <50% (na?=a?4) were excluded. Patients with an absolute value basal longitudinal strain of <13.9% (2 standard deviations below normal) were designated as cases (na?=a?39); those with a basal longitudinal strain of &#8805;13.9% were designated as controls (na?=a?36). Demographics and clinical variables were compared. Of 75 included patients (mean age 62  14 years, 41% women), 52% had reduced basal strain. Cases had higher body mass index (median 34.1; interquartile range 26.5-37.9 kg/m2 vs median 26.9, interquartile range, 24.8-30.0 kg/m2, Pa?=a?.009), and greater proportions of Black (74% vs 36%, Pa?=a?.0009), hypertensive (79% vs 56%, Pa?=a?.026), and diabetic patients (44% vs 19%, Pa?=a?.025) compared with controls. Troponin and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels trended higher in cases, but were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced basal LV strain is common in patients with COVID-19. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and Black race were more likely to have reduced basal strain.

Data about vertical transmission of Covid-19 are still limited and controversial: in most cases, although a positive mother, the virus could not be isolated in amniotic fluid, cord blood, breast milk or neonatal throat swab in these patients. No data have been published about possible intrauterine sonographic signs of infection. CASE PRESENTATION A pregnant woman was diagnosed with SARS-CoV2 at 35+5 weeks of gestation and managed conservatively at home. At transabdominal ultrasound at 38+3 weeks, fetal bowel and gallbladder calcifications were noted. CMV and other infectious agents were ruled out; an iterative Caesarean Section was performed at 38+5 weeks without complications. Placenta resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2; the umbilical cord blood sample was IgG positive and IgM negative as per maternal infection. The baby developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring endotracheal surfactant administration and nasal-CPAP for one day but nasopharyngeal swabs at birth and after 48 hours were SARS-Cov2 negative. Neonatal abdominal ultrasound showed normal liver, acalculous gallbladder with mild parietal thickening. The baby was discharged in good conditions. CONCLUSIONS although gallbladder calcifications and echogenic bowel are highly suspicious of viral infection and were thought to be due to the vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these findings were not corroborated by the results of our diagnostic tests; these sonographic findings might represent a false positive of fetal infection in mother affected by COVID-19 since vertical transmission appears to be rare.","output":"Pregnant woman infected by Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and calcifications of the fetal bowel and gallbladder: a case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Csackground: There is currently a lack of evidence-based postresuscitation or postmortem guidelines for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the setting of an emerging infectious disease This study aimed to develop and validate a multimodal screening tool that aids in predicting the disease confirmation in emergency situations and patients with OHCA during a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter observational study of adult patients with OHCA in Daegu, Korea To identify the potential predictors that could be used in screening tools in the emergency department, we applied logistic regression to data collected from March 1 to March 14 The prediction performance of the screening variables was then assessed and validated on the data of patients with OHCA who were treated between February 19 and March 31, 2020 General patient characteristics and hematological findings of the COVID-19-negative and COVID-19-positive groups were compared We also evaluated confirmation test criteria as predictors for COVID-19 positivity in patients with OHCA Results: Advanced age, body temperature, and abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) revealed significant predictive ability in the derivation cohort Of the 184 adult patients with OHCA identified in the validation cohort, 80 patients were included in the analysis Notably, 9 patients were positive and 71 were negative on the COVID-19 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test Five patients (55 6%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a fever before OHCA, and 12 (16 9%) of the COVID-19-negative group had a fever before OHCA (P= 0 018) Eight patients (88 9%) in the COVID-19-positive group had a CXR indicating pneumonic infiltration Of the criteria for predicting COVID-19, fever or an abnormal CXR had a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 65 4 -100) and a specificity of 22 5% (95% CI: 13 5 - 34 0) Conclusion: The screening tools that combined fever or abnormal CXR had a good discriminatory ability for COVID-19 infection in adult patients with OHCA Therefore, during the COVID-19 outbreak period, it is recommended to suspect COVID-19 infection and perform COVID-19 test if patients present with a history of fever or show abnormal findings in postmortem CXR","output":"Confirmation of COVID-19 in Out-of-Hospital.

Unique characteristics of VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19 include the high incidence of VTE (and especially pulmonary embolism) when compared with historical controls; the finding of in situ pulmonary embolism associated with microthrombi, which suggests a thrombotic microangiopathic process in addition to classic macrovessel disease; and, most important from a clinical perspective, the unusually high rate of VTE that has been reported despite standard thromboprophylaxis. This raises the possibility that intermediate or weight-based heparin dosing may be more effective than fixed dosing for thromboprophylaxis in high-risk subsets of patients hospitalized with COVID-19. There have been several guidance statements focusing on the management of VTE in hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19, including the most recent statement by the Scientific and Standardization Committee of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, which includes comprehensive guidance on the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of VTE in this patient population.

The results showed that among four turbulence models, the standard k-, RNG k-, realizable k- and SST k- models, the prediction by the realizable k- model agreed most closely with the experimental data. Meanwhile, the steady Eulerian method provided a reasonable prediction of the particle concentration field with low computing cost.

Thus we explored the plasma metabolome of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 to search for diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers and to improve the knowledge of metabolic disturbance in this infection.Materials and Methods We analyzed the plasma metabolome of 55 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 45 controls by LC-HRMS at the time of diagnosis (D0). We first evaluated the ability to predict the diagnosis from the metabotype at D0 in an independent population. Next, we assessed the feasibility of predicting the disease evolution at the 7 th and 15 th day.ResultsPlasma metabolome allowed us to generate a discriminant multivariate model to predict the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in an independent population (accuracy>74%, sensitivity, specificity>75%). We identified the role of the cytosine and tryptophan-nicotinamide pathways in this discrimination. However, metabolomic exploration modestly explained the disease evolution.DiscussionHere, we present the first metabolomic study in SARS-CoV-2 patients which showed a high reliable prediction of early diagnosis. We have highlighted the role of the tryptophan-nicotinamide pathway clearly linked to inflammatory signals and microbiota, and the involvement of cytosine, previously described as a coordinator of cell metabolism in SARS-CoV-2.

METHODS Several electronic databases were searched to identify studies in which rehabilitation professionals delivered, supervised, or participated in interventions for individuals with SSc. Randomized (RCTs) or non-randomized trials, one-arm trials, and prospective quasi-experimental studies with interventions were included if they had  10 participants. Quality appraisal was done by two independent raters using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale. RESULTS Sixteen good or excellent quality studies (15 RCTs, 1 prospective quasi-experimental study) were included. Most rehabilitation interventions focused on hands/upper extremities, followed by multicomponent, orofacial, and directed self-management. Sample sizes varied between 20 - 267 participants (median = 38). In 50% of studies, participants in intervention groups significantly improved compared to controls. Most studies demonstrated within-group improvements in intervention groups. Interventions varied in content, delivery, length, and dose and outcome measures collected. CONCLUSION Existing evidence provides some support for rehabilitation in SSc, such as interventions that focus on hand and upper extremity outcomes or are multicomponent, although there is high study heterogeneity. The evidence base would benefit from interventions testing similar replicable components, use of common outcome measures, and incorporation of delivery modes that enable larger sample sizes. There are challenges in recruiting participants due to SSc's rarity and involving participants in rehabilitation studies that require active participation over time due to high disease burden. Intervention studies designed to reduce participation barriers may facilitate translation of effective interventions into practice.","output":"Rehabilitation Interventions in Systemic Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Future Directions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19.

However, the applicability of internet searches to monitor COVID-19 infections and public health awareness in South Asian countries are unclear. Objectives To assess the association of public interest and health literacy in COVID-19 with the actual number of infected cases for countries in South Asia. Methods Google Trends data from January to March 2020 were used to correlate public interest and health literacy with official data on COVID-19 cases using the relative search volume (RSV) index. Public interest in COVID-19 was retrieved in RSV indices with the search term Coronavirus (Virus). Similarly, an OR combination of search terms hand wash, face mask, hand sanitizer, face shield, and gloves were used to retrieve RSV indices as a surrogate of population health literacy in COVID-19. Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the COVID-19 data repository managed by the Johns Hopkins University. Country-level time-lag correlation analyses were performed for a time lag between 30 and +30 days. Results COVID-19-related worldwide public interest reached a peak on March 16, 2020, right after the WHO announcement of coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. COVID-19 related public interest reached the highest peak in South Asian countries a few days after each county reported 100th confirmed cases. There were significant positive correlations between COVID-19 related public interest and daily laboratory-confirmed cases in countries expect Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka. The highest public interest in South Asian Countries was on average 12 days before the local maximum of new confirmed cases. Similarly, web searches related to personal hygiene and COVID-19 preventive measures in south Asia correlated to the number of confirmed cases as well as national restriction measures. Conclusion Public interest indicated by RSV indices can help to monitor the progression of an outbreak such as the current COVID-19 pandemic particularly in countries with a lack of diagnostic and surveillance capacity, and thereby distribute appropriate health information to the general public.","output":"Monitoring COVID-19 related public Interest and population Health Literacy in South Asia: An Internet Search-Interest Based Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Health leaders need global strategy for spotting disease threats.","output":"Disease monitors 'looking in the wrong places'"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cannabis use among women of reproductive age has increased substantially in recent decades. Understanding reasons for cannabis use in this population is critical for cannabis use prevention efforts. Thus, this scoping review aimed to identify and synthesize current measures on reasons for cannabis use in women of reproductive age. METHODS We searched PubMed, PyschINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar for relevant studies published in English between January 2010 and April 2021. Peer-reviewed, quantitative studies reporting on measures of cannabis-related knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, motivations, and influences among women of reproductive age were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies not focused on women of reproductive age and studies reporting cannabis use prevalence data only. RESULTS We included 11 studies (10 primary studies and 1 review) with varying subpopulation samples of women, including non-pregnant women (n = 2), women experiencing infertility (n = 1), pregnant women (n = 4), postpartum women (n = 3), and women in the perinatal period (n = 1). Measurement topic areas included information received from health care professionals, attitudes, perceptions and experiences about cannabis use, knowledge of potential harms, and motivations for cannabis use. Most studies including measures of risk perceptions were conducted among pregnant or postpartum women (n = 4). A single study measured influences of cannabis use; no studies measured social or peer influences of use. Most studies (n = 7) created their own measures, with 2 studies using secondary data via measures from population-based surveillance systems in the United States, and one using a previously validated instrument. Recommendations for future research were centered around addressing knowledge gaps of health effects of cannabis use across different time periods, and etiology of cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS We found vast measurement gaps in current measures of antecedents of cannabis use among women of reproductive age, providing clear direction for future research in this area. Findings necessitate psychometric evaluation of existing measures to ascertain validity and reliability, as well as development of additional measures of women's cannabis-related attitudes, perceptions, motivations, and influences.

Here we show that the emergence of variants can in fact be traced through data-driven methods, further capitalizing on the value of large collections of SARS-CoV-2 sequences. For all countries with sufficient data, we compute weekly counts of amino acid changes, unveil time-varying clusters of changes with similar - rapidly growing - dynamics, and then follow their evolution. Our method succeeds in timely associating clusters to variants of interest/concern, provided their change composition is well characterized. This allows us to detect variants emergence, rise, peak, and eventual decline under competitive pressure of another variant. Our early warning system, exclusively relying on deposited sequences, shows the power of big data in this context, and concurs to calling for the wide spreading of public SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing for improved surveillance and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Analysis of amino acid change dynamics reveals SARS-CoV-2 variant emergence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fibromyalgia (FM) was frequently observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

In a cross-sectional, observational study, patients with PFM and SFM underwent a structured interview for the lifetime diagnosis of major depression (MDD), panic (PD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and were assessed for childhood/adulthood adversities and FM-related symptoms severity. Thirty patients with PFM and forty with SFM were recruited. The univariate analysis showed that the lifetime rates of MDD were significantly higher in PFM vs SFM (76.7 % and 40% respectively, p <0.003), as well as the rates of PD (50 % and 15% respectively, p <0.003), whereas there was no difference in PTSD rates. The rates of sexual abuse and physical neglect were significantly higher in PFM patients vs SFM patients (p<0.005 and p<0.023). Life events occurring before FM onset were different in PFM and SFM groups. In the logistic regression model, lifetime PD and physical neglect remain independent risk factors for PFM.

When new diseases first emerge, we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and duration of immunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build realistic epidemiological models. Time series forecasts and machine learning, while less reliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of data that are also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we examine how knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new diseases in data-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both an empirical and a theoretical approach. Using empirical data from Brazil, we compare how well different machine learning models transfer knowledge between two different disease pairs: (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) influenza and COVID-19. In the theoretical analysis, we generate data using different transmission and recovery rates with an SIR compartmental model, and then compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning methods. We find that transfer learning offers the potential to improve predictions, even beyond a model based on data from the target disease, though the appropriate source disease must be chosen carefully.

Fifty-three liver allograft samples from unique HCV LT recipients were studied using microarrays, including a training set (n = 32) and a validation set (n = 19). Two no-HCV-ACR samples from LT recipients were also included. Probe set intensity values were obtained using the robust multiarray average method (RMA) method. Analysis of variance identified statistically differentially expressed genes (P  0.005). The limma package was used to fit the mixed-effects models using a restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The last absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was fit with HCVrec versus ACR as the dependent variable predicted. N-fold cross-validation was performed to provide an unbiased estimate of generalization error. A total of 179 probe sets were differentially expressed among groups, with 71 exclusive genes between HCVrec and HCV-ACR. No differences were found within ACR group (HCV-ACR vs. no-HCV-ACR). Supervised clustering analysis displayed two clearly independent groups, and no-HCV-ACR clustered within HCV-ACR. HCVrec-related genes were associated with a cytotoxic T-cell profile, and HCV-ACR-related genes were associated with the inflammatory response. The best-fitting LASSO model classifier accuracy, including 15 genes, has an accuracy of 100% in the training set.

Identification of KCs of cardiovascular (CV) toxicants could facilitate the systematic assessment of CV hazards and understanding of assay and data gaps associated with current approaches. OBJECTIVES: We sought to develop a consensus-based synthesis of scientific evidence on the KCs of chemical and nonchemical agents known to cause CV toxicity along with methods to measure them. METHODS: An expert working group was convened to discuss mechanisms associated with CV toxicity. RESULTS: The group identified 12 KCs of CV toxicants, defined as exogenous agents that adversely interfere with function of the CV system. The KCs were organized into those primarily affecting cardiac tissue (numbers 1C4 below), the vascular system (5C7), or both (8C12), as follows: 1) impairs regulation of cardiac excitability, 2) impairs cardiac contractility and relaxation, 3) induces cardiomyocyte injury and death, 4) induces proliferation of valve stroma, 5) impacts endothelial and vascular function, 6) alters hemostasis, 7) causes dyslipidemia, 8) impairs mitochondrial function, 9) modifies autonomic nervous system activity, 10) induces oxidative stress, 11) causes inflammation, and 12) alters hormone signaling. DISCUSSION: These 12 KCs can be used to help identify pharmaceuticals and environmental pollutants as CV toxicants, as well as to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings of their toxicity. For example, evidence exists that fine particulate matter [PM [Formula: see text] in aerodynamic diameter ([Formula: see text])] air pollution, arsenic, anthracycline drugs, and other exogenous chemicals possess one or more of the described KCs.

Considering the uneven spatial distribution of those severe outcomes at the municipality level, the objective of this study was, first, to identify high-risk areas for COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths, and second, to determine the associated contextual factors with the uneven spatial distribution of both study outcomes in Sweden. METHODS: The existences of spatial autocorrelation of the standardised incidence (hospitalisations) ratio and standardised mortality ratio were investigated using Global Morans I test. Furthermore, we applied the retrospective Poisson spatial scan statistics to identify high-risk spatial clusters. The association between the contextual demographic and socioeconomic factors and the number of hospitalisations and deaths was estimated using a quasi-Poisson generalised additive regression model. RESULTS: Ten high-risk spatial clusters of hospitalisations and six high-risk clusters of mortality were identified in Sweden from February 2020 to October 2020. The hospitalisations and deaths were associated with three contextual variables in a multivariate model: population density (inhabitants/km(2)) and the proportion of immigrants (%) showed a positive association with both outcomes, while the proportion of the population aged 65+ years (%) showed a negative association. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified high-risk spatial clusters for hospitalisations and deaths due to COVID-19 and the association of population density, the proportion of immigrants and the proportion of people aged 65+ years with those severe outcomes.

The gold standard method of VF examination is laryngoscopy. It requires ear, nose, and throat specialist consultation and additional equipment. Moreover, laryngoscopy causes distress to patients, and during the COVID-19 pandemic it is a high-risk, aerosol-producing procedure. The aim of the paper was to review publications on the role of TLUS in VF evaluation. Considered aspects included VF visibility, factors affecting them, and different variables measured during TLUS examination. The visibility of VFs in TLUS ranged from 72.8 to 100%. Among men it was significantly lower (17-100%) in comparison to women (83-100%). All but 2 authors concluded that TLUS is a viable tool that can be an alternative to laryngoscopy in diagnosing VFs. Obesity, age, male gender, height, calcified thyroid, and incision close to the thyroid cartilage were independent factors for inaccessible vocal folds. VF displacement velocity (VFDV) is the most objective parameter measured by Doppler, and it is proportional to the velocity of the wave causing the vibrations of the VFs. After VF paralysis, this parameter is reduced. Valsalva manoeuvre, low-frequency transducer, and different transducer positions can improve images obtained on USG. TLUS in a majority of cases can adequately assess whether the function of the VFs is intact or paresis/paralysis has occurred. It is noninvasive and rapid, it adds no extra cost, and it can be a part of the preoperative examination of the thyroid gland.

Testing performed up to February 24, 2021 in these patients was included for analysis. The main outcome was reinfection, defined as infection &#8805; 90 days after initial testing. Secondary outcomes were symptomatic infection and protection of prior infection against reinfection. RESULTS: Of 150,325 patients, 8,845 (5.9%) tested positive and 141,480 (94.1%) tested negative prior to August 30. 1,278 (14.4%) of the positive patients were retested after 90 days, and 62 had possible reinfection. Of those, 31 (50%) were symptomatic. Of those with initial negative testing, 5,449 (3.9%) were subsequently positive and 3,191 of those (58.5%) were symptomatic.

This protection increased over time, suggesting that viral shedding or ongoing immune response may persist beyond 90 days and may not represent true reinfection.

Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out on 306 patients who admitted to COVID-19 care centers in Kingdom of Bahrain from 20th March 2020 to 5th April 2020. Standard qPCR was used to estimate the viral load and data were analyzed to investigate the relationship between Ct values and various variables. Results: Out of 306 patients, 2 deaths, 1 active stable case and 303 recovered cases were reported. Ct value was significantly and negatively associated (P value <0.001) with length of hospital stay. The viral clearance was also inversely associated with the Ct values. Conclusion: Ct value was inversely associated with hospital stay duration (and time to viral clearance), higher the Ct value is indicative of faster time to viral clearance. This association could help to better manage the infection and resources allocation.","output":"SARS-Cov-2 Viral Load as an Indicator for COVID-19 Patients Hospital Stay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the developing world, Nanotechnology became an efficient method in therapeutics, antimicrobials, diagnostics, catalysis, microelectronics, and high sensitivity biomolecular detection.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the analytic performance and handling of four rapid Antigen Point of Care Tests (AgPOCTs) I-IV (Distributors: (I) Roche, (II) Abbott, (III) MEDsan and (IV) Siemens). METHODS: 100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs. Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2-12 days). The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4% (CI95%: 38.9 - 59.9), 44.6% (CI95%: 34.3 - 55.3), 45.8% (CI95%: 35.5 - 56.5) and 54.9% (CI95%: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >10(6) copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3% or more (range 92.3% - 100%).

Here, we used virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) to interrogate the functions of Pontin and Reptin in plant growth and physiology, focusing on Nicotiana benthamiana, a model species for the agriculturally significant Solanaceae family. Silencing either Pontin or Reptin caused pleiotropic developmental and physiological reprogramming, including aberrant leaf shape, reduced apical growth, delayed flowering, increased branching, chlorosis, and decreased spread of the RNA viruses Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and Potato virus X (PVX). To dissect these pleiotropic phenotypes, we took a comparative approach and silenced expression of key genes that encode subunits of each of the major Pontin/Reptin-associated chromatin remodeling or TOR complexes (INO80, SWR-C/PIE1, TIP60, TOR, and TELO2). We found that many of the pontin/reptin phenotypes could be attributed specifically to disruption of one of these complexes, with tip60 and tor knockdown plants each phenocopying a large subset of pontin/reptin phenotypes. We conclude that Pontin/Reptin complexes are crucial for proper plant development, physiology, and stress responses, highlighting the multifaceted roles these conserved enzymes have evolved in eukaryotic cells.","output":"Pontin/Reptin-associated complexes differentially impact plant development and viral pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: This article aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the concept of self-care and outline its defining attributes, antecedents, consequences and empirical referents.

However, up to 90% of people with schizophrenia begin smoking before the onset of their illness, thus smoking could be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Prenatal exposure to maternal cigarette smoke is also associated with psychiatric problems in adolescence. Therefore, our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the effect of smoking, and prenatal smoke exposure, on risk of schizophrenia. Method We systematically searched Medline, Embase, PsychInfo, Maternity and Infant Care, and Web of Science (from inception to February 2018) to identify comparative observational studies of the risk of schizophrenia in relation to smoking status. Measures of Relative Risk (RR) were pooled in a meta-analysis with 95% confidence intervals, using random effects model. Results Twelve studies (9 cohort, 3 case-control) were included. Odds ratios (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) were pooled together to estimate pooled RRs and estimates combined in a meta-analysis on an assumption of constant risk over time. Smokers had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia compared to non-smokers (RR 1.99, 95% CI 1.10-3.61, I2= 97%, 5 studies). Exposure to prenatal smoke increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29% (95% CI 1.10-1.51, I2= 71%, 7 studies). Sensitivity analyses identified no significant differences between the results from studies reporting OR and HR. Conclusions Our findings suggest smoking, and prenatal smoke exposure, may be an independent risk factor for schizophrenia. Care should be taken when inferring causation, given the observational nature of the studies. Implications In this meta-analysis of 12 studies smokers had a significantly increased risk of schizophrenia compared to non-smokers. Exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke also increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29% compared to those with no exposure to prenatal tobacco smoke. Our findings suggest that smoking, and prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, may be independent risk factors for schizophrenia. These results may have important public health implications for decreasing the incidence of schizophrenia. The possibility of a causal link between smoking and schizophrenia warrants further investigation.","output":"The effects of tobacco smoking, and prenatal tobacco smoke exposure, on risk of schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir in adult patients with COVID-19.

The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) checklists were used for the studies' qualitative assessment. The outcomes studied were mortality, all adverse events, serious adverse events, and clinical improvement. The quantitative synthesis was conducted using fixed and random effects models in the CMA 2.2. Heterogeneity was tested using the I-squared (I2) measure. RESULTS: In general, six studies, including five randomized controlled trials and one cohort study were found eligible. Comparison of the findings related to both groups receiving remdesivir (10-day remdesivir group) and placebo/control group showed that remdesivir treatment had no significant effect on mortality at day 14 of the treatment (RR=0.769;95% CI :0.563-1.050;p=0.098), and all adverse events (RR= 1.078;95% CI: 0.908-1.279;p= 0.392).

MethodsWe implemented the use of RAT in the emergency ward of our university hospital for rapid patients triaging and compared performances of four different antigen tests. All results were compared to SARS-CoV-2 specific RT-PCR (reference standard). ResultsTriaging patients using RAT in association with RT-PCR allowed us to isolate promptly positive patients and to save resources, in a context of rapid RT-PCR reagents shortage. Among 532 patients with valid results, overall sensitivities were 48.3% for One Step Exdia and 41.2% for Standard Q(R), Panbio-and BD Veritor. All four antigen tests exhibited specificity above 99%. Sensitivity increased up to 74.6%, 66.2%, 66.2% and 64.8% for One Step Exdia, Standard Q, Panbio, and BD Veritor respectively, when considering viral loads above 105copies/ml, up to 100%, 97.8%, 96.6% and 95.6% for viral loads above 106 copies/ml and 100% (for all tests) when considering viral loads above 107 copies/ml. Sensitivity was significantly higher for patients presenting with symptoms onset within 4 days (74.3%, 69.2%, 69.2% and 64%, respectively) versus patients with evolution of symptoms for more than 4 days (36.8%, 21.1%, 21.1% and 23.7%, respectively). Sensitivities of all RAT assays were of only 33% among hospitalized patients without COVID-19 symptoms. ConclusionRAT might represent a useful epidemiological resource in selected clinical settings as a complementary tool to the molecular tests for rapid patients triaging, but the lower sensitivity compared to RT-PCR, especially in late presenters and subjects without COVID-19 symptoms, must be taken into account in order to correctly use RAT for triaging.","output":"ImplemeNting SARS-CoV-2 Rapid antigen testing in the Emergency wArd of a Swiss univErsity hospital: the INCREASE study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) poses a severe threat around the world.

Although the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is not completely understood, there is emerging evidence that it causes a severe systemic inflammatory response and results in a hypercoagulable state with widespread microthrombi. We hypothesized that it is plausible that a similar disease process may occur in the fetal-maternal unit. Objective C The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 in term patients admitted to Labor and Delivery, including women without COVID-19 symptomatology, is associated with increased placental injury compared to a cohort of COVID-19 negative controls. Study Design C This was a retrospective cohort study performed at NYU Winthrop Hospital between 3/31/2020 and 6/17/2020. During the study period all women admitted to Labor and Delivery were routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 regardless of symptomatology. The placental histopathological findings of COVID-19 patients (n=77) who delivered a singleton gestation at term were compared to a control group of term patients without COVID-19 (n=56). Controls were excluded if they had obstetric or medical complications including fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathy or thrombophilia. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed for variables that were significant in univariable analyses. A subgroup analysis was also performed comparing asymptomatic COVID-19 cases to negative controls. Results C In univariable analyses, COVID-19 cases were more likely to have evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion, i.e. presence of avascular villi and/or mural fibrin deposition (32.5% (25/77) vs. 3.6% (2/56), p<0.0001) and villitis of unknown etiology (20.8% (16/77) vs. 7.1% (4/56), p=0.030). These findings persisted in a subgroup analysis of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases compared to COVID-19 negative controls. In a multivariable model adjusting for maternal age, race/ethnicity, mode of delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction and oligohydramnios, the frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion abnormalities remained significantly higher in the COVID-19 group (OR= 12.63, 95% CI [2.40, 66.40]). While the frequency of villitis of unknown etiology was more than double in COVID-19 cases compared to controls, this did not reach statistical significance in a similar multivariable model (OR=2.11, 95% CI [0.50, 8.97]). All neonates of mothers with COVID-19 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR. Conclusions C Despite the fact that all neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR, we found that COVID-19 in term patients admitted to Labor and Delivery is associated with increased rates of placental histopathologic abnormalities, particularly fetal vascular malperfusion and villitis of unknown etiology.

The databases of Medline, Embase, Cinahl, and Web of Science were searched from inception until July 2019. The quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 tool. Two by two tables were created, extracting the number of true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) regarding shivering and SBI, by 2 authors independently. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the MetaDATA Shiny app. In a population with known malignancy, we found a +LR of 3.47 (95% CI 2.58-4.36) for a serious bacterial infection when shivering was present, implying an increase of 25-30% possibility for a serious bacterial infection. In children without malignancy, diagnostic accuracy of shivering was poor.Conclusion: Shivering is of limited use to diagnose serious bacterial infection in children without malignancy.

Radiology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: National guidelines and consensus statements suggest a 24-hour window for endovascular recanalization in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke due to large-vessel occlusion. However, the safety and efficacy of extending the window for intervention remains to be definitively established. CASE REPORT: A healthy 26-year-old woman presented with headache, left-sided hemiplegia, and rightward gaze palsy 2 days after a minor trauma. Time last known well was approximately 50 hours prior to presentation. Computed tomography angiography revealed dissection of the distal right internal carotid artery and occlusion of the M1 segment of the right middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a small area of acute infarct in the right basal ganglia and right insular cortex, but suggested a large ischemic penumbra; this was confirmed with cerebral perfusion analysis. In light of the patients young age and potential for penumbral salvage, mechanical thrombectomy of an M1 thrombus and stenting of an internal carotid artery dissection were performed nearly 60 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient demonstrated marked clinical improvement over the following days and was discharged home in excellent condition one week after presentation. Based on our clinical experience and other emerging data, we propose that extension of the 24-hour window for endovascular intervention may improve functional outcomes among select individuals.

FCD II is a common neuropathological finding in tissues resected therapeutically from patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. However, its molecular genetic etiology remains unclear. This study aimed to identify potential molecular markers of FCD II using bioinformatics analysis. METHODS: We downloaded two datasets for FCD II from the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between FCD II and normal brain tissues were identified, and functional enrichment analysis was performed. A proteinCprotein interaction network was constructed, and hub genes were identified from the DEGs. The hub gene expression was validated using WB in vitro. IHC staining was performed to verify the feasibility of the target molecular markers identified in the bioinformatics analysis. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-seven common DEGs were identified between the datasets. The GO and KEGG analyses showed that variations were prominently enriched in some functions associated with gene expression. Five hub genes (i.e., FANCI, FANCA, BRCA2, RAD18, and KEAP1) were identified. Western blotting confirmed that all hub gene expressions were higher in the FCD II tissue than in the normal brain tissue. IHC staining showed that the FANCI expression significantly increased in the FCD II tissue.

Method: 1-Cross-sectional study and 2-Longitudinal prospective study on health professionals who worked directly with patients affected by COVID-19 pandemic during the period between March-June 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona. Baseline (July-November 2020) and follow-up (November 2020-March 2021) data were collected. Data related to the job and toxic habits were collected with ad hoc questionnaires, and data related to perceived stress, post-traumatic stress, depression, and anxiety using validated questionnaires. Results: In the baseline group (cross-sectional study), 90 professionals participated, 76% nurses. More than a third were on sick leave or took drugs to manage stress. Half of smokers increased tobacco use, and one in 5 increased alcohol consumption. Habitual shift change is significantly associated with depression, professional profile with anxiety, and perceived stress with age. In the longitudinal prospective study, the follow-up group (n = 64) shows high levels of stress and anxiety, which are maintained or even significantly increased over time. Conclusions: The structural changes that occurred in the hospital during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on professionals, many of them presenting an increase in toxic habits, as well as impaired mental health that is maintained over time.","output":"Pandemia COVID-19 sobre profesionales sanitarios en un hospital de tercer nivel en Espa?a: cambios laborales durante la primera ola, salud mental a los 4 meses y seguimiento a los 9 meses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a new infectious disease causing severe respiratory failure and death for which optimal treatment is currently unclear.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of all patients (age <18 years) diagnosed with myocarditis and hospitalized at Rady Children's Hospital San Diego between 2000 and 2018. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients met inclusion criteria. Of 28 (97%) patients who underwent testing for viruses, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used in 24/28 (86% of cases), and 16/24 (67%) detected a virus. Pathogens were: rhinovirus (6), influenza A/B (4), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (3), coronavirus (3), parvovirus B19 (2), adenovirus (2) and coxsackie B5 virus, enterovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 2 in one case each. Six (21%) patients had no pathogen detected but imaging and other laboratory test results were compatible with myocarditis. Age 0-2 years was associated with RSV, influenza A/B, coronavirus and enteroviruses (P < .001). Twenty-one patients (72%) experienced full clinical recovery. Three patients (10%) required venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and all three recovered. Three others (10%) required and underwent successful cardiac transplantation without complications. Two patients (7%) died 9-10 days after hospitalization (one had RSV and one had Influenza A/B). Two other patients presented with complete atrioventricular block; one case (rhinovirus) resolved spontaneously, and one (coronavirus) resolved after support with VA-ECMO. Age <2 years, female sex, lower ejection fraction at admission, and higher initial and peak levels of brain natriuretic peptide were significant predictors of critical outcomes (use of VA-ECMO, listing for cardiac transplantation, and death). CONCLUSIONS: Viral nucleic acid-based testing revealed a wider spectrum of viruses that could be associated with myocarditis in children than previously reported and traditionally anticipated. A predilection of certain pathogens in the very young patients was observed. Whether the observed range of viral agents reflects an undercurrent of change in viral etiology or viral detection methods is unclear, but the wider spectrum of viral pathogens found underscores the usefulness of PCR testing in order to explore possible viral etiologies of myocarditis in children.","output":"Spectrum of Viral Pathogens Identified in Children with Clinical Myocarditis (Pre-COVID, 2000-2018): Etiologic Agent vs Innocent Bystander"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to explore changes in psychological responses (perceived stress, traumatic stress, stigma, coping) over time in residents, as well as their predictors.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the test performance of a high complexity laboratory-developed rRT-PCR EUA from Stanford Health Care (SHC) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (E) gene with other tests: the Atila isothermal amplification assay targeting the nucleocapsid (N) gene and open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), the Altona E and spike (S) multiplex, real-time RT-PCR, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 rRT-PCRs. STUDY DESIGN: A diagnostic comparison study was performed by testing nasopharyngeal samples from persons under investigation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Assay performance was assessed by percent agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. RESULTS: Positive percent agreement with the SHC EUA reference assay was 82.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 65.0 to 92.9) for Atila, 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) for the Altona E and S targets, and 86.7 % (95 % CI 69.7 to 95.3) and 90.0 % (95 % CI 73.6 to 97.3), for the CDC N1 and N2 targets, respectively.

Method: Hospitalized patients (n=34) with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited into a prospective cohort study. Clinical data and blood samples were collected at inclusion and after 2-5 and 7-10 days. RF was defined as PaO2/FiO2 ratio (P/F) <40kPa. Plasma cytokines were analyzed by a Human Cytokine 27-plex assay. Measurements and Results: COVID-19 patients with RF and/or treated in ICU showed overall increased systemic cytokine levels. Plasma IL-6, IL-8, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1 levels were negatively correlated with P/F, whereas combinations of IL-6, IP-10, IL-1ra and MCP-1 showed the best association with RF in ROC analysis (AUC 0.79-0.80, p<0.05). During hospitalization the decline was most significant for IP-10 (P<0.001). Conclusion: Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were present in patients with severe COVID-19.

However, data protection regulations prohibit data centralisation for analysis purposes because of potential privacy risks like the accidental disclosure of data to third parties. Therefore, alternative data usage policies, which comply with present privacy guidelines, are of particular interest. OBJECTIVE We aim to enable analyses on sensitive patient data by simultaneously complying with local data protection regulations using an approach called the Personal Health Train (PHT), which is a paradigm that utilises distributed analytics (DA) methods. The main principle of the PHT is that the analytical task is brought to the data provider and the data instances remain in their original location. METHODS In this work, we present our implementation of the PHT paradigm, which preserves the sovereignty and autonomy of the data providers and operates with a limited number of communication channels. We further conduct a DA use case on data stored in three different and distributed data providers. RESULTS We show that our infrastructure enables the training of data models based on distributed data sources. CONCLUSION Our work presents the capabilities of DA infrastructures in the health care sector, which lower the regulatory obstacles of sharing patient data.

Data regarding the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in Gauteng before the fourth wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), in which the omicron variant was dominant, are needed. METHODS: We conducted a seroepidemiologic survey from October 22 to December 9, 2021, in Gauteng to determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Households included in a previous seroepidemiologic survey (conducted from November 2020 to January 2021) were contacted; to account for changes in the survey population, there was a 10% increase in the households contacted, with the use of the same sampling framework. Dried-blood-spot samples were tested for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid protein with the use of quantitative assays. We also evaluated Covid-19 epidemiologic trends in Gauteng, including cases, hospitalizations, recorded deaths, and excess deaths from the start of the pandemic through January 12, 2022. RESULTS: Samples were obtained from 7010 participants, of whom 1319 (18.8%) had received a Covid-19 vaccine. The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG ranged from 56.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52.6 to 59.7) among children younger than 12 years of age to 79.7% (95% CI, 77.6 to 81.5) among adults older than 50 years of age. Vaccinated participants were more likely to be seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 than unvaccinated participants (93.1% vs. 68.4%). Epidemiologic data showed that the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased and subsequently declined more rapidly during the fourth wave than it had during the three previous waves. The incidence of infection was decoupled from the incidences of hospitalization, recorded death, and excess death during the fourth wave, as compared with the proportions seen during previous waves. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread underlying SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was observed in Gauteng before the omicron-dominant wave of Covid-19.

QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to describe the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of acute pediatric trauma admissions and procedures performed in a level-I trauma center in Cork University Hospital, Ireland. METHODS: We compared the number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures that occurred during the first 4 weeks of a nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 with that of the same 4-week period in each of the preceding 11 years. Seasonal variables were measured and controlled for using multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 545 pediatric patients (under 16 years of age) were included. Over 12 years, the lowest number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures was recorded during the 2020 pandemic. There was a significant correlation between the number of school days and the number of acute traumatic admissions, as well as the procedures performed. The relationship between the number of school days and the number of trauma procedures was evident even when controlling for confounder variables of seasonal variation. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the number of acute traumatic pediatric admissions and procedures performed in our level-I trauma center, likely because of a reduction in school days.

Here we examine two 5'-proximal cis-replication signals of different character in a defective interfering (DI) RNA of the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) that map within a 322-nucleotide (nt) sequence (136 nt from the genomic 5' untranslated region and 186 nt from the nonstructural protein 1 [nsp1]-coding region) not found in the otherwise-identical nonreplicating subgenomic mRNA7 (sgmRNA7). The natural DI RNA is structurally a fusion of the two ends of the BCoV genome that results in a single open reading frame between a partial nsp1-coding region and the entire N gene. (i) In the first examination, mutation analyses of a recently discovered long-range RNA-RNA base-paired structure between the 5' untranslated region and the partial nsp1-coding region showed that it, possibly in concert with adjacent stem-loops, is a cis-acting replication signal in the (+) strand. We postulate that the higher-order structure promotes (+)-strand synthesis. (ii) In the second examination, analyses of multiple frame shifts, truncations, and point mutations within the partial nsp1-coding region showed that synthesis of a PEFP core amino acid sequence within a group A lineage betacoronavirus-conserved NH2-proximal WAPEFPWM domain is required in cis for DI RNA replication.

METHODS: Longitudinal study within the prospective, multicenter UMBRELLA cohort of patients (being) treated for breast cancer. All cohort participants enrolled in UMBRELLA between October 2013 and November 2020 were sent a COVID-19-specific survey during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., April 2020 and November 2020, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 1106 (69.3%) and 822 (50.9%) cohort participants completed the survey in the first and second wave, respectively. The proportion of patients experiencing that their treatment or follow-up care was affected due to COVID-19 decreased from 28.4% (n = 198) in April 2020 to 14.8% (n = 103) in November 2020. Throughout the pandemic, one or more hospital consultations were postponed in 10.0% (n = 82) of all patients and changed into a teleconsultation in 23.1% (n = 190). The proportion of patients who experienced a higher threshold to contact their general practitioner due to COVID-19 decreased from 29.9% (n = 204) in the first wave to 20.8% (n = 145) in the second wave. In-person consultations remained most preferred in 35.2% (n = 289) of all patients. Nearly half of all patients (48.3%, n = 396) indicated that telehealth would be a useful alternative for in-person consultations in future.

This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. SUMMARY: This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics.","output":"The clinical epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 in children and adolescents mirrors the widening gap in healthcare disparities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Invasive fungal infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients and in the immunocompromised population.

Camptothecin has been shown to have antiviral activity against various viruses; however, whether it can inhibit FAdV-4 infection remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the anti-FAdV-4 effects and mechanisms of camptothecin in vitro and in vivo. Several camptothecin treatments were used to study the antiviral activity of camptothecin on FAdV-4-infected Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells. The FAdV-4 titers of mock and camptothecin-treated infected cell cultures were determined using tissue culture infective dose assay, and the FAdV-4 copy number was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the therapeutic effect of camptothecin on FAdV-4-infected chickens was also evaluated. The results showed that camptothecin significantly reduced the viral replication in LMH cells in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a reduction in viral titer, viral copy number, and viral Hexon protein expression. Camptothecin was also found to have a significant inhibitory effect on the viral replication step. Finally, camptothecin showed anti-FAdV-4 efficacy in the chicken infection model, and the survival rate was improved.

HIV/AIDS is among the greatest public health challenges confronting health authorities, with South Africa having the greatest prevalence of the disease in the world. There is little research into how Africans meet their health information needs on HIV/AIDS online, and this research gap impacts programming and educational responses to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This paper reports on how, in general, interest in the search terms HIV and AIDS mirrors the increase in people living with HIV and the decline in AIDS cases in South Africa. METHODS: Data on search trends for HIV and AIDS for South Africa were found using the search terms HIV and AIDS (categories: health, web search) on Google Trends. This was compared with data on estimated adults and children living with HIV, and AIDS-related deaths in South Africa, from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, and also with search interest in the topics HIV and AIDS on Wikipedia Afrikaans, the most developed local language Wikipedia service in South Africa. Nonparametric statistical tests were conducted to support the trends and associations identified in the data. RESULTS: Google Trends shows a statistically significant decline (P<.001) in search interest for AIDS relative to HIV in South Africa. This trend mirrors progress on the ground in South Africa and is significantly associated (P<.001) with a decline in AIDS-related deaths and people living longer with HIV. This trend was also replicated on Wikipedia Afrikaans, where there was a greater interest in HIV than AIDS. CONCLUSIONS: This statistically significant (P<.001) association between interest in the search terms HIV and AIDS in South Africa (2004-2019) and the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in the country (2004-2019) might be an indicator that multilateral efforts at combating HIV/AIDSparticularly through awareness raising and behavioral interventions in South Africaare bearing fruit, and this is not only evident on the ground, but is also reflected in the online information seeking on the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We acknowledge the limitation that in studying the association between Google search interests on HIV/AIDS and cases/deaths, causal relationships should not be drawn due to the limitations of the data.","output":"Searching for HIV and AIDS Health Information in South Africa, 2004-2019: Analysis of Google and Wikipedia Search Trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"I read with interest the article by Professor Pandit [1], but the section, Measuring R0, seems to demonstrate a flaw with this calculated figure.

The formula is in terms of the fraction of positive test results and test parameters, i.e., probability of true positives (sensitivity) and the probability of true negatives (specificity). The motivation of this work arises in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in which estimating the number of infected individuals depends on the sensitivity and specificity of the tests. In this context, it is shown that approximating the prevalence ratio by the ratio between the number of positive tests and the total number of tested individuals leads to dramatically high estimation errors, and thus, unadapted public health policies. The relevance of estimating the prevalence ratio using the formula presented in this work is that precision increases with the number of tests. Two conclusions are drawn from this work. First, in order to ensure that a reliable estimation is achieved with a finite number of tests, testing campaigns must be implemented with tests for which the sum of the sensitivity and the specificity is sufficiently different than one. Second, the key parameter for reducing the estimation error is the number of tests. For a large number of tests, as long as the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is different than one, the exact values of these parameters have very little impact on the estimation error.","output":"On the True Number of COVID-19 Infections: Effect of Sensitivity, Specificity and Number of Tests on Prevalence Ratio Estimation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The vaccinations against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV?2) play a decisive role in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. In the population, but also among health care workers (HCWs), there were concerns and skepticism about vaccinations even before the corona pandemic. METHODS: An online survey on the attitude of HCWs to vaccination against SARS-CoV?2 was carried out in December (December 3rdCDecember 12th, 2020) before and in February (February 1stCFebruary 10th, 2021) after the start of the vaccinations. Members of the German Society for Internal Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DGIIN) and the German Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DIVI) were invited by email and on Facebook. RESULTS: In December 2305 and in February 3501 people took part. The approval rate for vaccination increased from 85.2% to 92.1% (p < 0.001). There was also an increase in willingness to vaccinate (63.8% vs. 75.9%; p < 0.001). The female gender, membership of the professional group nursing staff and age < 45 years were significantly associated with a restricted willingness to vaccinate. There was also a decrease in concerns about efficacy, side effects and long-term damage. There was clear skepticism about the vaccine from AstraZeneca (Cambridge, United Kingdom). SUMMARY: Before and after the introduction of vaccinations against SARS-CoV?2, an increase in the willingness to vaccinate against SARS-CoV-2 can be shown in German HCWs. Technical experts must bring objectivity into the currently controversial debate through precise and transparent information and thus counteract vaccination skepticism, not only among HCWs.","output":"Einstellung zur Impfung gegen SARS-CoV-2: Umfrage unter Mitarbeitenden in Krankenh?usern vor und nach Beginn der Impfungen in den deutschen Krankenh?usern"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) is a global recognized superinfection in critically ill influenza patients.

RESULTS: Of the first 10 patients that required ECMO for COVID-19, the age ranged from 31 to 62 years with the majority (70%) being men. Seven (70%) had comorbidities. The majority (80%) of patients had known sick contact and exposure to COVID-19 positive patients or traveled to pandemic areas inside the United States within the 2 weeks before symptom onset. None of the patients were healthcare workers. The most common symptoms leading to the presentation were high fever &#8805;103F (90%), cough (80%) and dyspnea (70%), followed by fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms (both 30%), myalgia, loss of taste, pleuritic chest pain, and confusion (all 10%).

METHODS A twenty-question survey, using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth set to understand the functional changes of children with CP during the stay-athome period, was sent to parents in this prospective study. Motor function levels of children were determined by the Gross Motor Function Classification System parent report. The structural equation model was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS One hundred and three parents of children with CP participated. At least one of four children with CP had increased levels of anxiety (41.8%), and increased level of a sensation of pain (34%) and sleep problems (25.2%).

RESULTS: Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for &#8805; 65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for &#8805; 65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs. When we applied quartiles of actual African Region country vaccine storage capacity, routine immunization vaccine volumes exceeded national-level storage capacity for at least 75% of countries, but subnational levels had sufficient storage capacity for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines for at least 75% of countries. CONCLUSIONS: In the WHO African Region, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would substantially increase doses per vaccinator and cold storage capacity requirements over routine immunization baselines. Pandemic vaccination campaigns would increase storage requirements of national-level stores already at their limits, but sufficient capacity exists at subnational levels. Immediate attention to strengthening immunization systems is essential to support pandemic responses.","output":"The potential effects of deploying SARS-Cov-2 vaccines on cold storage capacity and immunization workload in countries of the WHO African Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article is for analysis of new experience in the national context - organisation of distance education in preschool education and the challenges in application of the innovation, when the implementation as such has not been planned and modelled for getting ready for it in advance. In Lithuania, before the COVID-19 pandemic distance education in the preschool education meant for reparation of a child ready for school was not applied, there were no specific guidelines, tested teaching platforms or pedagogic practices. The study deals with the results of a focus groups research performed in June of 2020, designated for discussing of experiences of the Lithuanian preschool education institutions in distance education gained during the quarantine (16/03/2020 to 29/05/2020). The performed analysis of experiences in organisation of distant education in preschool education disclosed the essential challenges faced when applying this form of education in the education of six-year-old children. It has been established that the key challenges organizing distance education in the preschool education are related to lack of the IT solutions for distant education;readiness of the participants of the education process for distant education and engagement into such process of education, as well as the lack of support from national and regional institutions in organisation of distant education. The results of the research open possibilities for further researches which are necessary for efficient and sustainable distant education integration into preschool education. In this background, explicit, deep research related to analysis of appropriateness of distance education platforms in the stages of early age, search for didactic solutions of digital content for them and deep researches of implementation cases and etc. is necessary. ? 2021 Research Group Education and Virtual Learning (GREAV).

How the nervous system develops its diversity from a few neural stem cells remains a challenging question. Spatial and temporal patterning mechanisms provide an efficient model through which diversity can be generated. The molecular mechanism of spatiotemporal patterning has been studied extensively in Drosophila melanogaster, where distinct sets of transcription factors define the spatial domains and temporal windows that give rise to different cell types. Similarly, in vertebrates, spatial domains defined by transcription factors produce different types of neurons in the brain and neural tube. At the same time, different cortical neuronal types are generated within the same cell lineage with a specific birth order. However, we still do not understand how the orthogonal information of spatial and temporal patterning is integrated into the progenitor and post-mitotic cells to combinatorially give rise to different neurons. In this review, after introducing spatial and temporal patterning in Drosophila and mice, we discuss possible mechanisms that neural progenitors may use to integrate spatial and temporal information. We finally review the functional implications of spatial and temporal patterning and conclude envisaging how small alterations of these mechanisms can lead to the evolution of new neuronal cell types.","output":"Integration of Spatial and Temporal Patterning in the Invertebrate and Vertebrate Nervous System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract During the COVID-19 pandemic, universities worldwide are going into ?emergency moderadically transforming education by switching to online and e-learning education In the face of these emergent changes, many academic teachers who are unwilling to use e-learning or who lack the appropriate competences are suddenly being forced to teach via electronic devices and the Internet But how will this COVID-19 forced e-learning influence academic teachers' motivation and performance?

Methods A total of 200 consecutive patients undergoing Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy by a single surgeon were prospectively evaluated using either the valveless trocar (n = 100) or standard trocars (n = 100). Patient demographics, intra-operative parameters, length of stay, presence or absence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, analog pain score at 0-6 hours, 6-12 hours, 12-18 hours, and >24 hours, and 30-day postoperative complications were analyzed. Results There were no significant differences in estimated blood loss, intra-operative urine output, length of stay, or 30-day complication rates between the two groups. While the VTS group had higher Body Mass Index (BMI) (28.45 vs. 27.23; P = 0.049), the operative time was significantly shorter in the VTS group (146 minutes vs. 167 minutes; P < .005). The VTS group experienced fewer episodes of nausea (2% vs. 10%; P = 0.0172). The VTS group had less pain intensity compared to the control in the first 18 hours: 0-6 hours (1.9 vs. 2.5; P = 0.034), 6-12 hours (2.8 vs. 3.6; P = 0.044), and 12-18 hours (2.2 vs. 3.1; P = 0.049), respectively.

In contrast to SARS-CoV-1 (SARS), COVID-19 has presented as an often bi-phasic, multi-organ pathology, with a proclivity for severe disease in the elderly and those with hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Whilst death is usually related to respiratory collapse, autopsy reveals multi-organ pathology. Chronic pulmonary disease is underrepresented in the group with severe COVID-19. A commonality of aberrant renin angiotensin system (RAS) is suggested in the at-risk group. The identification of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor allowing viral entry to cells precipitated our interest in the role of ACE2 in COVID-19 pathogenesis. We propose that COVID-19 is a viral multisystem disease, with dominant vascular pathology, mediated by global reduction in ACE2 function, pronounced in disease conditions with RAS bias toward angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) over ACE2. It is further complicated by organ specific pathology related to loss of ACE2 expressing cells particularly affecting the endothelium, alveolus, glomerulus and cardiac microvasculature. The possible upregulation in ACE2 receptor expression may predispose individuals with aberrant RAS status to higher viral load on infection and relatively more cell loss. Relative ACE2 deficiency leads to enhanced and protracted tissue, and vessel exposure to angiotensin II, characterised by vasoconstriction, enhanced thrombosis, cell proliferation and recruitment, increased tissue permeability, and cytokine production (including IL-6) resulting in inflammation. Additionally, there is a profound loss of the protective angiotensin (1-7), a vasodilator with anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiproliferative, antifibrotic, anti-arrhythmic, and antioxidant activity. Our model predicts global vascular insult related to direct endothelial cell damage, vasoconstriction and thrombosis with a disease specific cytokine profile related to angiotensin II rather than cytokine storm. Our proposed mechanism of lung injury provides an explanation for early hypoxia without reduction in lung compliance and suggests a need for revision of treatment protocols to address vasoconstriction, thromboprophylaxis, and to minimize additional small airways and alveolar trauma via ventilation choice. Our model predicts long term sequelae of scarring/fibrosis in vessels, lungs, renal and cardiac tissue with protracted illness in at-risk individuals. It is hoped that our model stimulates review of current diagnostic and therapeutic intervention protocols, particularly with respect to early anticoagulation, vasodilatation and revision of ventilatory support choices.","output":"COVID-19 as a Viral Functional ACE2 Deficiency Disorder with ACE2 Related Multi-organ Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the first reports of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread to other parts of China and across the world. Although a few studies have assessed the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the changes in clinical characteristics during disease progression remain unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of 62 patients who died from COVID-19 at the Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 26 and February 17, 2020. We compared the clinical features on admission and at the last follow-up before death. RESULTS: Of the 62 patients with COVID-19, 41 (66%) patients were male, and 21 (34%) were female. The median age was 72 years (interquartile range (IQR), 54-88), and 45 (72.5%) patients had preexisting conditions. The median time from symptom onset to the first visit at the clinic was three days, while the median time from symptom onset to death was 18.5 days. During disease progression, the amounts of arterial gases worsened, and liver, renal, and heart dysfunction was observed. Due to the cytokine storm, infection-related biomarkers, including lactic acid, C-reactive protein, and interleukine-6, gradually worsened during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that during hospitalization, many COVID-19 patients experienced multiple organ dysfunction and cytokine storm. The time from symptom onset to death was only 18.5 days, highlighting the disease's rapid progression.

Majority of the studies that evaluated olfactory impairment in COVID-19 used questionnaires (subjective smell evaluations) and did not compare the results with objective or semiobjective measures of smell. We performed smell testing in hospitalised and self-isolated patients with COVID-19 and control participants. METHODS: Fifty-five COVID-19 and 44 control participants underwent smell testing, using Burghart Snif?n Sticks Screening 12 Test. Participants also rated their smelling capability on the numerical scale. Differences between groups and correlation between smell loss and time from acute onset of symptoms were tested, as well as correlation between results of smell test and subjective assessment of smell. RESULTS: Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 correctly determined 6.5/12 odorants compared with 10/12 in the self-isolated and 11/12 in the control group (p<0.001). Hyposmia or anosmia were present in 87.5% of hospitalised and 29.0% of self-isolated patients (p<0.001). The correlation between subjective self-assessment and results of smell testing was non-significant in both groups of patients with COVID-19, while there was a moderate positive correlation (p=0.001, Spearmans correlation coefficient=0.499) in control participants. CONCLUSION: Contrary to some previous reports suggesting that the presence of olfactory loss may predict milder course of disease, our study found that a vast majority of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 had prominent olfactory impairment.

METHODS: Descriptive statistical analyses were performed for population, density, COVID-19 tests administered, and positive cases for all 67 Alabama counties. RESULTS: Tests reported per capita appeared to suggest widespread statewide testing. However, there was little correlation (r=0.28, P=.02) between tests per capita and the number of cases. In terms of population density, new cases were higher in areas with a higher population density, despite relatively lower test rates as a function of density.

This complication seems to develop after the infection rather than during the acute phase of COVID-19. The clinical features are similar to a well-known inflammatory syndrome in children, Kawasaki disease, and it can lead to collapse and multiple organ failure requiring intensive care. The COVID-19-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and adolescents is referred to mutually as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally linked with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) correlated with COVID-19, and here, it is referred to as MIS-C. Case Presentation. This report describes a nine-month-old Asian infant presented with a two-week history of fever with nonspecific signs of viral illness and erythematous rash. The clinical and biochemical findings were compatible with complicated typical Kawasaki disease (KD). The infant fulfilled the World Health Organization criteria for MIS-C and was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin and anticoagulation, which he responded well to. He was discharged home in good condition after almost 3 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a rare but new phenomenon attributed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. We report the first case report of MIS-C in the United Arab Emirates and Arab region. Among KD's complications, massive aneurysm with thrombosis is rare and usually will have deleterious results if not diagnosed and managed promptly.","output":"COVID-19-Related Giant Coronary Aneurysms in an Infant with Multisystem Inflammatory Disorder in Children: The First Case Report from the United Arab Emirates and the Arab Region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"National responses to a pandemic require populations to comply through personal behaviors that occur in a cultural context. Here we show that aggregated cultural values of nations, derived from World Values Survey data, have been at least as important as top-down government actions in predicting the impact of COVID-19.

At the state level, the complementary variables of government efficiency and public trust in institutions predict lower death numbers. The difference in effect between individual beliefs and behaviors, versus state-level actions, suggests that open cosmopolitan societies may face greater challenges in limiting a future pandemic or other event requiring a coordinated national response among the population.

Our results also demonstrated significantly different plasma metabolic profiling in recovered COVID-19 patients even at 3 months after their hospital discharge, which was mainly related to purine pathways, amino acids, lipids, and amine metabolism. Certain regions with cerebral WM alterations in the recovered patients showed significant correlations with different metabolites and the mental health scores.

Moreover, it seems that even in patients with normal glycaemic status, COVID-19 may predispose to the development of hyperglycaemia which modulates immune mechanisms and inflammatory responses, with direct effects on morbidity and mortality. Thus, taking into account these scientific data, as well as the increased frequency of diabetes in the general population, we aimed to assess the risk of an unfavourable outcome of diabetic patients, which is in a strong connection with the presence and severity of pulmonary disease such as interstitial pneumonia/bronchopneumonia, as well as the effectiveness of Tocilizumab administration.

Characterizing their biologically-active conformations and minimum motifs for function represents a requisite step to developing them into efficacious and safe therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that metallating HDPs with Cu(2+) is an effective chemical strategy to improve their cytotoxicity on cancer cells. Mechanistically, we find that prepared as Cu(2+)-complexes, the peptides not only physically but also chemically damage lipid membranes. Our testing ground features piscidins 1 and 3 (P1/3), two amphipathic, histidine-rich, membrane-interacting, and cell-penetrating HDPs that are -helical bound to membranes. To investigate their membrane location, permeabilization effects, and lipid-oxidation capability, we employ neutron reflectometry, impedance spectroscopy, neutron diffraction, and UV spectroscopy. While P1-apo is more potent than P3-apo, metallation boosts their cytotoxicities by up to two- and seven-fold, respectively. Remarkably, P3-Cu(2+) is particularly effective at inserting in bilayers, causing water crevices in the hydrocarbon region and placing Cu(2+) near the double bonds of the acyl chains, as needed to oxidize them. This study points at a new paradigm where complexing HDPs with Cu(2+) to expand their mechanistic reach could be explored to design more potent peptide-based anticancer therapeutics.","output":"Copper-binding anticancer peptides from the piscidin family: an expanded mechanism that encompasses physical and chemical bilayer disruption"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current 2019-nCoV outbreak is becoming extremely noxious and has affected the whole world.

Importantly, however, OCS dose reductions must be conducted without loss of disease control. MAIN BODY Herein, we describe the development of OCS-sparing study methodologies for biologic therapies in patients with asthma. In particular, we focus on four randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group studies of varying sizes (key single-center study [n = 20], SIRIUS [n = 135], ZONDA [n = 220], VENTURE [n = 210]) and one open-label study (PONENTE [n = 598]), which assessed the effect of asthma biologics (mepolizumab, benralizumab or dupilumab) on OCS use using predefined OCS-tapering schedules. In particular, we discuss the evolution of study design elements in these studies, including patient eligibility criteria, the use of tailored OCS dose reduction schedules, monitoring of outcomes, the use of biomarkers and use of repetitive assessments of adrenal function during OCS tapering.

However, a systematic evaluation of the current literature investigating the impacts of metal mixtures on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and outcomes has thus far not been performed. This scoping review aims to summarize published epidemiology literature on the cardiotoxicity of exposure to multiple metals. We performed systematic searches of MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, and Web of Science to identify peer-reviewed studies employing statistical mixture analysis methods to evaluate the impact of metal mixtures on CVD risk factors and outcomes among nonoccupationally exposed populations. The search was limited to papers published on or after 1998, when the first dedicated funding for mixtures research was granted by NIEHS, through 1 October 2021. Twenty-nine original research studies were identified for review. A notable increase in relevant mixtures publications was observed starting in 2019. The majority of eligible studies were conducted in the United States (n = 10) and China (n = 9). Sample sizes ranged from 127 to 10,818. Many of the included studies were cross-sectional in design. Four primary focus areas included: (i) blood pressure and/or diagnosis of hypertension (n = 15), (ii) risk of preeclampsia (n = 3), (iii) dyslipidemia and/or serum lipid markers (n = 5), and (iv) CVD outcomes, including stroke incidence or coronary heart disease (n = 8). The most frequently investigated metals included cadmium, lead, arsenic, and cobalt, which were typically measured in blood (n = 15). The most commonly utilized multipollutant analysis approaches were Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), weighted quantile sum regression (WQSR), and principal component analysis (PCA). To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review to assess exposure to metal mixtures in relation to CVD risk factors and outcomes. Recommendations for future studies evaluating the associations of exposure to metal mixtures with risk of CVDs and related risk factors include extending environmental mixtures epidemiologic studies to populations with wider metals exposure ranges, including other CVD risk factors or outcomes outside hypertension or dyslipidemia, using repeated measurement of metals to detect windows of susceptibility, and further examining the impacts of potential effect modifiers and confounding factors, such as fish and seafood intake.","output":"Exposure to Metal Mixtures in Association with Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Outcomes: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cardiac arrest is a major public health concern worldwide. The extent and types of randomized controlled trials (RCT)-our most reliable source of clinical evidence-conducted in these high-risk patients over recent years are largely unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS We performed a systematic review, identifying all RCTs published in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library from 1995 to 2014 that focused on the acute treatment of nontraumatic cardiac arrest in adults. We then extracted data on the setting of study populations, types and timing of interventions studied, risk of bias, outcomes reported, and how these factors have changed over time. Over this 20-year period, 92 RCTs were published containing 64 309 patients (median, 225.5 per trial). Of these, 81 RCTs (88.0%) involved out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, whereas 4 (4.3%) involved in-hospital cardiac arrest and 7 (7.6%) included both. Eighteen RCTs (19.6%) were performed in the United States, 68 (73.9%) were performed outside the United States, and 6 (6.5%) were performed in both settings. Thirty-eight RCTs (41.3%) evaluated drug therapy, 39 (42.4%) evaluated device therapy, and 15 (16.3%) evaluated protocol improvements. Seventy-four RCTs (80.4%) examined interventions during the cardiac arrest, 15 (16.3%) examined post cardiac arrest treatment, and 3 (3.3%) studied both. Overall, reporting of the risk of bias was limited. The most common outcome reported was return of spontaneous circulation: 86 (93.5%) with only 22 (23.9%) reporting survival beyond 6 months. Fifty-three RCTs (57.6%) reported global ordinal outcomes, whereas 15 (16.3%) reported quality-of-life. RCTs in the past 5 years were more likely to be focused on protocol improvements and postcardiac arrest care.

This innovative idea is so recent that it requires further attention and debate. The significant role played by vimentin in virus-induced infection however is well established: (1) vimentin has been reported as a co-receptor and/or attachment site for SARS-CoV; (2) vimentin is involved in viral replication in cells; (3) vimentin plays a fundamental role in both the viral infection and the consequent explosive immune-inflammatory response and (4) a lower vimentin expression is associated with the inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. Moreover, the absence of vimentin in mice makes them resistant to lung injury. Since vimentin has a twofold role in the disease, not only being involved in the viral infection but also in the associated life-threatening lung inflammation, the use of vimentin-targeted drugs may offer a synergistic advantage as compared with other treatments not targeting vimentin. Consequently, we speculate here that drugs which decrease the expression of vimentin can be used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and advise that several Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs be immediately tested in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, thus broadening therapeutic options for this type of viral infection.","output":"Vimentin as a target for the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The diagnosis of COVID-19 is made using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) but its sensitivity varies from 20 to 100%.

Aims: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR+), negative likelihood ratio (LR?) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of using GD as a triage symptom prior to RT-PCR. Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched up to 20 June 2021. Studies published in English were included if they compared the frequency of GD in COVID-19 adult patients (proven by RT-PCR) to COVID-19 negative controls in case control or cross-sectional studies. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: 21,272 COVID-19 patients and 52,298 COVID-19 negative patients were included across 44 studies from 21 countries. All studies were of moderate to high risk of bias. Patients with GD were more likely to test positive for COVID-19: DOR 6.39 (4.86C8.40), LR+ 3.84 (3.04C4.84), LR? 0.67 (0.64C0.70), pooled sensitivity 0.37 (0.29C0.47) and pooled specificity 0.92 (0.89C0.94). While history/questionnaire-based assessments were predictive of RT-PCR positivity (DOR 6.62 (4.95C8.85)), gustatory testing was not (DOR 3.53 (0.98C12.7)).

Elderly individuals are at high risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 due to factors associated with aging and a higher prevalence of medical comorbidities and, therefore, they are more vulnerable to possible lasting neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments. Several reports have described insomnia, depressed mood, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and cognitive impairment in a proportion of patients after discharge from the hospital. The potential mechanisms underlying these symptoms are not fully understood but are probably multifactorial, involving direct neurotrophic effect of SARS-CoV-2, consequences of long intensive care unit stays, the use of mechanical ventilation and sedative drugs, brain hypoxia, systemic inflammation, secondary effects of medications used to treat COVID-19 and dysfunction of peripheral organs. Chronic diseases such as dementia are a particular concern not only because they are associated with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality but also because COVID-19 further exacerbates the vulnerability of those with cognitive impairment. In patients with dementia, COVID-19 frequently has an atypical presentation with mental status changes complicating the early identification of cases. COVID-19 has had a dramatical impact in long-term care facilities, where rates of infection and mortality have been very high.

METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients treated with PFs at our institution between June 2010 and April 2021 was performed. PF was defined as a concurrent fracture in at least 3 of 4 facial subunits (frontal, upper midface, lower midface, and mandible). Data regarding patient demographics, causes of injury, location of fractures, major concomitant injuries, and postinjury complications were collected, and the FISS score was collected from each patient. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.0. RESULTS: A total of 227 patients were enrolled. The most commonly fractured bones were the maxillary sinus wall (92.1%), mandible (82.8%), and zygomatic arch (75.3%), and the most common fracture sites in PFs were graphically presented. Four PF patterns were defined: FULM (n = 60), FUL (n = 39), ULM (n = 127), and FUM (n = 1). There was a significant association between PF patterns and sex (p = 0.018), the number of concomitant injuries (p = 0.014), and early surgical airway management (p = 0.003). Different PF patterns were significantly correlated with different types of concomitant injuries and complications. The FISS score showed a significant difference with PF patterns (p = 0.000) and sex (p = 0.007), and a FISS value of 11 or more is the appropriate cutoff for the prediction of multiple concomitant injuries and complications. CONCLUSIONS: Both the anatomic PF categories and FISS were significantly correlated with various concomitant injuries and complications. The combination of PF categories and FISS provided a better positive and negative prediction of concomitant injuries and complications for PF patients.

In the United States (US), extensive debate has ensued as to the risk posed by the disease, whether the health system is prepared to manage a high volume of critical cases, whether any number of public health responses are necessary and appropriate, and the appropriate ways to prevent, manage, and treat the pandemic. I hypothesized that the interplay between scientists, policymakers, and the public in an open forum was associated with increased overall public trust in science and scientists, but that this was moderated by political orientation and/or religious commitment. In the context of a public health emergency, it is important to understand the degree to which science and scientists are trusted to produce information that can provide reassurance and also can explain the details of a highly complex event such as a viral pandemic while providing actionable recommendations. STUDY DESIGN: The study design was analytic cross-sectional. METHODS: Data were obtained on March 17-18, 2020, from a sample of 242 US-based Amazon Mechanical Turk users. Respondents completed a 49-question survey consisting of key sociodemographic variables, political affiliation, religious commitment, and two iterations of the Trust in Science and Scientist Inventory (one for March 2020, and one for December 2019 using retrospective recall). Changes in mean level of trust and interaction with political affiliation and/or religious commitment were assessed using mixed ANOVA via the general linear model. RESULTS: On a scale from 1 (low trust) to 5 (high trust), the mean level of trust in science and scientists was static; 3.82 in December 2019 and 3.81 in March 2020. Conservative political orientation and high religious commitment were associated with significantly less overall trust in science; the interaction effect suggested that liberal trust in science decreased slightly from December 2019 to March 2020, whereas conservative trust increased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: Counter to my expectations, the overall level of trust in science remained static after the first several months of COVID-19 in the US, although there is some evidence that political orientation was associated with magnitude and directionality of change in trust.

Results Overall, 5274 participants returned the survey. The prevalence of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety was 21.5%, 10.9%, and 6%, respectively. Female gender (= 0.47, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) and more members of the household (= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.07) were correlated with a higher degree of anxiety, while older age (= -0.27, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.20), having larger social network (= -0.17, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.13), social support (= -0.28, 95% CI: -0.32 to -0.23), and higher income (>2000 Jordanian Dinars vs reference, = -0.52, 95% CI: -0.71 to -0.33) were correlated with lower BAI scores. Conclusion Our findings showed that approximately four out of every ten participants experienced quarantine-related anxiety. Younger participants, women, and people with poor social support were more likely to experience quarantine-related anxiety. These findings highlight the importance of targeting these groups to mitigate the consequence of home quarantine on public health.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: early quarantine-related anxiety and its correlates among Jordanians."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Canadian intensive care unit (ICU) workers. METHODS: Between June and August 2020, we distributed a cross-sectional online survey of ICU workers evaluating the impact of the pandemic, coping strategies, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Impact of Events Scale-Revised), and psychological distress, anxiety, and depression (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). We performed regression analyses to determine the predictors of psychological symptoms. RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 455 ICU workers (80% women; 67% from Ontario; 279 nurses, 69 physicians, and 107 other healthcare professionals). Respondents felt that their job put them at great risk of exposure (60%), were concerned about transmitting COVID-19 to family members (76%), felt more stressed at work (67%), and considered leaving their job (37%). Overall, 25% had probable PTSD and 18% had minimal or greater psychological distress. Nurses were more likely to report PTSD symptoms (33%) and psychological distress (23%) than physicians (5% for both) and other health disciplines professionals (19% and 14%). Variables associated with PTSD and psychological distress included female sex (beta-coefficient [B], 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 2.10 and B, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.79 to 5.78, respectively; P < 0.001 for differences in scores across groups) and perceived increased risk due to PPE shortage or inadequate PPE training (B, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.51 to 2.31 and B, 4.88; 95% CI, 3.34 to 6.43, respectively). Coping strategies included talking to friends/family/colleagues (80%), learning about COVID-19 (78%), and physical exercise (68%). Over half endorsed the following workplace strategies as valuable: hospital-provided scrubs, clear communication and protocols by hospitals, knowing their voice is heard, subsidized parking, and gestures of appreciation from leadership. CONCLUSIONS: This survey study shows that ICU workers have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with high levels of stress and psychological burden. Respondents endorsed communication, protocols, and appreciation from leadership as helpful mitigating strategies.

One strategy to limit clearance by metabolism and excretion, and improving the stability of therapeutic proteins, is their fusion to the immunoglobulin fragment crystallizable region (Fc). The Fc region plays multiple roles in (i) dimerization for the formation of Y-shaped structure of Ig, (ii) Fc-mediated effector functions, (iii) extension of serum half-life, and (iv) a cost-effective purification tag. Plants and in particular Nicotiana benthamiana have proven to be suitable expression platforms for several recombinant therapeutic proteins. Despite the enormous success of their use for the production of full-length monoclonal antibodies, the expression of Fc-fused therapeutic proteins in plants has shown limitations. Many Fc-fusion proteins expressed in plants show different degrees of instability resulting in high amounts of Fc-derived degradation products. To address this issue, we used erythropoietin (EPO) as a reporter protein and evaluated the efforts to enhance the expression of full-length EPO-Fc targeted to the apoplast of N. benthamiana. Our results show that the instability of the fusion protein is independent from the Fc origin or IgG subclass and from the peptide sequence used to link the two domains. We also show that a similar instability occurs upon the expression of individual heavy chains of monoclonal antibodies and ScFv-Fc that mimic the Y-shape of antibodies but lack the light chain. We propose that in this configuration, steric hindrance between the protein domains leads to physical instability. Indeed, mutations of critical residues located on the Fc dimerization interface allowed the expression of fully stable EPO monomeric Fc-fusion proteins. We discuss the limitations of Fc-fusion technology in N. benthamiana transient expression systems and suggest strategies to optimize the Fc-based scaffolds on their folding and aggregation resistance in order to improve the stability.","output":"The Instability of Dimeric Fc-Fusions Expressed in Plants Can Be Solved by Monomeric Fc Technology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Telemedicine has emerged as a feasible adjunct to in-person care in multiple clinical contexts, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and its role has expanded in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there exists a general paucity of information surrounding best practice recommendations for conducting specialty or disease-specific virtual care. Aims The purpose of this study was to systematically review existing best practice guidelines for conducting telemedicine encounters, both in general and specific to patients with IBD. Methods A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) of existing guidelines for the provision of virtual care was performed. Data was synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis (SWiM) guideline, and the AGREE II tool was used to evaluate quality of evidence Results A total of 60 studies providing guidance for virtual care encounters were included;52% of these were published during the COVID-19 pandemic. No gastroenterology-specific guidelines were found. The majority (95%) of provider guidelines specified a type of virtual encounter to which their guidelines applied. Of included studies, 65% provided guidance regarding confidentiality/security, 58% discussed technology/setup, and 56% commented on patient consent. 31 studies also provided guidance to patients or caregivers. Overall guideline quality was poor. Conclusions General best practices for successful telemedicine encounters include ensuring confidentiality and consent, preparation prior to a visit, and clear patient communication. Future studies should aim to objectively assess the efficacy of existing clinician practices in order to further optimize the provision of virtual care for specific populations, such as patients with IBD.

Procedural volumes increased at most institutions (70.7%) and most were performing previously postponed cases (90.7%). Ninety-seven percent of institutions were performing pre-endoscopy screening with 78.7% testing all patients. Many (34.7%) have performed procedures on COVID-19 positive patients. There was significantly less PPE reuse (p < 0.05) and fewer institutions recommending full PPE for all endoscopies (43.2% vs 59.2%, p = 0.013).

The hypothesis of this study was that confinement reduced orthopaedic and trauma surgical activity. The main objective was to assess orthopaedic and trauma surgical activity during confinement and to compare it to the activity outside confinement. MATERIALS & METHODS: This was a retrospective, monocentric, observational and comparative study of a continuous cohort of patients included during the confinement period of March 16th to May 11th, 2020. This cohort was retrospectively compared to a group of patients over the same non-confinement period in the previous year, from March 16th to May 11th, 2019. The primary outcome measured was the incidence rate of surgical activity in 2020 versus 2019 over an identical period. The secondary outcome was the analysis of the trauma identified. RESULTS: The number of patients operated on was significantly reduced during confinement: 194 patients were included in 2020, i.e. an incidence of 57 per 100,000 inhabitants against 772 patients included in 2019, i.e. an incidence of 227 per 100,000 inhabitants; p<0.001. Planned orthopaedic surgery decreased from an incidence rate of 147 in 2019 to 5 in 2020 per 100,000 inhabitants (p<0.001). Trauma surgery decreased from an incidence rate of 80 in 2019 to 50 in 2020 per 100,000 inhabitants (p: NS). We found a significant increase in patients over 65 years of age during confinement, 70% compared to 61% in 2019; p = 0.04. The rate of femoral neck fractures was significantly increased during confinement, 48.5% compared to 39.3% in 2019; p = 0.03. Degenerative surgery was significantly reduced during confinement (p<0.001). DISCUSSION: This study shows that the surgical activity of orthopaedics and trauma was significantly reduced by confinement, with a difference in incidence of 170 per 100,000 inhabitants, thus confirming the hypothesis of the authors. This decrease is due to both the cessation of planned orthopaedics and the 40% decrease in the number of trauma patients. During confinement, the percentage of patients over the age of 65 with a fracture increased significantly. CONCLUSION: Confinement had a significant impact on orthopaedic and trauma surgical activity.

METHODS: A nationwide study was conducted from March 24 to April 3, 2020, whereby data were collected via an online self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: Responses from 12,332 participants were analyzed. Participants mean knowledge score was 23.2 (SD 4.3) out of 30. Most participants recognized the cause of COVID-19, its routes of transmission, its symptoms and signs, predisposing factors, and prevention measures. Social media was the leading source of information. Participants recognized the dangers of the situation and felt responsible for following social distancing protocols, as well as isolating themselves upon symptom presentation. Participants mean practice score was 20.7 (SD 2.2) out of 24. Nearly none of the respondents went on a trip, and 92% (n=11,342) washed their hands before touching their faces.

As it is still not possible to predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will end, phone consultation and prescription are likely to continue for some time. Hence, it is expected that telemedicine will naturally settle in the medical field in the near future.

Malaria has been successfully eradicated since 1961 in Japan and now only imported malaria cases are encountered. However, as the number of Japanese people who are going abroad and also the number of foreigners who are visiting Japan increases (about 16 and 5 millions, respectively, in 2001), so does the chance for Japanese doctors to see imported malaria or transfusion-transmitted malaria cases. In fact, the total number of the patients with acute malaria in Japan has been around 100C150 annually for the last 10 years. Of those, about 75% are Japanese and 25% are foreigners, and about 75% are male and 25% are female. The peak age is in the 20 s. Recently, about 45% of patients are Plasmodium falciparum and another 45% Plasmodium vivax infections. The former species is likely to be seen in travelers coming back from African countries and the latter is mainly from Asian countries. The important issue is that patients in Japan have not been diagnosed promptly nor treated properly because doctors in Japan are no longer familiar with tropical medicine. Therefore, some patients are dying from severe malaria as a consequence. As it is, most of the effective medicines for drug-resistant malaria or severe malaria have not been registered in Japan.

By inducing peripheral B cell aplasia, anti-CD20 depleting agents are hypothesised to significantly impair serological responses to neoantigens, including the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein within SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Seropositivity following SARS-CoV-2 is the strongest, measurable correlate of protection from severe COVID-19. Understanding the kinetics of B cell reconstitution and vaccine responsiveness following exposure to B cell depleting agents is essential to maximise vaccine efficacy in patients vulnerable to severe COVID-19. Methods: 80 patients with underlying haematological malignancy and 38 patients with underlying rheumatological disease previously treated with anti-CD20 B cell depleting agents were studied following their second dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (median time to sampling: 46.5d, IQR: 33.8-63.3). Lymphocyte subset (CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56/16) enumeration was performed using 6 colour flow cytometry (BD Trucount). Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein antibodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (The Binding Site, Human Anti-IgG/A/M SARS-CoV-2-ELISA). The relationship between immune reconstitution following B cell depletion and vaccine responsiveness was explored. Results: In the haematology cohort (median age 70y, IQR 60.3-76.0, 62.5% male), overall seropositivity following vaccination was 60.0%. Individuals on active chemotherapy had significantly lower seroprevalence than those vaccinated following the completion of chemotherapy (22.7% vs 74.1%, p<0.0001). In the rheumatology cohort (median age 65y, IQR 58.3-70.8, 39.9% male), overall seropositivity was 69.4%. In both cohorts, vaccine non-responders had significantly smaller populations of peripheral CD19+ B cells (haematology: 0.20 vs 0.02 x10 9/L, p=0.004, rheumatology: 0.07 vs 0.01 x10 9/L, p=0.03). The magnitude of the antibody response following vaccination did not differ between recipients of Tozinameran and Vaxzeveria in either cohort. Vaccine responsiveness was lower in the first 6 months following B cell depletion therapy; 42.9% in the haematology cohort and 33.3% in the rheumatology cohort, increasing to 100% and 75% respectively in individuals receiving their second dose 6-12 months following B cell depletion (Figure 1). B cell reconstitution in the 7-12 month window following B cell depletion was faster in haematology compared to rheumatology patients (77.8% v 22.2% achieving normal B cell count, p=0.005) and associated with improved vaccine responsiveness. However, persistent immunodeficiency occurred in some haematology patients following completion of treatment: 25% of patients who had completed therapy at least 36 months previously failed to respond to vaccination. In this cohort of vaccine non-responders, 83.3% of individuals had B cell numbers within the normal range. These patients had all previously been treated for follicular lymphoma suggesting a specific mechanism for long-range secondary immunodeficiency in these patients. Conclusions: Serological responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is poor during active chemotherapy for haematological malignancy and in the first 6 months following B cell depletion, regardless of underlying disease. Vaccine responsiveness significantly improves in the 7-12 month window following B cell depletion. Compared to haematology patients, B cell reconstitution is slower in rheumatology patients and associated with reduced vaccine responsiveness, possibly due to the use of additional concurrent disease-modifying anti-rheumatic therapies. Furthermore, long-term secondary immunodeficiency occurs in a minority of haematology patients. To maximise the efficacy from SARS-CoV-2 booster vaccination and optimal utilisation of available vaccine doses, immunisations should be delivered at least 6 months following the administration of anti-CD20 depleting drugs.

Many of these changes have been serially modified in adaptation to growing service demands and department provision capacity. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on the foot and ankle service at our trauma unit, assessing whether these adaptations to practice were justifiable, successful and sustainable for the future. This was a single-centre, retrospective cohort study analysing the patient care pathway from admission to discharge, for two pre-defined timeframes: Phase 0 (pre-lockdown phase) and Phase 1 (lockdown phase). Patients were split into stable and unstable injuries depending on their fracture pattern. The follow-up modality and duration were evaluated. Trauma throughput for the equivalent timeframe in 2019 was also analysed for comparison. There were 106 unstable fractures and 100 stable fractures in 2020.78 interventional procedures were performed on 72 patients with unstable fractures in Phase-1. Close contact casting was performed on 13 patients at presentation in the ED. Selective patients underwent partial fixation in theatre, which still provided adequate stability. 35% of patients with a stable fracture were discharged directly from the ED with written advice from a review letter. The treatment modality in selective patients, particularly the vulnerable should be carefully assessed. Interventions performed at presentation often negate the need for admission. Partial fixation reduces intraoperative time and surgical insult. Integrating telemedicine into the care pathway, particularly for stable ankle fractures reduces the need for physician-patient contact and eases follow-up burden. Many of our recommended changes are easily replicated in other clinical settings. Should these adaptations demonstrate long-term sustainability, it is likely they will remain incorporated into future clinical practice.","output":"Foot and ankle trauma management during the COVID-19 pandemic: Experiences from a major trauma unit"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transition from pregnancy through early postpartum can be a particularly vulnerable time for women as they adjust to the changes of motherhood.

METHODS A retrospective review of our prospectively maintained database identified all patients treated by SAC for an UIA in 2 institutions. The clinical charts, procedural data and angiographic results were reviewed. RESULTS Between 2004 and 2012, we identified 164 patients with 183 UIA. There were 115 women and 49 men with a mean age of 46 years. Embolization was successful in all patients. Procedural morbidity and mortality rates were 2.2% and 0% respectively. Immediate anatomical outcome included 54 complete occlusion (29.5%), 43 neck remnants (23.5%) and 86 incomplete occlusions (47%). Imaging follow-up was available in 137 patients (mean=26 months, range 3 to 99 months) and it showed 104 complete occlusions (75.9%), 23 neck remnants (16.8%) and 10 incomplete occlusions (7.3%). At follow-up, only 3 patients developed a significant intrastent stenosis, one of which was induced by radiosurgery.

There is a paucity of data regarding the practice of regional anesthesia in low- and middle-income countries. Using access data from a free Android app with curated regional anesthesia learning modules, we aimed to estimate global interest in regional anesthesia and potential applications to clinical practice stratified by World Bank income level. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data collected from the free Android app Anesthesiologist from December 2015 to April 2020. The app performs basic anesthetic calculations and provides links to videos on performing 12 different nerve blocks. Users of the app were classified on the basis of whether or not they had accessed the links. Nerve blocks were also classified according to major use (surgical block, postoperative pain adjunct, rescue block). RESULTS: Practitioners in low- and middle-income countries accessed the app more frequently than in high-income countries as measured by clicks. Users from low- and middle-income countries focused mainly on surgical blocks: ankle, axillary, infraclavicular, interscalene, and supraclavicular blocks. In high-income countries, more users viewed postoperative pain blocks: adductor canal, popliteal, femoral, and transverse abdominis plane blocks. Utilization of the app was constant over time with a general decline with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: The use of an in app survey and analytics can help identify gaps and opportunities for regional anesthesia techniques and practices. This is especially impactful in limited-resource areas, such as lower-income environments and can lead to targeted educational initiatives.","output":"Regional anesthesia educational material utilization varies by World Bank income category: A mobile health application data study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the literature on psychosocial stressors and psycho-social protective factors already clearly indicated that the two were linked in a multitude of ways to longevity. These ways include 1) directly through increased risk in suicides with respect to psycho-social stress or lack of connectivity 2) increased risk for psychopathologies such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and others, which in turn can decrease longevity in indirectly, and 3) a worse/healthier lifestyle that may be associated through decreased/improved social connectivity. With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, the ways in which these psychosocial factors could be impacted by policy came into focus. Attempting to quantify the potential future impact of such policies on longevity through psycho-social changes appeared necessary to allow better guidance of policy making.

It is suggested that COVID-19 associated PE represents in situ immunothrombosis rather than venous thromboembolism, although the origin of thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the clinical and computed tomography (CT) characteristics of PE in 23 consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and compared these to those of 100 consecutive control patients diagnosed with acute PE before the COVID-19 outbreak. Specifically, RV/LV diameter ratio, pulmonary artery trunk diameter and total thrombus load (according to Qanadli score) were measured and compared. RESULTS: We observed that all thrombotic lesions in COVID-19 patients were found to be in lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19. Also, the thrombus load was lower in COVID-19 patients (Qanadli score -8%, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] -16 to -0.36%) as was the prevalence of the most proximal PE in the main/lobar pulmonary artery (17% versus 47%; -30%, 95%CI -44% to -8.2).

Previous means of acquiring this information in the examination room have been insufficient in preventing disease spread. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to demonstrate the deployment of an automatic system to triage outpatients over the internet. METHODS: An automatic system was incorporated in the existing web-based appointment system of the hospital and deployed along with its on-site counterpart. Automatic queries to the virtual private network travel and contact history database with each patients national ID number were made for each attempt to acquire the patients travel and contact histories. Patients with relevant histories were denied registration or entry. Text messages were sent to patients without a relevant history for an expedited route of entry if applicable. RESULTS: A total of 127,857 visits were recorded. Among all visits, 91,195 were registered on the internet. In total, 71,816 of them generated text messages for an expedited route of entry. Furthermore, 65 patients had relevant histories, as revealed by the virtual private network database, and were denied registration or entry.

The tomato crop is considered an important vegetable crop globally and represents a model plant for fruit development research. The heat shock factor (HSF) gene family contains plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that are highly conserved and play a key role in plant high-temperature stress responses. The current study was designed to determine the relative response of heat stress under three different temperatures in the field condition to determine its relative heat tolerance. Furthermore, the study also characterized heat shock genes in eight tomato genotypes under different temperature regimes. The expressions of each gene were quantified using qPCR. The descriptive statistics results suggested a high range of diversity among the studied variables growing under three different temperatures.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal descriptive study, comprised of three online surveys conducted between April to December, 2020. We recruited sites from email lists of national abortion and family planning organizations. RESULTS: Seventy-four sites opted to participate. We analyzed 55/74 sites (74%) that provided medication abortion and completed all three surveys. The total number of abortion encounters reported by the sites remained consistent throughout the study period, though medication abortion encounters increased while first-trimester aspiration abortion encounters decreased. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, sites reduced the number of in-person visits associated with medication abortion and confirmation of successful termination. In February 2020, considered prepandemic, 39/55 sites (71%) required 2 or more patient visits for a medication abortion. By April 2020, 19/55 sites (35%) reported reducing the total number of in-person visits associated with a medication abortion. As of October 2020, 37 sites indicated newly adopting a practice of offering medication abortion follow-up with no in-person visits. CONCLUSIONS: Sites quickly adopted protocols incorporating practices that are well-supported in the literature, including forgoing Rh-testing and pre-abortion ultrasound in some circumstances and relying on patient report of symptoms or home pregnancy tests to confirm successful completion of medication abortion. Importantly, these practices reduce face-to-face interactions and the opportunity for virus transmission. Sustaining these changes even after the public health crisis is over may increase patient access to abortion, and these impacts should be evaluated in future research.

To understand how applicants from diverse social backgrounds might differ in these regards. Design Cross-sectional questionnaire study forming part of the longitudinal United Kingdom Medical Applicant Cohort Study (UKMACS). Setting United Kingdom medical school admissions. Participants 2887 participants (68% female; 64% with at least one degree-educated parent; 63% with at least one parent in the highest socioeconomic group) completed an online questionnaire between 8th and 22nd April 2020. To be invited to complete the questionnaire, participants had to have registered to take the University Clinical Admissions Test (UCAT) in 2019 and to have agreed to be invited to take part in the study, or they needed to have completed one or more previous UKMACS questionnaires. They also need to have been seriously considering applying to study medicine in the UK for entry in 2020 between May and October 2019, and be resident in the UK or Islands/Crown Dependencies. Main outcome measures Views on calculated grades, views on potential changes to medical school admissions and teaching in 2020 and 2021, reported experiences of education following the closure of educational institutions in March 2020. Results Respondents had concerns about the calculated grades that will replace A-level examinations, especially female applicants and applicants from Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds who felt teachers would find it difficult to grade and rank students accurately, as well as those from non-selective state schools and those living in deprived areas who had some concerns about the grade standardisation process. Calculated grades were not considered fair enough by a majority to use in the acceptance or rejection of medical offer-holders, but several measures - including interview and aptitude test scores - were considered fair enough to use in combination. Respondents from non-selective state (public) schools reported less use of and less access to educational resources compared to their counterparts at private/selective schools. In particular they reported less online teaching in real time, and reported spending less time studying during the lockdown. Conclusions The coronavirus pandemic will have significant and long term impacts on the selection, education and performance of our future medical workforce. It is important that the views and experiences of medical applicants from diverse backgrounds are taken into consideration in decisions affecting their futures and the future of the profession.","output":"The attitudes, perceptions and experiences of medical school applicants following the closure of schools and cancellation of public examinations in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ballistocardiogram signals describe the mechanical activity of the heart.

But how consistently have such patterns of change and stability unfolded across U.S. society? Are the trends widespread, with most demographic groups changing or remaining stable in parallel, at the same rate and in the same direction? Or are the trends more idiosyncratic, with groups moving at different rates and/or directions, revealing nonparallel change? The answer can reveal whether the sources of change are unfolding at the collective, macrolevel of society, or at the mezzo-level of demographic group memberships. Results from over 2.5 million tests of sexuality, race, and age attitudes, collected continuously in the United States over 10 years (2007-2016) show that attitude trends are largely parallel across most demographic groups (e.g., respondents' gender, race, education). Parallel trends are more strongly evident in implicit social group attitudes, with explicit attitudes showing relatively more nonparallel trends. Two demographics, respondent age and political orientation, are exceptions: younger and politically liberal groups are generally changing faster toward implicit attitude neutrality than older and conservative groups. Nevertheless, the surprising consistency in trends across demographic groups points to the role of macrolevel societal variables as the most likely sources of widespread reductions in implicit and explicit social group attitudes over the past decade.

Aim: We aimed to evaluate immunogenicity of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in LT recipients and healthy controls and to identify factors associated with negative response to vaccine. Materials and Methods: We prospectively evaluated a cohort of adult LT patients the humoral response (with anti-Spike protein IgG-LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2-IgG chemiluminescent assay) at 1 and 3 months after 2-dose vaccination. A group of 307 vaccinated healthcare workers, matched by age and sex, served as controls. Results: Overall, 492 LT patients were enrolled (75.41% male, median age 64.85 years). Detectable antibodies were observed in the 75% of patients with a median value of 73.9 AU/mL after 3 months from 2-dose vaccination. At multivariable analysis, older age (>40years, p=0.016), shorter time from liver transplantation (<5years, p=0.004), and immunosuppression with antimetabolites (p=0.029) were significantly associated with non-response to vaccination. Moreover, the LT recipients showed antibody titers statistically lower than the control group (103 vs 261 AU/ml, p<0.0001) (fig. 1). Finally, both in controls and LT patients we found a trend of inverse correlation between age and antibody titers (correlation coefficient: -0.2023 and -0.2345, respectively). Conclusions: Three months after vaccination, LT recipients showed humoral response in 75% of cases. Older age, shorter time from transplantation and use of antimetabolites were factors associated with non-response to vaccination and needed to be kept under close monitoring.","output":"Humoral response to 2-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for Covid-19 in liver transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lung lesions of this COVID\\\\19 patient were slowly absorbed, and the clinical symptoms with shortness of breath were improved slowly in the recovery period.","output":"The treatment and rehabilitation of a critical COVID\\\\19 case in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disruptive pandemic that has continued to test the limits of health care system capacities. It is important to highlight the specific challenges facing US neurosurgery during these difficult circumstances. In the present study, we have described our neurosurgery department's unique experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed the following data points both before and during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the number of patients infected with COVID-19 at our institution, changes in neurosurgical operative workflow, changes in neurosurgical outpatient and inpatient clinic workflows, resident redeployment statistics and changes in call schedules, and changes in neurosurgical education. RESULTS: At our institution, the adult surgery numbers decreased from 120 during the week of March 4-11, 2020 (before the World Health Organization had classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic) to 17 during the week of April 13-17, 2020. The number of pediatric surgeries decreased from 15 to 3 during the same period. Significantly more surgeries were cancelled than were delayed (P < 0.0001). A drastic decline occurred in the number of in-person neurosurgery clinic visits (97.12%) between March and April 2020 (P = 0.0020). The inpatient census declined from mid-March to mid-April 2020 by 44.68% compared with a 4.26% decline during the same period in 2019 (P < 0.0001).

BACKGROUND The preferred organ used for reconstruction after esophagectomy for cancer is the stomach. Previous studies attempted to define the optimal site of anastomosis and anastomotic techniques. However, anastomotic stricture formation and leakage still remain an important clinical problem. METHODS From May 2005 to September 2007, 128 patients (64 in each group) were randomized between ETE and ETS anastomosis after esophagectomy for cancer with gastric tube reconstruction. Routine contrast swallow studies and endoscopy were performed. Anastomotic stricture within 1 year, requiring dilatation, was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were anastomotic leak rate and mortality. RESULTS Ninety-nine men and 29 women underwent esophagectomy and gastric tube reconstruction. Benign stenosis of the anastomosis, for which dilatation was required, occurred more often in the ETE group (40% vs. ETS 18%, P < 0.01) after 1 year of follow-up. The overall (clinical and radiological) anastomotic leak rate was lower in the ETE group (22% vs. ETS 41%, P = 0.04). Patients with an ETE anastomosis suffered less often from pneumonia; 17% versus ETS 44%, P = 0.002 and had subsequently significantly shorter in-hospital stay (15 days vs. 22 days, P = 0.02). In-hospital mortality did not differ between both groups. CONCLUSION ETS anastomosis is associated with a lower anastomotic stricture rate, compared to ETE anastomosis. However, prevention of stricture formation was at high costs with increased anastomotic leakage and longer in-hospital stay.

OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that 129Xe MRI is feasible and can demonstrate ventilation defects that relate to and predict clinical severity in a pediatric asthma cohort. METHODS Thirty-seven children (13 severe asthma, 8 mild/moderate asthma, 16 age-matched healthy controls) aged 6-17 years-old were imaged with 129Xe MRI. Ventilation defect percentage (VDP) and image reader score were calculated and compared to clinical measures at baseline and at follow-up. RESULTS Children with asthma had higher VDP (p=0.002) and number of defects per image slice (defects/slice) (p=0.0001) than children without asthma. Children with clinically severe asthma had significantly higher VDP and number of defects/slice than healthy controls. Children with asthma who had higher number of defects/slice had higher rate of healthcare utilization (r=0.48, p=0.03) and oral corticosteroid use (r=0.43, p=0.05) at baseline. ROC analysis demonstrated the number of defects/slice and VDP were predictive of increased healthcare utilization, asthma and severe asthma.

METHODS: Data collection commenced in October 2019 and as of August 2020, 227 patients have been recruited from 66 registered sites across England. This interim data was analysed. The primary outcome was the change in monthly patient recruitment and site registration. The secondary outcome was the completeness of the dataset. RESULTS: Initially, monthly site registration increased to a peak of 31 in December 2019 and monthly patient recruitment increased to a peak of 34 in February 2020. Both levels decreased during the first wave of Covid-19 with 11 patients recruited and 0 sites registered in April 2020.

This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent. These blood biochemical indicators should be considered in the clinical management of the disease.","output":"Blood biochemical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a systemic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"No disponible","output":"Nuevo coronavirus (2019-nCov): ?tiene suficientes unidades de cuidados intensivos?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Skin and oral mucosal findings of viral infections are significant both in diagnosis and follow-up.

FI is associated with increased risk for multiple chronic diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health. We selected these four chronic diseases given their global prevalence and comorbid associations with each other. We evaluated the most recent literature published over the past 5 years and offer strategies for the screening of FI. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses report an association between FI and obesity in adult women as well as adult men and women living in low- and middle-income countries. Gender differences also were observed between FI and type 2 diabetes, such that adult women showed an increased risk for type 2 diabetes. This association was influenced by social determinants of health. Very low food security (i.e., high FI) was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and a higher risk for cardiovascular disease mortality. Finally, several studies showed an association between FI and adverse mental health outcomes, including increased risk for stress, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and suicidal ideation. SUMMARY: FI and its negative association with body weight, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health provide a compelling rationale for identification of FI in clinical settings. Brief, well-validated screening measures are available in multiple languages. Despite the need for FI screening, many guidelines do not address its implementation. For this reason, more research and targeted interventions are needed to increase FI screening rates and close the loop in the coordination of resources.","output":"Food Insecurity and its Impact on Body Weight, Type 2 Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease, and Mental Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals are at increased risk of severe disease from pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm09), vaccination was recommended as a prevention strategy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and persistence of the immune response after vaccination against pandemic influenza A (H1N1pdm09) with an adjuvanted vaccine in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adults using two single and two double doses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Open label, randomized trial to evaluate the immune response following H1N1pdm09 vaccination in HIV-infected participants compared to HIV-negative controls (NCT01155037). HIV-infected participants were randomized to receive 2 single (3.75 g hemagglutinin) or 2 double (7.5 g hemagglutinin) doses of the vaccine, 21 days apart. Controls received one dose of the vaccine. The primary endpoint was seroconversion as measured by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Two hundred fifty six HIV-infected participants (129 and 127 randomized to single and double doses, respectively) and 71 HIV-negative controls were enrolled. Among HIV-infected participants, seroconversion increased from 46.7% and 51.7% after the first dose to 77.2% and 83.8% after the second dose of the vaccine using single and double doses, respectively. Participants aged >40 years showed higher seroconversion compared to younger participants. Seroconversion among HIV-infected women and those with nadir CD4<200 cells/mm(3) was significantly higher with double doses. Persistence of protective antibodies six months after vaccination was achieved by 80% and 89.9% of the HIV-infected participants who received single and double doses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results support the recommendation of two double doses of adjuvanted H1N1pdm09 vaccine for HIV-infected individuals, particularly women, and those aged >40 years or with nadir CD4<200 cells/mm(3), to achieve antibody levels that are both higher and more sustained.

Initial findings in cancer patients suggest a lower seroconversion and greater toxicity possibly related to myelo-immunosuppressive therapies. AIM We conducted a prospective study to assess factors predicting poor seroconversion and adverse events following immunization (AEFI) to the BNT162b2 vaccine in cancer patients on active treatment. METHODS Blood samples were collected by the research nurse at first dose (visit 1), second dose (visit 2), after 42 days (visit 3) and after 6 months (visit 4). At visit 1, 3 and 4 participants received: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Distress Thermometer. Patients who ended treatment >6 months on active surveillance served as controls. RESULTS Between March and July 2021, 320 subjects were recruited and 291 were assessable. The lack of seroconversion at 21 days from the second dose was 1.6% (95% CI, 0.4-8.7) on active surveillance, 13.9% (8.2-21.6) on chemotherapy, 11.4% (5.1-21.3) on hormone therapy, 21.7% (7.5-43.7) on targeted therapy and 4.8% (0.12-23.8) on immunotherapy. Compared to controls, the risk of no IgG response was greater for chemotherapy (P=0.033), targeted therapy (0.005) and hormonotherapy (P=0.051). Lymphocyte count less than 1x109/L, older age and advanced stage also significantly predicted poor seroconversion. Overall, 43 patients (14.8%) complained of AEFI, mostly of mild grade. Risk of AEFI was greater in females (P=0.001) and younger patients (P=0.009).

The Mediterranean diet pyramid includes lifestyle activities at the base of the pyramid such as regular physical activity (PA), adequate rest, conviviality, biodiversity and seasonality, traditional local and eco-friendly products, and culinary activities. The purpose of this study was to design and pilot test a Mediterranean diet and lifestyle index for older adults in the U.S. METHODS: The Harvard Food Frequency Questionnaire was used to determine the alternative Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed). The short version of the Minnesota Leisure Time PA questionnaire and additional Mediterranean diet-related dietary habit and lifestyle questions were piloted in 75 older adults attending senior centers. RESULTS: Participants were primarily women (80.6%) and Caucasian (68%) with an average age of 71.89+/?7.60 years. A 27-item index including the aMed food groups, dietary habits, PA, culinary activities, purchasing of local and seasonal foods, and adequate rest resulted in a reliable score ( = 0.75). Individual index factors correlated with the overall Mediterranean diet and lifestyle score. CONCLUSIONS: While this Mediterranean diet and lifestyle index resulted in good internal consistency; assessment of conviviality, especially for older adults in the time of Covid-19, need be re-evaluated as a lifestyle measure that can impact dietary intake and overall health.

High-throughput proteomics analysis of urine samples was performed to identify reliable and non-invasive biomarkers that could effectively discriminate between the two ovarian tumor types. METHODS: In total, 132 urine samples from 73 malignant and 59 benign cases of ovarian carcinoma were divided into C1 (training and test datasets) and C2 (validation dataset) cohorts. Mass spectrometry (MS) data of all samples were acquired in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode with an Orbitrap mass spectrometer and analyzed using DIA-NN software. The generated classifier was trained with Random Forest algorithm from the training dataset and validated in the test and validation datasets. Serum CA125 and HE4 levels were additionally determined in all patients. Finally, classification accuracy of the classifier, serum CA125 and serum HE4 in all samples were evaluated and plotted via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In total, 2,199 proteins were quantified and 69 identified with differential expression in benign and malignant groups of the C1 cohort. A classifier incorporating five proteins (WFDC2, PTMA, PVRL4, FIBA, and PVRL2) was trained and validated in this study. Evaluation of the performance of the classifier revealed AUC values of 0.970 and 0.952 in the test and validation datasets, respectively. In all 132 patients, AUCs of 0.966, 0.947, and 0.979 were achieved with the classifier, serum CA125, and serum HE4, respectively. Among eight patients with early stage malignancy, 7, 6, and 4 were accurately diagnosed based on classifier, serum CA125, and serum HE4, respectively.

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage samples was reported in February 2020, raising the possibility of using environmental water surveillance to monitor SARS-CoV-2 activity in infected areas. The aim of this study was to standardize the methodology for detection of SARS-CoV-2 from sewage and explore the feasibility of establishing supplementary surveillance for COVID-19. Methods: Sewage specimens were collected from six sites in Mumbai, India, using the grab sample method and processed using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-dextran phase separation method for virus concentration. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Results: A total of 20 sewage samples collected from six different wards in Mumbai city, before the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections and during May 11-22, 2020, were processed using the phase separation method.

The article was evaluated by the Editor-in-Chief with the support of several Editorial Board Members. They found that the article contained several errors that fundamentally affect the interpretation of the findings. These include, but are not limited to: The data from the Lareb report (https://www.lareb.nl/coronameldingen) in The Netherlands were used to calculate the number of severe and fatal side effects per 100,000 vaccinations. Unfortunately, in the manuscript by Harald Walach et al. these data were incorrectly interpreted which led to erroneous conclusions. The data was presented as being causally related to adverse events by the authors. This is inaccurate. In The Netherlands, healthcare professionals and patients are invited to report suspicions of adverse events that may be associated with vaccination. For this type of reporting a causal relation between the event and the vaccine is not needed, therefore a reported event that occurred after vaccination is not necessarily attributable to vaccination. Thus, reporting of a death following vaccination does not imply that this is a vaccine-related event. There are several other inaccuracies in the paper by Harald Walach et al. one of which is that fatal cases were certified by medical specialists. It should be known that even this false claim does not imply causation, which the authors imply. Further, the authors have called the events 'effects' and 'reactions' when this is not established, and until causality is established they are 'events' that may or may not be caused by exposure to a vaccine. It does not matter what statistics one may apply, this is incorrect and misleading. The authors were asked to respond to the claims, but were not able to do so satisfactorily.

This study aimed to characterize the alterations in the expression of circulating acute-phase proteins, cytokines, and checkpoint proteins in patients with severe trauma injuries. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included trauma patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an injury severity score equal to or greater than 16 and who had used a ventilator for 48 hours. A total of 12 female and 28 male patients were recruited for the study; six patients died and 34 survived. Blood samples collected at acute stages were compared with those drawn at the subacute stage, the time when the patients were discharged from the ICU, or before the discharge of the patients from the hospital. RESULTS: The study identified that the expression of acute-phase proteins, such as alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and C-reactive protein, and cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, was elevated in the circulation after severe trauma. In contrast, the levels of acute-phase proteins, such as alpha-2-macroglobulin, serum amyloid P, and von Willebrand factor, and cytokines, including interleukin-4 and interferon gamma-induced protein 10, were reduced. However, there were no significant differences in the expression of checkpoint proteins in the circulation.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of L. japonica ethanol extract (LJEE) on NASH in mice. C57BL/6J mice were fed with methionine-choline-deficient diet (MCDD) for eight weeks to promote the development of NASH. After development of the model, the mice were administered LJEE once daily via oral gavage at doses of 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg for another four weeks. Simultaneous treatments with LJEE (300 mg/kg/day) resulted in pronounced improvements in liver steatosis, ballooning degeneration, and inflammation. LJEE prevented MCDD-induced plasma level increases in aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. LJEE significantly reduced hepatic malondialdehyde level and ameliorated hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in MCDD-fed mice, which were associated with down-regulation of cytochrome P450 2E1 suppression of multiple proinflammatory and profibrotic genes. LJEE can prevent hepatic steatosis by reducing hepatic peroxisome acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 expression, as well as by inducing proliferator-activated receptor  expression.

An important contributor is the shear exerted on the skin due to static friction at the skin-PPE interface. This study aims to develop an optimised wax-oil lubricant that reduces the friction, or shear, in the skin-PPE contact for up to four hours. Lubricants with different wax-oil combinations were prepared using beeswax, paraffin wax, olive oil, and mineral oil. In-vivo friction measurements involving seven participants were conducted by sliding a polydimethylsiloxane ball against the volar forearms to simulate the skin-PPE interface. The maximum static coefficient of friction was measured immediately and four hours after lubricant application. It was found that the coefficient of friction of wax-oil lubricants is mainly governed by the ratio of wax to oil and the thermal stability and morphology of the wax. To maintain long-term lubricity, it is crucial to consider the absorption of oil into the PPE material. The best performing lubricant is a mixture of 20 wt% beeswax, 40 wt% olive oil, and 40 wt% mineral oil, which compared to unlubricated skin, provides 87% (P = 0.0006) and 59% (P = 0.0015) reduction in instantaneous and 4-h coefficient of friction, respectively.","output":"Wax-oil lubricants to reduce the shear between skin and PPE"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a severe health threat causing high-level morbidity and mortality in health care environments and in community settings.

Recently, since the development of the CRISPR/Cas technology, new possibilities for rapid point-of-care detection have emerged. In this study, we developed a rapid, accurate, and contamination-free platform for MRSA detection by integrating recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with the Cas12 system into one tube. Using this approach, visual MRSA detection could be achieved in 20 min. Based on the one-tube RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform, the assay results are visualized by lateral flow test strips (LFS) and fluorescent-based methods, including real-time and end-point fluorescence. This platform allows specific MRSA detection with a sensitivity of 10 copies for the fluorescence method and a range of 10C100 copies for the LFS. The results of 23 samples from clinical MRSA isolates showed that the coincidence rate was 100% and 95.7% of the fluorescence method and LFS, respectively, compared to qPCR.

The disease presents as severe respiratory infection often with shock, acute kidney injury, and coagulopathy. Recently, we observed three cases who presented with neurologic symptoms. These are so far the first reported cases of neurologic injury associated with MERS-CoV infection. METHODS: Data was retrospectively collected from three patients admitted with MERS-CoV infection to Intensive Care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh. They were managed separately in three different wards prior to their admission to ICU. FINDING: The three patients presented with severe neurologic syndrome which included altered level of consciousness ranging from confusion to coma, ataxia, and focal motor deficit. Brain MRI revealed striking changes characterized by widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging within the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the basal ganglia, and corpus callosum. None of the lesions showed gadolinium enhancement.

The global analysis of 65 published literature references allowed observing the effectiveness and efficiency of the strategies used by these countries to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Results: Both mitigation and suppression strategies were adopted by the United Kingdom, India, Italy, China, and Saudi Arabia to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was observed that China has achieved a greater success in flattening the curve compared to the other countries. In China, few new daily cases have occurred since March, and it has been the only country that has managed to keep the COVID-19 pandemic under control. On the other hand, reductions in the number of daily cases (since May 2020) were detected in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Saudi Arabia (since July 2020). Also, during the last 3 months (June, July and August) India has shown the highest growth in the total number of confirmed cases and in the number of new daily cases, compared to the mentioned countries.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of Singapores Circuit Breaker (CB) lockdown measures on CRC disease presentation and short-term surgical outcomes, while comparing Singapores approach against other countries which employed similar lockdown measures. METHODS: Patients whose initial diagnosis of CRC was made within the 6-month pre-CB (6/10/19C6/4/20) (pre-CB group) and post-CB (7/4/20C7/10/20) (post-CB group) period were enrolled retrospectively. The groups were compared based on severity of disease on presentation and short-term operative outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 105 patients diagnosed with CRC were enrolled in this study. When comparing pre-CB and post-CB groups, there was no significant difference in stage of CRC on presentation (p = 0.850). There was also no increase in need for emergent operations (p = 0.367). For patients who had undergone an operation, postoperative morbidity was not significantly higher in the post-CB group (p = 0.201). Both groups of patients had similar length of stay in the hospital (p = 0.438).

This analysis included 74a?208 tests from children 5 to 11 years of age and 47a?744 tests from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with COVID-19-like illness who underwent SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification testing from December 26, 2021, to February 21, 2022. Exposures: Two BNT162b2 doses 2 weeks or more before SARS-CoV-2 testing vs no vaccination for children; 2 or 3 doses 2 weeks or more before testing vs no vaccination for adolescents (who are recommended to receive a booster dose). Main Outcomes and Measures: Symptomatic infection. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the association of prior vaccination and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was used to estimate VE: VE = (1 - OR)  100%. Results: A total of 30a?999 test-positive cases and 43a?209 test-negative controls were included from children 5 to 11 years of age, as well as 22a?273 test-positive cases and 25a?471 test-negative controls from adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. The median age among those with included tests was 10 years (IQR, 7-13); 61a?189 (50.2%) were female, 75a?758 (70.1%) were White, and 29a?034 (25.7%) were Hispanic/Latino. At 2 to 4 weeks after dose 2, among children, the adjusted OR was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.35-0.45; estimated VE, 60.1% [95% CI, 54.7%-64.8%]) and among adolescents, the OR was 0.40 (95% CI, 0.29-0.56; estimated VE, 59.5% [95% CI, 44.3%-70.6%]). During month 2 after dose 2, among children, the OR was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67-0.76; estimated VE, 28.9% [95% CI, 24.5%-33.1%]) and among adolescents, the OR was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.92; estimated VE, 16.6% [95% CI, 8.1%-24.3%]). Among adolescents, the booster dose OR 2 to 6.5 weeks after the dose was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35; estimated VE, 71.1% [95% CI, 65.5%-75.7%]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among children and adolescents, estimated VE for 2 doses of BNT162b2 against symptomatic infection was modest and decreased rapidly. Among adolescents, the estimated effectiveness increased after a booster dose.","output":"Association of Prior BNT162b2 COVID-19 Vaccination With Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children and Adolescents During Omicron Predominance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a fatal, universal pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that has directly caused at least 95,235 deaths in the US by May 2020.

Specifically, based on the Job Demands-Resources and Conservation of Resources theories, we postulate a mediation model where proactive vitality management leads to entrepreneurs transferring resources developed in their work role to thrive in their home role (i.e., workChome enrichment), resulting in augmented entrepreneurial performance. The hypotheses were tested with data collected at two time points, 1 onth apartT1 (N = 277) and T2 (N = 249), from Romanian entrepreneurs. We analyzed autoregressive, causal, reversed, and reciprocal models to test the mediation model. In the linkage between predictor and outcome variable, the reversed model is the best-fitting model, showing that proactive vitality management is only a distal precursor of performance. However, the best-fitting models for the relationship between predictor and mediator and between mediator and outcome were the reciprocal models. Thus, proactive vitality management and workChome enrichment have reciprocal effects on each other over time, as was the case between workChome enrichment and entrepreneurial performance. These results are in line with the resource gain cycle perspective of the Conservation of Resources theory. Employing proactive behaviors to optimize functioning at work enables the transfer of resources to the home role. Potentiating one role through aspects of another will thus generate additional resources reflecting on entrepreneurial performance.

However, these tests have considerable variations in their specificity and sensitivity, and whether they can predict levels of neutralizing activity is yet to be determined. This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various antigen-specific antibody isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients confirmed via polymerase chain reaction test. We developed IgG, IgM and IgA measurement assays for each antigen, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein, S1 domain, full length S protein, S trimer and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, while the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity. The sensitivity of all antigen-specific antibody isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 days post-symptom onset. The best correlation with virus neutralizing activity was found for IgG against RBD (RBD-IgG), and levels of RBD-IgG in sera from four severe COVID-19 patients increased concordantly with neutralizing activity.

We identified five genes capable of accurately distinguishing multibacillary and paucibacillary leprosy from other skin conditions.

METHODS: In May 2021, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, the Bihari government initiated a 1-day COVID-19 training programme for rural, unaccredited CHWs who had recently completed a community health education course from the National Institute of Open Schooling. The use of primary health centre buildings and doctors to deliver COVID-19 training and the existence of certification data on CHWs who participated in the community health education course streamlined implementation and minimized costs. After COVID-19 training, CHWs were paid as first responders and COVID-19 treatment workers by the Bihari government. FINDINGS: Overall, 15 000 CHWs in Bihar completed the COVID-19 training programme in 2021 and a further 30 000 were enrolled. A survey of CHWs carried out after COVID-19 training had started found that 80% (81/102) were satisfied with training and felt they were receiving information from reliable sources.

Towards achieving broad vaccine protection from these viruses, vaccines composed of multiple antigens, each capable of eliciting broad neutralising responses across a subgroup will be required. Utilising a novel platform for selecting immune optimized, structurally engineered antigens capable of eliciting protective responses across a group of related viruses, we demonstrate proof-concept against the greater sarbecoviruses sub-genus with a single antigen structure. From an array of phylogenetically informed antigen structures displaying different broad neutralising epitopes, synthetic genes expressing these were selected based on broad immune responses in BALB/C mice. Improved protection against the Delta variant was further observed in K18-hACE2 mice on boosting with the lead designs of mice primed by an approved COVID-19 vaccine. Immunogenicity of the lead vaccine antigen and breadth of neutralisation against the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, WIV16, and RaTG13 was confirmed in guinea pigs using needleless intradermal immunisation. Immunogenicity was further confirmed in rabbits with GMP manufactured DNA immunogen. Notably, given the increasing number of mutations acquired by SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), the rabbit sera were tested for the capacity to neutralise VOCs - Beta, Gamma, Delta, as well as the most diverse Omicron variant.

These SLiM candidates are highly conserved in vertebrates. They suggest potential interactions with the AP2 mu2 subunit as well as I-BAR, LC3, PDZ, PTB and SH2 domains found in signalling and regulatory proteins present in epithelial lung cells. Several motifs overlap in the tail sequences, suggesting that they may act as molecular switches, often involving tyrosine phosphorylation status. Candidate LIR motifs are present in the tails of ACE2 and integrin beta3, suggesting that these proteins can directly recruit autophagy components.

Hence, a nationwide comprehensive model of the disease's epidemic dynamics can provide information to understand better and predict a potential outbreak of this disease and efficiently and effectively manage its impact.

The pattern of spread of this disease is uneven across the provinces in Thailand, so we used K-means clustering algorithm to cluster those provinces into three groups (i.e., highly, moderately, and least affected levels). We also analysed health records collected from district hospitals, which suggest significant reinfection cases. For example, we found that 11% (approximately) of infectious patients return for repeat treatment within the study period. We also performed sensitivity analysis which indicates that the basic reproduction number (R 0) is sensitive to the rate of transmission (?) and the rate at which infected people recover (?3). By fitting the model with HFMD confirmed data for the provinces in each cluster, the basic reproduction number (R 0) was estimated to be 2.643, 1.91, and 3.246 which are greater than 1.

A popular pooling scheme is Dorfman pooling: test N individuals simultaneously, if the test is positive, each individual is then tested separately; otherwise, all are declared negative. Most analyses of the error rates of pooling schemes assume that including more than a single infected sample in a pooled test does not increase the probability of a positive outcome. We challenge this assumption with experimental data and suggest a novel and parsimonious probabilistic model for the outcomes of pooled tests. As an application, we analyse the false-negative rate (i.e. the probability of a negative result for an infected individual) of Dorfman pooling. We show that the false-negative rates under Dorfman pooling increase when the prevalence of infection decreases. However, low infection prevalence is exactly the condition when Dorfman pooling achieves highest throughput efficiency. We therefore urge the cautious use of pooling and development of pooling schemes that consider correctly accounting for tests error rates.","output":"An accurate model for SARS-CoV-2 pooled RT-PCR test errors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"On 23 January 2020, the government of China announced a lockdown of all public transportationdeparting from Wuhan, including airports, trains, and buses [...].","output":"Does Wuhan Need to be in Lockdown during the Chinese Lunar New Year?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case report demonstrates the significant impact active infection with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 can have on functional capacity evaluated by cardiopulmonary exercise testing, even in minimally symptomatic individuals.

The test is commonly used by clinicians; however, many experts argue it lacks reliability and validity along with concerns of safety. The primary purpose of this review is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the SPT to detect AI. Methods: A search of five databases was performed from inception to 19 December 2018 using search terms related to the SPT. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the SPT was used on a patient/participant. Methodological quality assessment of diagnostic studies was performed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) for studies that reported data to calculate sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive likelihood ratio (+LR), and negative likelihood ratio (-LR). Results: The search yielded 1009 articles, and 32 studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Meta-analysis on diagnostic accuracy studies assessing the SPT was not possible due to statistical heterogeneity. Six diagnostic accuracy studies assessed the SN of the SPT ranging from 0.19 to 1.00. Four of the studies assessed SP of the SPT ranging from 0.71 to 0.98. The +LR was identified in 4 studies was 0.655, 1.73, 22, and 17.25. The -LR was 1.14, 0.799, 0.571, and 0.323. Seven RCTs utilized the SPT to screen for AI, and the SPT was used in 18 case reports. Conclusion: The SPT may be inappropriate to use due to inconsistent validity, poor inter-rater reliability, and potential to cause harm.

Sweden adopted a different strategy to contain the epidemic, opting for non-binding recommendations. Nonetheless, elective and acute surgical procedures in health care may have been affected. Objectives: To investigate the effect of the first-wave of COVID-19 and the government's response in Sweden on the rates of total joint replacements (TJR), arthroscopies, and fracture surgeries of the knee and hip. Methods: We used register data for the entire population of Sk?ne, the southernmost region in Sweden with 1.3 million inhabitants (13% of the total Swedish population). We identified all residents aged 18 years who between 1st January 2015 and 31st November 2020 underwent any of the following surgical procedures of the knee or hip: TJR (TJR due to fracture excluded), arthroscopy, and surgery due to fracture (including TJR). To demarcate pre-event and post-event periods, we established a differentiation point corresponding to mid-March 2020, the timepoint at which the the Swedish Public Health Agency began recommending social distancing, working from home, distance learning for secondary schools and universities,. At the aggregate level, we modelled the number of surgeries per 10,000 adults from January 2015 up to September 2020. We did an interrupted time-series (ITSA) analysis using segmented ordinary least-squares regression to estimate changes in the levels and trends of surgical procedures compared to pre-COVID-19 levels, adjusting for seasonal variations. The month of March was treated as a phase-in period to give time for the new recommendations to be implemented. In addition, we estimated the absolute and relative difference (with its 95% confidence interval [CI]) between the predicted and the counterfactual scenario in the monthly number of surgeries from April 2020, where the counterfactual is the rate of surgery that would have been expected if COVID-19 had not happened. To account for the possibility that other co-occurring events may be responsible for the observed changes, we assessed changes in the number of surgeries due to fractures, which are normally treated as emergencies that cannot be cancelled or rescheduled, and thus should be less affected, at least by policies at the hospital level. Results: We identified a total of 20,831 TJRs, 12,156 arthroscopies and 15,041 fracture surgeries of the knee or hip over the study period. The monthly rate of surgeries and ITSAs are presented in Figure 1, with the pre-COVID period starting from February 2019 for readability (Figure 1). The results suggest that in April 2020, there was a decrease of 2.08 (95%CI 1.81;2.35) TJRs per 10,000 adults which corresponds to a decrease of 74% (95%CI 65%;85%) when compared to the counterfactual scenario. This was followed by a positive trend signifying a monthly increase of 0.36 (95%CI 0.31;0.40) TJRs per 10,000 adults. The rate of arthroscopies followed a similar pattern with a decrease of 0.55 (95%CI 0.39;0.71) arthroscopies per 10,000 adults in April, which corresponds to a 49% decrease (95%CI 28%;63%) followed by a positive trend signifying a monthly increase of 0.11 (95%CI 0.07;0.15) arthroscopies per 10,000 adults. The rate of surgery due to knee or hip fractures showed no decrease in April and was followed by a negative trend signifying a monthly decrease of 0.03 (95%CI 0.002;0.04) surgeries per 10,000 adults. Conclusion: In Sweden, we observed a marked decrease in the number of typical elective knee and hip surgeries such as TJRs and arthroscopies, following the government's response to Covid-19. We then observed a slow but steady recovery that brought the rates of procedures towards expected levels by Fall 2020, before the second wave hit the country. The number of acute fracture surgeries showed no sharp drop, instead showing a steady and slow decline potentially due to reduction in commuting and in physical activities l nked to recommendations of social.","output":"Rates of surgical procedures of the knee and hip during the first wave of COVID 19 in Sweden"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The value of SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in urban wastewater samples (WWS) for surveillance of virus spread at a population-wide level has been largely demonstrated. Aim of this study was to optimize an analytical workflow to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in WWS and to monitor SARS-CoV-2 spread during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic (MarchCJune 2020) in Lombardy, northern Italy. Methods & Materials The workflow consisted in WWS concentration by using PEG-8000 precipitation, a modified RNA extraction (QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit; QIAGEN) and a one-step real-time RT-PCR detecting two portions of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2. Composite 24-hour WWS were collected once a week at the inlet of 8 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with an overall catchment of 2,276,000 inhabitants, located in representative COVID-19 hotspots in Lombardy, from the end of March to mid-June 2020. 107 WWS were obtained and analysed. SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/L/WWS were multiplied by the flow rate of each WWTP (m3/day) and the obtained load (copies/day/1,000 people) was normalized to the number of inhabitants served by WWTPs. Results The optimized workflow allowed to identify 1E+3 copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 in concentrated WWS with a turnaround time of 8 hours. Overall, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in 65/107 WWS (61%). The highest rate of positive WWS (78.7%; 26/33) was identified in the Bergamo province, that was the epicentre during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic (March-June 2020) in Lombardy. The highest amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in late March/early April, when the overall viral load reflecting the number of individuals shedding the virus ranged from 9.3E+10 copies/day/1,000 people to 8.2E+8 copies/day/1,000 people. Since the end of May, WWS tested negative to SARS-CoV-2 detection. Conclusion According to the epidemiological features of the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Lombardy, the highest amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in WWS collected in the areas most affected by COVID-19 (i.e. Bergamo province). This optimized workflow of WWS surveillance can help assessing the real number of individuals C both symptomatic and asymptomatic C able to spread the virus and appraising the effect of preventive measures.","output":"Tracking SARS-CoV-2 in urban wastewater samples during the first wave of COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy (Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Motivation: Heterochronous gene sequence data is important for characterizing the evolutionary processes of fast-evolving organisms such as RNA viruses. A limited set of algorithms exists for estimating the rate of nucleotide substitution and inferring phylogenetic trees from such data. The authors here present a new method, Tree and Rate Estimation by Local Evaluation (TREBLE) that robustly calculates the rate of nucleotide substitution and phylogeny with several orders of magnitude improvement in computational time. Methods: For the basis of its rate estimation TREBLE novelly utilizes a geometric interpretation of the molecular clock assumption to deduce a local estimate of the rate of nucleotide substitution for triplets of dated sequences. Averaging the triplet estimates via a variance weighting yields a global estimate of the rate. From this value, an iterative refinement procedure relying on statistical properties of the triplets then generates a final estimate of the global rate of nucleotide substitution. The estimated global rate is then utilized to find the tree from the pairwise distance matrix via an UPGMA-like algorithm. Results: Simulation studies show that TREBLE estimates the rate of nucleotide substitution with point estimates comparable with the best of available methods. Confidence intervals are comparable with that of BEAST. TREBLE's phylogenetic reconstruction is significantly improved over the other distance matrix method but not as accurate as the Bayesian algorithm. Compared with three other algorithms, TREBLE reduces computational time by a minimum factor of 3000. Relative to the algorithm with the most accurate estimates for the rate of nucleotide substitution (i.e. BEAST), TREBLE is over 10 000 times more computationally efficient.

We used dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) as a model membrane material and did simulations on both gel and liquid crystalline phases of membrane surrounded by aqueous solutions of varying alcohol concentrations (up to 17.5 mol %). While a moderate effect of alcohol on the gel phase of membrane is observed, its liquid crystalline phase is shown to be influenced dramatically by either alcohol. Our results show that aqueous solutions of only 5 and 10 mol % alcohol already have significant weakening effects on the membrane. The effects of n-propanol are always stronger than those of ethanol. The membrane changes its structure, when exposed to disinfectant solutions; uptake of alcohol causes it to swell laterally but to shrink vertically. At the same time, the orientational order of lipid tails decreases significantly. Metadynamics and grand-canonical ensemble simulations were done to calculate the free-energy profiles for permeation of alcohol and alcohol/water solubility in the DPPC. We found that the free-energy barrier to permeation of the DPPC liquid crystalline phase by all permeants is significantly lowered by alcohol uptake. At a disinfectant concentration of 10 mol %, it becomes insignificant enough to allow almost free passage of the disinfectant to the inside of the virus to cause damage there. It should be noted that the disinfectant also causes the barrier for water permeation to drop. Furthermore, the shrinking of the membrane thickness shortens the gap needed to be crossed by penetrants from outside the virus into its core. The lateral swelling also increases the average distance between head groups, which is a secondary barrier to membrane penetration, and hence further increases the penetration by disinfectants. At alcohol concentrations in the disinfectant solution above 15 mol %, we reliably observe disintegration of the DPPC membrane in its liquid crystalline phase.","output":"How Alcoholic Disinfectants Affect Coronavirus Model Membranes: Membrane Fluidity, Permeability, and Disintegration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Air travel facilitates the international spread of infectious disease. While global air travel data represent the volume of travel between airports, identifying which airport an infected individual might use, or where a disease might spread after an infected passenger deplanes, remains a largely unexplored area of research and public health practice.

This research aims to determine how existing market area delineation techniques estimate airport catchments differently, and which techniques are best suited to anticipate where infectious diseases may spread. Multiple techniques were tested for airports in the Province of Ontario, Canada: circular buffers, drive-time buffers, Thiessen polygons, and the Huff model, with multiple variations tested for some techniques. The results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively based on spatial patterns as well as area and population of each catchment area. There were notable differences, specifically between deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Deterministic techniques may only be suitable if all airports in a study area are similar in terms of attractiveness. The probabilistic Huff model appeared to produce more realistic results because it accounted for variation in airport attractiveness. Additionally, the Huff model requires few inputs and therefore would be efficient to execute in situations where time, resources, and data are limited.","output":"Market Area Delineation for Airports to Predict the Spread of Infectious Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The genetic variability of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was studied by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragments among 50 Korean isolates from open reading frame 5.

There is limited knowledge about the personal meaning that experiential workers derive from their work, which serve as motivators for them to take on these often-stressful roles. METHODS This project used a community-based qualitative research design. The research was based at two organizations in BC. Eight experiential worker-led focus groups were conducted (n = 31) where participants spoke about their roles, positive aspects of their jobs, challenges they face, and support needs in harm reduction work. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using interpretative description to uncover the meaning derived from experiential work. RESULTS Three themes emerged from focus group data that describe the meanings which serve as motivators for experiential workers to continue working in overdose response environments: (1) A sense of purpose from helping others; (2) Being an inspiration for others, and; (3) A sense of belonging. CONCLUSION Despite the frequent hardships and loss that accompany overdose response work, experiential workers identified important aspects that give their work meaning. These aspects of their work may help to protect workers from the emotional harms associated with stressful work as well as the stigma of substance use. Recognizing the importance of experiential work and its role in the lives of PWUD can help inform and strengthen organizational supports.","output":"\\"It's an emotional roller coaster But sometimes it's fucking awesome\\": Meaning and motivation of work for peers in overdose response environments in British Columbia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Temperature and relative humidity are major factors determining virus inactivation in the environment. This article reviews inactivation data regarding coronaviruses on surfaces and in liquids from published studies and develops secondary models to predict coronaviruses inactivation as a function of temperature and relative humidity. A total of 102 D values (i.e., the time to obtain a log10 reduction of virus infectivity), including values for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), were collected from 26 published studies. The values obtained from the different coronaviruses and studies were found to be generally consistent. Five different models were fitted to the global data set of D values. The most appropriate model considered temperature and relative humidity. A spreadsheet predicting the inactivation of coronaviruses and the associated uncertainty is presented and can be used to predict virus inactivation for untested temperatures, time points, or any coronavirus strains belonging to Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genera.IMPORTANCE The prediction of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on fomites is essential in investigating the importance of contact transmission. This study collects available information on inactivation kinetics of coronaviruses in both solid and liquid fomites and creates a mathematical model for the impact of temperature and relative humidity on virus persistence. The predictions of the model can support more robust decision-making and could be useful in various public health contexts. A calculator for the natural clearance of SARS-CoV-2 depending on temperature and relative humidity could be a valuable operational tool for public authorities.","output":"Modeling the Inactivation of Viruses from the Coronaviridae Family in Response to Temperature and Relative Humidity in Suspensions or on Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Viewpoint calls for a greater understanding of the role that water plays in the transmission of anti-microbial resistance and covid-19 in protracted urban armed conflict, in order to develop a pathogen-safe practice.

Thus, this research aimed to develop of semantic-sharing and collaborative-modeling to meet the information exchange requirements of Iran's notifiable diseases surveillance system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First, the Iran's Notifiable diseases Minimum Data Set (INMDS) was determined according to a literature review coupled with agreements of experts. Then the INMDS was mapped to international terminologies and classification systems, and the Health Level seven-Clinical Document Architecture (HL7-CDA) standard was leveraged to define the exchangeable and machine-readable data formats. RESULTS: A core dataset consisting of 15 classes and 96 data fields was defined. Data elements and response values were mapped to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) reference terminology. Then HL7-CDA standard for interoperable data exchange were defined. CONCLUSION: The notifiable disease surveillance requires an integrative participation of multidisciplinary team. In this field, data interoperability is more essential due to the heterogeneous nature of health information systems. Developing of INMDS based on HL7-CDA along with SNOMED-CT codes offers an inclusive and interoperable dataset that can help make notifiable diseases data more comparable and reportable across studies and organizations.

In contrast to a model-based approach for estimating population immunity, or simplistic summing of natural- and vaccine-induced immunity, the current study presents a data-driven statistical procedure for estimating the total immunity rate in a region using prospectively collected serological data along with state-level vaccination data. We present a detailed procedure so that efforts can be replicated regionally to inform policy-making decisions relevant to SARS-CoV-2.

Immunology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immune response that destroys platelets and increases the risk of bleeding, which can range from bruising to intracranial hemorrhage. ITP is a known complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In the first studies of the BNT162b2 messenger RNA (mRNA) COVID-19 vaccine, there were no reports of ITP and the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) was low overall. Here, we present a case of ITP as a complication of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. CASE REPORT: Three days after receiving a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, a 39-year-old woman presented with a petechial rash on her trunk, legs, and arms, and fatigue and muscle aches. At the time of her hospital admission, her platelet count was 1000/L. A peripheral smear showed profound thrombocytopenia. During the course of the patients hospitalization, she was treated with 2 units of platelets, 2 infusions of i.v. immunoglobulin, and i.v. methylprednisolone. Her platelet count increased to 92 000/L on the day of discharge and she was prescribed a tapered dose of oral prednisone. One day later, her rash had resolved and her platelet count was 243 000/L. The patient recovered completely with no complications. CONCLUSIONS: ITP should be considered a severe AE of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Knowing the early signs and symptoms of ITP will become increasingly important as more of the population receives this vaccine. Quick diagnosis and management are essential to avoid life-threatening bleeding.","output":"A Case of Immune Thrombocytopenia After BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus reverse genetic systems have become valuable tools for studying the molecular biology of coronavirus infections.

Patients may perceive the day of surgery as the biggest and the most threatening day in their lives. There is paucity of information on predictors of anxiety in the current study area. The main objective of this study is to assess predictors of preoperative anxiety among patients scheduled for surgery in Jimma University Specialized Teaching Hospital. METHODS A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted using quantitative data collection technique in Jimma University Specialized Teaching Hospital from February 13 to April 13, 2012 on 239 patients scheduled for surgery. The data were collected by five trained diploma nurses using structured interviewer administered questionnaires that were prepared based on state trait anxiety inventory measurement scale. The quantitative data were entered into SPSS for windows version 16. 0 and descriptive, simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 239 patients were enrolled in the study with a response rate of 93.0%. Their mean age was 42.7  1.8 years (range 16 to 85 years). Nearly over half 53.6% were females, while 48.1% illiterate, 72.4% Oromo and 56.5% were Muslim followers. Significant preoperative anxiety was seen in 70.3% patients. The most common factors that lead to anxiety were fear of death 38.1% and fear of unknown origin 24.3% and the most common strategy mentioned by patient in reducing anxiety were talking to other patient 79.8% and religious belief. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, two third 70.3% of preoperative patients had anxiety. Factors which were positively correlated with anxiety were trait anxiety, single and divorced, time of operation and income. Factors which were shown to reduce anxiety were preoperative anxiety related information provision and afternoon operation.

Here, we report on the development of a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein, expressed at high levels in yeast (Pichia pastoris), as a suitable vaccine candidate against COVID-19. After introducing two modifications into the wild-type RBD gene to reduce yeast-derived hyperglycosylation and improve stability during protein expression, we show that the recombinant protein, RBD219-N1C1, is equivalent to the wild-type RBD recombinant protein (RBD219-WT) in an in vitro ACE-2 binding assay. Immunogenicity studies of RBD219-N1C1 and RBD219-WT proteins formulated with Alhydrogel? were conducted in mice, and, after two doses, both the RBD219-WT and RBD219-N1C1 vaccines induced high levels of binding IgG antibodies. Using a SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we further showed that sera obtained after a two-dose immunization schedule of the vaccines were sufficient to elicit strong neutralizing antibody titers in the 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 range, for both antigens tested. The vaccines induced IFN-?3 IL-6, and IL-10 secretion, among other cytokines.

SUMMARY: MTM clinical pharmacists at JHHCG collaborate with patients to identify barriers to adherence, review medications, and develop plans for improvement. Through improved medication adherence, the goals for this program are to reduce adverse effects, patient cost, and medical visits or hospital admissions. Central to this practice is the belief that strong patient relationships are necessary to uncover the root cause of medication nonadherence. In Postgraduate Year-1 (PGY-1) community-based pharmacy residency training, new pharmacists learn the value of building relationships with patients and working through complex problems during this clinical experience. By assisting patients with complex medical conditions and social situations, new pharmacists gain skills in patient care, pharmacy operations, and medication access challenges. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced the discontinuation of face-to-face interactions in this setting, rotation experiences for residents were adapted with the goal of continuing high-impact patient interactions and keeping everyone involved safe. CONCLUSION: Although considerable changes were made to the MTM rotation because of the COVID-19 pandemic, residents were still able to provide meaningful clinical care telephonically and continued to learn valuable patient care skills. Most importantly, high quality care was still delivered to the patients despite considerable challenges. The major challenge for the residents' clinical experiences as a result of the adjustments has been finding an impactful volume of complex patients to enhance their skills.

Chest CT findings were qualitatively compared on admission and serial chest CT scans were semi-quantitively evaluated between two groups using curve estimations. On admission, significantly more bilateral (97.6% vs. 73.5%, p = 0.001) and diffuse lesions (39.0% vs. 8.4%, p < 0.001) with higher total CT score (median 10 vs. 4, p < 0.001) were observed in non-survivor group compared with survivor group. Besides, crazy-paving pattern was more predominant in non-survivor group than survivor group (39.0% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001). From the prediction of curve estimation, in survivor group total CT score increased in the first 20 days reaching a peak of 6 points and then gradually decreased for more than other 40 days (R2 = 0.545, p < 0.001). In non-survivor group, total CT score rapidly increased over 10 points in the first 10 days and gradually increased afterwards until ARDS occurred with following death events (R2 = 0.711, p < 0.001).

The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures.

However, to date, there are limited data regarding: (i) the optimal models for integration of genomic data into epidemiological investigations, and (ii) how to quantify and evaluate public health impacts resulting from genomic epidemiological investigations. Methods: We developed the Pathogen Genomics in Public HeAlth Surveillance Evaluation (PG-PHASE) Framework to guide examination of the use of WGS in public health surveillance and disease control. We illustrate the use of this framework with three pathogens as case studies: Listeria monocytogenes , Mycobacterium tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2. Results: The framework utilises an adaptable whole-of-system approach towards understanding how interconnected elements in the public health application of pathogen genomics contribute to public health processes and outcomes. The three phases of the PG-PHASE Framework are designed to support understanding of WGS laboratory processes, analysis, reporting and data sharing, and how genomic data are utilised in public health practice across all stages, from the decision to send an isolate or sample for sequencing to the use of sequence data in public health surveillance, investigation and decision-making. Importantly, the phases can be used separately or in conjunction, depending on the need of the evaluator. Subsequent to conducting evaluation underpinned by the framework, avenues may be developed for strategic investment or interventions to improve utilisation of whole genome sequencing. Conclusions: Comprehensive evaluation is critical to support health departments, public health laboratories and other stakeholders to successfully incorporate microbial genomics into public health practice. The PG-PHASE Framework aims to assist public health laboratories, health departments and authorities who are either considering transitioning to whole genome sequencing or intending to assess the integration of WGS in public health practice, including the capacity to detect and respond to outbreaks and associated costs, challenges and facilitators in the utilisation of microbial genomics and public health impacts.","output":"The Pathogen Genomics in Public HeAlth Surveillance Evaluation (PG-PHASE) Framework: An Implementation Science Approach to Evaluating Pathogen Whole Genome Sequencing in Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 156,242 Americans died as a result of alcohol, drugs or suicide in 2019, representing a slight increase over 2018, according to the latest annual report released May 18 by Trust for America's Health and Well Being Trust.","output":"New data reveals 156,000+ lost to MH, SUD issues pre\\\\COVID\\\\19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Separation logics are widely used for verifying programs that manipulate complex heap-based data structures. These logics build on so-called separation algebras, which allow expressing properties of heap regions such that modifications to a region do not invalidate properties stated about the remainder of the heap. This concept is key to enabling modular reasoning and also extends to concurrency. While heaps are naturally related to mathematical graphs, many ubiquitous graph properties are non-local in character, such as reachability between nodes, path lengths, acyclicity and other structural invariants, as well as data invariants which combine with these notions. Reasoning modularly about such graph properties remains notoriously difficult, since a local modification can have side-effects on a global property that cannot be easily confined to a small region. In this paper, we address the question: What separation algebra can be used to avoid proof arguments reverting back to tedious global reasoning in such cases? To this end, we consider a general class of global graph properties expressed as fixpoints of algebraic equations over graphs. We present mathematical foundations for reasoning about this class of properties, imposing minimal requirements on the underlying theory that allow us to define a suitable separation algebra. Building on this theory, we develop a general proof technique for modular reasoning about global graph properties expressed over program heaps, in a way which can be directly integrated with existing separation logics. To demonstrate our approach, we present local proofs for two challenging examples: a priority inheritance protocol and the non-blocking concurrent Harris list.","output":"Local Reasoning for Global Graph Properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Evidence is lacking on how to manage imminent suicidality in adolescents with self-harm.

Challenges included experiencing distrust from staff and fear of not being able to abstain from self-harm, which BA is conditioned upon. However, this condition was also perceived to induce self-motivation and growth. BA appeared well-adapted to the target group, fulfilling needs of predictability, autonomy, and opportunity for recovery to prevent self-harm. Suggestions for improvement included continually informing staff about important features of BA. To further evaluate benefits and challenges of BA, future research may evaluate clinical and health-economic outcomes and perspectives from parents and caregivers.","output":"A Safe Place Where I Am Welcome to Unwind When I Choose toExperiences of Brief Admission by Self-Referral for Adolescents Who Self-Harm at Risk for Suicide: A Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We evaluated the antiviral activity of the marine alga, Ulva fasciata, collected from Rasa beach and Forno beach, Bzios, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on the replication of human metapneumovirus (HMPV). The algae extracts were prepared using three different methodologies to compare the activity of different groups of chemical composites obtained through these different methodologies. Four out of the six extracts inhibited nearly 100% of viral replication. The results demonstrated that the majority of the extracts (five out of six) possess virucidal activity and therefore have the ability to interact with the extracellular viral particles and prevent the infection. On the other hand, only two extracts (from Forno beach, obtained by maceration and maceration of the decoction) were able to interact with cell receptors, hindering the viral entry. Finally, only the extract of algae collected at Forno beach, obtained by maceration presented intracellular activity. To our knowledge, this is a pioneer study on antiviral activity of marine algae against HMPV. It is also the first on antiviral activity against HMPV ever done in Brazil. The study also shows the effect of different environment factors and different chemical procedures used to obtain the extract on its biological properties.","output":"Antiviral activity of the green marine alga Ulva fasciata on the replication of human metapneumovirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Involving a patient's relatives is a complex endeavour, especially in emergency departments (EDs). Generally, relatives are recognized as vital partners in health care, but in-depth knowledge on how these family involvement processes take place in the everyday practices of EDs is sparse. The aim of this study is to explore the practice of involving relatives in the acute ambulatory clinical pathway in the ED, as seen from the perspectives of patients and relatives. METHODS The study was conducted as ethnographic fieldwork in an ED at a Danish Regional Hospital. Two months of participant-observation were carried out focusing on 43 patients. Of these, 18 patients and/or relatives were selected for telephone interviews after 1 week, and of these 11 were selected for in-depth interviews 3 weeks later. RESULTS Unpredictability is a basic condition of any ED. For the patients and relatives, who are unfamiliar with the routines in the ED, unpredictability translates to a sense of temporal and existential unpredictability, reinforced by a sense of not knowing when the examinations will be completed or if/when they will be sent home. Relatives' involvement in the ED is affected by this sense of unpredictability and by the existing relations between patients and their relatives prior to entering the ED. The stay in the ED is only one 'stop' in the complete acute ambulatory clinical pathway but relatives' involvement also concerns the time before and after the stay in the ED. Practices of involving relatives leave (some) relatives invisible in the clinical pathway. As a consequence, they are often not addressed, which un-enables their involvement. CONCLUSION Involvement of relatives presupposes recognizing the relatives as participants if they are to be involved in the patient's clinical pathway in the ED. As a start, it is advisable that the medical staff ask the patients on arrival who has accompanied them in the ED, and if and in what way they want their companions involved in the ED. There is a need for a more integrated and contextualized understanding of relatives' involvement, as it takes place along an extended acute ambulatory clinical pathway.","output":"Involvement un-enabled?

Evidence is consolidating on incidence and associated drivers of infections, predominantly in high-income settings. It is however still unclear what the risk factors may be for specific health professions, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey in a representative sample of 1,183 medical doctors registered with Brazils Federal Council of Medicine in one developed (Sao Paulo) and one disadvantaged state (Maranhao). Between February-June 2021, we administered a telephone questionnaire to collect data on physicians demographics, deployment to services, vaccination status, and self-reported COVID-19 infections. We performed descriptive, univariate, and multilevel clustered analysis to explore the association between physicians infection rates, and their sociodemographic and employment characteristics. A generalized linear mixed model with a binomial distribution was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratio. ResultsWe found that 35.8% of physicians in our sample were infected with COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic. The infection rate in Maranhao (49.2%) [95% CI 45.0-53.4] was almost twice that in Sao Paulo (24.1%) [95% CI 20.8-27.5]. Being a physician in Maranhao [95% CI 2.08-3.57], younger than 50 years [95% CI 1.41-2.89], and having worked in a COVID-19 ward [95% CI 1.28-2.27], were positively associated with the probability of infections. Conversely, working with diagnostic services [95% CI 0.53-0.96], in administrative functions [95% CI 0.42-0.80], or in teaching and research [95% CI 0.48-0.91] was negatively associated. ConclusionsBased on data from Brazil, COVID-19 infections in LMICs may be more likely in those health systems with lower physician-to-patient ratios, and younger doctors working in COVID-19 wards may be infected more frequently. Such findings may be used to identify policies to mitigate COVID-19 effects on HWs in LMICs.","output":"Demographic and professional risk factors of COVID-19 infections among physicians in low- and middle-income settings; findings from a representative survey in two Brazilian states"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: COVID-19 pandemic is a World Health Organization day-to-day work and has a significant crisis on the physical and mental health of humans However, little is known about the mental health crisis of the pandemic in Sub-Saharan countries Therefore, this study aimed to determine the magnitude of psychological problems and associated factors among communities living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 10 to 30, 2020 Data were collected from 420 respondents selected using a consecutive sampling technique An online self-administered and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS21) survey during the initial phase of the pandemic was conducted to assess the presence of psychological problems for the last two weeks in response to the infection Results: The magnitude of the psychological problem from moderate to severe levels was 66 4% The predictor variables of the outcome were female gender, above the secondary level of education, monthly income below 3000 ETB, and more than three family size at 95% CI, P&lt;0 05 Conclusion: At the time of the initial COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of psychological problems Therefore, working on those identified factors would be vital to promote the mental resilience of a community towards the pandemic","output":"The Magnitude of Psychological Problem and Associated Factor in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Among Communities Living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, March 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study Design"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a mechanism explaining the approximately linear growth of Covid19 world total cases as well as the slow linear decrease of the daily new cases (and daily deaths) observed (in average) in USA and Italy.

Materials and Methods: Included in the study group were 120 COVID-19 patients (56 women and 104 men; 61 years of median age; range: 21C93 years) who underwent chest CT examinations at discharge between 5 March 2020 and 15 March 2021 and again at a follow-up time (3 months; range 30C237 days). A qualitative assessment by expert radiologists in the infectious disease field (experience of at least 5 years) was performed, and a quantitative evaluation using thoracic VCAR software (GE Healthcare, Chicago, Illinois, United States) and a pneumonia module of ANKE ASG-340 CT workstation (HTS Med & Anke, Naples, Italy) was performed. The qualitative evaluation included the presence of ground glass opacities (GGOs) consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, fibrotic-like changes (reticular pattern and/or honeycombing), bronchiectasis, air bronchogram, bronchial wall thickening, pulmonary nodules surrounded by GGOs, pleural and pericardial effusion, lymphadenopathy, and emphysema. A quantitative evaluation included the measurements of GGOs, consolidations, emphysema, residual healthy parenchyma, and total lung volumes for the right and left lung. A chi-square test and non-parametric test were utilized to verify the differences between groups. Correlation coefficients were used to analyze the correlation and variability among quantitative measurements by different computer tools. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. Results: The correlation coefficients showed great variability among the quantitative measurements by different tools when calculated on baseline CT scans and considering all patients. Instead, a good correlation (0.6) was obtained for the quantitative GGO, as well as the consolidation volumes obtained by two tools when calculated on baseline CT scans, considering the control group. An excellent correlation (0.75) was obtained for the quantitative residual healthy lung parenchyma volume, GGO, consolidation volumes obtained by two tools when calculated on follow-up CT scans, and for residual healthy lung parenchyma and GGO quantification when the percentage change of these volumes were calculated between a baseline and follow-up scan. The highest value of accuracy to identify patients with RT-PCR positive compared to the control group was obtained by a GGO total volume quantification by thoracic VCAR (accuracy = 0.75). Conclusions: Computer aided quantification could be an easy and feasible way to assess chest CT sequelae due to COVID-19 pneumonia; however, a great variability among measurements provided by different tools should be considered.","output":"Quantitative Analysis of Residual COVID-19 Lung CT Features: Consistency among Two Commercial Software"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 inhibitor, empagliflozin (EMPA), reduces mortality and hospitalisation for heart failure following myocardial infarction irrespective of diabetes status. While the findings suggest an inherent cardioprotective capacity, the mechanism remains unknown. We studied infarct size (IS) ex-vivo in isolated hearts exposed to global IR injury and in-vivo in rats subjected to regional myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury, in whom we followed left ventricular dysfunction for 28 days. We compared rats that were given EMPA orally for 7 days before, EMPA 1.5 h before IR injury and at onset of reperfusion and continued orally during the follow-up period. We used echocardiography, high resolution respirometry, microdialysis and plasma levels of -hydroxybutyrate to assess myocardial performance, mitochondrial respiration and intermediary metabolism, respectively. Pretreatment with EMPA for 7 days reduced IS in-vivo (65  7% vs. 46  8%, p < 0.0001 while administration 1.5 h before IR, at onset of reperfusion or ex-vivo did not. EMPA alleviated LV dysfunction irrespective of the reduction in IS. EMPA improved mitochondrial respiration and modulated myocardial interstitial metabolism while the concentration of -hydroxybutyric acid was only transiently increased without any association with IS reduction. EMPA reduces infarct size and yields cardioprotection in non-diabetic rats with ischemic LV dysfunction by an indirect, delayed intrinsic mechanism that also improves systolic function beyond infarct size reduction.

Housing precarity, which includes both the risk of eviction and utility disconnections or shut-offs, reduces a persons ability to abide by social distancing orders and comply with hygiene recommendations. Our analysis quantifies the impact of these various economic policies on COVID-19 infection and death rates using panel regression techniques to control for a variety of potential confounders. We find that policies that limit evictions are found to reduce COVID-19 infections by 3.8% and reduce deaths by 11%.

METHODS In this review article, we have searched the Medline database (PubMed) for the combination of the following key terms \\"Dermatological Manifestation\\", \\"cutaneous Manifestation\\", \\"Skin Manifestation\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"SARS-CoV-2\\". RESULTS The prevalence of skin manifestations related to COVID-19 ranged from 0.2% to 20%. The majority of these skin lesions are maculopapular eruptions. The skin presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic are described below. Traumatic skin conditions such as dermatitis in individuals, especially those with allergies, might initiate secondary to over-washing or rinsing with inappropriate detergents. Also, inappropriate use of personal protective equipment (mask-gloves-shield) can trigger skin lesions on the face and hands or aggravate the lesions of acne, seborrhoeic dermatitis, eczema, etc. Furthermore, cutaneous adverse drug reactions may occur during hospitalization or outpatient treatment of COVID-19 patients. Also, psychocutaneous disorders due to acute stress can trigger or deteriorate several skin manifestations. Moreover, COVID-19 prevalence and course may be changed in patients with autoimmune or chronic inflammatory underlying skin disorders such as psoriasis, lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, scleroderma who are on immunosuppressive or biological medications to control their disorders.

Consequently, MINCR was upregulated in NPC, and linked with worse prognosis and radiotherapy efficacy. MINCR intervention weakened NPC cell radioresistance. MINCR sponged miR-223 to regulate ZEB1. Inactivating AKT eliminated the increased radioresistance of CNE2 cells induced by overexpressing MINCR.

Neutrophils exist as a heterogeneous population, and their interaction with pathogens and other immune cells may shape the outcome of the host immune response. Diverse classes of viruses, including the recently identified novel SARS-CoV-2, have shown to alter the various aspects of neutrophil biology, offering possibilities for selective intervention. Here, we review heterogeneity within the neutrophil population, highlighting the functional consequences of circulating phenotypes and their critical involvement in exaggerating protective and pathological immune responses against the viruses. We discuss the recent findings of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in COVID-19 pathology and cover other viruses, where neutrophil biology and NETs are crucial for developing disease severity. In the end, we have also pointed out the areas where neutrophil-mediated responses can be finely tuned to outline opportunities for therapeutic manipulation in controlling inflammation against viral infection.","output":"Neutrophils at the crossroads of acute viral infections and severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The extraordinary variation of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules is critical for diversifying antigen presentation to T cells. Coupled with the rise of novel strains and rapidly evolving immune evasion SARS-CoV-2 proteins, HLA-mediated immunity in COVID-19 is critically important but far from being fully understood. A growing number of studies have found association of HLA variants with different COVID-19 outcomes and that HLA genotypes associate with differential immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Prediction studies have shown that mutations in multiple viral strains, most concentrated in the Spike protein, affect the affinity between these mutant peptides and HLA molecules. Understanding the impact of this variation on T-cell responses is critical for comprehending immunogenic mechanisms in both natural immunity and vaccine development.","output":"HLA variation and antigen presentation in COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purified coronavirus, detergent extracts of purified coronavirus, and virus-infected Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells were evaluated as antigen substrates in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and passive hemagglutination systems.

Participants aged 60-78 years were randomized to either a control group (n = 15) or a tai chi group (n = 15) for a 10-week period. The tai chi group received two, 8-form tai chi classes of 60 min duration per week. Changes in psychoemotional state, cognition, and the learning of fast and accurate reaching movements were assessed. In addition, the potential roles of the autonomic nervous system and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. Tai chi practice decreased (P < 0.05) perceived stress, whereas no change in autonomic nervous system activity was observed. Improvements in mental switching correlated with decreased depressive symptoms and increased BDNF levels (P < 0.05), whereas improvements in inhibitory control tended to correlate with BDNF levels (P = 0.08). Improvements in visuospatial processing tended to correlate with decreased depressive symptoms (P = 0.07) while improved visuospatial processing correlated with improved motor planning during learning tasks (P < 0.05). This study suggests that tai chi is an effective intervention that can be delivered under pandemic conditions to improve mental and physical function in older adults.","output":"Tai chi improves psychoemotional state, cognition, and motor learning in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are pathogens that threaten human health. Several CoVs are maintained in nature, recombine, mutate, evolve, and emerge as novel CoVs to cause new zoonotic diseases. CoVs infection displays immense interindividual clinical variability, varying from asymptomatic to severe. Risk factors, such as older age, underlying health conditions, and the human genome could address the diseases variable symptoms. The possible association between disease severity and DNA polymorphisms in the virus-host factors presents a unique opportunity to reveal human genetic determinants in infection and disease susceptibility. This chapter emphasizes the history, taxonomy, naming, genetic diversity of CoVs, the genome of CoVs, and potential genes for diseases pathogenesis. This information can help to prepare countermeasures against future spillover and pathogenic infections in humans with novel CoVs. ? 2021 Elsevier Inc.

We compared EBOV-GP interactions with human cells and cells from African fruit bats. We found that susceptibility to EBOV-GPCdependent infection was not limited to bat cells from potential reservoir species, and we observed that GP displayed similar biological properties in human and bat cells. The only exception was GP localization, which was to a greater extent intracellular in bat cells as compared to human cells. Collectively, our results suggest that GP interactions with fruit bat and human cells are similar and do not limit EBOV tropism for certain bat species.","output":"Comparative Analysis of Ebola Virus Glycoprotein Interactions With Human and Bat Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Women play a pivotal role in managing crises and diminishing their serious consequences both in the family and society. In the first place, the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most severe crises in the world. Accordingly, many precautionary measures have been taken in many countries, including Saudi Arabia, such as border closures, lack of movement, and quarantine procedures, leading to an unprecedented impact on the daily lifestyle, and contributing significantly to increasing pressures on women because of her multiroles in family and work. This study aims at identifying the role of women in managing family crises during COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a descriptive, cross-sectional study. An online survey was conducted using self-designed electronic questionnaire consisting knowledge about the role of Saudi women in managing family during COVID-19 crises. The questionnaire was applied to 324 Saudi working women in Riyadh and Najran, with an average age of 33 years. RESULTS: The results indicate that the role of Saudi women during the COVID-19 crisis was approximately 82%. Moreover, results showed that the prevalence of the social, psychological, and professional role of Saudi women during crisis was 82.24%, 83.40%, and 78.80%, respectively, which indicates the importance of the role of Saudi women in managing family crises during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the study emphasizes the importance of urging responsible persons to provide a package of rescue and stimulus, including social protection measures. Furthermore, it empowers Saudi women in all sectors of society and provides them with all means of support to help them achieve their mandated role in society generally and in their families particularly.","output":"The role of Saudi women in crisis management within the family: The COVID-19 pandemic as a model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe two fatal cases of COVID-19 in which Rhizopus microsporus and Lichtheimia corymbifera were cultured from endotracheal aspirate samples.

Currently, there is no definitive treatment for COVID-19, although many vaccines have been developed. The World Health Organization has approved the safety and efficacy of the AstraZeneca/Oxford, Johnson and Johnson/Janssen (JnJ), Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, Sinopharm, and Sinovac vaccines so far. The approved formulations of AstraZeneca, JnJ, and Gam-COVID-vac (Sputnik V) contain DNA delivered within non-replicating recombinant adenovirus vector-based systems, while the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines utilize mRNA technology and lipid nanoparticle delivery systems. All of these vaccines encode production of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, ultimately triggering immunity in the human body. COVID-19 causes several cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias, myocarditis, pericarditis, and venous thromboembolism. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been associated with rare, but sometimes fatal, cardiovascular side effects, which are the topics of this review. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in general may cause thromboembolic events, such as cerebral vein thrombosis, and mRNA-based vaccines in particular may cause myocarditis/pericarditis, with the latter more likely to occur in younger adults after the second vaccination dose. Nevertheless, the advantages of these vaccines for ending the pandemic and/or decreasing the mortality rate outweigh any risk for the rare cardiovascular complications.","output":"Cardiovascular Complications of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines: An Overview"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with Covid-19, after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU), experience some psychological, physical, and cognitive disorders, which is known as the postCintensive care syndrome and has adverse effects on patients and their families.

As the role of æ T cells in early, active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is well documented, we focused on elucidating the æ T cell response in persistent or controlled Mtb infection. Systems analysis of circulating æ T cells from a South African adolescent cohort identified a distinct population of CD8+ æ T cells that expanded in this state. These cells had features indicative of persistent antigenic exposure but were robust cytolytic effectors and cytokine/chemokine producers. While these æ T cells displayed an attenuated response to TCR-mediated stimulation, they expressed Natural Killer (NK) cell receptors and had robust CD16 (FcRIIIA)-mediated cytotoxic response, suggesting alternative ways for æ T cells to control this stage of the infection. Despite this NK- like functionality, the CD8+ æ T cells consisted of highly expanded clones, which utilized TCRs with different V/ pairs. Theses TCRs could respond to an Mtb-lysate, but not to phosphoantigens, which are components of Mtb-lysate that activate æ T cells in acute Mtb infection, indicating that the CD8+ æ T cells were induced in a stage-specific, antigen-driven manner. Indeed, trajectory analysis showed that these æ T cells arose from naive cells that had traversed distinct differentiation paths in this infection stage. Importantly, increased levels of CD8+ æ T cells were also found in other chronic inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease and cancer, suggesting that persistent antigenic exposure may lead to similar æ T cell responses.","output":"The role of antigen recognition in the æ T cell response at the controlled stage of M. tuberculosis infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A hallmark of severe COVID-19 pneumonia is SARS-CoV-2 infection of the facultative progenitors of lung alveoli, the alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (AT2s).

Here, we present an in vitro human model that simulates the initial apical infection of alveolar epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 by using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived AT2s that have been adapted to air-liquid interface culture. We find a rapid transcriptomic change in infected cells, characterized by a shift to an inflammatory phenotype with upregulation of NF-&#954;B signaling and loss of the mature alveolar program. Drug testing confirms the efficacy of remdesivir as well as TMPRSS2 protease inhibition, validating a putative mechanism used for viral entry in alveolar cells.

The EpCAM is a cell-surface glycoprotein highly expressed in colorectal carcinomas. The objective of the present study is to develop an edible vaccine system through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa). For the transformation, two plant expression vectors containing genes encoding for the EpCAM recombinant protein along with the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Joining (J)-chain tagged with the KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention motif (J-chain K) were constructed. The vectors were successfully transformed and expressed in the Chinese cabbage individually using Agrobacterium. The transgenic Chinese cabbages were screened using genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in T(0) transgenic plant lines generated from both transformants. Similarly, the immunoblot analysis revealed the expression of recombinant proteins in the transformants. Further, the T(1) transgenic plants were generated by selfing the transgenic plants (T(0)) carrying EpCAMCIgM Fc and J-chain K proteins, respectively. Subsequently, the T(1) plants generated from EpCAMCIgM Fc and J-chain K transformants were crossed to generate F(1) plants carrying both transgenes. The presence of both transgenes was validated using PCR in the F(1) plants. In addition, the expression of Chinese cabbage-derived EpCAMCIgM Fc  J-chain K was evaluated using immunoblot and ELISA analyses in the F(1) plants.

The purpose of this study is to provide an overview of the literature published thus far on the indirect health effects of COVID-19 and to explore the data sources and methodologies being used to assess indirect health effects. METHODS: A scoping review of peer-reviewed literature using three search engines was performed. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy studies were included in the final analysis. Nearly half (46.5%) of included studies focused on cardiovascular health outcomes. The main methodologies used were observational analytic and surveys. Data was drawn from individual health facilities, multicentre networks, regional registries, and national health information systems. Most studies were conducted in high-income countries with only 35.4% of studies representing low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSION: Healthcare utilization for non-COVID-19 conditions has decreased almost universally, across both high- and lower-income countries. The pandemic's impact on non-COVID-19 health outcomes, particularly for chronic diseases, may take years to fully manifest and should be a topic of ongoing study. Future research should be tied to system improvement and the promotion of health equity, with researchers identifying potentially actionable findings for national, regional, and local health leadership. Public health professionals must also seek to address the disparity in published data from LMICs as compared to high-income countries.","output":"Assessing the Indirect Effects of COVID-19 on Healthcare Delivery, Utilization, and Health Outcomes: A Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit the entire world since March 2020 provides various aspects of peoples lives economic social behavior and life habits.

DESIGN: This cross-sectional survey study collected responses from 13 April 2020 until 30 April 2020. Students at US allopathic medical schools completed the survey online. RESULTS: 1,668 responses were analyzed. A total of 337 (20.2%) respondents thought the pandemic would affect their choice of specialty, with differences across class years: 15.2% (53) of first-years (MS1s), 26.4% (92) of second-years (MS2s), 23.7% (162) of third-years (MS3s), and 9.7% (22) of fourth-years (MS4s) (p < 0.0001). Among all classes, the most common reason chosen was inability to explore specialties of interest (244, 72.4%), and the second was inability to bolster their residency application (162, 48.1%). Out of the MS3s who chose the latter, the majority were concerned about recommendation letters (68, 81.0%) and away rotations (62, 73.8%). As high as 17.4% (119) of MS3s said they were more likely to take an extra year during medical school as a result of the pandemic. Region of the US, number of local COVID cases, and number of local COVID deaths had no effect on whether respondents thought the pandemic would affect their specialty choice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that about one-fifth of surveyed medical students currently believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will affect their choice of specialty, with many of these citing concerns that they cannot explore specialties or obtain recommendation letters. With prolonged suspension of clinical rotations, targeted efforts by medical schools to address these concerns through enhanced virtual curriculum development and advising strategies will become increasingly important.

The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. RESULTS: Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown.

METHODOLOGY: A randomized control trial was conducted amongst class II students of a private school in Korangi, Karachi. Pre-intervention assessment including baseline knowledge and observed practices of hand washing in comparison with World Health Organization (WHO) standard hand washing techniques was done. This was followed by education and demonstration of proper hand washing steps by principal investigator utilizing visual aids. Participants were then randomized into two group: Group A (education only group) and Group B (education along with glow gel application group). First post-intervention assessment was conducted on same day where both groups were observed for the hand washing steps and scored for hand washing technique. In addition, participants of group B were shown germs under Ultraviolet (UV) light. School was revisited after 1 week later and participants were reassessed for their hand washing technique along with cleanliness grade after applying glow gel and observing under UV light. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 21.0. RESULT: No significant differences were found in median hand washing scores pre-intervention between both the groups (Group A vs B: 4 vs 5, P value = 0.659), while significant improvement in median hand washing scores was seen post intervention in group B as compared to group A (7 vs 6, P value = 0.011).

The extent of spread of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the UK and elsewhere is unknown because typically only symptomatic individuals are diagnosed. We performed a serological study of recent blood donors in Scotland to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 as a marker of past infection. Methods. A pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay was used to detect neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. The study group comprised samples from 1000 blood donors collected in Scotland during March, 2020. Controls were collected from 100 donors in Scotland during 2019. Findings. All samples collected on the 17th March, 2020 (n=500) were negative in the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus microneutralisation assay. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 5 of the 500 samples collected 21st to 23rd March; one further sample was reactive in an anti-spike ELISA. Interpretation. Although we cannot use the rise in numbers seropositive to infer the contemporary seroprevalence or the growth rate of the epidemic, we note that they are consistent with frequency of reported diagnosed infections and SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths reported in that time period in Scotland, given that seroconversion takes up to 2-3 weeks. It should also be noted that blood donors are not representative of the general population; in particular, those with a history of recent respiratory infections are deferred. Finally, it is unknown what proportion of infected individuals seroconvert and become reactive in the assays used. Serial follow up studies are needed to track infection and seroconversion in this and other similar populations However, these data indicate that sero-surveys of blood banks can serve as a useful tool for tracking the emergence and progression of an epidemic like the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","output":"Neutralising antibodies to SARS coronavirus 2 in Scottish blood donors - a pilot study of the value of serology to determine population exposure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During March to June 2021 India has experienced a deadly second wave of COVID-19 with an increased number of post-vaccination breakthrough infections reported across the country. To understand the possible reason of these breakthroughs we collected 677 clinical samples (throat swab/ nasal swabs) of individuals who had received two doses (n=592) and one dose (n=85) of vaccines (Covishield and Covaxin,) and tested positive for COVID-19, from 17 states/Union Territories of country. These cases were telephonically interviewed and clinical data was analyzed. A total of 511 SARS-CoV-2 genomes were recovered with genome coverage of higher than 98% from both the cases. Analysis of both the cases determined that 86.69% (n=443) of them belonged to the Delta variant along with Alpha, Kappa, Delta AY.1 and Delta AY.2. The Delta variant clustered into 4 distinct sub-lineages. Sub-lineage-I had mutations: ORF1ab-A1306S, P2046L, P2287S, V2930L, T3255I, T3446A, G5063S, P5401L, A6319V and N-G215C; Sub-lineage -II : ORF1ab- P309L, A3209V, V3718A, G5063S, P5401L and ORF7a-L116F; Sub-lineage -III : ORF1ab- A3209V, V3718A, T3750I, G5063S, P5401L and Spike-A222V; Sub-lineage -IV ORF1ab- P309L, D2980N, F3138S and spike - K77T.

Rejected proposals were more likely than accepted proposals to violate the proposal script. Compared to accepted proposals, rejected proposals included fewer ritual elements and they often happened \\"off-time.\\" Specifically, rejected proposals came earlier in the relationship, typically prior to the discussion of the topic of marriage by the couple, and rejected men sometimes proposed to \\"save\\" an unstable or abusive relationship that was headed toward dissolution. As with other important life transition events, audiences played an important role in many proposals. Rejected proposals were more likely to occur in public than accepted proposals, and when present, audience members often participated in the proposal by encouraging couples to follow the proposal script and by expressing dissatisfaction when the script was violated. Some audiences became hostile when the woman said \\"no.\\" Also consistent with life script theory, couples evinced strong emotions during proposals, and confusion and anger were common emotional responses among rejected suitors. Indeed, 15% of rejected proposal accounts described intimate partner violence. Yet, about 30% of relationships continued after the rejection, sometimes for years.

Biomarkers distinguishing different COVID-19 phenotypes from sepsis syndrome remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To characterize circulating biomarkers of endothelial damage in different COVID-19 clinical disease stages compared with sepsis syndrome and normal volunteers. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (n = 49) were classified into moderate, severe, or critical (life-threatening) disease. Plasma samples were collected within 48 to 72 h of hospitalization to analyze endothelial activation markers, including soluble Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), von Willebrand Factor (VWF), A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif no. 13 (ADAMTS-13) activity, thrombomodulin (TM), and soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI); heparan sulfate (HS) for endothelial glycocalyx degradation; C5b9 deposits on endothelial cells in culture and soluble C5b9 for complement activation; circulating dsDNA for neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) presence, and 2-antiplasmin and PAI-1 as parameters of fibrinolysis. We compared the level of each biomarker in all three COVID-19 groups and healthy donors as controls (n = 45). Results in critically ill COVID-19 patients were compared with other intensive care unit (ICU) patients with septic shock (SS, n = 14), sepsis (S, n = 7), and noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome (NI-SIRS, n = 7). RESULTS: All analyzed biomarkers were increased in COVID-19 patients versus controls (P < 0.001), except for ADAMTS-13 activity that was normal in both groups. The increased expression of sVCAM-1, VWF, sTNFRI, and HS was related to COVID-19 disease severity (P < 0.05). Several differences in these parameters were found between ICU groups: SS patients showed significantly higher levels of VWF, TM, sTNFRI, and NETS compared with critical COVID-19 patients and ADAMTS-13 activity was significantly lover in SS, S, and NI-SIRS versus critical COVID-19 (P < 0.001). Furthermore, 2-antiplasmin activity was higher in critical COVID-19 versus NI-SIRS (P < 0.01) and SS (P < 0.001), whereas PAI-1 levels were significantly lower in COVID-19 patients compared with NI-SIRS, S, and SS patients (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients present with increased circulating endothelial stress products, complement activation, and fibrinolytic dysregulation, associated with disease severity. COVID-19 endotheliopathy differs from SS, in which endothelial damage is also a critical feature of pathobiology. These biomarkers could help to stratify the severity of COVID-19 disease and may also provide information to guide specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate endotheliopathy progression.","output":"Distinctive Biomarker Features in the Endotheliopathy of COVID-19 and Septic Syndromes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE We explored whether children with hearing loss (HL) and their parents perceive the child's quality of life (QOL) similarly using the Hearing Environment And Reflections on Quality of Life (HEAR-QL) survey.

METHODS: We included 29 participating neurosurgeons in centers from all geographical regions in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The study period, which was between March 5, 2020 and May 20, 2020, was divided into three equal periods to determine the longitudinal effect of COVID-19 measures on neurosurgical practice over time. RESULTS: During the 11-week study period, 474 neurosurgical interventions were performed. The median number of neurosurgical procedures per day was 5.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 3.5C8). The number of cases declined from 72 in the first week and plateaued at the 30s range in subsequent weeks. The most and least number of performed procedures were oncology (129 [27.2%]) and functional procedures (6 [1.3%]), respectively. Emergency (Priority 1) cases were more frequent than non-urgent (Priority 4) cases (178 [37.6%] vs. 74 [15.6%], respectively). In our series, there were three positive COVID-19 cases. There was a significant among-period difference in the length of hospital stay, which dropped from a median stay of 7 days (IQR: 4 C 18) to 6 (IQR: 3 - 13) to 5 days (IQR: 2 - 8). There was no significant among-period difference with respect to institution type, complications, or mortality. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the number of procedures performed in neurosurgery practice. The load of emergency neurosurgery procedures did not change throughout the three periods, which reflects the need to designate ample resources to cover emergencies. Notably, with strict screening for COVID -19 infections, neurosurgical procedures could be safely performed during the early pandemic phase. We recommend to restart performing neurosurgical procedures once the pandemic gets stabilized to avoid possible post-pandemic health-care system intolerable overload.","output":"COVD-12.

If KL is associated with longevity, then we would expect the genotype counts to differ between the 2 cohorts.

However, these associations did not replicate in the remainder of the UK Biobank cohort.

However, the development of such immunogens is often complicated by inefficiencies in their production.

LuS and ferritin coupled to SpyTag expressed well in a mammalian expression system when an N-linked glycan was added to the nanoparticle surface. The respiratory syncytial virus fusion (F) glycoprotein trimerstabilized in the prefusion conformation and fused with SpyCatchercould be efficiently conjugated to LuS-SpyTag or ferritin-SpyTag, enabling multivalent display of F trimers with prefusion antigenicity. Similarly, F-glycoprotein trimers from human parainfluenza virus-type 3 and spike-glycoprotein trimers from SARS-CoV-2 could be displayed on LuS nanoparticles with decent yield and antigenicity. Notably, murine vaccination with 0.08 g of SARS-CoV-2 spike-LuS nanoparticle elicited similar neutralizing responses as 2.0 g of spike, which was ~ 25-fold higher on a weight-per-weight basis.

It activated different subsets of the lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells (331%), T cells (102%), and B cells (39%) at 100 g/ml concentration. The significant activation of NK cells is associated with the dose-dependent killing of tumor cells by activated normal lymphocytes in a functional assay. Immune activation by RR1 in normal lymphocytes elicited the synthesis of interleukin (IL)-1 (1080 pg/ml), IL-6 (21,833 pg/ml), IL-12 p70 (50.19 pg/ml), IL-12 p40 (918.23 pg/ml), IL-18 (27.47 pg/ml), IFN-  (90.16 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- (2225 pg/ml) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 (2307 pg/ml) at 100 g/ml concentration, while it did not induce the production of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, interferon (IFN)- and TNF-. The cytokine profile clearly demonstrates the Th1 pathway of T helper cell differentiation essential for cell mediated immunity, with a self-regulatory mechanism for the control of its overproduction. RR1 also activated the complements in the alternate pathway, demonstrated by a stepwise increase in C3a des Arg components. Incidentally, RR1 stimulation did not produce any oxidative stress or inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the lymphocytes or any significant increase in nitric oxide production. The water solubility, high molecular mass, activation of lymphocytes especially NK cells, complement activation, Th1 pathway-associated cytokine profile, together with a low level of nitric oxide synthesis and absence of oxidative stress confer important immunoprotective potential to this novel -d-glucan.","output":"Immune stimulating properties of a novel polysaccharide from the medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A nurse who cared for prime minister Boris Johnson when he had COVID-19 has resigned, saying that the government's 1% pay rise offer for nurses in England shows a lack of respect for the profession.

However, there is a scarcity of evaluation of ABL to provide evidence of the scale of its adoption in the university, its forms in different academic disciplines, its impact on different groups of students, and how to improve its effectiveness. Ideally, evaluation is always integral to pedagogic initiatives. It is however a reality that evaluation comes with challenges.

Determining transmission routes and risk levels during healthcare is of great importance in preventing nosocomial outbreaks. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of nosocomial transmission and factors affecting the transmission in HCW. METHODS: HCWs admitted to the infectious diseases outpatient clinic due to contact with a COVID-19 patient and diagnosed with SARS-COV-2 by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) between 20 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 822 HCWs with 295 low, 284 intermediate and 243 high-risk exposures were included in the study. 27.1% of the HCWs were male, and the median age was 31.9 years (20C62). 89.5% of these patients were directly in charge of patient care. Of the index cases contacted, 72.6% were HCW, and 27.4% were non-HCW patients. Most of the risky exposure (51.7%) occurred in nurses. The occurrence frequency of high-risk exposure was lower in those assigned to direct patient care when compared with the occurrence frequency of moderate-risk or low-risk exposures (76.5%, 94.7, 95.3, respectively p<0.001). In most high-risk exposures (220/253), the index cases were HCWs (p<0.001). Symptoms were detected in 311 of the HCWs (37.8%) during the follow-up. The median time to perform SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was 5.3 days (IQR) after the last risky exposure. In multivariate analysis, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positivity was 5.65 times higher in HCWs not directly involved in patient care than HCWs who are not involved in patient care (95% CI 2.437 to 13.111; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides particularly useful information on post-exposure COVID-19 follow-up and management of working schedules and procedures of HCWs.","output":"Investigation of the relation between risk assessment of exposure and nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission in healthcare workers: a prospective single-centre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the lack of defining features in the clinical manifestations and radiographic findings for children with mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) has become a useful diagnostic method. This study was performed to explore the relationship between the qPCR findings, clinical symptoms, and inflammatory markers in children with MPP. Four hundred children with MPP have been enrolled in this retrospective analysis. All clinical and analytical information, including mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) PCR results, has been collected. Based on the PCR results, the patients were divided into groups with load values (copy number) < 10(5) (54 cases), 10(5) and <10(6) (71 cases), 10(6) and <10(7) (112 cases), 10(7) and 10(8) (114 cases), and >10(8) (49 cases). The clinical features (including symptoms and signs) and inflammatory indicators were compared among the groups. The incidence of high fever (above 39C), thermal peak during the entire hospitalization period, fever duration, days of hospitalization, and plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were statistically correlated with the MP PCR load value in children with MPP. The analysis of relevance degree showed the correlative order as a thermal peak of hospitalization > duration of fever > period of hospitalization > LDH value > C-reactive protein value.

In this paper, we present a concept for reactive collision avoidance using Capacitive Proximity Sensor (CPS), with the goal to augment robot perception in close proximity situations. We propose a proximity-based potential field method using capacitive measurement for collision avoidance. A local minima problem is solved by applying tangential forces around the virtual obstacle points. We evaluate the proof-of-concept both in simulation and on a real mobile robot equipped with CPS.

Approximately 5% of patients develop chronic antibiotic-dependent or antibiotic-refractory pouchitis without any effective treatment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of chronic pouchitis. METHODS: This was a single-center, double-blinded, parallel group trial comparing donor fecal microbiota transplantation with placebo (autologous transplant) in chronic pouchitis. Twenty-six patients were recruited at the Helsinki University Hospital between December 2017 and August 2018 and were randomly allocated a 1:1 ratio to either donor fecal microbiota transplantation or placebo. The protocol included 2 transplantations into the pouch on weeks 0 and 4, and patients were followed up for 52 weeks. RESULTS: Nine patients in the intervention group and 8 patients in the placebo group relapsed during the 52-week follow-up, and the relapse-free survival did not differ between the groups (P = 0.183, log-rank; hazard ratio, 1.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.73-4.98; P = 0.190]). In the subgroup analysis of patients using continuous antibiotics before the study, the relapse-free survival was shorter in the intervention group (P = 0.004, log-rank; hazard ratio, 13.08 [95% confidence interval, 1.47-116.60; P = 0.021]).

Methods: : During the outbreak of COVID-19, an internet-based questionnaire included The Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the impact of the epidemic situation on the mental health of medical staff and general population in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Results: : The results suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected individuals significantly, the degree of which is related to age, sex, occupation and mental illness. There was a significant difference in PSS-10 and IES-R scores between the medical staff and the general population. The medical staff showed higher PSS-10 scores (16.813  4.87) and IES-R scores (22.40  12.12) compared to members of the general population PSS-10 (14.80  5.60) and IES-R scores (17.89  13.08). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the SDS scores of medical staff (44.52  12.36) and the general public (43.08  11.42).

Although RNTD and some of its transformation products (TPs) have been studied under chlorination and photo-irradiation, the relationship between RNTD TPs and NDMA formation potential (NDMA-FP) remaining after those processes is still unclear. This study investigated the effects of chlorination and/or photo-irradiation on NDMA-FP derived from RNTD, simulating an urban water environment receiving treated wastewater. After chlorination and/or photo-irradiation of RNTD, ten TPs including five new ones were identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTof-MS). In addition, important RNTD TPs responsible for NDMA-FP (e.g., chlorinated and hydroxylated RNTD: TP-364) were also confirmed by the relationship between detected peak area and NDMA-FP. The results showed that NDMA-FP remained due to the presence of RNTD TPs, although RNTD itself was significantly removed by chlorination and/or photo-irradiation.

METHODS: All stroke admissions to two hospitals in Saudi Arabia during two months were prospectively evaluated for PSD and PSA. NIHSS and serum TSH assessed on admission. PSD and PSA were evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Post-stroke disability was assessed by mRS, while social support assessed by Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). RESULTS: Among 50 participants (28 males), clinically significant PSD was found in 36%, while PSA in 32%.

We conducted a narrative review of the literature regarding the indications and safety of the various types of vaccines currently available in dermatological patients treated with biological therapy. The safety and efficacy of administering inactivated vaccines in patients undergoing biological therapy with inhibitors of TNF-, IL-17, IL-12/23, and IL-4/13 was confirmed. Inactivated vaccines can be administered during therapy with inhibitors of IL-23 and IgE, taking into account that the level of evidence is lower due to the lack of specific studies.

In this study, we used immunoinformatics to identify conservative B and T cell epitopes for S proteins of SARS-CoV-2, which might play roles in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified the B cell and T cell peptide epitopes of S protein and their antigenicity, as well as the interaction between the peptide epitopes and human leucocyte antigen (HLA). Among the B cell epitopes, 'EILDITPCSFGGVS' has the highest score of antigenicity and great immunogenicity. In T cell epitopes, MHC-I peptide 'KIADYNYKL' and MHC-II peptide 'LEILDITPC' were identified as high antigens. Besides, docking analysis showed that the predicted peptide 'KIADYNYKL' was closely bound to the HLA-A*0201. The results of molecular dynamics simulation through GROMACS software showed that 'HLA-A*0201~peptide' complex was very stable.
