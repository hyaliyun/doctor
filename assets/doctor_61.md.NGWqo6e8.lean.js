Substantial attention has been given to the role of mast cells in regulating T cell function either directly or indirectly through actions on dendritic cells. In contrast, the ability of mast cells to modify B cell responses has been less explored. Several lines of evidence suggest that mast cells can greatly modify B cell generation and activities. Mast cells co-localise with B cells in many tissue settings and produce substantial amounts of cytokines, such as IL-6, with profound impacts on B cell development, class-switch recombination events, and subsequent antibody production. Mast cells have also been suggested to modulate the development and functions of regulatory B cells. In this review, we discuss the critical impacts of mast cells on B cells using information from both clinical and laboratory studies and consider the implications of these findings on the host response to infections.","output":"Mast Cell Modulation of B Cell Responses: An Under-Appreciated Partnership in Host Defence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting ~10% of women globally. Little is known about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on their care. This brief report is aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the care of people with endometriosis around the world, their priorities in relation to their clinical care during and coming out of the pandemic, and whether they believed that endometriosis makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19. An internet-based survey collected data in five languages between May 11, 2020, and June 8, 2020. Only participants with a surgical or radiological diagnosis of endometriosis aged 18 years or over were included. A total of 6,729 eligible respondents completed the survey with 80.7% [95% CI (79.7, 81.6)] reporting a negative impact on their care. This included difficulties obtaining medication (20.3%), cancelled/postponed gynaecology appointments (50.0%), and cancelled/postponed procedures (37.2%). More than half worried that their endometrioses make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 [54.2%; 95% CI (53.0, 55.4)]. The top three priorities were remarkably consistent around the world: contact with gynaecologists, knowing when procedures would be performed, and support with mental health (20.3% prioritising this aspect during the pandemic and 13.0% as restrictions begin to ease). This study shows the substantial impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on people with endometriosis and describes how they would like care prioritised moving forwards.

This pandemic has prompted the current health system to reorganize and rethink the care offered by health establishments. We report the early and late toxicity in patients infected with covid-19 treated at the same time for early-stage breast cancer. Material and methods This is a monocentric prospective study of patients treated in our hospital between March and June 2020 who were diagnosed with covid-19 infection. The inclusion criteria were to be irradiated for early-stage breast cancer and to have a positive covid diagnosis on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and/or a lung computed tomography (CT) scan and/or suggestive clinical symptoms. All of them needed 6 months follow-up clinic after the end of the radiotherapy with clinical examination, mammogram, as well as CT scan to evaluate the lung status. Radiotherapy consisted of breast or chest wall irradiation with or without lymph node irradiation, with protocols adapted to pandemic situation. The treatment-related toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Results All 350 patients treated for early-stage breast cancer were studied. Of them, 16 presented clinical symptoms of covid-19 infection, and of them 12 had clinical, CT scan and PCR confirmation. This entire cohort of 12 patients with median age of 56 years (range: 42C72 years) underwent their radiotherapy. During the radiotherapy, nine patients presented radiodermatitis: eight grade 1 (66%) and one grade 2 (8%). Two patients with lymph nodes irradiation presented grade 2 oesophagitis. Late toxicity was evaluated 6 months after the end of the radiotherapy, and there was no radiation or covid lung sequel on the CT scans. One patient presented covid-related dyspnoea, and two had fibrosis. Conclusion The half-year follow-up of prospective covid-19 cohort, treated for early-stage breast cancer demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile with few low-grade adverse events. It seems that the covid-19 infection does not appear to increase the side effects of radiotherapy. Therefore radiotherapy should not be delayed.","output":"Can we treat with radiation breast cancer patients with covid-19 infection?

These forced variations resemble the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) in time. Unlike the North Atlantic, where indirect and direct aerosol effects on surface solar radiation drive the multidecadal SST variations, over the tropical central and western Pacific atmospheric circulation response to aerosol forcing plays an important role, whereas aerosol-induced radiation change is small. Our new finding implies that AMO-like climate variations in Eurasia, North America, and other regions may be partly caused by the aerosol forcing, rather than being originated from the North Atlantic SST variations as previously thought.","output":"Aerosol-forced multidecadal variations across all ocean basins in models and observations since 1920"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In view of the ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it remains unclear whether the severity of illness and time interval from symptom onset to release from quarantine differ between cases that originated from clusters and cases reported in other areas. This study aimed to assess epidemiological and intergenerational clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients associated with cluster outbreaks to provide valuable data for the prevention and control of COVID-19. METHODS: We identified the first employee with COVID-19 at a supermarket and screened the close contacts of this index patient. Confirmed cases were divided into two groups according to the generation (first generation comprising supermarket employees [group A] and second or third generations comprising family members or friends of the supermarket employees [group B]). The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the two groups were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: A total of 8437 people were screened, and 24 COVID-19 patients were identified. Seven patients (29.2%) were asymptomatic; three patients were responsible for six symptomatic cases. The interval from the confirmation of the first case to symptom onset in symptomatic patients was 5-11 days. The clinical manifestations of symptomatic patients upon admission were non-specific. All patients (including the seven asymptomatic patients) were admitted based on chest computed tomography features indicative of pneumonia. There were 11 cases in group A (first generation) and 13 cases in group B (second generation, 11 cases; third generation, 2 cases), with no significant differences in clinical and epidemiological characteristics between the two groups, except for sex, duration from symptom onset to hospitalization, and underlying disease (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: For cluster outbreaks, it is important to comprehensively screen close the contacts of the index patient. Special attention should be paid to asymptomatic cases.

METHODS: A mannequin was connected to an active lung simulator. The inspiratory and expiratory variations in airways pressure observed with a high simulated effort, were determined relative to the preset CPAP level. NIV was applied in Pressure Support Mode at two simulated respiratory rates and two cycling-off flow thresholds. During the bench study, we measured the variables defining patient-ventilator interaction and performance. RESULTS: During nCPAP, the tested interfaces did not show significant differences in terms of ?Pawi and ?Pawe. During NIV, the snorkeling mask demonstrated a better patient-ventilator interaction compared to FFM, as shown by significantly shorter Pressurization Time and Expiratory Trigger Delay (p<0.01), but no significant differences were found in terms of Inspiratory Trigger Delay and Time of Synchrony between the interfaces tested. At RR 20sim, the snorkeling mask presented the lower Ptrigger (p<0.01), moreover during all the conditions tested the snorkeling mask showed the longer Pressure Time Product at 200, 300, and 500 ms compared to FFM (p<0.01). A major limitation of snorkeling mask is that during NIV with this interface it is possible to reach maximum 18 cmH(2)O of peak inspiratory pressure.

There are limited direct data on SARS-CoV-2 long-term immune responses and reinfection. The aim of this study is to use data on the durability of immunity among evolutionarily close coronavirus relatives of SARS-CoV-2 to estimate times to reinfection by a comparative evolutionary analysis of related viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-NL63. METHODS: We conducted phylogenetic analyses of the S, M, and ORF1b genes to reconstruct a maximum-likelihood molecular phylogeny of human-infecting coronaviruses. This phylogeny enabled comparative analyses of peak-normalised nucleocapsid protein, spike protein, and whole-virus lysate IgG antibody optical density levels, in conjunction with reinfection data on endemic human-infecting coronaviruses. We performed ancestral and descendent states analyses to estimate the expected declines in antibody levels over time, the probabilities of reinfection based on antibody level, and the anticipated times to reinfection after recovery under conditions of endemic transmission for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the other human-infecting coronaviruses. FINDINGS: We obtained antibody optical density data for six human-infecting coronaviruses, extending from 128 days to 28 years after infection between 1984 and 2020. These data provided a means to estimate profiles of the typical antibody decline and probabilities of reinfection over time under endemic conditions. Reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 under endemic conditions would likely occur between 3 months and 51 years after peak antibody response, with a median of 16 months. This protection is less than half the duration revealed for the endemic coronaviruses circulating among humans (5C95% quantiles 15 months to 10 years for HCoV-OC43, 31 months to 12 years for HCoV-NL63, and 16 months to 12 years for HCoV-229E). For SARS-CoV, the 5C95% quantiles were 4 months to 6 years, whereas the 95% quantiles for MERS-CoV were inconsistent by dataset. INTERPRETATION: The timeframe for reinfection is fundamental to numerous aspects of public health decision making. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, reinfection is likely to become increasingly common. Maintaining public health measures that curb transmissionincluding among individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2coupled with persistent efforts to accelerate vaccination worldwide is critical to the prevention of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

It is not possible to find which essential oil will offer the best level of protection. However, it is likely to assume that some essential oils are likely to offer a measurable level of defense in the same way they do with many other known viruses. METHODS Literature relevant to various essential oils having antiviral activity has been collected and compiled. Various nanocarriers of essential oils have also been stated. The database was collected using various search engines such as jgate, google scholar, scihub, pubmed, sciencedirect etc. Results: Essential oils contain active constituents such as phenolics compounds, terpenoids, alkaloids, phenyl propanoids etc., which are responsible for their biological properties such as antiviral, antibacterial, antimicrobial, antioxidant activities and many more. But the use of essential oils has always been limited due to poor solubility, solvent toxicity, volatility and low solubility. Many nanotechnology based carriers especially, liposomes, dendrimers, nanoparticles, nanoemulsion and microemulsion etc. have been evidenced to overcome limitations associated with essential oils.

Since the first confirmed case was reported on January 31, 2020, there have been over 405,000 cases and 28,000 deaths in Spain. The economic and social impact is without precedent. Thus, it is important to quickly assess the situation and perception of the population. Large-scale online surveys have been shown to be an effective tool for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: We aim to assess the situation and perception of the Spanish population in four key areas related to the COVID-19 pandemic: social contact behavior during confinement, personal economic impact, labor situation, and health status. METHODS: We obtained a large sample using an online survey with 24 questions related to COVID-19 in the week of March 28-April 2, 2020, during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 in Spain. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit 156,614 participants via social media posts that targeted the general adult population (age >18 years). Given such a large sample, the 95% CI was 0.843 for all reported proportions. RESULTS: Regarding social behavior during confinement, participants mainly left their homes to satisfy basic needs. We found several statistically significant differences in social behavior across genders and age groups. The populations willingness to comply with the confinement measures is evident. From the survey answers, we identified a significant adverse economic impact of the pandemic on those working in small businesses and a negative correlation between economic damage and willingness to stay in confinement. The survey revealed that close contacts play an important role in the transmission of the disease, and 28% of the participants lacked the necessary resources to properly isolate themselves. We also identified a significant lack of testing, with only 1% of the population tested and 6% of respondents unable to be tested despite their doctors recommendation. We developed a generalized linear model to identify the variables that were correlated with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Using this model, we estimated an average of 5% for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Spanish population during the time of the study. A seroprevalence study carried out later by the Spanish Ministry of Health reported a similar level of disease prevalence (5%). CONCLUSIONS: Large-scale online population surveys, distributed via social media and online messaging platforms, can be an effective, cheap, and fast tool to assess the impact and prevalence of an infectious disease in the context of a pandemic, particularly when there is a scarcity of official data and limited testing capacity.","output":"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain: Large-Scale, Online, Self-Reported Population Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemics, like the 1918 Spanish Influenza and COVID-19, spread through regions of the World in subsequent waves. There is, however, no consensus on the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or others based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless, understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave.

Materials and Methods: We linked the WHO FluNet database and COVID-19 confirmed cases (Johns Hopkins University) for four countries across the northern (Canada, the United States) and southern hemispheres (Australia, Brazil) for the period 2016-2020. Graphical presentations of longitudinal data were provided. Results: There was a notable reduction in influenza cases for the 2019-2020 season. Northern hemisphere countries experienced a quicker ending to the 2019-2020 seasonal influenza cases (shortened by 4-7 weeks) and virtually no 2020 fall influenza season. Countries from the southern hemisphere experienced drastically low levels of seasonal influenza, with consistent trends that were approaching zero cases after the introduction of COVID-19 measures. Conclusions: It is likely that the COVID-19 mitigation measures played a notable role in the marked decrease in influenza, with little to no influenza activity in both the northern and southern hemispheres. In spite of this reduction in influenza cases, there was still community spread of COVID-19, highlighting the contagiousness of SARS-CoV-2 compared to influenza.

Methods: The EHS is an ongoing and deeply-phenotyped prospective cohort study that has recruited 667 participants in northwest Greece until August 31st, 2020. Level of knowledge on coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and COVID-19 severity was labeled as poor, moderate or good. Variables assessing knowledge and beliefs towards the pandemic were summarized overall and by gender, age group (25-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+ years) and period of report (before the lifting of lockdown measures in Greece: March 30th to May 3rd, and two post-lockdown time periods: May 4th to June 31st, July 1st to August 31st). An exposure-wide association analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between 153 explanatory variables and participants' knowledge. Correction for multiple comparisons was applied using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 5%. Results: A total of 563 participants (49 years mean age; 60% women) had available information on the standard EHS questionnaire, the clinical and biochemical measurements, and the COVID-19-related questionnaire. Percentages of poor, moderate and good knowledge status regarding COVID-19 were 4.5%, 10.0% and 85.6%, respectively. The majority of participants showed absolute or moderate trust in the Greek health authorities for the management of the epidemic (90.1%), as well as in the Greek Government (84.7%) and the official national sources of information (87.4%). Trust in the authorities was weaker in younger participants and those who joined the study after the lifting of lockdown measures (p-value <= 0.001). None of the factors examined was associated with participants' level of knowledge after correction for multiple testing. Conclusions: High level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic and trust in the Greek authorities was observed, possibly due to the plethora of good quality publicly available information and the timely management of the pandemic at its early stages in Greece. Information campaigns for the COVID-19 pandemic should be encouraged even after the lifting of lockdown measures to increase public awareness.","output":"Awareness, knowledge and trust in the Greek authorities towards COVID-19 pandemic: results from the Epirus Health Study cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 62-year-old woman presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary to a ruptured right supraclinoid internal carotid artery blister aneurysm.

It was predictable that countries with weak health systems will be severly wiped out by the pandemic. Countries across Europe faced severe human loses and it was foreseable that Africa will experience an even worse tragedy. Suprisingly, since the evolution of the pandemic, there has been remarkable resistance from African countries, including Cameroon. METHOD: the study was phenomenographic. The data were collected successively from media observations (in particular the WHO site, national TV (CRTV) programs 'Parlons COVID'), social networks - Facebook and Whatsapp) and direct observations of some quarters of Garoua (Roumd-Adjia, Foulbr, Kakatar) and Mora for the Far North and the southern zone of Yaound (Ngoa-Ekel, Nkolondom, Mokolo). These observations were associated with individual interview, reviews and note-taking around places of public circulation (places of worship, markets and discussion sites (Faada). The theory of functionalism was mobilized in this study. RESULTS: the results show that Cameroonians perceive the pandemic as an eminently metasocial phenomenon which explains their tendency to use prayers, nature to counter this attack.

Substantial economic losses also affect shellfish growers during PSP events. The toxins responsible for PSP are produced by dinoflagellates in the genus Alexandrium. Despite the persistent threat posed by PSP and the long history of shellfish toxicity research, there is still confusion concerning the Alexandrium species that cause PSP in Alaska. The primary objective of this study was to identify the toxic Alexandrium species present in Alaska and to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for use in screening phytoplankton and sediment samples. Before developing the PCR assays for this study, we evaluated published assays and many were not adequate because of primer dimer formation or because of cross-reactivity. Rather than continue to grapple with the uncertainty and inadequacy of published assays, we developed new assays for the Alexandrium species most likely to be present in Alaska. Only Alexandrium fundyense Group I and A. ostenfeldii were identified from four sampling regions from southeast Alaska to Kodiak Island, indicating that these two species are widely distributed. PCR assays for these two species were converted to quantitative (q)PCR format for use in monitoring programs. During the course of this study, we realized that a systematic evaluation of all published (~150) Alexandrium species-specific assays would be of benefit. Toward this objective, we collated published Alexandrium PCR, qPCR, and in situ hybridization assay primers and probes that targeted the small-subunit (SSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS/5.8S), or D1-D3 large-subunit (LSU) (SSU/ITS/LSU) ribosomal DNA genes.

Results: A total of 487 patients were offered an outpatient appointment, of whom 153 (31%) attended for assessment at a median of 75 days after diagnosis. A total of 74 (48%) had required hospital admission during acute infection. Persistently abnormal chest X-ray findings were seen in 4%. The median 6MWT distance covered was 460 m. A reduced distance covered was associated with frailty and length of inpatient stay. A total of 95 (62%) patients believed that they had not returned to full health, whereas 47% met the case definition for fatigue. Ongoing ill health and fatigue were associated with an increased perception of exertion. None of the measures of persistent respiratory disease were associated with initial disease severity.

We planned to recruit three care homes residents and staff to take part in this project, and meet with them in person to: obtain consent, train care staff to use the PAT, and undertake postural assessments. COVID-19 restrictions meant that face-to-face physiotherapist/researcher contact has not been possible;we thus applied for and received ethics approval to explore the feasibility of delivering all aspects of the project remotely, mainly via video platform. We report on our project aim of assessing the feasibility and acceptability of remote working. Methods: All interactions with participating care home staff and residents take place via video link-up, using the home's preferred platform. Immediately after each contact, detailed (anonymous) field notes are made by the researcher, documenting staff members and residents reactions to and comments about the remote platform, and any challenges experienced during the encounter. Once the project is complete, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with care home staff and physiotherapists involved in remote procedures. Qualitative content analysis is ongoing C to produce qualitative descriptions of our experiences. Results: To date, we have been able to engage with two care homes via video link-up C to initiate the project and recruit participants. It took a number of attempts to arrange meetings and engage staff C due to equipment availability, occasional poor WiFi connection, staff unavailability or forgetfulness. However, remote connection was usually good, there were minimal disruptions once meetings started, and staff and residents expressed no concerns about using this platform for recruitment and consent. Staff were familiar with the use of remote platforms following regular use for resident contact (family and medical) during the pandemic, which facilitated the use of this method for research. For residents it was important that they were with a member of staff during a video call to support communications with the researcher - for example, where English was not their first language, or in case they had sensory impairment. Work with care homes continues (until July 2021) C we will report physiotherapists, care staff's, researchers and residents experiences of receiving training in the use of the PAT and completing postural assessments remotely. To date, training has been successfully adapted for remote provision, and delivered to three staff members. Conclusion(s): We have shown that remote contact with care homes for research is feasible, and will report on the feasibility of undertaking postural assessments remotely. Impact: The pandemic has forced care homes to engage with remote technology, and these technologies can also be ultilised by researchers to undertake research C whilst Covid-19 restrictions remain and in other cases where in-person visits are not possible.

The increased access and persistent Internet use could heighten the risk of problematic Internet use (PIU) that has been increasingly recognized as a risk factor for academic engagement. This study aims to investigate the direct and indirect relationships between PIU and academic engagement through psychopathological symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, insomnia) in early, middle, and late adolescence. METHODS: In all, 4852 adolescents (51.5% females; M(age) = 13.80  2.38) from different regions of Chinese mainland participated in the study and completed questionnaires. RESULTS: Depression and then insomnia as well as anxiety and then insomnia mediated the relationship between PIU and academic engagement. Anxiety exhibited a double-edged effect, that is, a positive relation with academic engagement directly and a negative relation with academic engagement indirectly through insomnia. Multigroup analyses showed that the indirect effects of PIU on academic engagement through depression and subsequent insomnia in middle and late adolescence were stronger than that in early adolescence, whereas the direct effect in early adolescence was stronger than that in middle adolescence. LIMITATION: This study was cross-sectional in design and relied upon self-report measures. CONCLUSION: These findings improve the understandings of how PIU relates to academic engagement through psychopathological symptoms and highlight developmental differences of adolescence.","output":"Problematic Internet use and academic engagement during the COVID-19 lockdown: The indirect effects of depression, anxiety, and insomnia in early, middle, and late adolescence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 40 million people worldwide, with over 1 million deaths as of October 2020 and with multiple efforts in the development and testing of antiviral drugs and vaccines under way. In order to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution and drug targets, we investigated how and to what extent the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence differs from those of other well-characterized human and animal coronavirus genomes, as well as how polymorphic SARS-CoV-2 genomes are generally. We ultimately sought to identify features in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that may contribute to its viral replication, host pathogenicity, and vulnerabilities. Our analyses suggest the presence of unique sequence signatures in the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of betacoronavirus lineage B, which phylogenetically encompasses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV as well as multiple groups of bat and animal coronaviruses. In addition, we identified genome-wide patterns of variation across different SARS-CoV-2 strains that likely reflect the effects of selection. Finally, we provide evidence for a possible host-microRNA-mediated interaction between the 3'-UTR and human microRNA hsa-miR-1307-3p based on the results of multiple computational target prediction analyses and an assessment of similar interactions involving the influenza A H1N1 virus. This interaction also suggests a possible survival mechanism, whereby a mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 3'-UTR leads to a weakened host immune response. The potential roles of host microRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 replication and infection and the exploitation of conserved features in the 3'-UTR as therapeutic targets warrant further investigation.IMPORTANCE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is having a dramatic global effect on public health and the economy. As of October 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in over 189 countries, has infected over 40 million people, and is responsible for more than 1 million deaths. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is small but complex, and its functions and interactions with human host factors are being studied extensively. The significance of our study is that, using extensive SARS-CoV-2 genome analysis techniques, we identified potential interacting human host microRNA targets that share similarity with those of influenza A virus H1N1. Our study results will allow the development of virus-host interaction models that will enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and motivate the exploitation of both the interacting viral and host factors as therapeutic targets.","output":"Conserved Genomic Terminals of SARS-CoV-2 as Coevolving Functional Elements and Potential Therapeutic Targets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systemic inhibition of neuropathy target esterase (NTE) with certain organophosphorus (OP) compounds produces OP compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN), a distal degeneration of axons in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS), thereby providing a powerful model for studying a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Axonopathies are important medical entities in their own right, but in addition, illnesses once considered primary neuronopathies are now thought to begin with axonal degeneration. These disorders include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover, conditional knockout of NTE in the mouse CNS produces vacuolation and other degenerative changes in large neurons in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum, along with degeneration and swelling of axons in ascending and descending spinal cord tracts. In humans, NTE mutations cause a variety of neurodegenerative conditions resulting in a range of deficits including spastic paraplegia and blindness. Mutations in the Drosophila NTE orthologue SwissCheese (SWS) produce neurodegeneration characterized by vacuolization that can be partially rescued by expression of wild-type human NTE, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for certain human neurological disorders. This chapter defines NTE and OPIDN, presents an overview of OP compounds, provides a rationale for NTE research, and traces the history of discovery of NTE and its relationship to OPIDN. It then briefly describes subsequent studies of NTE, including practical applications of the assay; aspects of its domain structure, subcellular localization, and tissue expression; abnormalities associated with NTE mutations, knockdown, and conventional or conditional knockout; and hypothetical models to help guide future research on elucidating the role of NTE in OPIDN.","output":"Neuropathy target esterase (NTE/PNPLA6) and organophosphorus compound-induced delayed neurotoxicity (OPIDN)()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The efforts of containing the novel virus (COVID-19) have now begun to show signs of psychological impact on societies across the globe.

This resulted in school closures forcing children to remain at home. Dental-facial trauma was still likely to be common place due to falls and injuries exercising. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in a paediatric population in a tertiary care hospital and a linked Dental Institute. METHOD: A proforma was designed to capture the demographics, presenting complaints, type of dental-facial injury, treatment need and the treatment received for all paediatric patients presenting face to face with dental-facial trauma to King's College Hospital during the 'lockdown' period (23 March- 14 June 2020). RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty calls were triaged, converting to 102 patients seen face-to-face for dental-facial trauma. The remainder were able to be triaged 'virtually'. Injuries seen included 56 (54.9%) dentoalveolar injuries, 37 (36.2%) lacerations, five (4.9%) suspected facial fractures and four (3.9%) dog bites. Males and females were equally affected. The majority of incidents occurred in the home environment (n = 60, 58.8%), with the remainder (n = 42, 41.2%) occurring outside the home environment. The main causes of dental-facial trauma were falls (n = 47, 46.1%) and bicycles/scooters (n = 29, 28.4%). The most common type of dentoalveolar injury was lateral luxation (n = 15, 26.7%), followed by avulsion (n = 12, 21.4%). Only one child required treatment under general anaesthesia (GA). CONCLUSION: The demographic, presenting complaints and treatment needs of patients who presented during the lockdown period with dental-facial trauma were unusual. The overwhelming majority were able to be treated without the use of GA. The attendance protocol in a tertiary care setting and the use of 'teledentistry' ensured only the most severe trauma cases were seen.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) blocks autophagy and promotes apoptosis of the prostate after castration. METHODS Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 12): control group (sham operation), castration group, and HCQ group (castrated and treated with HCQ). On day 7, all mice were executed and prostates were isolated. The morphological changes of prostates were observed by light microscope, and the ultrastructure changes were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The protein expression of Beclin-l, P62, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses. The mRNA expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS Prostates of castration group shrank remarkably and prostates of HCQ group shrank more remarkably than castration group. Cytolysosomes were visible in the prostates of the castration group under SEM. Immunohistochemistry showed that the protein of Beclin-1 increased in the castration group compared to the control group, while decreased in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. While P62 protein moderately dyed in the control group and weakly dyed in the castration group, it strongly dyed in the HCQ group. Caspase-3 and Bax protein were weakly dyed in the control group but moderately dyed in the castration group and strongly dyed in the HCQ group. The expressions of apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 were reduced in the castration group and further reduced in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA of LC3 and Atg5 in the castration group increased compared to the control group, while decreased after treated with HCQ. CONCLUSION Autophagy increased after castrated in prostates, while decreased after treated with HCQ; all these indicated that HCQ blocked autophagy and then promoted prostate apoptosis of castrated mice.","output":"Hydroxychloroquine Blocks Autophagy and Promotes Apoptosis of the Prostate after Castration in Rats."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our paper contributes to emerging management research on the effects of societal inequality.

In some cases, e.g., for influenza viruses, their function during the viral propagation cycle is relatively well understood, where they cleave and activate viral surface glycoproteins. For other viruses, e.g., Ebola virus, the function of host proteases during replication is still not clear. Host proteases may also contribute to the pathogenicity of virus infection by activating proinflammatory cytokines. For some coronaviruses, human proteases can also serve in a nonproteolytical fashion simply as receptors for virus entry. However, blocking of such protein-protein contacts is challenging, because receptor surfaces are often flat and difficult to address with small molecules. In contrast, many proteases possess well-defined binding pockets. Therefore, they can be considered as well-druggable targets, especially, if they are extracellularly active. The number of their experimental crystal structures is steadily increasing, which is an important prerequisite for a rational structure-based inhibitor design using computational chemistry tools in combination with classical medicinal chemistry approaches. Moreover, host proteases can be considered as stable targets, and their inhibition should prevent rapid resistance developments, which is often observed when addressing viral proteins. Otherwise, the inhibition of host proteases can also affect normal physiological processes leading to a higher probability of side effects and a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, they should be preferably used in combination therapies with additional antiviral drugs. This strategy should provide a stronger antiviral efficacy, allow to use lower drug doses, and minimize side effects.

Providing evidence for intervention measures in the face of a mental health crisis, the present study validates the relation between self-compassion and anxiety and depression mediated by perceived stress amongst medical workers. The goal is also to replicate a similar mediation model though multigroup analysis. METHODS: Medical workers were randomly selected to investigate by paper-and-pencil survey among 1,223 medical workers from three hospitals in Shiyan, China. The measures were comprised of four parts: the Chinese version of the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale (GADS), the Self\\\\Compassion ScaleCShort Form (SCS-SF), the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and a socio-demographic questionnaire. Applying structural equation modeling (SEM, single-group analysis), we estimated the effects of self-compassion on anxiety/depression through perceived stress. Furthermore, based on multigroup analysis, we used two sets of internal samples (gender groups, medical groups) and an external sample (nursing students) for testing multigroup invariance. RESULTS: The average scores of anxiety, depression, self-compassion and perceived stress in medical workers were 5.93  2.46, 4.91  2.62, 38.87  4.66 and 71.96  15.14, respectively. In some departments engaged in the research, the medical workers showed higher levels of anxiety and depression. The SEM results indicated that the original relationship between self-compassion and anxiety and depression was beta = C0.42 (P < 0.001) and reduced to beta = C0.17 (P < 0.001) while introducing perceived stress as a mediating variable. Perceived stress was positively associated with anxiety and depression (beta = 0.60, P < 0.001), and self-compassion was negatively associated with perceived stress (beta = C0.56, P < 0.001). Multigroup analysis showed acceptable changes in fit indices across gender (male and female), medical (clinician and non-clinician), and population (medical workers and nursing students) groups. CONCLUSION: Medical workers were experiencing high levels of anxiety and depression and perceived stress. Perceived stress might have a partial mediating effect on self-compassion and anxiety and depression amongst medical workers, which was similar to a previous study in nursing students. The findings supported multigroup invariance across gender, medical and population groups. The study concluded that the mediation model may be generalized across these multiple samples.

Moreover, MSCs could also be used as a model to study various developmental and physiological processes in avian and other species. To obtain a comprehensive overview of this topic, the keywords mesenchymal stem cells, chicken, disease, chicken dermatitis, viral infections in chicken, and antibiotics in chicken were searched in WOS and PUBMED databases to obtain relevant information. ABSTRACT: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells that adhere to plastic; express the specific markers CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105; and produce cytokines and growth factors supporting and regulating hematopoiesis. MSCs have capacity for differentiating into osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myocytes. They are useful for research toward better understanding the pathogenic potential of the infectious bursal disease virus, mineralization during osteogenesis, and interactions between MSCs as a feeder layer to other cells. MSCs are also important for immunomodulatory cell therapy, can provide a suitable strategy model for coculture with pathogens causing dermatitis disorders in chickens, can be cultured in vitro with probiotics and prebiotics with a view to eliminate the feeding of antibiotic growth promoters, and offer cell-based meat production. Moreover, bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) in coculture with hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells (HPCs/HSCs) can support expansion and regulation of the hematopoiesis process using the 3D-culture system in future research in chickens. MSCs several advantages, including ready availability, strong proliferation, and immune modulatory properties make them a suitable model in the field of stem cell research. This review summarizes current knowledge about the general characterization of MSCs and their application in chicken as a model organism.","output":"Chicken Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Applications: A Mini Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article analyzes 46 publications on the use of ICS for COVID-19.

It is a major conservation threat in some endangered species. Infection can result in severe respiratory disease and fatal encephalitis. Diagnosis and disease monitoring in wildlife, and differentiation of CDV from rabies (a life-threatening zoonotic disease that can produce similar neurologic signs), would benefit from the availability of a portable, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test. We therefore developed a quantitative RT-PCR assay for CDV using shelf-stable, lyophilized reagents and target-specific primers and probes for use with the handheld Biomeme two3(?) qPCR thermocycler. Biomemes extraction methodology, lyophilized reagents, and thermocycler were compared to our standard laboratory-based methods to assess sensitivity, efficiency and overall test performance. Results using a positive control plasmid for CDV showed comparable sensitivity (detection of 50 copies) and PCR efficiency between the two platforms, and CDV detection was similar between platforms when tested using a modified live CDV vaccine. Significantly higher Ct values (average Ct = 5.1 cycles) were observed using the Biomeme platform on known CDV positive animal samples. CDV detection using the Biomeme platform was similar in 25 of 26 samples from suspect CDV cases when compared to standard virology laboratory testing. One false positive was observed that was negative upon retest. The Biomeme methodology can be adapted for detection of specific targets, and this portable technology saves time by eliminating the need for local or international sample transport for laboratory-based diagnostics. However, results of our testing suggest that decreased diagnostic sensitivity (higher Ct values) relative to laboratory-based methods was observed using animal samples, so careful validation and optimization are essential. Portable qPCR platforms can empower biologists and wildlife health professionals in remote and low-resource settings, which will greatly improve our understanding of CDV disease ecology and associated conservation threats in wildlife.","output":"Development and validation of a portable, point-of-care canine distemper virus qPCR test"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: AirSeal? is a valve-free insufflation system that enables a stable pneumoperitoneum with continuous smoke evacuation and CO2 recirculation during laparoscopic surgery. Comparative evidence on the use of AirSeal? and standard CO2 insufflator in laparoscopic general surgery procedures is scarce. The aim of this study was to compare surgical outcomes between AirSeal? and standard CO2 insufflators in patients undergoing the most frequently performed laparoscopic procedures. METHODS: One hundred and ninety-eight patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery and hernia repair were randomized to either AirSeal? (group A) or standard pressure CO2 insufflator (group S). The primary endpoints were operative time and level of postoperative shoulder tip pain (Visual Analog Scale). Secondary outcomes included Clavien-Dindo grade complications, surgical side effect and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Patients were randomized to either group A (n = 101) or group S (n = 97) and were analyzed by intention-to-treat. There was no significant difference in mean operative time between the groups (median [IQR]; 71 min [56-94] in group A vs. 69 min [52-93] in group S; p = 0.434). Shoulder tip pain levels were significantly lower in group S (VAS 0 [0-3] in group S vs. 2 [0-4] in group A; p = 0.001). There was no significant difference in complications, surgical side effects (subcutaneous emphysema was not observed in any group) and length of hospital stay.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of stress hyperglycaemia in acute pulmonary embolism, providing new insights into the presumed embolus size and localization, clinical parameters (Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index, PESI), and in-hospital mortality. Design and Methods. Among a total of 95,454 patients referred to the Emergency Department of the Sestre Milosrdnice University Hospital Centre between 2014 and 2016, all patients with acute pulmonary embolism were included into this observational cohort study. The study group consisted of 190 patients aged 25-96. Relevant patient history, clinical data, and laboratory findings were collected during the entire hospitalization period. Data were analyzed for the entire group of patients, as well as separately for patients without diabetes, using the Fisher exact test and logistic regression. Results Analysis of embolus localization as an indirect parameter of embolus size showed that patients with stress hyperglycaemia more often had emboli located in proximal parts of the pulmonary circulation (i.e., main artery or lobar branches) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, stress hyperglycaemia correlated with PESI score and diabetes (p < 0.05) in the entire patient group. Stress hyperglycaemia showed independent association with in-hospital mortality in patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion Stress hyperglycaemia in patients with acute pulmonary embolism is associated with embolus localization in larger arteries of the pulmonary circulation and higher PESI score and therefore could serve as an independent in-hospital mortality predictor.","output":"Stress Hyperglycaemia Indicates Embolus Size and Localization in Patients with Acute Pulmonary Embolism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bacteroides fragilis is considered an important clinical pathogen and the most common anaerobe isolated from human and animal clinical specimens; enterotoxigenic strains produce diarrhea.

Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. Objective: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. Methods: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. Results: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. Conclusions: Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place. By implementing the proposed framework according to the stated guidelines, this study allows for the development of applications such as interactive dashboards to facilitate the contextual identification and tracking of interdependent COVID-19 knowledge resources.

The availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across the globe. The availability of whole genomes from multiple states in India prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in India. We performed whole-genome sequencing for 64 genomes making a total of 361 genomes from India, followed by phylogenetic clustering, substitution analysis, and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes. We describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster (Clade I / A3i) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, which encompasses 41% of all genomes sequenced and deposited in the public domain from multiple states in India. Globally 3.5% of genomes, which till date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster fall in this newly defined clade. The cluster is characterized by a core set of shared genetic variants C C6312A (T2016K), C13730T (A88V/A97V), C23929T, and C28311T (P13L). Further, the cluster is also characterized by a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.4  10?3 variants per site per year, lower than the prevalent A2a cluster, and predominantly driven by variants in the E and N genes and relative sparing of the S gene. Epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in the month of February 2020 and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread, as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country.

The COVID-19 pandemic may have affected the management of chronic conditions by delaying care. We sought to understand the impact of personal characteristics (i.e., age) and healthcare factors (i.e., access to a provider) on healthcare access in a sample of Americans 50 years of age or older during COVID-19. METHOD: Participants completed an online survey at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic C the Aging in the Time of COVID Survey. Questions focused on health status, health care access, COVID-19 fear, and social connectedness. Participants were recruited through social media advertisements, list serves, and snowball sampling. Data collection started in early April 2020 and concluded in late May 2020. Logistic regression models examined the results of two key access points: healthcare provider/doctor (n = 481) and medication (n = 765), with 56 and 93% of participants reporting access to a provider and medications, respectively. RESULTS: Individuals with an established primary care provider were much more likely to obtain access to a healthcare provider, OR = 3.81 (95% CI: 1.69, 8.77), and to receive medication, OR = 4.48 (95% CI: 1.61, 11.48), during the time of COVID-19. In addition, access to medication was (a) higher for those who were older, OR = 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.09), had a higher income (greater than 100 k compared to less than 50 k, OR = 3.04 (95% CI: 1.11, 8.98), and (b) lower for those having caregiving responsibilities, OR = 0.41 (95% CI: 0.21, 0.78), or greater social isolation, OR = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Although most participants had access to medication, just over half had access to a healthcare provider when needed. Notably, health-seeking behaviors for individuals who do not have an established primary care providers as well as those who provide unpaid care, are socially isolated, and younger may require more proactive approaches to care monitoring, management, and maintenance.","output":"Aging through the time of COVID-19: a survey of self-reported healthcare access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to explore student and staff perceptions and experiences of a pilot SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic testing service (P-ATS) in a UK university campus setting.

PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Embase databases were searched to identify relevant articles describing attenuating mutations tested in vivo. In case of coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2, sequence alignment was used to exclude attenuating mutations that cannot be applied to SARS-CoV-2. Potential immunogenicity, safety and efficacy of the attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were discussed based on animal studies data. A total of 27 attenuation strategies, used to create 101 different coronaviruses, have been described in 56 eligible articles. The disruption of the furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was identified as the most promising strategy. The replacement of core sequences of transcriptional regulatory signals, which prevents recombination with wild-type viruses, also appears particularly advantageous. Other important attenuating mutations encompassed mostly the prevention of evasion of innate immunity. Sufficiently attenuated coronaviruses typically caused no meaningful disease in susceptible animals and protected them from challenges with virulent virus.

The intensification of integration processes, regional and interregional transformations lead to changes in the national economy structure and shifts in socialization processes at the macro- and meso-level followed by different practical results and impact on the social economy development of the countries all over the world. A scientific and technological progress, Industries 4.0 and 5.0 development, the creation of smart enterprises and cities, digital transformations affect the socialization of the economy in a global environment. The article critically evaluates the positive and negative impacts of the latest global trends on the socialization of the economies of the countries all over the world. The latest trends in pandemic development will affect the provision of national and global competitiveness, the development of small business, the functioning of the capital market, the quality of life, employment of the population and its forms, the medical sphere and the education system, as well as socialization processes. There are considered the signs of postpandemic development of the world community, that enhances both global opportunities and dangers.

We aimed to understand what factors influence the successful implementation of indicated psychological interventions within schools and colleges to help guide increased provision of mental health support within education settings. METHODS Systematic search for studies that have reported barriers or facilitators to the implementation of indicated interventions for adolescent emotional disorders delivered within schools and further education/sixth form colleges (CRD42018102830). Databases searched were EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, ASSIA, ERIC and British Education Index. A thematic synthesis of factors reported to impact implementation was conducted. RESULTS Two thousand five hundred and sixty-nine records and 177 full texts were screened. Fifty studies were identified for inclusion, all of which were of school-based interventions. Eleven analytic themes were developed encompassing intervention characteristics, organisational capacity, training and technical assistance, provider characteristics and community-level factors. Findings indicate the need to select appropriate interventions, consider logistical challenges of the school context and provide training and supervision to enable staff to deliver interventions with fidelity. However, structural and environmental support is required for these facilitators to have the greatest impact on successful implementation. CONCLUSIONS Implementing indicated school-based mental health interventions is challenging. Those involved in planning school-based mental health initiatives must be alert to the impact of factors on multiple interacting levels. There is a lack of research on implementing mental health support within further education and sixth form colleges. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE Increased utilisation of schools and colleges as a setting for early intervention has been proposed as a means of improving access to mental health treatment, but successful implementation of mental health interventions within educational settings is challenging. Based on a synthesis of current evidence, we recommend that young people and education professionals should be involved in the selection of school-based interventions to ensure they are acceptable and practical to deliver within the logistical constraints of the school environment. Those delivering interventions within schools, as well as staff involved in identifying young people who might benefit from these interventions, must receive high-quality ongoing training and support. Senior school leaders play an important role in championing mental health interventions and developing a school culture that prioritises mental well-being. Health and education policy should be designed to promote a cross-sector focus on the emotional health of young people. There is a lack of evidence on the implementation of indicated psychological interventions within sixth form and further education colleges.","output":"Review: Delivering mental health support within schools and colleges - a thematic synthesis of barriers and facilitators to implementation of indicated psychological interventions for adolescents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Machine learning models are increasingly used in a wide variety of financial settings.

This study assessed the effect of a nationwide lockdown in France on admissions for acute surgical conditions and the subsequent impact on postoperative mortality. METHODS: This was an observational analytical study, evaluating data from a national discharge database that collected all discharge reports from any hospital in France. All adult patients admitted through the emergency department and requiring a surgical treatment between 17 March and 11 May 2020, and the equivalent period in 2019 were included. The primary outcome was the change in number of hospital admissions for acute surgical conditions. Mortality was assessed in the matched population, and stratified by region. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, 57 589 consecutive patients were admitted for acute surgical conditions, representing a decrease of 20.9 per cent compared with the 2019 cohort. Significant differences between regions were observed: the decrease was 15.6, 17.2, and 26.8 per cent for low-, intermediate- and high-prevalence regions respectively. The mortality rate was 1.92 per cent during the lockdown period and 1.81 per cent in 2019. In high-prevalence zones, mortality was significantly increased (odds ratio 1.22, 95 per cent c.i. 1.06 to 1.40). CONCLUSION: A marked decrease in hospital admissions for surgical emergencies was observed during the lockdown period, with increased mortality in regions with a higher prevalence of COVID-19 infection.

Algorithm performance was then evaluated prospectively in February and August 2020. Total error and mean error per day were evaluated, and computational time was logged using different Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples. Data from 610,570 examinations were used for training; the majority were CTs (82.3%). During retrospective testing, prediction error was reduced from 19 to < 1 per day in CT (total 589 to 17) and from 5 to < 1 per day (total 144 to 27) in MRI by fine-tuning the Prophet procedure. Prospective prediction error in February was 11 per day in CT (9934 predicted, 9667 actual) and 1 per day in MRI (2484 predicted, 2457 actual) and was significantly better than manual weekly predictions (p = 0.001).

METHODS A systematic review of articles that examined COVID-19 in kidney transplant recipients was performed. Patients' demographics, clinical, laboratory and radiological presentations, immunosuppression modification, and COVID-19 specific management were abstracted and analyzed. COVID-19 severity was classified into mild, moderate, and severe. Disease outcome was classified by whether the patient was discharged, still hospitalized, or died. RESULTS 44 articles reporting individual data and 13 articles reporting aggregated data on 149 and 561 kidney transplant recipients respectively with COVID-19 from Asia, Europe and America fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among studies reporting case specific data, 76% of cases had severe disease. Compared to patients with mild/moderate disease, patients with severe disease had higher CRP, LDH, Ferritin, D-dimer and were more likely to have bilateral lung involvement at presentation and longer time since transplantation (P<0.05 for all). Recipients' age, gender and comorbidities did not impact disease severity. Patients with severe disease had a more aggressive CNI reduction and more antiviral medications utilization. Outcome was reported on 145 cases, of those 34 (23%) died all with severe disease. Longer duration from transplant to disease diagnosis, hypoxia and higher LDH were associated with mortality (P<0.05). Different immunosuppression reduction strategies, high dose parenteral corticosteroids use and various antiviral combinations did not demonstrate survival advantage. Similar finding was observed for studies reporting aggregated data. CONCLUSION COVID-19 in kidney transplant patients is associated with high rate of disease severity and fatality. Higher LDH and longer time since transplantation predicted both disease severity and mortality.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether state-imposed stay-at-home orders (SAHOs) and the proportion of African American population in a state were associated with the state-level COVID-19 cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used daily, state-level data on COVID-19 cases, tests, and fatalities from the COVID Tracking Project. Data from March 1 to May 4, 2020, for all states (except Washington state) as well as the District of Columbia were used. EXPOSURES: The key exposure variables were state-level SAHO (1 if in place, 0 otherwise), and proportion of state population who are African American. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was daily cumulative COVID-19 case rates. A secondary outcome was subsequent COVID-19 fatality rates, derived using mean cumulative fatality rates 21 to 28 days after each date. Multivariate regression models were estimated. RESULTS: The final sample included 3023 pooled state- and day-level observations. The mean (SD) cumulative positive case rate was 103.186 (200.067) cases per 100 000 state population, the mean (SD) cumulative test rate was 744.23 (894.944) tests per 100 000 state population, and the mean (SD) subsequent cumulative fatality rate was 12.923 (21.737) deaths per 100 000 state population. There was a negative association of SAHOs with cumulative case rates ( = ?1.166; 95% CI, ?1.484 to ?0.847; P < .001) and subsequent fatality rates ( = ?0.204; 95% CI, ?0.294 to ?0.113; P < .001). Estimation analyses indicated that expected cumulative case rates would have been more than 200% higher and fatality rates approximately 22% higher if there were no SAHOs, as compared with SAHOs fully in place. A higher proportion of African American population was associated with higher case rates ( = 0.045; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.077; P = .001) and fatality rates ( = 0.068; 95% CI, 0.044 to 0.091; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, SAHOs were associated with reductions in COVID-19 case rates. These findings could help inform policy makers to address the continued COVID-19 pandemic in the US. The proportion of African American population was positively associated with COVID-19 case rates, and this state-level finding adds to evidence from existing ecological studies using county-level data on racial disparities in COVID-19 infection rates and underlines the urgency of better understanding and addressing these disparities.","output":"Association of State Stay-at-Home Orders and State-Level African American Population With COVID-19 Case Rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) constitutes less than 5% of overall cases of extrapulmonary disease and mostly affects the ileocecal region.

Identifying the characteristics of impaired drivers is essential for planning preventive actions. OBJECTIVE To compare drug use and driving behavior profiles of drivers with and without alcohol-related infractions. METHODS 178 drivers stopped at routine roadblocks were assessed by traffic agents who conducted standard roadblock procedures (document verification; request of a breathalyzer test [BT]). Drug use and driving behavior data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Subjects were divided into three groups: drivers who refused the BT (RDs, n = 72), drivers who tested positive on the BT (PDs, n = 34), and drivers who had committed other infractions (ODs, n = 72). RESULTS The proportion of alcohol use in the last year was higher among RDs (100%) than in the PD and OD groups (97.1% and 72.2% respectively, p < 0.001). Lifetime prevalence of cannabis and cocaine use for the overall sample was 44.3% and 18.2%, respectively. Fewer individuals in the OD group (31.5%) reported having been stopped at roadblocks in the previous year compared to the PDs (55.9%) and RDs (48.6%, p = 0.03). However, a higher proportion of RDs reported drunk driving in the same period (87.5%; PD 69.7%; OD 26.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Essential differences among groups were observed.

In the context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the ability to deliver timely and efficacious care must be balanced with the risk of infectious exposure to the clinical team. Furthermore, rapid and effective stroke care remains paramount to achieve maximal functional recovery for those needing admission and to triage care appropriately for those who may be presenting with neurological symptoms but have an alternative diagnosis. Methods- Available resources, COVID-19-specific infection prevention and control recommendations, and expert consensus were used to identify clinical screening criteria for patients and provide the required nuanced considerations for the healthcare team, thereby modifying the conventional code stroke processes to achieve a protected designation. Results- A protected code stroke algorithm was developed. Features specific to prenotification and clinical status of the patient were used to define precode screening. These include primary infectious symptoms, clinical, and examination features. A focused framework was then developed with regard to a protected code stroke. We outline the specifics of personal protective equipment use and considerations thereof including aspects of crisis resource management impacting team role designation and human performance factors during a protected code stroke.

Albumins pharmacological properties and widespread availability have the potential to mitigate these factors. However, the effect of albumin on cardiac surgery-associated AKI is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of postoperative 20% albumin infusion on kidney function after high-risk cardiac surgery. METHODS: We designed an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trialthe ALBICS study (ALBumin Infusion and acute kidney injury following Cardiac Surgery). A total of 590 patients undergoing high-risk cardiac surgery (combined procedure or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)) will be enrolled into the study and randomly allocated to receive a postoperative 20% albumin infusion or standard care in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by centre and baseline renal function. The study fluid will be administered upon arrival in intensive care for 15 h. Patients will be followed up until 28 days after surgery or until discharge from the hospital. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who develop AKI in both groups. Secondary outcomes to be measured are proportions of AKI stage II and III, 28-day mortality, mechanical ventilation time and length of stay in intensive care and hospital.

Pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935 000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old. METHODS: One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at ?70 C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio\\\\Plex/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded. RESULTS: Of the samples tested, 81.6% were positive for viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23.7%, human enterovirus/rhinovirus in 16.6%, metapneumovirus in 5.7%, parainfluenza virus (types 1C4) in 5.5%, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3.6%, adenovirus in 2.2%, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) in 2.2%, and bocavirus in 0.4%.

We aimed to determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcome of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and to compare the performance of different prognostic models for predicting mortality. Patients We performed a prospective cohort study including 2211 hospitalized patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from April 15, 2020 through October 1, 2020 in 38 Hospitals from 11 Latin American countries. We registered clinical and laboratory parameters of patients with and without cirrhosis. All patients were followed until discharge or death. We evaluated the prognostic performance of different scoring systems to predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis using ROC curves. Results Overall, 4.6%(CI 3.7-5.6) subjects had cirrhosis (n=96). Baseline Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class was assessed: CTP-A (23%), CTP-B (45%) and CTP-C (32%); median MELD-Na score was 19 (IQR 14-25). Mortality was 47% in patients with cirrhosis compared to 16% in those without cirrhosis (P<.0001).

However, there are limited pediatric data from low-income settings. We aimed to assess the characteristics and outcomes of pediatric COVID-19 in Ethiopia. SETTING: St. Pauls COVID-19 treatment center; a tertiary COVID-19 center. Pediatric care was provided in a dedicated ward but with a common ICU. METHODS: St. Pauls Hospital COVID-19 cohort (SPC-19) included inpatient COVID-19 RT-PCR confirmed cases from August 2020 to January 2021. Data were extracted from case report forms attached to patient charts and completed by the clinicians. Data were uploaded into the Redcap database and exported to SPSS 20 for analysis. Binary logistic regression and chi-square test were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients 0C19 years were included from the SPC-19 cohort over 6 months. Pediatric admissions accounted for 11% of cases in the cohort. The mean age (SD) was 6.9 (6.36) years and 40 (50.6%) were female. The disease was asymptomatic or mild in 57 (72.2%), moderate in 15 (19%), and severe or critical in 7 (8.8%). The commonest presentations in symptomatic children were prostration (26.6%) followed by vomiting (12.7%), fever and cough (11.4% each), and dyspnea (10%). About 53 (67%) children had multimorbidity, and 14 (17.7%) children died. All deaths were in children with comorbidities with tuberculosis and malignancy being associated with 43% of deaths. Nearly 5% of children reported long-COVID symptoms highlighting the need for prolonged follow-up in those children. CONCLUSION: Despite lower admissions and severity, high mortality and morbidity was documented in our pediatric cohort. The presence of comorbidity and inadequate care organization likely contributed to high mortality. COVID-19 centers of low-income settings should emphasize optimizing the care of children with COVID-19 and multimorbidity, and vaccination should be considered in those children to prevent high morbidity and mortality.","output":"Clinical Characteristics and Outcome of Pediatric COVID-19 Patients in Ethiopia During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic: A Prospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has resulted in the development of various therapeutics to treat and prevent major complications related to the virus; pregnant patients are vulnerable to acquiring severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 because of frequent contact with the healthcare setting.

Previous studies have pointed out that disruption of the proteolytic cleavage of proteins can promote infectious and non-infectious diseases. The last few weeks have been marked by an important revelation concerning the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2. This new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly contagious and transmissible acute respiratory infectious disorder. SARS-CoV-2 is composed of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and structural proteins including Spike protein (S protein). Interestingly, the FURIN, one of the proproteins of the convertase family, play a crucial role in the maturation of viral glycoproteins. In addition, many viruses including coronaviruses, exploit FURIN for the activation of their glycoproteins. Recent data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Subsequently, the S protein is cleaved by receptor transmembrane serine protease 2 with the help of FURIN which facilitates the entry of the virus into the cell after binding. Furthermore, it seems that FURIN is implicated in the pathogenesis of SRS-CoV-2 and potentially in the increased rates of human-to-human transmission.","output":"Expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and proteases in COVID-19 patients: a potential role of cellular FURIN in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Chemokines produced by reactive glia drive migration of immune cells and previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that CD19(+) B cells infiltrate the brain. In this study, in vivo and in vitro experiments investigated the role of reactive glial cells in recruitment and survival of B-lineage cells in response to (murine cytomegalovirus) MCMV infection. METHODS: Flow cytometric analysis was used to assess chemokine receptor expression on brain-infiltrating B cells. Real-time RT-PCR and ELISA were used to measure chemokine levels. Dual-immunohistochemical staining was used to co-localize chemokine production by reactive glia. Primary glial cell cultures and migration assays were used to examine chemokine-mediated recruitment. Astrocyte: B cell co-cultures were used to investigate survival and proliferation. RESULTS: The chemokine receptors CXCR3, CXCR5, CCR5, and CCR7 were detected on CD19(+) cells isolated from the brain during MCMV infection. In particular, CXCR3 was found to be elevated on an increasing number of cells over the time course of infection, and it was the primary chemokine receptor expressed at 60 days post infection Quite different expression kinetics were observed for CXCR5, CCR5, and CCR7, which were elevated on the highest number of cells early during infection and decreased by 14, 30, and 60 days post infection Correspondingly, elevated levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL13, as well as CCL5, were found within the brains of infected animals, and only low levels of CCL3 and CCL19 were detected. Differential expression of CXCL9/CXCL10 and CXCL13 between microglia and astrocytes was apparent, and B cells moved towards supernatants from MCMV-infected microglia, but not astrocytes. Pretreatment with neutralizing Abs to CXCL9 and CXCL10 inhibited this migration. In contrast, neutralizing Abs to the ligand of CXCR5 (i.e., CXCL13) did not significantly block chemotaxis. Proliferation of brain-infiltrating B cells was detected at 7 days post infection and persisted through the latest time tested (60 days post infection). Finally, astrocytes produce BAFF (B cell activating factor of the TNF family) and promote proliferation of B cells via cell-to-cell contact. CONCLUSIONS: CXCR3 is the primary chemokine receptor on CD19(+) B cells persisting within the brain, and migration to microglial cell supernatants is mediated through this receptor. Correspondingly, microglial cells produce CXCL9 and CXCL10, but not CXCL13.

At present, the virus has infected over 1.7 million people and caused over 100000 deaths worldwide. Research is currently focused on understanding the acute infection and developing effective treatment strategies. In view of the magnitude of the epidemic, we conducted a speculative review of possible medium- and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin, based on the available evidence on neurological symptoms of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Development We systematically reviewed the available evidence about the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the immediate and lasting effects of the cytokine storm on the central nervous system, and the consequences of neuroinflammation for the central nervous system. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 is a neuroinvasive virus capable of triggering a cytokine storm, with persistent effects in specific populations. Although our hypothesis is highly speculative, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the onset and progression of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases of neuroinflammatory origin should be regarded as the potential cause of a delayed pandemic that may have a major public health impact in the medium to long term.

In Brazil, abortion is a major public health problem due to the morbidity, mortality and hospitalization caused by the practice of unsafe abortions. Complications related to induced abortion and miscarriages are treated in maternity wards, where obstetric violence can be perpetrated. PURPOSE OF RESEARCH: To analyse, based on ethnographic data, the practices of biomedical technologies and their relation to practices of gynecological and obstetrical violence. RESULTS: Three main practices are systematized for didactic purposes: treatment of complications from abortion in maternity wards; ultrasound; and curettage. Despite the existence of national standards C due to the advances of the brazilian health and feminist movement C and international standards, there is still institutional resistance to the adoption of practices that prioritize womens well-being. CONCLUSIONS: The way in which the ward is organized and materialized and the adoption of certain practices and technologies (and the omission of others) contribute to reproducing obstetric violence. The daily practices in the hospital do not escape the moralization of abortion, and the strong economic, racial and gender inequalities that go beyond the institutional space of the hospital.

Our previous research indicated that anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could maintain the normal structure and function of the respiratory barrier. However, systemic application of VEGF antagonists would lead to animal death. This study attempts to study the targeted drug delivery for ARDS. In this study, we used soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt)-targeted ultrasound microbubbles to antagonize the effect of VEGF on lung tissue. Ninety male BALB/c mice were randomly assigned to 6 groups: phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group (PBS+PBS); blank group (PBS+empty microbubbles); lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group (LPS+PBS); ARDS group (LPS+empty microbubbles); control group (PBS+sFlt microbubbles); and treatment group (LPS+sFlt microbubbles). After administration of LPS or PBS in the corresponding groups, the sFlt-targeted microbubbles or empty microbubbles were injected into the blood circulation. Then the lungs were irradiated with ultrasound, which ruptured the drug-loaded microbubbles and helped release drugs to the lung tissues targeted. The lung injury score, lung wet/dry ratio (W/D), liver and kidney functions, and the mortality of the mice in all groups were investigated at the predetermined time point. The difference in mortality between groups was examined by Fisher test. Other data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A value of P<0.05 indicates that the difference was significant. The results showed that the PaO(2) levels were normal in the PBS group, the blank group, and the control group. The LPS group and ARDS group showed significant hypoxia. PaO(2) was improved significantly in the treatment group. The lung injury score and W/D were normal in the PBS group, the blank group, and the control group. The lung injury score and W/D increased significantly in the LPS group and ARDS group and decreased in the treatment group (P<0.05). The mortality rate of the ARDS model was 60% (95% confidence interval 47.5%C72.5%), and that with sFlt-targeted microbubbles was significantly lower at only 40% (95% confidence interval 27.5%C52.5%, P<0.05). It was concluded that anti-VEGF with sFlt targeted ultrasound microbubbles attenuated the lung injury and ultimately reduced the 7-day mortality effectively.

Immediately after the demonstration they were allegedly abducted, tortured and sexually violated by State security agents. In response to these allegations, the State accused the women of taking part in an 'illegal' demonstration. The experiences of these three women are an appropriate entry-point for discussion of the vile - in the sense of the objectionable - treatment of women in the national politics of Zimbabwe.

The seronegative CMV IgM patients received (sofosbuvir/daclatasvir) regimen, then the CMV reactivation was examined by measuring the CMV IgM by ELISA and CMV DNA by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The serological data revealed that all patients were positive for CMV IgG (100%) while (64%) patients were positive for CMV IgM. The seronegative CMV IgM (36%) received the DAAs protocol. The sustained virological response was monitored by measuring the HCV RNA viremia in the patient sera. The serological data revealed that 28.6% of patients had a reactivation of CMV, while 18.5% of patients had detectable CMV DNA viremia. Moreover, there was a significant improvement in liver function as well as a decrease in FIB-4 and APRI scores at EOT. SVR was reached 97.4% among the total studied patients (N= 192). CONCLUSION: CMV co-infection has no impact on the response rate to DAAs. However, the CMV reactivation might have occurred after the complete eradication of HCV by DAAs.","output":"The Impact of Direct-Acting Antiviral Agents on Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in Chronic Hepatitis C Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of two rosemary extracts obtained from the a? a? a? a? a? of Rosmarinus officinalis L., as a technological (antioxidant) feed additive for cats and dogs. The two rosemary extracts were obtained through two different solvent extraction methods, acetone and ethanol. The additives were specified to contain carnosic acid and carnosol as the reference antioxidative compounds at a minimum content of their sum as  10% in the case of the acetone extract and  5% for the ethanol extract. Based on the data available, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the maximum safe concentrations of the additives in feed were 300 and 50 mg/kg feed, for dogs and cats, respectively. No data on potential effects on respiratory system were available; however, as the products are in liquid form, the FEEDAP Panel considered that the exposure through inhalation is unlikely. The additives were shown to be irritant to skin and consequently they were considered also eye irritants. Due to the lack of data, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the potential of the additives to be skin sensitisers. The food and feed matrices in which the additives are intended to be used are of comparable nature. Therefore, the antioxidant effect observed when the additives are used in food is expected to be observed also when the additives are used in feed at the recommended concentrations.","output":"Safety and efficacy of two solvent extracts of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) when used as feed additive for cats and dogs (Kemin Nutrisurance Europe SRL)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Brazillian authorities reported a total of 16.3 million cases and 454.000 deaths during COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil by may 2021. It became necessary to educate healthcare professionals on diagnosis and treatment of the syndrome. Game based learning surfaced as an effective alternative, since it promotes critical thinking and problem solving skills. A team of Brazilian and Peruvian students, physicians, designers and programmers gathered to create a decision based computer game that simulates a hospital scenario and allows medical students to analise, make decisions and receive feedback. This work describes the creative process and showcase the initial version of the software. Methods Professors and students of Medicine, Information Technology (IT), Design and Architecture from Brazil and Peru assembled a team in order to develop the computer game. Clinical cases were created by the medical students and professors, comprising medical procedures for the treatment and management of COVID 19, and a video game script was developed exploring gamification principles of challenge, objectivity, persistence, failure, reward and feedback. Algorithms (image 1) were created, under supervision of professors of Medicine, to define possible courses of action and outcomes (e.g. gain or loss of points, improvement or worsening of the patient). Students of Design created artistic elements, and IT students programmed with a game engine software. This fluxogram, written in portuguese, describes in detail all the possible courses of actions that can be exercised by the player. It is created by a team of Professors of Medicine and medical students, in accordance with evidence-based guidelines. Primarily, this document guides the programmers and designers throughout the development phase of the game. Results Initially, an expandable minimum viable product was obtained. The game, visualized on image 2, consists in a non-playable character and a playable character (i.e. doctor), with a scenario and a dialogue script simulating a clinical examination of a COVID 19 patient. The player can interact with certain elements within the game, e.g. the computer and other characters, to retrieve test results or start dialogues with relevant information. Hospital scenario and dialogue window between doctor (player in black) and patient (non playable character) are displayer in the game engine software (Unity 2D). On the bottom half of the screen, the dialogue box allows the player to collect the patients medical history. The player can interact with certain elements to obtain relevant information to make decision and progress in the game. Conclusion The game allows medical students to practice diagnosis and treatment of COVID 19. Future versions will include assessment reports of players actions, and a new score system will be implemented. New diseases will be incorporated in the gameplay to match the variety of scenarios offered by real hospitals and patients. Artificial intelligence will be employed to optimize gameplay, feedback and learning.

METHODS: In the setting of the STROKOVID study including patients with acute ischemic stroke consecutively admitted to the ten hub hospitals in Lombardy, Italy, between March 8 and April 30, 2020, we compared clinical features of patients with confirmed infection and non-infected patients by logistic regression models and survival analysis. Then, we trained and tested a random forest (RF) binary classifier for the prediction of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among 1013 patients, 160 (15.8%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Male sex (OR 1.53; 95% CI 1.06-2.27) and atrial fibrillation (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.05-2.43) were independently associated with COVID-19 status. Patients with COVID-19 had increased stroke severity at admission [median NIHSS score, 9 (25th to75th percentile, 13) vs 6 (25th to75th percentile, 9)] and increased risk of in-hospital death (38.1% deaths vs 7.2%; HR 3.30; 95% CI 2.17-5.02). The RF model based on six clinical and laboratory parameters exhibited high cross-validated classification accuracy (0.86) and precision (0.87), good recall (0.72) and F1-score (0.79) in predicting in-hospital death. CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic strokes in COVID-19 patients have distinctive risk factor profile and etiology, increased clinical severity and higher in-hospital mortality rate compared to non-COVID-19 patients.

An international effort led by EN industry leaders has developed a small-bore enteral connector (ENFit) that in theory will reduce the frequency of misconnections. Despite the potential benefit of preventing misconnections, the full impact of adoption of the ENFit connector is unknown. To assess the impact of transitioning to ENFit on our home EN (HEN) patients, the current study evaluated gravity feeding comparing 2 proposed small-bore connectors to the legacy (current connector) using various commercial formulas. METHODS Six commonly used enteral formulas in our facility with varying density and viscosity were tested in triplicate. Forty milliliters of formula was poured into a syringe connected to an ENFit or legacy (current) feeding connector attached to varying French size tubes. The time it took formula to flow through the connectors was recorded, and the test was repeated in triplicate. RESULTS All formulas took significantly longer to flow through the first ENFit connector compared with the legacy connector ( P < .05). The second ENFit connector demonstrated similar flow dynamics to the legacy connector. CONCLUSIONS There is wide variability in the flow dynamics in ENFit connectors with significant potential impact on many facets of HEN, including medicine delivery, blenderized feeds, venting, and compliance with EN due to increased time to administer feeds. We highly recommend additional testing of flow dynamics, including gravity flow, as ENFit tubes are being developed and adopted.","output":"Gravity Flow in Proposed Enteral Tube Small-Bore Connectors."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the epidemiology of an infectious disease is a prerequisite to be being able to suggest the most appropriate methods for prevention and control of the disease.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is considered a risk modifier in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that the absence of CAC might have an additional predictive value for an improved cardiovascular outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: We prospectively included 310 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Thirty patients with history of coronary artery disease were excluded. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. Demographics, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging data, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. A composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was defined. Results: Two hundred eighty patients (63.2  16.7 years old, 57.5% male) were included in the analysis. 46.7% patients had a CAC score of 0. MACE rate was 21.8% (61 patients). The absence of CAC was inversely associated with MACE (OR 0.209, 95% CI 0.052C0.833, p = 0.027), with a negative predictive value of 84.5%. Conclusion: The absence of CAC had a high negative predictive value for MACE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, even in the presence of cardiac risk factors.

This paper will propose a thorough analysis of operating dentistry procedures, comparing the economic performance of the activity in a dental surgery before and after the adoption of these protective measures, which are required to contain the risk of SARS-COV-2 infections. Methods: The economic analysis is articulated in three approaches. Firstly, it assesses a reduction in markup by maintaining current charges (A); alternatively, it suggests revised charges to adopt in order to maintain unvaried levels of markup (B). And the third Approach (C) examines available dental treatments, highlighting how to profitably combine treatment volumes to reduce markup loss or a restricted increase in dental charges. Results: Maintaining dental charges could cause a loss in markup, even rising to 200% (A); attempting to maintain unvaried levels of markup will result in an increase in dental charges, even at 100% (B); and varying the volumes of the single dental treatments on offer (increasing those which current research indicates as the most profitable) could mitigate the economic impact of the measures to prevent the transmission of SARS-COV-2 (C).

The three most frequent viruses are rhinovirus (RV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV), detected in 8.8 %, 6.4 % and 6 % of cases, respectively. Due to its amplifying properties, the use of PCR increases the frequency of viral detection, and appears particularly appropriate in asthma where the viral load can be reduced. In a study of bronchiolitis, RSV, PIV3, AdV and RV were identified in 39.3 %, 4.3 %, 1.4 % and 3.9 % of cases, respectively, by IF or culture, and in 62.4 %, 8.3 %, 10.8 % and 12.6 % of cases, respectively, by PCR.

Previous evidence indicated that fear of missing out is related with anxiety and depression in teenagers with Internet gaming disorder, but it is unclear how fear of missing out influences depression, anxiety, or stress. METHODS: Based on an I-PACE model, using Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Fear of Missing Out Scale, and Internet Gaming Addiction Scale, and 324 middle school students as participants, this study explored the mediating effect of fear of missing out on depression, anxiety, or stress and Internet gaming disorder. RESULTS: The results showed that depression and stress are significantly related to Internet gaming disorder through the partial mediating of fear of missing out. Anxiety is not significantly related to Internet gaming disorder through the full mediating of fear of missing out, and anxiety and stress have a greater predictive effect on Internet gaming disorder through fear of missing out. Results also demonstrated that students who play Honor of Kings or Player Unknown's Battlegrounds have more risk to develop Internet gaming disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that fear of missing out as a mediator regulates the relationship among depression, anxiety, and stress and Internet game disorder. Specifically, under the mediation of fear of missing out, teenagers with anxiety are more likely to develop Internet gaming disorder, while teenagers with depression or stress might be prone to other types of Internet use disorders.","output":"Anxiety, Depression, and Stress Are Associated With Internet Gaming Disorder During COVID-19: Fear of Missing Out as a Mediator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we examine public perceptions of the importance of different levels of government and of nongovernmental entities in responding to the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

However, still, it is not the end. Hence, predicting the COVID possibility in an early stage is the most required matter to reduce the death risks. Therefore, many researchers have focused on designing an early prediction mechanism in the basis of deep learning (DL), machine learning (Ml), etc., on detecting the COVID virus and severity in the human body in an earlier stage. However, the complexity of X-ray images has made it difficult to attain the finest prediction accuracy. Hence, the present research work has aimed to develop a novel Vulture Based Adaboost-Feedforward Neural (VbAFN) scheme to forecast the COVID-19 severity early. Here, the chest X-ray images were employed to identify the COVID risk feature in humans. The preprocessing function is done in the initial phase; the error-free data is imported to the classification layer for the feature extraction and segmentation process. This investigation aims to track and segment the affected parts from the trained X-ray images by the vulture fitness and to segment them with a good exactness rate. Subsequently, the designed model has gained a better segmentation accuracy of 99.9% and a lower error rate of 0.0145, which is better than other compared models.

Regarding COVID-19, handwashing and social distancing through stay-at-home orders or quarantine measures are effective at slowing the spread of illness. Use of proper face masks (not gaiters or bandanas) is also effective at preventing transmission. This is important because the virus can infect others during the presymptomatic phase. Aspirin can no longer be recommended for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Human papillomavirus vaccination is strongly associated with reduced risk of invasive cervical cancer, especially in women who were vaccinated before 17 years of age. When a woman who is postmenopausal has a screening bone mineral density test, rechecking the test after three years does not help to identify those who will have a fragility fracture. A higher daily step count is associated with lower all-cause mortality. After one year of follow-up, physical therapy is preferred to glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis of the knee;acetaminophen is ineffective for acute low back pain or pain due to knee or hip osteoarthritis;and adding a muscle relaxant to ibuprofen does not improve functional outcomes or pain in people reporting moderate to severe back pain one week after starting treatment. Although short-term antibiotics and steroids are effective in treating acute exacerbations of COPD, not much else is. Successful communication with patients seeking an antibiotic for a flulike illness can be achieved with combinations of messaging, including information on antibiotic resistance and the self-limiting nature of the illness. A new prediction rule effectively identifies patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have a low likelihood of positive findings on allergy testing. Low-value screening tests in asymptomatic, low-risk patients often lead to further testing, diagnostic procedures, or referrals.

Genome analyses revealed that U.S. PdCV isolates possess unique genetic characteristics and share a close relationship with Hong Kong and South Korean PdCV strains and coronaviruses (CoVs) of Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret-badgers. The PdCV-positive intestinal content (Ohio CVM1) and the cell culture-adapted PdCV Michigan (MI) strain were orally inoculated into gnotobiotic and/or conventional piglets. Within 1 to 3 days postinfection, profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration were observed.

METHODS: An intervention study conducted in members of the COPD Foundations Patient Powered Research Network (PPRN). All had self-reported COPD. A survey queried about receipt of influenza, shingles and pneumonia vaccines and reasons for not receiving those vaccines. For individuals not receiving the newest of those vaccines (shingles), a 5-minute educational video was presented discussing general shingles disease burden and increased risk in those with COPD, and disease prevention from vaccination. A 1-minute patient (COPD + shingles) testimonial was included in the video. After viewing, participants were asked about the value and potential impact of the video. RESULTS: 735 people responded;60% women, mean age 68.5 years, 53% reporting poor overall health and 54% having >1 exacerbations in past 12 months. Vaccination rates were 93% for pneumonia vaccines, 89% for influenza vaccines and 61% for shingles vaccines. Health care recommendations varied by site: highest in primary care (61 to 91%) and from internet or family and friends (35 to 47%) and lower rates of recommendations by pulmonologists (21 to 61%) and pharmacies (30 to 53%) among those attending the specific site. The most common reasons for not receiving a vaccine were lack of health care professional recommendation (7% for influenza to >30% for pneumonia and shingles), concerns about side effects (pneumonia 22%, shingles 38% and influenza 43%), inadequate information (influenza 11%, pneumonia 20%, shingles 32%) and for influenza and shingles vaccinesfear of vaccine causing the disease (28% and 22% respectively). Only 25% were aware that COPD increased the risk of developing shingles. The video was felt to be useful (>94%) and increased interest and intent for receiving the shingles vaccine or at least discussing receipt with their physician (>87%). Awareness of increased risk of shingles in those with COPD increased to 91%. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccine hesitancy continues among those living with COPD, particularly for newer vaccines such as shingles.Health care professionals recommendations are not universal.A short educational intervention may lower vaccine hesitancy and may have implications for addressing COVID vaccine acceptance. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Care of people with COPD must include clear vaccine recommendations and information about preventable disease burden, vaccine effectiveness and accurate side effect profiles from all the Health Care Professionals they visit.

It is characterized by the features of acute encephalopathy such as seizure, alteration of consciousness, and symmetric involvement of the bilateral thalamus on neuroimaging tests. Although most ANE cases have occurred sporadically, familial or recurrent ANE has been reported in Caucasian patients, with genetic susceptibility to ANE noted in some patients due to a RANBP2 mutation. We report the cases of two Korean siblings with typical ANE and RANBP2 mutation. CASE REPORT: A 2 year-old Korean girl presented with prolonged seizures and encephalopathy after two days of febrile illness. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed diffuse brain swelling and low attenuation in the bilateral thalamus. Two months later, her younger sister presented with lethargy and flurries of seizures after a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Brain magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) showed a characteristic involvement of the bilateral thalamus, suggesting ANE. Although they received intravenous steroids and immunoglobulin, the older child died; her sister remained in a coma. Both were diagnosed with familial ANE after identifying a common missense mutation in RANBP2 (c.1754C > T: p.Thr585Met) in the younger sister and their father. CONCLUSIONS: This report is the first case of familial ANE in Northeast Asia identifying a RANBP2 mutation with poor outcome.

An isolation ward is a facility to isolate patients physically and to care them safely. One way to isolate a patient physically is to build a negative pressure isolation facility. However, unexpected failure or misuse of such facility makes it difficult to maintain negative pressure and eventually causes secondary infection, leaking the infectious pathogen to outside of the isolation ward. This study identifies the amount and velocity of leakage air from a patient ward by tracer gas experiment under abnormal operations of an isolation facility. In addition, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allowed us to observe the outflow mechanism of pollutant.

Self and nonself SCSs comprised 91.2% and 8.8% of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, respectively. We identified potentially important nonself SCS clusters in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein that overlap with previously identified epitopes of neutralizing antibodies. These nonself SCS clusters may serve as functional epitopes for effective, safe, and long-term vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, analyses of self/nonself status changes in mutants revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 proteome may be evolving to mimic the human proteome.

Co-injections of HDL and filomicelles into wild-type mice reduced filomicelle signal in the liver and increased filomicelle plasma levels. The same was true with SCARB1-/- mice. SR-BI binding is followed by phagocytosis for filomicelle macrophage entry, but only SR-BI is needed for entry into Idla7-SR-BI cells. PEO-PBD spheres did not interact strongly with SR-BI in the above experiments. The results show elongated PEO-based NPs can bind cells via cooperativity among SR-BI receptors on cell surfaces.","output":"Elongated PEO-based nanoparticles bind the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor scavenger receptor class B I (SR-BI)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present review, the authors shed light on the SARS-CoV-2 impact, persistence, and monitoring in the soil environment. With this purpose, several aspects have been deepened: i) viruses in soil ecosystems; ii) direct and indirect impact on the soil before and after the pandemic, and iii) methods for quantification of viruses and SARS-CoV-2 monitoring in soil. Viruses are present in soil (i.e. up to 41710(7) viruses per g TS(C1) in wetlands) and can affect the behavior and ecology of other life forms (e.g. bacteria), which are remarkably important for maintaining environmental equilibrium. Also, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in soil (i.e. up to 550 copiesg(C1)). Considering that the SARS-CoV-2 is very recent, poor knowledge is available in the literature on persistence in the soil and reference has been made to coronaviruses and other families of viruses. For instance, the survival of enveloped viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV) can reach 90 days in soils with 10% of moisture content at ambient. In such a context, the possible spread of the SARS-CoV-2 in the soil was evaluated by analyzing the possible contamination routes.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses in soil: an environmental outlook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A web application with real-time emotion recognition for psychologists and psychiatrists is presented.

But the challenge is to implement it under the poor performance of a part of society computers and the low speed of internet connection, i.e., improve the computational efficiency and reduce the data transfer. To validate the computational efficiency premise, we compare CNN architectures results, collecting the floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), the Number of Parameters (NP) and accuracy from the MobileNet, PeleeNet, Extended Deep Neural Network (EDNN), Inception- Based Deep Neural Network (IDNN) and our proposed Residual mobile-based Network model (ResmoNet).

The objective of this study is to test the feasibility of gravitationally driven droplet translocation numerically to enhance the nasal spray dosages in the olfactory region and quantify the intranasal dose distribution in the regions of interest. A computational nasal spray testing platform was developed that included a nasal spray releasing model, an airflow-droplet transport model, and an Eulerian wall film formation/translocation model. The effects of both device-related and administration-related variables on the initial olfactory deposition were studied, including droplet size, velocity, plume angle, spray release position, and orientation. The liquid film formation and translocation after nasal spray applications were simulated for both a standard and a newly proposed delivery system. Results show that the initial droplet deposition in the olfactory region is highly sensitive to the spray plume angle. For the given nasal cavity with a vertex-to-floor head position, a plume angle of 10 with a device orientation of 45 to the nostril delivered the optimal dose to the olfactory region. Liquid wall film translocation enhanced the olfactory dosage by ninefold, compared to the initial olfactory dose, for both the baseline and optimized delivery systems. The optimized delivery system delivered 6.2% of applied sprays to the olfactory region and significantly reduced drug losses in the vestibule.

Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: societal and isolated SSEs. METHODS: We summarise SSEs that have occurred using multiple databases that have been cross referenced to ensure numbers are as reliable as we can ascertain. This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Societal SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, isolated SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Superspreader Events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is an intestinal infectious disease caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV); manifestations of the disease are diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration.

It is the product of the interaction between consumer health needs and supply-side reform. However, there has still been no systematic summary of its establishment and definition, nor has there been an analysis of its service content. OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to understand the definition, establishment, and development status of internet hospitals. METHODS: Data on internet hospitals were obtained via the Baidu search engine for results up until January 1, 2019. Based on the results of the search, we obtained more detailed information from the official websites and apps of 130 online hospitals and formed a database for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: By January 2019, the number of registered internet hospitals had expanded to approximately 130 in 25 provinces, accounting for 73.5% of all provinces or province-level municipalities in China. Internet hospitals, as a new telehealth model, are distinct but overlap with online health, telemedicine, and mobile medical.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the impact of initial government policies on this vulnerable older population between the UK and Australia during the first wave of attack. METHODS: We searched websites of governments in the UK and Australia and media outlets. We examined the key policies including the national lockdown dates and the distribution of some important resources (personal protective equipment and testing) and the effects of these initial policies on the mortality rates in the aged care homes during the first wave of attack of COVID-19. RESULTS: We found that both countries had prioritized resources to hospitals over aged care homes during the first wave of attack. Both countries had lower priority for aged care residents in hospitals (e.g. discharging without testing for COVID-19 or discouraging admissions). However, deaths in aged care homes were 270 times higher in the UK than in Australia as on 7 May 2020 (despite UK having a population only 2.5 times larger than Australia). The lower fatality rate in Australia may have been due to the earlier lockdown strategy when the total daily cases were low in Australia (118) compared to the UK (over 1000), as well as the better community viral testing regime in Australia. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the public health policy in Australia aimed towards earlier intervention with earlier national lockdown and more viral testing to prevent new cases. This primary prevention could have resulted in more lives being saved. In contrast, the initial policy in the UK focussed mainly on protecting resources for hospitals, and there was a delay in national lockdown intervention and lower viral testing rate, resulting in more lives lost in the aged care sector.","output":"COVID-19 in aged care homes: a comparison of effects initial government policies had in the UK (primarily focussing on England) and Australia during the first wave"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic condition worldwide.

The community transmission of this highly infectious virus has severely affected various parts of China, Italy, Spain, India, and USA, among others. The prophylactic solution against SARS-CoV-2 infection is challenging due to the high mutation rate of its RNA genome. Herein, we exploited a next-generation vaccinology approach to construct a multi-epitope vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 that is predicted to have high antigenicity, safety, and efficacy to combat this deadly infectious agent. The whole proteome was scrutinized for the screening of highly conserved, antigenic, non-allergen, and non-toxic epitopes having high population coverage that can elicit both humoral and cellular mediated immune response against COVID-19 infection. These epitopes along with four different adjuvants, were utilized to construct a multi-epitope-vaccine candidate that can generate strong immunological memory response having high efficacy in humans. Various physiochemical analyses revealed the formation of a stable vaccine product having a high propensity to form a protective solution against the detrimental SARS-CoV-2 strain with high efficacy. The vaccine candidate interacted with immunological receptor TLR3 with a high affinity depicting the generation of innate immunity. Further, the codon optimization and in silico expression show the plausibility of the high expression and easy purification of the vaccine product.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worldwide, we selected 20 countries; 10 hottest countries with the highest temperatures and 10 coldest countries with the lowest temperature. The selection of the countries was based on the daily basis mean temperature from the date of appearance of the initial cases of COVID-19, Dec 29, 2019 to May 12, 2020. In the world's 10 hottest countries, the mean temperature was (26.311.51) and humidity (44.674.97). However, in the world's 10 coldest countries the mean temperature was (6.191.61) and humidity (57.262.35). The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, daily new cases and deaths were recorded from World Health Organization, and daily information on temperature and humidity was obtained from metrological web \\"Time and Date\\". RESULTS: In countries with high temperatures and low humidity, the mean daily cases incidence were (407.1224.33); cumulative cases (9094.34708.29); and cumulative deaths (452.8443.30) were significantly low compared to countries with low temperatures and high humidity: daily cases (1876.72207.37); cumulative cases (44232.385875.11); and cumulative deaths (2008.29310.13). Moreover, COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population were significantly low in countries with high temperatures (cases 711.23, and deaths 16.27) compared to countries with low temperatures (cases 1685.99; and deaths 86.40). Furthermore, in hottest countries, a 1% increase in humidity reduced number of cases and deaths by (? = -5.40, p<0.001) and (? = -0.187, p=0.004) respectively. A similar trend was seen with a 1C increase in temperature, reducing the number of deaths by (? = -1.35. p<0.001).

We focused on SNP rs17775810 that has been previously identified by examining loss-of-function mutations in the S1R gene associated with distal hereditary motor neuropathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS We utilized UK Biobank (UKB) data. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. RESULTS The effect of rs17775810 genotype on survival was significant (p=0.036, 2 tailed Fisher exact test). The minor allele homozygotes (TT) had the lowest death rate (0%), whereas the non-TT genotypes (i.e. CT and CC) had the highest death rate (16.2%). CONCLUSION The rs17775810 analysis corroborates the favorable effect of fluvoxamine on COVID-19 survival.","output":"Homozygosity for rs17775810 Minor Allele Associated With Reduced Mortality of COVID-19 in the UK Biobank Cohort."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The semi-anadromous sea catfish species Cathorops tuyra (Ariidae, Besudo sea catfish) from the Tropical Eastern Pacific has been found reproductively active in the freshwater rivers and lakes of the Panama Canal.

Evidence of impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Germany is scarce. The objectives of this study were to use a Delphi-panel based assessment of the effectiveness of different COVID-19 specific prevention measures in order to retrospectively approximate and to prospectively predict the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progression via a SEIR model (SEIR: Susceptible - Exposed - Infectious - Removed). The SEIR model will be made available with a modifiable user interface.Methods: We applied an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach to elicit the impact of NPIs being discussed in Germany on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission rate R0. Initial estimates were discussed and agreed upon in two Delphi stages resulting in a final set of average efficacy and compliance estimates for each NPI. Effectiveness was defined as the product of efficacy and compliance. A discrete, deterministic SEIR model with time step of 1 day, a latency period of 1.8 days, duration of infectiousness of 5 days, and a share of the total population of 15% assumed to be protected by immunity was developed in order to estimate the impact of selected NPI measures on pandemic course. The model was populated with the Delphi-panel results and varied in sensitivity analyses.Results: Efficacy and compliance estimates were obtained as follows (ranked by effectiveness): test and isolate 49% (efficacy)/78% (compliance), keeping distance 42%/74%, personal protection masks (cloth masks or other face masks) 33%/79%, ban of large public events 26%/96%, contact reduction 33%/59%, closure of non-essential stores 10%/97%, closure of schools 10%/100%, working from home 12%/66%, closure of restaurants 8%/96%, and improved hand hygiene 7%/54%. Applying these NPI effectiveness estimates to the SEIR model resulted in a valid replication of reported occurrence of the German SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.Conclusion: Employing an evidence-educated Delphi-panel approach for generating NPI effectiveness estimates is feasible and could help to generate model simulations with close replication of reported infected cases in Germany.

It is recognised that low health literacy levels, different worldviews and English as a second language all contribute to the difficulties health workers often have in explaining biomedical health concepts, relevant to hepatitis B infection, to patients. The aim of this research project was to explore the knowledge, perceptions and experiences of remote dwelling Indigenous adults and their health care providers relating to hepatitis B infection with a view to using this as the evidence base to develop a culturally appropriate educational tool. METHODS: The impetus for this project came from health clinic staff at a remote community in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, in partnership with a visiting specialist liver clinic from the Royal Darwin Hospital. Participants were clinic patients with hepatitis B (n = 12), community members (n = 9) and key informants (n = 13); 25 were Indigenous individuals. A participatory action research project design was used with purposive sampling to identify participants. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken to explore: current understanding of hepatitis B, desire for knowledge, and perspectives on how people could acquire the information needed. All individuals were offered the use of an interpreter. The data were examined using deductive and inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Low levels of biomedical knowledge about Hepatitis B, negative perceptions of Hepatitis B, communication (particularly language) and culture were the major themes that emerged from the data. Accurate concepts grounded in Indigenous culture such as only your blood can tell the story were present but accompanied by a feeling of disempowerment due to perceived lack of medical understanding, and informed partnerships between caregiver and patient. Culturally appropriate discussions in a patients first language using visual aids were identified as vital to improving communication. CONCLUSIONS: Having an educational tool in Indigenous patients first language is crucial in developing treatment partnerships for Indigenous patients with hepatitis B. Using a culturally appropriate worldview as the foundation for development should help to reduce disempowerment and improve health literacy.","output":"Only your blood can tell the story C a qualitative research study using semi- structured interviews to explore the hepatitis B related knowledge, perceptions and experiences of remote dwelling Indigenous Australians and their health care providers in northern Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by 2030, using direct-acting antiviral treatments, has been promoted by the World Health Organization.

SAMPLE: College students (N=756) ages 18C24 who reported current e-cigarette use. MEASURES: Current use of e-cigarettes, combustible cigarettes, and cigars, and self-reported COVID-19 symptomatology, testing, and diagnosis status were measured. ANALYSIS: Multivariable logistic regression models accounting for students demographics, university site, fraternity/sorority membership, and current residence. RESULTS: Over half (53.6%) of students were exclusive e-cigarette users, 20.4% were dual e-cigarette and combustible cigarette users, 4.6% were dual e-cigarette and cigar users, and 21.4% were poly users of e-cigarettes, combustible cigarettes, and cigars. Compared to exclusive e-cigarette users, dual users of e-cigarettes and combustible cigarettes (AOR=2.12, 95%CI=1.05C4.27) and poly users of e-cigarettes, combustible cigarettes, and cigars (AOR=3.70, 95%CI=1.78C7.70) had increased odds of COVID-19 symptomatology, even when accounting for covariates.

Clinical and experimental evidence point to a dysregulated immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 as the primary mechanism of lung disease in COVID-19. However, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) remain incompletely understood. This study aims to explore the inflammatory responses of alveolar epithelial cells to either the spike S1 protein or to a mixture of cytokines secreted by S1-activated macrophages. Methods and Results. The exposure of alveolar A549 cells to supernatants from spike-activated macrophages caused a further release of inflammatory mediators, with IL-8 reaching massive concentrations. The investigation of the molecular pathways indicated that NF-kB is involved in the transcription of IP-10 and RANTES, while STATs drive the expression of all the cytokines/chemokines tested, with the exception of IL-8 which is regulated by AP-1. Cytokines/chemokines produced by spike-activated macrophages are also likely responsible for the observed dysfunction of barrier integrity in Human Alveolar Epithelial Lentivirus-immortalized cells (hAELVi), as demonstrated by an increased permeability of the monolayers to mannitol, a marked decrease of TEER and a disorganization of claudin-7 distribution. Conclusion. Upon exposure to supernatants from S1-activated macrophages, A549 cells act both as targets and sources of cytokines/chemokines, suggesting that alveolar epithelium along with activated macrophages may orchestrate lung inflammation and contribute to alveolar injury, a hallmark of ARDS.","output":"Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Responses of Alveolar Epithelial Cells: Implications for COVID-19 Lung Pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Numerous interventions are in clinical development for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, including small molecules that target viral transcription and replication.

Despite their critical roles in RSV transcription and replication, structures of L and P have remained elusive. Here, we describe the 3.2-? cryo-EM structure of RSV L bound to tetrameric P. The structure reveals a striking tentacular arrangement of P, with each of the four monomers adopting a distinct conformation. The structure also rationalizes inhibitor escape mutants and mutations observed in live-attenuated vaccine candidates.

We aimed to explore the impact of age and frailty on the acute immune response to COVID-19 illness. METHODS: We recruited older (aged 65+; n = 33) and younger (aged 20C50; n = 43) participants with acute COVID-19 illness for clinical assessment and detailed immunophenotyping for T-cell, neutrophil, monocyte and inflammatory markers using flow cytometry. We additionally assessed circulating levels of several important pro-inflammatory cytokines. Wilxocon rank-sum, chi-square tests and linear regression were used to examine the impact of age and frailty (Clinical Frailty Score 3C9) on the immune response in COVID-19 illness. Results were compared to age-matched pre-pandemic controls (n = 40). RESULTS: COVID-19 illness was associated with a marked pro-inflammatory response (raised CRP, IL-6, IL-2R), lymphopenia and emergency myelopoesis (an expansion of non-classical/intermediate monocytes and immature neutrophils) in both age groups (all P < 0.001). In comparison to younger participants (35.7  8.6 years), older adults (76.7  7.8 years) had a more marked reduction in na?ve CD4+ and CD8+ cells and a more marked expansion of activated CD4+, CD8+ and effector CD8+ T-cells (all P < 0.001). These findings were independent of illness severity (all P < 0.001). In comparison to their younger counterparts, older adults had a reduced number of CD10+ neutrophils/non-classical monocytes and greater CRP, IL-6 and IL-2R (P < 0.05), although results were attenuated on adjusting for COVID-19 severity. Frailty was not associated with any significant difference in immune cell population or pro-inflammatory response in acute COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSION: Increasing age, but not frailty status, was associated with reduced na?ve T-cells and a more marked expansion of activated/effector T-cells in acute COVID-19 illness.

The authors present a regional-based model of a network of clinicians and healthcare managers using a dedicated IT platform to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency objectives, to ensure coordination of the available resources and the most appropriate rehabilitative treatment for patients. The proposed post-acute COVID-19 rehabilitation network has been designed according to the model of a clinical management project within the Italian national healthcare system, and its context is an easily adjustable model for the European healthcare systems. The authors base the project on current laws and scientific guidelines in rehabilitation in Italy and in Europe and use the SWOT analysis technique to assess the proposal feasibility. The primary aims of the project are: (1) standardizing the minimum assessment tools of post-COVID-19 patients with disabilities; (2) ensuring an individual rehabilitation project for each patient with international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF) coding and (3) reporting the activity performance with appropriate indicators. The secondary aims are: (1) developing educational programs for patients and care givers also aimed at acquiring better empowerment and positive behavior; (2) creating a regional database for data collection and (3) improving IT, and specifically tele-rehabilitation, as a suitable approach during the COVID-19 emergency and also in the future. Expected results are: continuum of care; effectiveness, efficacy and appropriateness in the delivery of rehabilitation treatments through a standardized minimum assessment and the wording of the individual rehabilitation project and a precise reporting of performance indicators to measure the effectiveness of clinical activities and the satisfaction of patients and caregivers.

In part, the inefficiency is due to an absence of the coxsackie B and adenovirus type 2 and 5 receptor (CAR) from the apical membranes of polarized epithelia. In this study, using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, we show that providing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked AdV receptor (GPI-CAR) at the apical surface did not significantly improve AdV gene transfer efficiency because the lumenal surface glycocalyx limited the access of AdV to apical GPI-CAR. The highly glycosylated tethered mucins were considered to be significant glycocalyx components that restricted AdV access because proteolytic digestion and inhibitors of O-linked glycosylation enhanced AdV gene transfer. To determine whether these in vitro observations are relevant to the in vivo situation, we generated transgenic mice expressing GPI-CAR at the surface of the airway epithelium, crossbred these mice with mice that were genetically devoid of tethered mucin type 1 (Muc1), and tested the efficiency of gene transfer to murine airways expressing apical GPI-human CAR (GPI-hCAR) in the presence and absence of Muc1. We determined that AdV gene transfer to the murine airway epithelium was inefficient even in GPI-hCAR transgenic mice but that the gene transfer efficiency improved in the absence of Muc1. However, the inability to achieve a high gene transfer efficiency, even in mice with a deletion of Muc1, suggested that other glycocalyx components, possibly other tethered mucin types, also provide a significant barrier to AdV interacting with the airway lumenal surface.","output":"Glycocalyx restricts adenoviral vector access to apical receptors expressed on respiratory epithelium in vitro and in vivo: role for tethered mucins as barriers to lumenal infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An appropriate balanced diet and dietary patterns are important at every stage of life, but in the case of young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), it is especially crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We fit a set of probability distribution functions and estimate a symptom-onset-to-death mean of $15.2$ days for Brazil, which is lower than earlier estimates of 17.8 days based on early Chinese data. A joint Bayesian subnational model is used to simultaneously describe the 26 states and one federal district of Brazil, and shows significant variation in the mean of the symptom-onset-to-death time, with ranges between 11.2-17.8 days across the different states. We find strong evidence in favour of specific probability distribution function choices: for example, the gamma distribution gives the best fit for onset-to-death and the generalised log-normal for onset-to-hospital-discharge. Our results show that epidemiological distributions have considerable geographical variation, and provide the first estimates of these distributions in a low and middle-income setting.

The main purpose of this study was to identify predictors of short- and long-term mortality in the ED and at hospital discharge. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational, single-center, cohort study, involving critically ill older adults, recruited consecutively in an ED. The primary outcome was mortality. All patients were followed for 6.5C7.5 years. The Cox proportional hazards model was used. RESULTS: Regarding all critically ill patients aged  70 years and identified in the ED (n = 402), there was a significant association between mortality at 30 days after ED admission and unconsciousness on admission (HR 3.14, 95% CI 2.09C4.74), hypoxia on admission (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.69C3.74) and age (HR 1.06 per year, 95% CI 1.03C1.09), (all p < 0.001). Of 402 critically ill patients aged  70 years and identified in the ED, 303 were discharged alive from hospital. There was a significant association between long-term mortality and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) > 2 (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.46C2.48), length of stay (LOS) > 7 days (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.32C2.23), discharge diagnosis of pneumonia (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.24C2.21) and age (HR 1.08 per year, 95% CI 1.05C1.10), (all p < 0.001).

An access point (AP) and a Raspberry PI kit has been located in a closed area to harvest the RSS value when people pass through the area. K-NN machine learning algorithm has been trained with different features extracted from the RSS to predict the number of people in the area. Finally, an Android smartphone App has been written to monitor the counted number to enforce the counting constraint in the closed areas. The model has been deployed in the engineering faculty. Our results show that K-NN with RSS features for passively crowd density counting achieved 88% accuracy. However, this accuracy dropped to 75% with people running scenario ? 2021, Periodicals of Engineering and Natural Sciences.

Between November 2009 and November 2014, 84 consecutive isolated pediatric LTs were performed in 81 children. Potential preoperative predictive factors for bleeding, amount of intra-operative transfusions, postoperative course, and outcome were recorded. Cutoff point for intra-operative HBL was defined as intra-operative RBC transfusions 1 TBV. Twenty-six patients (31%) had intra-operative HBL. One-year patient survival after LT was 66.7% (CI 95%=[50.2-88.5]) in HBL patients and 83.8% (CI 95%=[74.6-94.1]) in the others (P=.054). Among 13 potential preoperative risk factors, three of them were identified as independent predictors of high intra-operative bleeding: abdominal surgical procedure(s) prior to LT, factor V level 30% before transplantation, and ex situ parenchymal transsection of the liver graft. Based on these findings, we propose a simple score to predict the individual hemorrhagic risk related to each patient and graft association.

Early studies showed favorable short-term results of endoscopic transanal proctectomy (ETAP), with low conversion rates to open procedures. We aimed to compare efficacy, morbidity, and functional outcomes of ETAP to standard LAP for low rectal cancer. STUDY DESIGN From 2008 to 2013, 72 consecutive patients received proctectomy and coloanal manual anastomosis for low rectal adenocarcinoma. Thirty-four patients had transanal endoscopic proctectomy, and 38 patients underwent the standard laparoscopic procedure. RESULTS When compared with the LAP group, the ETAP group demonstrated a lower conversion rate to open procedures (23.7% vs 2.9%, respectively; p = 0.015), shorter in-hospital stays (9 vs 8 days, respectively; p = 0.04), and a lower readmission rate (13.2% vs 0%; p = 0.03). Overall postoperative morbidity rates for the LAP and the ETAP groups (36.8% vs 32.4%, respectively; p = 0.69) and functional results (Kirwan score 1/2, 73.7% vs 73.5%, respectively; p = 0.85) were comparable; additionally, we found similar oncologic quality criteria (R1 resection 10.5% vs 5.9%, respectively; p = 0.68; grade 3 mesorectal integrity 52.6% vs 55.9%, respectively; p = 0.66).

Currently, the accumulating information on the effects of the infection regarding the demographic and clinical characteristics of the disease, as well as outcomes within different DMTs? enable us to have better practices on the management of the Covid-19 infection in pwMS. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to reveal the relationship between the demographic-clinical and therapeutic features and the outcome of Covid-19 infection in a multi-center national cohort of pwMS. METHODS: The Turkish Neurological Society-MS Study Group in association with the Italian MuSC-19 Study Group initiated this study. A web-based electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) of Study-MuSC-19 were used to collect the data. The demographic data and MS histories of the patients were obtained from the file tracking forms of the relevant clinics. RESULTS: 309 MS patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection were included in this study. Two hundred nineteen (219) were females (70.9%). The mean age was 36.9, ranging from 18 to 66, 194 of them (62.8%) were under 40. The clinical phenotype was relapsing-remitting in 277 (89.6%) and progressive in 32 (10.4%). Disease duration ranged from 0.2 years to 31.4 years. The median EDSS was 1.5, ranging from 0 to 8.5. The EDSS score was<= 1 in 134 (43%) of the patients. 91.6% of the patients were on a DMT, Fingolimod was the most frequently used drug (22.0%), followed by Interferon (20.1%). The comorbidity rate is 11.7%. We were not able to detect any significant association of DMTs with Covid-19 severity. CONCLUSION: The Turkish MS-Covid-19 cohort had confirmed that pwMS are not at risk of having a more severe COVID-19 outcome irrespective of the DMT that they are treated. In addition, due to being a younger population with less comorbidities most had a mild disease further highlight that the only associated risk factors for having a moderate to severe COVID-19 course are similar with the general population such as having comorbid conditions and being older.","output":"The Outcome Of a National MS-Covid-19 Study: What The Turkish MS Cohort Reveals?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glaucoma is the second most common cause for blindness around the world and the third most common in Europe and the USA. Around 78 million people are presently living with glaucoma (2020). It is expected that 111.8 million people will have glaucoma by the year 2040. 90% of glaucoma is undetected in developing nations. It is essential to develop a glaucoma detection system for early diagnosis. In this research, early prediction of glaucoma using deep learning technique is proposed. In this proposed deep learning model, the ORIGA dataset is used for the evaluation of glaucoma images. The U-Net architecture based on deep learning algorithm is implemented for optic cup segmentation and a pretrained transfer learning model; DenseNet-201 is used for feature extraction along with deep convolution neural network (DCNN). The DCNN approach is used for the classification, where the final results will be representing whether the glaucoma infected or not. The primary objective of this research is to detect the glaucoma using the retinal fundus images, which can be useful to determine if the patient was affected by glaucoma or not. The result of this model can be positive or negative based on the outcome detected as infected by glaucoma or not. The model is evaluated using parameters such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F-measure. Also, a comparative analysis is conducted for the validation of the model proposed. The output is compared to other current deep learning models used for CNN classification, such as VGG-19, Inception ResNet, ResNet 152v2, and DenseNet-169.

The cytokine storm in SARS-CoV2 infection has been linked with both diabetes and Vitamin D deficiency. This study examined the hypothesis that supplementation with vitamin D, in combination with l-cysteine (LC), is better at reducing oxidative stress and thereby, more effective, at inhibiting the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in U937 monocytes exposed to high glucose concentrations. Methods: U937 monocytes were pretreated with 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D (VD, 10 nM) or LC (250 M) or VD + LC for 24 h and then exposed to control or high glucose (HG, 25 mM) for another 24 h. Results: There were significantly greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in monocytes treated with HG than those in controls. Combined supplementation with VD and LC showed a more significant reduction in ROS (46%) in comparison with treatment with LC (19%) or VD (26%) alone in monocytes exposed to HG. Similarly, VD supplementation, together with LC, caused a more significant inhibition in the secretion of IL-8 (36% versus 16%) and MCP-1 (46% versus 26%) in comparison with that of VD (10 nM) alone in high-glucose treated monocytes. Conclusions: These results suggest that combined supplementation with vitamin D and LC has the potential to be more effective than either VD or LC alone in lowering the risk of oxidative stress and inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes or COVID-19 infection. Further, this combined vitamin D with LC/N-acetylcysteine may be a potent alternative therapy for SARS-CoV2 infected subjects.

In the absence of specific vaccines and anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, medicines that may assist in tackling the emergency and limiting the high number of fatalities are urgently needed. The repositioning of available drugs to treat COVID-19 is the only and rapid option in the face of the lack of direct antiviral agents and vaccines available. In this light it is important to focus on available drugs, which, based on their pharmacodynamics, could plausibly attenuate viral growth as well as COVID-19s worst complications.

The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37 kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD).

METHODS: Collaborating with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), we established a prospective consecutive cohort of 5,628 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to 120 hospitals in Korea between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort was randomly divided using a 7:3 ratio into a development (n = 3,940) and validation (n = 1,688) set. Clinical information and complete blood count (CBC) detected at admission were investigated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-Mortality Score). The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality was 4.3% in both the development and validation set. A COVID-Mortality Score consisting of age, sex, body mass index, combined comorbidity, clinical symptoms, and CBC was developed. AUCs of the scoring system were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85C0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84C0.93) in the development and validation set, respectively.

Results Once their respective epidemics begin to propagate, Louisiana displays Rt values with an absolute difference of 1.3 to 2.5 compared to South Korea. It also takes Louisiana more than twice as long to bring Rt below 1. We estimate that increased equity in transmission consistent with the benefits of a successful reparations program (reflected in the ratio {beta}b[->]b / {beta}w[->]w) could reduce R0 by 31 to 68%. Discussion While there are compelling moral and historical arguments for racial injustice interventions such as reparations, our study describes potential health benefits in the form of reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. As we demonstrate, a restitutive program targeted towards Black individuals would not only decrease COVID-19 risk for recipients of the wealth redistribution; the mitigating effects would be distributed across racial groups, benefitting the population at large.","output":"Reparations for Black American Descendants of Persons Enslaved in the U.S. and Their Estimated Impact on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, large volumes of biomedical information concerning this new disease have been published on social media. Some of this information can pose a real danger to people's health, particularly when false information is shared, for instance recommendations on how to treat diseases without professional medical advice. Therefore, automatic fact-checking resources and systems developed specifically for the medical domain are crucial.

We employ a novel crowdsourcing methodology to annotate all tweets with fact-checking labels and supporting evidence, which crowdworkers search for online. This methodology results in moderate inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, we use the retrieved evidence extracts as part of a fact-checking pipeline, finding that the real-world evidence is more useful than the knowledge indirectly available in pretrained language models.","output":"CoVERT: A Corpus of Fact-checked Biomedical COVID-19 Tweets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although serious complications of otitis media (OM) such as brain abscess are rare, sequelae of OM such as tympanic membrane perforation and atelectatic tympanic membrane are quite common.

Efforts to prevent transmission of the virus among humans remains a high priority. The current efforts to quarantine involve social distancing, monitoring and tracking the infected patients. However, the spread of the virus is too rapid to be contained only by manual and inefficient human contact tracing activities. To address this challenge, we have developed Connect, a blockchain empowered digital contact tracing platform that can leverage information on positive cases and notify people in their immediate proximity which would thereby reduce the rate at which the infection could spread. This would particularly be effective if sufficient people use the platform and benefit from the targeted recommendations. The recommendations would be made in a privacy-preserving fashion and contain the spread of the virus without the need for an extended period of potential lockdown.

As their state of preparation and perceptions in volunteering during this pandemic have yet to be investigated, this study aims to evaluate Indonesian medical students willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted among undergraduate medical students throughout Indonesia. Socio-demographic and social interaction information, in addition to willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice, were obtained using a self-reported questionnaire. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: Among 4870 participants, 2374 (48.7%) expressed their willingness to volunteer, while only 906 (18.6%) had adequate readiness to practice. Male students, students with prior volunteering experience in health or non-health sectors, and students from public universities or living in Central Indonesia (vs Java) had higher scores of willingness and readiness to volunteer. Students from Sumatra also had better preparedness (odds ratio [OR] 1.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15C2.12, p = 0.004), while the opposite occurred for students from Eastern Indonesia (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.44C0.89, p = 0.002)Cwhen compared to students from Java. In addition, compared to students with high family income, students from lower-middle income families were less willing to volunteer (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.59C0.98, p = 0.034), though those with low family income had better readiness (OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.10C2.08, p = 0.011). Shortage of medical personnel, sense of duty, and solicitation by stakeholders were the main reasons increasing the students willingness to volunteer; whereas contrarily fear for owns health, absence of a cure, and fear of harming patients were the primary factors diminishing their willingness to volunteer. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that many Indonesian medical students are willing to volunteer, yet only few of them were ready to practice, indicating that further preparations are required to maximize their potentials and minimize their exposure to hazards. We suggest that their potentials as a firm support system during the pandemic should not be overlooked, and that the integration of relevant courses to the medical curricula are imperative to prepare for future public health emergencies.","output":"Willingness to volunteer and readiness to practice of undergraduate medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey in Indonesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the guidance from authorities for social distancing and media reporting lead to significant uncertainty in Germany.

Furthermore, treatment of TGEV-infected IPEC-J2 cells with the NF-B-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 resulted in down-regulation of pFcRn expression. Transient transfection of pFcRn promoter luciferase report plasmids with overexpression of NF-B p65 transcription factor enhanced the activation of the luciferase report plasmids. We identified four NF-B transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region of this gene using luciferase reporter system, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electromobility shift assay, and supershift analysis.

A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression.

Stroke was ischemic in 58 (92.1%) patients and hemorrhagic in 5 (7.9%) patients. More than half of all strokes (52.3%) were disabling. By principal management strategy, cerebrovascular events developed in 2.0%, 14.9%, and 1.9% of patients triaged to primary percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting, and medical therapy, respectively (P<0.0001). Cerebrovascular events were independently predicted by older age, creatinine clearance <60 mL/min, treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting, anemia, and diabetes mellitus. Cerebrovascular events were associated with significantly increased rates of 3-year mortality (20.5% versus 6.5%; P<0.0001), as well as reinfarction (14.3% versus 3.8%; P=0.0007), ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (22.8% versus 13.0%; P=0.006), and major bleeding (23.5% versus 8.4%; P<0.0001).

Although we acknowledge the problematic nature of the distinction, we nevertheless recognize its utility in delineating who we are engaging with and what, therefore, we owe them. Traditionally, citizenship, when seen as a role (rather than a status), belongs to the public sphere. We are citizens when we walk into the voting booth, when we attend a ward council meeting, or write to the paper. At home, we might think, we are not citizens but, stripped of our roles in society, we assume the most fundamental roles in our lives-as family and friends-with freedom to pursue and express our interests and desires. It may appear then, that the citizen and the person, or the public and the private, co-exist only insofar as they are understood to be enacted in different spaces, each with their own norms and rules. Drawing upon Christine Hobden's account of citizenship, we challenge this stark divide between the public citizen and private person.

METHODS: Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire using a telephonic interview conducted by two rheumatologists. Rheumatic disease characteristics, knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19, and impacts of pandemic on rheumatology care and patient's compliance were assessed. RESULTS: We included 307 patients in the survey, and rheumatoid arthris was the main rheumatic disease. Patients had mostly moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19, and patients with higher level of education were more likely to have better knowledge. Participants respected mainly recommended preventive measures. The pandemic and sanitary containment impacted strongly the rheumatology care. Over quarter of patients noted worsening of their rheumatic disease, two-thirds reported postponed or canceled medical apointments and more than three quarters postponed their laboratory tests.

Determining which patients should be prioritized is inherently subjective and difficult to assess. The authors have proposed an algorithm to fairly and consistently triage patients and mitigate the risk of adverse outcomes. METHODS: Two separate expert panels, a consensus panel (11 participants) and a validation panel (15 participants), were constructed among international HNC surgeons. Using a modified Delphi process and RAND Corporation/University of California at Los Angeles methodology with 4 consensus rounds and 2 meetings, groupings of high\\\\priority, intermediate\\\\priority, and low\\\\priority indications for surgery were established and subdivided. A point\\\\based scoring algorithm was developed, the Surgical Prioritization and Ranking Tool and Navigation Aid for Head and Neck Cancer (SPARTAN\\\\HN). Agreement was measured during consensus and for algorithm scoring using the Krippendorff alpha. Rankings from the algorithm were compared with expert rankings of 12 case vignettes using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS: A total of 62 indications for surgical priority were rated. Weights for each indication ranged from ?4 to +4 (scale range; ?17 to 20). The response rate for the validation exercise was 100%. The SPARTAN\\\\HN demonstrated excellent agreement and correlation with expert rankings (Krippendorff alpha, .91 [95% CI, 0.88\\\\0.93]; and rho, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.45\\\\0.95]). CONCLUSIONS: The SPARTAN\\\\HN surgical prioritization algorithm consistently stratifies patients requiring HNC surgical care in the COVID\\\\19 era. Formal evaluation and implementation are required. LAY SUMMARY: Many countries have enacted strict rules regarding the use of hospital resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic. Facing delays in surgery, patients may experience worse functional outcomes, stage migration, and eventual inoperability. Treatment prioritization tools have shown benefit in helping to triage patients equitably with minimal provider cognitive burden.

Here, we will consider this question, and the role in this respect of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Emerging evidence suggests that AMPK facilitates central and peripheral reflexes that coordinate breathing and oxygen supply, and contributes to the central regulation of feeding and food choice. We propose, therefore, that oxygen supply to the body is aligned with not only the quantity we eat, but also nutrient-based diet selection, and that the cell-specific expression pattern of AMPK subunit isoforms is critical to appropriate system alignment in this respect. Currently available information on how oxygen supply may be aligned with feeding and food choice, or vice versa, through our motivation to breathe and select particular nutrients is sparse, fragmented and lacks any integrated understanding. By addressing this, we aim to provide the foundations for a clinical perspective that reveals untapped potential, by highlighting how aberrant cell-specific changes in the expression of AMPK subunit isoforms could give rise, in part, to known associations between metabolic disease, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, sleep-disordered breathing, pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"AMPK and the Need to Breathe and Feed: What's the Matter with Oxygen?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep-related breathing disorder characterised by the repeated episodic collapse of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in sleep deprivation, giving rise to apnoeas and hypopnoeas. Based on the severity of OSA, there are two primary treatment modalities, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and mandibular advancement appliances (MAA); both are adherence-dependent. MAA is offered to those with mild to moderate OSA and is prescribed as an alternative to patients intolerable to CPAP. However, adherence to MAA treatment is variable and declines over time. Hence, the current study aims to assess the effectiveness of the stage-matched intervention, the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), on adherence to MAA in patients with OSA. METHODS: A single-centre randomised clinical trial will be undertaken at Barts Health NHS Trust. Fifty-six participants with newly diagnosed OSA are planned to be enrolled in the study and randomised to intervention care (IC) and standardised care (SC) groups. Participants in the SC group will receive routine care whilst participants in the IC group will receive the stage-matched intervention, developed using the HAPA model. Data indicating MAA adherence will be collected both objectively and subjectively, from micro-sensors embedded in the MAA design and sleep diaries, respectively at 3, 6, 18 and 36 months. In addition, a range of questionnaires designed to assess risk perception, outcome expectancy, and self-efficacy (SEMSA) and quality of sleep (PSQI and ESS) and life (EQ-5DL), socio-economic and social support scales will be used. DISCUSSION: The currently available treatments for obstructive sleep apnoea depend entirely on the patients acceptance and use. There are several factors that affect cooperation and wear for example patients awareness of their condition, social support and psychological behaviour. In addition, mood, such as anxiety, stress, and depression, may affect wear. At the same time, we know that interventions involving more education and behaviour approaches can help patients adapt more easily to some treatments. As a result, the present trial aims to explore the potential role of these factors to maximise treatment success and minimise side effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04092660.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22 2020 to Apr 02 2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04C6.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73C5.25) in Hunan.

Nurses have a pivotal role in managing the COVID-19 patients across the globe including Bangladesh. Objective: The study was aimed to assess the level of nurses' knowledge, attitude and practice with regard to readiness for providing nursing care for COVID-19 patients at COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in Dhaka. Method: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. Data were collected from July, to September, 2020 using a self-administered questionnaire. A total of 384 nurses were selected from four corona dedicated hospitals in Dhaka. Nurses' readiness was measured by using paper and pencil questionnaire. Personal and professional characteristics knowledge, attitudes and practice related to COVID-19 questionnaires were used. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent t-test, one way ANOVA and Pearson's Product-Moment Correlation-Coefficient. Results: Findings showed that nurses had moderate level of knowledge (M = 34.34.15, SD = 2.98), attitude (M = 27.58, SD = 3.45) and practice (M = 13.12, SD = 1.78) respectively. A significant negative correlation found between knowledge and attitude (r = -.178, p = .000). However, no significant relationship was to be found between attitude and practice and knowledge and practice regarding nurses' readiness to provide nursing care to COVID-19 patients. Statistical analysis showed that nurses working at Kurmitola General Hospital (F = 9.47, p = .000) had better practice than those of other hospitals. Senior staff nurses did better practice (F = 21.765, p = .000) than those of other nurses. Conclusion: Nurses achieved moderate level of knowledge, attitude and practice.

Host thiol isomerases have been shown to play a role in influenza A virus infection, and we hypothesized that this role involved manipulation of disulfide bonds in HA. Results: Analysis of HA crystal structures revealed that three of the six HA disulfides occur in high-energy conformations and four of the six bonds can exist in unformed states, suggesting that the disulfide landscape of HA is generally strained and the bonds may be labile. We measured the redox state of influenza A virus HA disulfide bonds and their susceptibility to cleavage by vascular thiol isomerases. Using differential cysteine alkylation and mass spectrometry, we show that all six HA disulfide bonds exist in unformed states in a1 in 10 recombinant and viral surface HA molecules. Four of the six H1 and H3 HA bonds are cleaved by the vascular thiol isomerases, thioredoxin and protein disulphide isomerase, in recombinant proteins, which correlated with surface exposure of the disulfides in crystal structures. In contrast, viral surface HA disulfide bonds are impervious to five different vascular thiol isomerases. Innovation: It has been assumed that the disulfide bonds in mature HA protein are intact and inert. We show that all six HA disulfide bonds can exist in unformed states.

We found that the presence of automated accounts infected the debate particularly in the days before the UK national elections, in which we find a steep increase of bots in the discussion; in the days after the election day, their incidence returned to values similar to the ones observed few weeks before the elections. On the other hand, we found that the number of suspended users (i.e. accounts that were removed by the platform for some violation of the Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it reached significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, we observed the injection of a large number of novel bots whose behaviour is markedly different from that of pre-existing ones.

In contrast, a low dose of SARS-CoV-2 via fomites did not result in productive infection in the majority of exposed hamsters and these animals remained non-seroconverted. After recovery, hamsters were re-exposed to hCoV-19/South African/KRISP-K005325/2020 (VOC B.1.351) via an intranasal challenge. Seroconverted rechallenged animals did not lose weight and shed virus for three days. They had a little infectious virus and no pathology in the lungs. In contrast, shedding, weight loss and extensive pulmonary pathology caused by B.1.351 replication were observed in the non-seroconverted animals. The rechallenged seroconverted animals did not transmit the virus to na?ve sentinels via direct contact transmission, in contrast to the non-seroconverted animals. Reinfection with B.1.351 triggered an anamnestic response that boosted not only neutralizing titres against lineage A, but also titres against B.1.351. Our results confirm that aerosol exposure is a more efficient infection route than fomite exposure. Furthermore, initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 lineage A does not prevent heterologous reinfection with B.1.351 but prevents disease and onward transmission.

For instance, subgenomic mRNAs are transcribed directly via transcription intermediates that contain subgenome-length negative-strand templates; however subgenomic mRNA does not appear to be copied directly into negative strands. In our model the subgenome-length negative strands would be derived using the genome as a template. After the polymerase had copied the 3'-end of the genome, it would detach at any one of the several intergenic sequences and reattach to the sequence immediately downstream of the leader sequence at the 5'-end of genome RNA. Base pairing between the 3'-end of the nascent subgenome-length negative strands, which would be complementary to the intergenic sequence at the end of the leader sequence at the 5'-end of genome, would serve to align the nascent negative strand to the genome and permit the completion of synthesis, i.e., discontinuous extension of the 3'-end of the negative strand.

The solution to combat the inflation of false positives is also suggested by Bayesian statistics: intelligently integrating multiple COVID diagnostic tests and symptoms via Bayes' Theorem, an approach conceptually similar to pre-screening for mammograms. This extra information is readily available (e.g olfactory function and fever) and will minimize the economic and emotional costs incurred by false positives while simultaneously improving the information available for policy-makers. In summary, along with the push for universal testing should be an equally rigorous approach to interpreting the test results.","output":"Bayesian, Universal COVID Testing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), studies suggest that the resultant disease (COVID-19) is more severe in individuals with a weakened immune system. Cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) and Natural Killer (NK) cells are required to generate an effective immune response against viruses, functional exhaustion of which enables disease progression. Patients with severe COVID-19 present significantly lower lymphocyte, and higher neutrophil, counts in blood. Specifically, CD8+ lymphocytes and NK cells were significantly reduced in cases of severe infection compared to patients with mild infection and healthy individuals. The NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor transduces inhibitory signalling, suppressing NK cytokine secretion and cytotoxicity. Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8+ and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8+ cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response. Blocking NKG2A on CD8+ cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8+ T and NK cell function. A recently proposed mechanism via which SARS-CoV-2 overrides innate immune response of the host is by over-expressing NKG2A on CD+ T and NK cells, culminating in functional exhaustion of the immune response against the viral pathogen. Monalizumab is an inhibiting antibody against NKG2A which can restore the function of CD8 + T and NK cells in cancers, successfully ceasing tumor progression with no significant side effects in Phase 2 clinical trials. We hypothesize that patients with severe COVID-19 have a severely compromised innate immune response and could be treated via the use of Monalizumab, interferon &#945;, chloroquine, and other antiviral agents.","output":"Innate immunity in COVID-19 patients mediated by NKG2A receptors, and potential treatment using Monalizumab, Cholroquine, and antiviral agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has significantly impacted teaching and learning in higher education, leading institutions to embrace Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in response to school and university closure.

BACKGROUND: The number of women aged  50 years is predicted to increase in the next years in Germany. This coincides with the ageing of primary care specialists providing outpatient care. Whereas delegation of tasks to nurses as a form of interprofessional collaboration has been the target of recent studies, there is no data regarding collaboration amongst physicians in different specialisations working in primary care. We explored collaboration amongst GPs and Gyn regarding the healthcare provision to women aged  50 years. METHODS: A quantitative postal survey was administered to GPs and Gyns in three federal states in Germany, focusing on care provision to women aged  50 years. A total of 4545 physicians, comprising 3514 GPs (67% of the total GP population) randomly selected, and all 1031 Gyns practicing in these states received the postal survey in March 2018. A single reminder was sent in April 2018 with data collection ending in June 2018. Multiple logistic regressions were performed for collaboration, adjusted by age and sex, alongside descriptive methods. FINDINGS: The overall response rate was 31% (1389 respondents): 861 GPs (25%) and 528 Gyns (51%), with the mean respondent age being 54.4 years. Seventy-two per cent were female. Key competencies of collaboration are associated with working in rural federal states and with network participation. Physicians from rural states [odds ratio (OR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2, 1.9] and physicians in networks (OR = 3.0, CI = 2.3, 3.9) were more satisfied with collaboration. Collaboration to deliver services for women aged  50 years is more systematic amongst GPs and Gyns who are members of a network; increased networking could improve collaboration, and ultimately, outcomes too.","output":"Collaboration amongst general practitioners and gynaecologists working in primary health care in Germany: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY A recent study proposed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hijacks the LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition machinery to integrate into the DNA of infected cells.

Overproduction and release of proinflammatory cytokines are the underlying cause of severe COVID-19. Treatment of this condition with JAK inhibitors is a double-edged sword, which might result in the suppression of proinflammatory cytokine storm and the concurrent enhancement of viral infection, since JAK signaling is essential for host antiviral response. Improving the current JAK inhibitor therapy requires a detailed molecular analysis on how SARS-CoV-2 modulates interferon (IFN)-induced activation of JAK-STAT signaling. RESULTS: In this study, we focused on the molecular mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase suppresses IFN signaling. Expression of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 alleviated transcriptional activity driven by type I and type II IFN-responsive enhancer elements. It also prevented nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT2. The suppression of NSP13 on IFN signaling occurred at the step of STAT1 phosphorylation. Nucleic acid binding-defective mutant K345A K347A and NTPase-deficient mutant E375A of NSP13 were found to have largely lost the ability to suppress IFN--induced STAT1 phosphorylation and transcriptional activation, indicating the requirement of the helicase activity for NSP13-mediated inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation. NSP13 did not interact with JAK1 nor prevent STAT1-JAK1 complex formation. Mechanistically, NSP13 interacted with STAT1 to prevent JAK1 kinase from phosphorylating STAT1.

While early cases of the disease were linked to a wet market, human-to-human transmission has driven the rapid spread of the virus throughout China. The Chinese government has implemented containment strategies of city-wide lockdowns, screening at airports and train stations, and isolation of suspected patients; however, the cumulative case count keeps growing every day. The ongoing outbreak presents a challenge for modelers, as limited data are available on the early growth trajectory, and the epidemiological characteristics of the novel coronavirus are yet to be fully elucidated. We use phenomenological models that have been validated during previous outbreaks to generate and assess short-term forecasts of the cumulative number of confirmed reported cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, and for the overall trajectory in China, excluding the province of Hubei. We collect daily reported cumulative confirmed cases for the 2019-nCoV outbreak for each Chinese province from the National Health Commission of China. Here, we provide 5, 10, and 15 day forecasts for five consecutive days, February 5th through February 9th, with quantified uncertainty based on a generalized logistic growth model, the Richards growth model, and a sub-epidemic wave model. Our most recent forecasts reported here, based on data up until February 9, 2020, largely agree across the three models presented and suggest an average range of 7409C7496 additional confirmed cases in Hubei and 1128C1929 additional cases in other provinces within the next five days.

Mean estimates and uncertainty bounds for both Hubei and other provinces have remained relatively stable in the last three reporting dates (February 7th C 9th).

Excess mortality now appears to be associated with working-class citizens across demographic and geographic boundaries, but no known qualitative studies have engaged residents of rural and urban locales with high prevalence of diseases of despair to learn their perspectives. OBJECTIVE: To explore perceptions about despair-related illness and potential intervention strategies among diverse community members residing in discrete rural and urban hotspots. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this qualitative study, high-prevalence hotspots for diseases of despair were identified from health insurance claims data in Central Pennsylvania. Four focus groups were conducted with 60 community members in organizations and coalitions from 3 census block group hotspot clusters in the health system between September 2019 and January 2020. Focus groups explored awareness and beliefs about causation and potential intervention strategies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A descriptive phenomenological approach was applied to thematic analysis, and a preliminary conceptual model was constructed to describe how various factors may be associated with perpetuating despair and with public health. RESULTS: In total, 60 adult community members participated in 4 focus groups (44 women, 16 men; 40 White non-Hispanic, 17 Black, and 3 Hispanic/Latino members). Three focus groups with 43 members were held in rural areas with high prevalence of diseases of despair, and 1 focus group with 17 members in a high-prevalence urban area. Four themes emerged with respect to awareness and believed causation of despair-related illness, and participants identified common associated factors, including financial distress, lack of critical infrastructure and social services, deteriorating sense of community, and family fragmentation. Intervention strategies focused around 2 themes: (1) building resilience to despair through better community and organizational coordination and peer support at the local level and (2) encouraging broader state investments in social services and infrastructure to mitigate despair-related illness. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, rural and urban community members identified common factors associated with diseases of despair, highlighting the association between long-term political and economic decline and public health and a need for both community- and state-level solutions to address despair. Health care systems participating in addressing community health needs may improve processes to screen for despair (eg, social history taking) and codesign primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions aimed at addressing factors associated with distress.

OBJECTIVE To examine literature which evaluates the concomitant use of opioids and rifamycins with clinically-relevant CYP-inducing properties METHODS: A systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria was performed. PubMed, Scopus, and OVID Embase were queried for studies from database inception to January 2020 related to rifamycin and opioid medications. Only full-text, peer-reviewed, English language articles addressing clinical outcomes from concomitant rifamycin and opioid therapy were included. RESULTS The review isolated 12 articles for data extraction from an original 2,260 citations identified. Rifampin (11; 92%) and rifabutin (2; 17%) were the rifamycins studied along with seven different opioids. Decreased effect of opioids with concomitant rifampin therapy manifested as withdrawal in numerous patients on methadone and a decreased analgesic effect from tramadol, morphine, and, most notably, oxycodone. Only the combinations of rifampin with buccal fentanyl and rifabutin with buprenorphine and methadone were found to have no clinically measurable interaction.

The survey evaluated hospital staff emotions, perceived stressors, external factors that reduced stress, personal coping strategies, and motivators for future outbreaks. The participants rated each question for MERS and COVID-19 simultaneously on a scale from 0-3.

The ritual of obsessive hand washing, emotional and physical fatigue, ongoing changes in infection control guidelines, fear of community transmission, and limitations on socialization and travel were the major stressors that were significantly worse during COVID-19 compared to MERS (P<0.05) and led to HCWs adoption of additional 'personal' coping strategies during COVID-19.

However, COVID-19 was a relatively more stressful experience than MERS for HCWs and led to greater personal, behavioral, and protective adaptations by the hospital staff.","output":"From Epidemic to Pandemic: Comparing Hospital Staff Emotional Experience Between MERS and COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose This paper aimed to examine the sources of information and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The COVID-19 pandemic affected at a large level of all social institutions including the healthcare system of the countries. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Pakistan by using an online survey technique. The rationale to opt for this method was based on the country's lockdown situations, social distancing and the care of the respondents. A total of 847 individuals from different parts of the Punjab province participated in the study. An attitudinal scale was administered, which consisted of statements to measure (dis)agreement among the individuals on current situations of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ethical considerations and confidentiality of the respondents were opted by describing the purpose of research on the first page of the questionnaire. Findings The study findings revealed that peer group, signs and symptoms of COVID-19 pandemic and causes and consequences of COVID-19 pandemic had favourable positive effects on the use of PPE by individuals through the mediation of fear of infection during COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the study findings were interpreted as per the effects of current situations of COVID-19 on the sources of information and the use of PPE by individuals.

Searching for diagnostic and prognostic methods that are fast, low-cost and accurate is essential for disease control and patient recovery. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry technique is rapid, low cost and accurate when compared to other MS methods, thus its use is already reported in the literature for various applications, including microorganism identification, diagnosis and prognosis of diseases. Here we developed a prognostic method for COVID-19 using the proteomic profile of saliva samples submitted to MALDI-TOF and machine learning algorithms to train models for COVID-19 severity assessment. We achieved an accuracy of 88.5%, specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 91.5% for classification between mild/moderate and severe conditions. Then, we tested the model performance in an independent dataset, we achieved an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 67.18, 52.17 and 75.60% respectively. Saliva is already reported to have high inter-sample variation; however, our results demonstrates that this approach has the potential to be a prognostic method for COVID-19. Additionally, the technology used is already available in several clinics, facilitating the implementation of the method.

Emerging evidence indicates SIPOs have reduced COVID-19 cases. Using data starting at different dates in March through May 15, 2020, we examine effects of SIPOs on daily growth rates of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations using event study models. We find that SIPOs reduced the daily mortality growth rate after nearly three weeks from enactment, and the daily growth rate of hospitalizations two weeks after enactment. After 42 days from enactment, the daily mortality growth rate declined by up to 6.1 percentage points. Projections suggest as many as 250,000-370,000 deaths possibly averted by May 15 in the 42 states plus the District of Columbia with statewide SIPOs. The daily hospitalization growth rate examined in 19 states with SIPOs and 3 states without SIPOs with data on hospitalizations has declined by up to 8.4 percentage points after 42 days.

Most are B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We present an unusual case of classic Hodgkin lymphoma presenting as goiter in an adolescent female. A 15 year old female presented with a painless, firm goiter associated with vocal hoarseness. Fever, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats were absent. Examination demonstrated diffuse thyroid enlargement and tissue firmness, especially in the right lobe. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes, including supraclavicular, were palpated. The patient was clinically and biochemically euthyroid at presentation. Ultrasound demonstrated a 6.8 by 2.5 cm mass predominantly in the right lobe with extension into the isthmus and left lobe. The mass was mostly solid and hypoechoic with some cystic areas and calcifications. Multiple enlarged lymph nodes with cortical hypertrophy and calcifications were identified raising suspicion for metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a suspected metastatic lymph node demonstrated atypical B-cell proliferation which stained diffusely positive for CD20, and negative for antigens associated with PTC (BRAF, PAX8, TTF, and cytokeratin AE1,3). Excision of an axillary lymph node was required for definitive diagnosis. Histology showed predominantly small lymphocytes with few interspersed large atypical cells with prominent nucleoli (Reed-Sternberg cells), traversed by paucicellular fibrosclerotic septae imparting a nodular pattern. Final diagnosis was classic Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosing subtype, stage IIA. She initiated therapy with ABVE-PC (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone, and cyclophosphamide) and had excellent response. She was changed to doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine to reduce toxicities, omitting bleomycin to reduce pulmonary risks in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. Eleven months after therapy completion, she has no evidence of disease. She did not require thyroid surgery or radiotherapy. While PTC is strongly suspected with this presentation, lymphoma should be a diagnostic consideration in patients with a thyroid mass. In this case, FNA was valuable in raising the possibility of a lymphoproliferative disorder, which led to excisional lymph node biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Initiation of chemotherapy in this chemo-sensitive tumor averted unnecessary thyroid surgery and extensive lymph node dissection.","output":"Thyroid mass as the presenting sign of hodgkin lymphoma in an adolescent"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: High-quality phenotype definitions are desirable to enable the extraction of patient cohorts from large electronic health record repositories and are characterized by properties such as portability, reproducibility, and validity. Phenotype libraries, where definitions are stored, have the potential to contribute significantly to the quality of the definitions they host. In this work, we present a set of desiderata for the design of a next-generation phenotype library that is able to ensure the quality of hosted definitions by combining the functionality currently offered by disparate tooling. METHODS: A group of researchers examined work to date on phenotype models, implementation, and validation, as well as contemporary phenotype libraries developed as a part of their own phenomics communities. Existing phenotype frameworks were also examined. This work was translated and refined by all the authors into a set of best practices. RESULTS: We present 14 library desiderata that promote high-quality phenotype definitions, in the areas of modelling, logging, validation, and sharing and warehousing. CONCLUSIONS: There are a number of choices to be made when constructing phenotype libraries. Our considerations distil the best practices in the field and include pointers towards their further development to support portable, reproducible, and clinically valid phenotype design.

Similar to SARS-CoV that was related to a bat-borne coronavirus, this new virus originated from Rhinolophus affinis bats. Because bats usually transmit their coronaviruses to intermediate animal hosts that in turn represent a source of virus able to cross the species barrier to finally infect humans, the identification of an intermediate animal reservoir was recently the subject of intense researches. At the very beginning it was claimed that a reptile ( Ophiophagus hannah ) was the intermediate host. This hypothesis was quickly eliminated to be replaced by the pangolin ( Manis javanica ) hypothesis. Yet, several other animal species were recently reported as possible intermediate hosts in between bats and humans. To determine which intermediate animal host could have infected the index case patient with SARS-CoV-2, we used multi-sequence alignment, 3-D structure analysis and electrostatic potential surface generation of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented an immediate-read screening mammography program to reduce patient visits and decrease time to diagnostic imaging. Objective: To measure the impact of an immediate-read screening program, with focus on disparities in sameday diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. Methods: In May 2020, we implemented an immediate-read screening program whereby a dedicated breast imaging radiologist interprets all screening mammograms in real-time; patients receive results before discharge, and efforts are made to perform any recommended diagnostic imaging during the visit (performed by different radiologists). We retrospectively identified screening mammograms performed from 6/1/2019-10/31/2019 (pre-implementation) or 6/1/2020-10/31/2020 (post-implementation). Patient characteristics were recorded from the electronic medical record. Multivariable logistic regression models incorporating patient age, race and ethnicity, language, and insurance type were estimated to identify factors associated with same-day diagnostic imaging. Screening metrics were compared between periods. Results: A total of 8,222 pre-implementation and 7,235 post-implementation screening examinations were included; 521 and 359 patients had abnormal screening examinations, respectively. A total of 14.8% and 60.7% of patients, respectively, had same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms. Pre-implementation, patients with other races had significantly lower odds than White patients of same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening examinations (adjusted odds ratio: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.86; p=.03). Post-implementation, odds of same-day diagnostic imaging was not significantly different between patients with other races and White patients (adjusted odds ratio: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.71; p=.80). Post-implementation, patients with and without same-day diagnostic imaging after abnormal screening mammograms showed no significant difference in race and ethnicity (p>.05). Abnormal interpretation rate was significantly lower post-implementation than pre-implementation (5.0% vs 6.3%, respectively; p<.001).

Heart rate (HR) has been used as a safety variable in the evaluation of the results of interventions in patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation. The aim of this research was to analyse HR during a pulmonary rehabilitation program in post-severe COVID-19 patients who survived mechanical ventilation (MV). The study includes the initial and final evaluations and aerobic training sessions. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients (58  13 years, 11 men) were trained for 8 weeks. A 6-minute walk test (6 MWT) was performed and, subsequently, a supervised and individualised training plan was created. Resting heart rate (RHR), heart rate recovery (HRR), heart rate at minute 6 (HR6 min) and the product of HR6 min and systolic blood pressure (HR6 min(x)SBP) were measured at 6 MWT. In addition, HR was measured at each training session. Results: After 8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation, patients decreased their RHR from 81.95  9.36 to 73.60  9.82 beats/min (p < 0.001) and significantly increased their HRR from 12.45  10.22 to 20.55  7.33 beats/min (p = 0.005). HR6 min presented a significant relationship with walking speed and walked distance after the pulmonary rehabilitation period (r = 0.555, p = 0.011 and r = 0.613, p = 0.011, respectively). HR6 min(x)SBP presented a significant relationship with walking speed and walked distance after training (r = 0.538, p = 0.014 and r = 0.568, p = 0.008, respectively).

This increase is partly explained by changes in food processing and consumption patterns that lead to the worldwide availability of high-risk food. As a result, vast outbreaks may occur due to contamination of food by a single foodhandler or at a single source. Although there are numerous fecalCorally transmitted viruses, most reports of foodborne transmission describe infections with Norwalk-like caliciviruses (NLV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), suggesting that these viruses are associated with the greatest risk of foodborne transmission. NLV and HAV can be transmitted from person to person, or indirectly via food, water, or fomites contaminated with virus-containing feces or vomit. People can be infected without showing symptoms. The high frequency of secondary cases of NLV illness and C to a lesser extent C of hepatitis A following a foodborne outbreak results in amplification of the problem. The burden of illness is highest in the elderly, and therefore is likely to increase due to the aging population. For HAV, the burden of illness may increase following hygienic control measures, due to a decreasing population of naturally immune individuals and a concurrent increase in the population at risk. Recent advances in the research of NLV and HAV have led to the development of molecular methods which can be used for molecular tracing of virus strains. These methods can be and have been used for the detection of common source outbreaks. While traditionally certain foods have been implicated in virus outbreaks, it is clear that almost any food item can be involved, provided it has been handled by an infected person. There are no established methods for detection of viruses in foods other than shellfish. Little information is available on disinfection and preventive measures specifically for these viruses. Studies addressing this issue are hampered by the lack of culture systems. As currently available routine monitoring systems exclusively focus on bacterial pathogens, efforts should be made to combine epidemiological and virological information for a combined laboratory-based rapid detection system for foodborne viruses.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed computerized records of patients who visited the pediatric dental clinic at three different periods: pre-lockdown period, lockdown period, and post-lockdown period. Results: Nine-hundred and forty-nine children were included in the study; most of them were healthy children between 3 and 6 years old. During lockdown, all scheduled appointments except for treatments under general anesthesia and deep sedation were canceled due to the government's restrictions; the frequency of treatments with non-pharmacological behavior management, general anesthesia or deep sedation was higher than in the previous or subsequent periods and the use of inhaled/conscious sedation was significantly lower. During lockdown most of the children were diagnosed with dentoalveolar abscess (32.3%), compared to 14 and 21% at the previous or subsequent periods, respectively (P < 0.001).

Abortion-seekers faced barriers including: (i) burden of taboo, (ii) vulnerability (emotional, financial, and social), (iii) health professional evaluation and (iv) disempowerment and distress. The overarching theme was womens lack of autonomy in access to abortion care. The key barriers to abortion access in the Netherlands are the institutionalisation of taboo in abortion law and care, complex candidacy regulations, lack of permeability for certain marginalised groups, and womens inability to speak openly about abortion. To increase the permeability of abortion care, and thereby womens autonomy, legislators and policy-makers must trust women to make their own reproductive decisions and avoid actions that stigmatise abortion and hinder access to care, while actively developing systemic support for vulnerable groups.","output":"Permeability of abortion care in the Netherlands: a qualitative analysis of womens experiences, health professional perspectives, and the internet resource of Women on Web"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has been the subject of intense investigation. Early sequence analysis identified a unique 13 amino acid region (13-mer) nested within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein that directly interacts with the ACE2 receptor. Blasting with the 13-mer identified a highly conserved segment in propyl-tRNA synthetase enzymes. Comparison with the human analogue, glutamyl-propyl-tRNA synthetase 1, showed a high level of identity with its drug binding domain, which is targeted by halofuginone, a drug recently shown to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. In silico experiments predicted a high affinity interaction between halofuginone and the 13-mer. In vitro addition of halofuginone effectively inhibited binding of recombinant S1 monomer to ACE2. Accordingly, it appears that halofuginone inhibits viral infection by preventing correct interactions between spike protein and ACE2. These findings indicate that viral entry can potentially be drug-targeted and support the application of halofuginone in mitigation of COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 13-mer subdomain corresponds to the drug-binding domain of glutamyl-propyl-tRNA synthetase 1 and is targetable by halofuginone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Surveillance practices, both state and non-state in origin, are deployed increasingly to solve social problems beyond the traditional domains of criminal justice and national security, including public health concerns.

This study aimed to evaluate the association between the elapsed time from emergency department (ED) visit to emergency neurosurgery and clinical outcomes in patients with spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke. METHODS: A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted using the nationwide emergency database in Korea. Spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke patients who received neurosurgery within 12 hours of ED visit between January 2018 and December 2019 were enrolled. The main exposure was time to neurosurgery and the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted. RESULTS: Among 2,602 study populations (incidence rate: 2.5 per 100,000 person-years, 15.8% of SAH, 78.6% of ICH, and 5.6% of mixed type), 525 (20.2%) patients received surgery in the ultra-early (0C2 hours) group, 1,093 (42.0%) in the early (2C4 hours) group, and 984 (37.8%) in the late (4C12 hours) group. The early group showed better survival outcomes than the ultra-early and late group (in-hospital mortality 22.2% vs. 26.5% and 26.1%, p = 0.06).

Mortality from HFRS varies between hantaviruses; Hantaan and Dobrava show the highest, Seoul intermediate, and Puumala low mortality. Saaremaa, genetically closely related to Dobrava, is also known to induce HFRS, with low or no mortality. In this study, mice were inoculated with Dobrava and Saaremaa viruses to test for infectibility, lethality, viremia, nitric oxide production and antibody responses. Out of suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500 and 5000 focus-forming units of Dobrava virus, respectively, 1/8, 2/8 and 7/8 died within 18C26 days. In all but one of the lethally infected mice high levels of replicating virus were detected, and most were positive for neutralizing antibodies and showed elevated levels of nitric oxide production. All suckling mice intracerebrally inoculated with 50, 500, or 5000 focus-forming units of Saaremaa virus survived and all seroconverted. Clearly lower viral titers were observed for the Saaremaa virus-inoculated mice, also when sacrificed at day 18 after infection, compared to those in mice that died following Dobrava virus infection. Dobrava, Saaremaa, Puumala and Hantaan virus infections of adult mice were asymptomatic, and the anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG2a/IgG1-titer ratio was higher in mice inoculated with Dobrava virus than in those inoculated with Saaremaa virus. Elevated nitric oxide production was not detected in asymptomatically infected mice, and iNOS?/? mice, like normal mice, cleared viremia.

AIM: The aim of this study was to analyze the role of various hematological and immunological parameters in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis was performed on 300 patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction analysis. All participants of the study were divided into C (a) Group I: patients with mild symptoms and normal chest radiographic findings; (b) patients with moderate disease presenting with fever and cough along with other respiratory symptoms, and (c) patients suffering from severe disease. Data collection was done from all patients at the time of hospital admission for hematological and immunological parameters C (a) total leukocyte count, (b) lymphocyte count, (c) lymphocytic subset count, (d) lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, (e) D-dimer, (f) C-reactive protein (CRP), and (g) ferritin levels. SPSS 22.0 software was used for determining P values by independent t-test and Chi-square test. RESULTS: The median age was 65 years (interquartile range C57C71 years). While comparing white blood cell and lymphocyte counts, extremely significant P values were obtained. D-dimers and ferritin levels demonstrated extremely significant P values while both LDH and CRPs showed statistical significance. Correlation of lymphocytic subsets showed extreme significance in total lymphocyte counts in mild-to-moderate as compared to severely infected patients while both CD4+ and CD8+ counts demonstrated statistical significance in mild-moderate infected cases.

Although behavioural evidence suggests that agents' motor plans might be related to collective goals, direct neurophysiological evidence of whether collective goals are motorically represented is still scarce. The aim of the present transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study is to begin to fill this gap. A participant and a confederate were asked to sequentially perform a two-choice reaction time task by acting on pressure sensors. In their own turn, they saw a cue indicating whether to lift their fingers from (or to press them on) a pressure sensor to shoot a ball across the screen as fast as possible. The confederate responded with the right hand, the participant with the left hand. While the confederate acted on the sensor, the participant's motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from the right Extensor Carpi Ulnaris. If participants represent their own and the confederate's actions as being directed to a collective goal, MEPs amplitude should be modulated according to the action the confederate should perform. To test this conjecture, we contrasted three conditions: a Joint condition, in which both players worked together with their collective goal being to shoot the ball to get it to a common target, a Parallel condition, in which the players performed exactly the same task but received independent outcomes for their performance, and a Competitive condition, in which the outcome of the game still depended on the other player performance, but without the collective goal feature. Results showed no MEPs modulation according to the confederate's action in the Joint condition. Post-hoc exploratory analyses both provide some hints about this negative finding and also suggest possible improvements (i.e., adopting a different dependent variable, avoiding task-switching between conditions) for testing our hypothesis that collective goal can be represented motorically.","output":"Sharing motor plans while acting jointly: A TMS study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The structure of the X (or ADRP) domain of a pathogenic variant of feline coronavirus (FCoV) has been determined in tetragonal and cubic crystal forms to 3.1 and 2.2 ? resolution, respectively.

Previous studies suggest such delays result in more late-stage breast cancer diagnoses. We hypothesized that this impact would vary between institutions depending on regional variations in shutdown periods and the ability and willingness of patients to resume screening. Methods: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancers from 2016-2020 were identified using the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and the Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) cancer registries. Rates of mammography were ascertained from billing data. Baseline patient characteristics, demographics, and clinical information were gathered and cross-referenced with the electronic medical record. Late-stage was defined as Anatomic Stage III-IV disease (AJCC 8th edition). Chi-squared analysis was used to examine monthly distributions in stage at presentation for diagnosis in 2016-2019 compared to in 2020 at each institution. Results: There were 5907 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between 2016-2019 (1597 at BIDMC and 4310 at DUMC) and 1075 in 2020 (333 and 742, respectively). Mammography was limited from 3/16/20-6/8/20 at BIDMC and from 3/16/20-4/20/20 Sa t DUMC. There were fewer SM at each institution during their respective shutdown periods in 2020 than in the same months in 2019: BIDMC 1713 versus 8566 (80% reduction) and at DUMC 1649 versus 5698 (71% reduction). Following the pandemic shutdown, SM volume increased in July-December 2020 compared to July-December 2019 (108% at BIDMC and 116% at DUMC). The proportion of patients diagnosed with late-stage disease at BIDMC was greater in 2020 than in 2016-2019, at 12.6% and 6.6%, respectively (p < 0.001);86% of late-stage diagnoses and 68% of all diagnoses in 2020 at BIDMC occurred from July-December following the initial shutdown period. The proportion of patients diagnosed with late-stage disease at DUMC in these two cohorts were 14.3% in 2020 and 16.2%% in 2016-2019 (p = 0.1);50% of late-stage diagnoses and 51% of all diagnoses in 2020 at DUMC occurred in the period following the initial shutdown from July-December. Conclusion: We identified variation between two large academic medical centers in the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic shutdown on the proportion of late-stage breast cancer diagnoses. These dissimilar outcomes may be the result of differences in referral patterns as well as regional differences in the approach to SM during the pandemic. In particular, a shorter closure time and substantial increase in SM volume following the initial shutdown period in the Southeast region may have prevented an increase in late-stage diagnoses. Further information and analysis may help suggest additional strategies to minimize adverse effects of reduced cancer screening in future public-health emergencies.","output":"Multi-institutional perspective on screening mammography and breast cancer stage at diagnosis during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Parents in the Arab population of Israel are known to be pro-vaccination and vaccinate their children at higher rates than the Jewish population, specifically against human papilloma virus (HPV) and seasonal influenza. OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to identify and compare variables associated with mothers uptake of two vaccinations, influenza and HPV, among different subgroups in Arab and Jewish society in Israel. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of the entire spectrum of the Israeli population was conducted using a stratified sample of Jewish mothers (n = 159) and Arab mothers (n = 534) from different subgroups: Muslim, Christian, Druse and Northern Bedouins. From March 30, 2019 through October 20, 2019, questionnaires were distributed manually to eighth grade pupils (13C14 years old) who had younger siblings in second (7C8 years old) or third (8C9 years old) grades. RESULTS: Arab mothers exhibited a higher rate of uptake for both vaccinations (p < .0001, HPV C 90%; influenza C 62%) than Jewish mothers (p = 0.0014, HPV C 46%; influenza C 34%). Furthermore, results showed that HPV vaccination uptake is significantly higher than seasonal influenza vaccination uptake in both populations. Examination of the different ethnic subgroups revealed differences in vaccination uptake. For both vaccinations, the Northern Bedouins exhibited the highest uptake rate of all the Arab subgroups (74%), followed by the Druse (74%) and Muslim groups (60%). The Christian Arab group exhibited the lowest uptake rate (46%). Moreover, the uptake rate among secular Jewish mothers was lower than in any of the Arab groups (38%), though higher than among religious/traditional Jewish mothers, who exhibited the lowest uptake rate (26%). A comparison of the variables associated with mothers vaccination uptake revealed differences between the ethnic subgroups. Moreover, the findings of the multiple logistic regression revealed the following to be the most significant factors in Arab mothers intake of both vaccinations: school-located vaccination and mothers perceived risk and perceived trust in the system and in the family physician. These variables are manifested differently in the different ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows that all Arabs cannot be lumped together as one monolithic group in that they exhibit major differences according to religion, education and access to information. Ranking of variables associated with uptake of the two vaccines can provide decision-makers an empirical basis for tailoring appropriate and specific interventions to each subgroup to achieve the highest vaccine uptake rate possible.

CIM is a byproduct of critical care, attributed to impaired recovery, long-term complications, and mortality. CIM pathophysiology is complex, heterogeneous and remains incompletely understood, however loss of mechanical stimuli contributes to critical illness associated muscle atrophy and weakness. Passive mechanical loading (ML) and electrical stimulation (ES) therapies augment muscle mass and function. While having beneficial outcomes, the mechanistic underpinning of these therapies is less known. Therefore, here we aimed to assess the mechanism by which chronic supramaximal ES ameliorates CIM in a unique experimental rat model of critical care. Methods Rats were subjected to 8 days critical care conditions entailing deep sedation, controlled mechanical ventilation, and immobilization with and without direct soleus ES. Muscle size and function were assessed at the single cell level. RNAseq and Western blotting were employed to understand the mechanisms driving ES muscle outcomes in CIM. Results Following 8 days of controlled mechanical ventilation and immobilization, soleus muscle mass, Myosin:Actin ratio and single muscle fiber maximum force normalized to cross-sectional area (specific force) were reduced by 40-50% (p< 0.0001). ES significantly reduced the loss of soleus muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and Myosin:Actin ratio by approximately 30% (p< 0.05) yet failed to effect specific force. RNAseq pathway analysis revealed downregulation of insulin signaling in the soleus muscle following critical care and GLUT4 trafficking was reduced by 55% leading to an 85% reduction of muscle glycogen content (p< 0.01). ES promoted phosphofructokinase and insulin signaling pathways to control levels (p< 0.05), consistent with the maintenance of GLUT4 translocation and glycogen levels. AMPK, but not AKT, signaling pathway was stimulated following ES, where the downstream target TBC1D4 increased 3 logFC (p= 0.029) and AMPK-specific P-TBC1D4 levels were increased approximately 2-fold (p= 0.06). Reduction of muscle protein degradation rather than protein synthesis promoted soleus CSA, as ES reduced E3 ubiquitin proteins, Atrogin-1 (p= 0.006) and MuRF1 (p= 0.08) by approximately 50%, downstream of AMPK-FoxO3. Conclusions ES maintained GLUT4 translocation through increased AMPK-TBC1D4 signaling leading to improved muscle glucose homeostasis. Soleus CSA and myosin content was promoted through reduced protein degradation via AMPK-FoxO3 E3 ligases, Atrogin-1 and MuRF1.

In this review, the authors discuss up-to-date advances in immune-based therapy for COVID-19. The use of convalescent plasma therapy as the first line of defense to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been established, with encouraging results.

Considering the counterproductive antibody-dependent enhancement of the virus, mAbs therapy that is safe and efficacious, even in people with underlying conditions, will be a significant breakthrough. In addition, emerging immunotherapeutic interventions using nanobodies and cellular immunotherapy are promising avenues for tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.

To apply the technology, either the quarantine authorities should provide the location history COVID-19 patients, or all people should provide their own location history. This inevitably makes people either the patient location history or personal location history of the public, leading to the privacy protection issue of information release for the public good against privacy exposure risks. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing system without exposing the location information between the user and the quarantine authorities with COVID-19 patient location history. METHODS: We propose a new protocol called PRivacy Oriented Technique for Epidemic Contact Tracing (PROTECT) that securely shares the location information of patients with users by using the Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) homomorphic encryption scheme, along with a new secure proximity computation method for it. RESULTS: We have developed a mobile application for the end-user and a web service for the quarantine authorities by applying the proposed method and have verified their effectiveness. Proposed application and web service compute the existence of intersections between the encrypted location history of COVID-19 patients released by the quarantine authorities and the user location history saved on the local device. We also show that the developed contact tracing application can identify whether the user is in contact with patients within a reasonable time on smartphones. CONCLUSIONS: The developed method that shares the location information encrypted with homomorphic encryption is a new method for contact tracing without exposing the location information of the COVID-19 patients and the users. Homomorphic encryption is difficult to apply to practical issues despite its high security value.

Potential adaptations of community-based services for older adults and their caregivers include remote service liaisons and need assessment of caregiver dyads to assure access to home-based personal assistance services and nutrition support for those at greatest risk of negative consequences during emergency service lapses.","output":"Caregiving and COVID-19: Perspectives from a Care Coach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With the effective treatments of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thousands of patients have recovered from COVID-19 globally. The public perceptions and views are vital to facilitate recovered COVID-19 patients reintegrate into society. In China, the rural population accounts for nearly 70% of the total population. Therefore, we chose to evaluate perceptions and views of rural residents towards COVID-19 recovered patients in China. METHODS: Fifteen participants were sampled from a village with the severe COVID-19 epidemic in Zibo city, Shandong Province. The fifteen participants who lived in the village with COVID-19 recovered patients were included. They were over 18 years of age and were voluntary to participant in the study. A descriptive qualitative design using semi-structured telephone interviews was undertaken. Thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged from the data: (1) Perceived personal characteristics of COVID-19 recovered patients; (2) Perceived difficulties faced by COVID-19 recovered patients; (3) Perceptions on the social relationship with COVID-19 recovered patients; (4) Views on COVID-19 recovered patients going to public venues; (5) Views on helping COVID-19 recovered patients. Each theme was supported by several subthemes. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that discrimination and reduced social intimacy exist among rural residents. To improve their views or the situation, relevant departments could lead health educational programs and encourage supportive social connections. Through these strategic messaging, rural residents are expected to recognize that COVID-19 recovered patients need more social support, rather than discrimination and resistance, which helps recovered patients better return to society.","output":"The Perceptions and Views of Rural Residents Towards COVID-19 Recovered Patients in China: A Descriptive Qualitative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The recent spread of new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic which caused worldwide concern is a public health emergency situation The risk of getting infected as well as the concern levels of the health professionals on this issue is very high due to their close contact with the infected patients The aim of this study is to evaluate the concern level of being infected in the health professionals, as well as their view and perception of different applications used during the treatment of the COVID-19 cases together with their whole approach during this pandemic situation : Methods: The study was conducted through an online survey that was sent to all the Health professionals of a pandemic hospital of a city in Turkey between 8 and 15 May 2020 This online survey was sent to all the professionals through social media platforms The survey included both multiple-choice and true-false questions regarding COVID-19 diagnosis, clinical stage, treatment approach, concerns, knowledge, and awareness of the situation together with some social demographic characteristics of the health professionals SPSS v20 program was used to evaluate the statistical analysis of the data collected Data are shown through mean +or- and the standard deviation is shown through percentage : Results: The study consisted of 250 (59 9%) doctors and 169 (41 1%) assistant healthcare professionals and the average age of the participants was 33 21+or-6 88 years Seventy-six (18 1%) of 128 people who smoked during the pandemic wanted to quit smoking 390 (93 1%) of the participants thought that they were in a high-risk group of being infected and were concerned about this matter One hundred nine (26 01%) of the participants had positive COVID-19 tests of their relatives or friends Sixty-four (15 3%) participants claimed to have a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and 3 (0 7%) of them reported that their COVID-19 PCR tests were positive Eighty-four (20 04%) stated that they used Hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis : Conclusion: The healthcare professionals working in the pandemic hospital during the pandemic stated that they generally had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 and believed that our country would be successful with its fight against this pandemic Moreover, our study proved the importance of knowledge levels in fighting communicable diseases","output":"The evaluation of the health care professionals' knowledge, prevention and the perceptions on the treatment of new coronavirus (COVID-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation plays an important role in the response to danger signals arising from damage to our body and in restoring homeostasis. Dysregulated inflammatory responses occur in many diseases, including cancer, sepsis and autoimmunity. The efficacy of anti-inflammatory drugs, developed for the treatment of dysregulated inflammation, can be potentiated using biomaterials, by improving the bioavailability of drugs and by reducing side effects. In this Review, we first outline key elements and stages of the inflammatory environment and then discuss the design of biomaterials for different anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies. Biomaterials can be engineered to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and cell-free DNA, in the early stages of inflammation. Materials can also be designed to prevent adhesive interactions of leukocytes and endothelial cells that initiate inflammatory responses. Furthermore, nanoscale platforms can deliver anti-inflammatory agents to inflammation sites.

STUDY DESIGN: We used conditional logistic regression clustered by hospital and generalized estimating equations to compare the odds of unplanned all-cause 30-day readmission between Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Medicare Advantage (MA). DATA COLLECTION: Wisconsin Health Information Organization collects claims data from various payers including private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, twice a year. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For 62 of 66 hospitals, hospital-level readmission rates for MA were lower than those for Medicare FFS. The odds of 30-day readmission in MA were 0.92 times lower than Medicare FFS within the same hospital (odds ratio, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89-0.98). The adjusted overall readmission rates of Medicare FFS and MA were 14.9 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings provide additional evidence of potential variations in readmission risk by payer and support the need for improved monitoring systems in hospitals that incorporate payer-specific data. Further research is needed to delineate specific care delivery factors that contribute to differential readmission risk by payer source.","output":"Likelihood of hospital readmission in Medicare Advantage and Fee-For-Service within same hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The battery life (BL) of portable home ventilator batteries is reported by manufacturers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ventilator mode, breathing frequency, PEEP, and leaks on the BL of 5 commercially available portable ventilators. METHODS The effects of the ventilator mode (volume controlled-continuous mandatory ventilation [VC-CMV] vs pressure support ventilation [PSV]), PEEP 5 cm H2O, breathing frequency (10, 15, and 20 breaths/min), and leaks during both volume-targeted ventilation and PSV on the BL of 5 ventilators (Elise 150, Monnal T50, PB560, Vivo 50, and Trilogy 100) were evaluated. Each ventilator was ventilated with a test lung at a tidal volume of 700 ml and an inspiratory time of 1.2 s in the absence of leaks. RESULTS Switching from PSV to VC-CMV or the addition of PEEP did not significantly change ventilator BL. The increase in breathing frequency from 10 to 20 breaths/min decreased the BL by 18  11% (P = .005). Leaks were associated with an increase in BL during the VC-CMV mode (18  20%, P = .04) but a decrease in BL during the PSV mode (-13  15%, P = .04). CONCLUSIONS The BL of home ventilators depends on the ventilator settings. BL is not affected by the ventilator mode (VC-CMV or PSV) or the addition of PEEP. BL decreases with an increase in breathing frequency and during leaks with a PSV mode, whereas leaks increase the duration of ventilator BL during VC-CMV.","output":"Battery life of portable home ventilators: effects of ventilator settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The task for cognitive scientists has recently become the development of computable models that can replicate the process of human cognition, both at the individual and at the aggregate level.

This inequity may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Compare health care utilization, EOL, and palliative care outcomes between COVID-19 decedents with and without LEP during the pandemic's first wave in Massachusetts. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of adult inpatients who died from COVID-19 between February 18, 2020 and May 18, 2020 at two academic and four community hospitals within a greater Boston health care system. We performed multivariable regression adjusting for patient sociodemographic variables and hospital characteristics. Primary outcome was place of death (intensive care unit [ICU] vs. non-ICU). Secondary outcomes included hospital and ICU length of stay and time to initial palliative care consultation. Results: Among 337 patients, 89 (26.4%) had LEP and 248 (73.6%) were English proficient. Patients with LEP were less often white (24 [27.0%] vs. 193 [77.8%]; p < 0.001); were more often Hispanic or Latinx (40 [45.0%] vs. 13 [5.2%]; p < 0.001); and less often had a medical order for life-sustaining treatment (MOLST) on admission (15 [16.9%] vs. 120 [48.4%]; p < 0.001) versus patients with English proficiency. In the multivariable analyses, LEP was not independently associated with ICU death, ICU length of stay, or time to palliative care consultation, but was independently associated with increased hospital length of stay (mean difference 4.12 days; 95% CI, 1.72-6.53; p < 0.001).

This paper outlines the evaluation of the telesimulation component of a programme that was designed as a solution to COVID-19 restriction. Methods: A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate the telesimulation educational activities. Via a post-course online survey student were asked to rate the pre-simulation preparation, level of engagement, confidence in recognising and responding to the four clinical presentations and to evaluate telesimulation as a tool to prepare for working in the clinical environment. Students responded to open-ended questions describing their experience in greater depth. Results: Forty-two (72.4%) out of 58 students responded. 97.62% agreed that participating in the simulation was interesting and useful and 90.48% felt that this will provide a good grounding prior to clinical work. Four key themes were identified: Fidelity, Realism, Engagement and Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes Outcomes. Limitations of telesimulation included the inability to examine patients, perform procedures and experience non-verbal cues of team members and patients;but this emphasised importance of non-verbal cues and close looped communication. Additionally, designing the telesimulation according to defined objectives and scheduling it after the theory teaching contributed to successful execution. Conclusion: Telesimulation is an effective alternative when in-person teaching is not possible and if used correctly, can sharpen non-tactile aspects of clinical care such as history taking, executing treatment algorithms and team communication.

While China and Singapore have successfully led the effort, more and more countries are now implementing such surveillance systems, raising potential privacy concerns about this long term surveillance. For example, it is not clear what happens to the information post-pandemic because people are more likely to share their information during a global crisis without governments having to elaborate on their data policies.

OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom. METHODS: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches. RESULTS: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology.

However, it causes human as well as animal toxicities. In this study, we aimed to ascertain the toxic constituents in Rhizoma Coptidis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The acute toxicity of both the total extract and the alkaloid-rich extract of Rhizoma Coptidis were tested in mice. The dose related tissue concentration of the Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids in mice was determined using high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The influence of phenobarbital sodium [a non-selective hepatic enzyme (P450) inducer] on the acute toxicity of Rhizoma Coptidis as well as the tissue concentration of the alkaloids was investigated. The cytotoxicity of the Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids was tested in six cell lines using the MTT assay. RESULTS The median acute oral lethal dose of the total extract of Rhizoma Coptidis was 2.95g/kg in mice. The alkaloid-rich extract was much more toxic than the total extract of Rhizoma Coptidis. Four Rhizoma Coptidis alkaloids were detected in brain, heart, and lung tissues of mice that received the oral total extract of Rhizoma Coptidis. Tissue concentration increased nonlinearly with higher doses. Phenobarbital sodium decreased the tissue concentration of every alkaloid as well as the toxicity of Rhizoma Coptidis.

Therefore, by analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of axiomatic design (AD) and Tteoriya Resheniya Izoblateskikh Zadatch (TRIZ), an innovative design method integrating AD and TRIZ was proposed for different design types, such as breakthrough design, adaptive design and variable parameter design. Firstly, the function requirements of the product were analyzed to determine its design type, and the function requirements was decomposed by the AD theory, and the function-structure tree was constructed by the TRIZ. Then, the coupling judgment of the initial design scheme was carried out, and the TRIZ was used to decouple. After several iterations, the final design scheme was obtained. Taking the public interactive control panel and the enclosed car of the traditional box elevator as the research object, facing the function requirements of preventing virus transmission and eliminating virus, the innovative design method integrating AD and TRIZ was adopted to design the epidemic prevention function module of the box elevator, and the non-public contact interactive control module and the conditional disinfection and sterilization module for the traditional box elevator were designed. The innovative design example made a beneficial attempt to expand from the traditional mechanical structure design to the new human-computer interaction mode design, which verified the feasibility of the innovative design method integrating AD and TRIZ.

As a nucleoside analogue prodrug, RDV undergoes intracellular multistep activation to form its pharmacologically active species, GS-443902, which is not detectable in the plasma. A question arises that whether the observed plasma exposure of RDV and its metabolites would correlate with or be informative about the exposure of GS-443902 in tissues. A whole body PBPK modeling and simulation approach was utilized to elucidate the disposition mechanism of RDV and its metabolites in the lung and liver and explore the relationship between plasma and tissue PK of RDV and its metabolites in healthy subjects. In addition, the potential alteration of plasma and tissue PK of RDV and its metabolites in patients with organ dysfunction was explored. Our simulation results indicated that intracellular exposure of GS-443902 was decreased in the liver and increased in the lung in subjects with hepatic impairment relative to the subjects with normal liver function. In subjects with severe renal impairment, the exposure of GS-443902 in the liver was slightly increased, whereas the lung exposure of GS-443902 was not impacted. These predictions along with the organ impairment study results may be used to support decision-making regarding the RDV dosage adjustment in these patient subgroups. The modeling exercise illustrated the potential of whole body PBPK modeling to aid in decision-making for nucleotide analogue prodrugs, particularly when the active metabolite exposure in the target tissues is not available.","output":"Whole Body PBPK Modeling of Remdesivir and its Metabolites to Aid in Estimating Active Metabolite Exposure in the Lung and Liver in Patients with Organ Dysfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Convalescent plasma, widely utilized in viral infections that induce neutralizing antibodies, has been proposed for COVID-19, and preliminary evidence shows that it might have beneficial effect. Our objective was to determine the risk factors for 28-days mortality in patients who received convalescent plasma for COVID-19 compared to those who did not, who were admitted to hospitals in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, throughout the pandemic. METHODS: This is a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 2-month duration beginning on June 1, 2020, including unselected, consecutive adult patients with diagnosed COVID-19, admitted to 215 hospitals with pneumonia. Epidemiological and clinical variables were registered in the Provincial Hospital Bed Management System. Convalescent plasma was supplied as part of a centralized, expanded access program. RESULTS: We analyzed 3,529 patients with pneumonia, predominantly male, aged 6217, with arterial hypertension and diabetes as main comorbidities; 51.4% were admitted to the ward, 27.1% to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 21.7% to the ICU with mechanical ventilation requirement (ICU-MV). 28-day mortality was 34.9%; and was 26.3%, 30.1% and 61.4% for ward, ICU and ICU-MV patients. Convalescent plasma was administered to 868 patients (24.6%); their 28-day mortality was significantly lower (25.5% vs. 38.0%, p<0.001). No major adverse effects occurred. Logistic regression analysis identified age, ICU admission with and without MV requirement, diabetes, and preexistent cardiovascular disease as independent predictors of 28-day mortality, whereas convalescent plasma administration acted as a protective factor.

Influenza is a particularly important disease in this context because it causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics. In order to forecast health care utilization during epidemicsand the effects of hospitalizations and deaths on the contact network and, in turn, on transmission dynamicsmodellers must make assumptions about the lengths of time between infection, visiting a physician, being admitted to hospital, leaving hospital, and death. More reliable forecasts could be be made if the distributions of times between these types of events (delay distributions) were known. METHODS: We estimated delay distributions in the province of Ontario, Canada, between 2006 and 2010. To do so, we used encrypted health insurance numbers to link 1.34 billion health care billing records to 4.27 million hospital inpatient stays. Because the four year period we studied included three typical influenza seasons and the 2009 influenza pandemic, we were able to compare the delay distributions in non-pandemic and pandemic settings. We also estimated conditional probabilities such as the probability of hospitalization within the year if diagnosed with influenza. RESULTS: In non-pandemic [pandemic] years, delay distribution medians (inter-quartile ranges) were: Service to Admission 6.3 days (0.1C17.6 days) [2.4 days (-0.3C13.6 days)], Admission to Discharge 3 days (1.4C5.9 days) [2.6 days (1.2C5.1 days)], Admission to Death 5.3 days (2.1C11 days) [6 days (2.6C13.1 days)]. (Service date is defined as the date, within the year, of the first health care billing that included a diagnostic code for influenza-like-illness.) Among individuals diagnosed with either pneumonia or influenza in a given year, 19% [16%] were hospitalized within the year and 3% [2%] died in hospital. Among all individuals who were hospitalized, 10% [12%] were diagnosed with pneumonia or influenza during the year and 5% [5%] died in hospital. CONCLUSION: Our empirical delay distributions and conditional probabilities should help facilitate more accurate forecasts in the future, including improved predictions of hospital bed demands during influenza outbreaks, and the expected effects of hospitalizations on epidemic dynamics.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress, fear and coping strategies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among Malaysian residents. METHODS: Participants were invited to an online cross-sectional survey from Aug-Sep 2020. The study assessed psychological distress using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, level of fear using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and coping strategies using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to adjust for potential confounders. RESULTS: The mean age (SD) of the participants (N = 720) was 31.7 (11.5) years, and most of them were females (67.1%). Half of the participants had an income source, while 216 (30%) identified themselves as frontline health or essential service workers.

Participants who self-isolated due to exposure to COVID-19 (3.12, 1.04C9.32) and who had moderate to very high levels of psychological distress (2.56, 1.71C3.83) had higher levels of fear. Participants who provided care to a family member/patient with a suspected case of COVID-19 were more likely to be moderately to highly resilient compared to those who did not. CONCLUSION: Vulnerable groups of individuals such as patients and those impacted financially during COVID-19 should be supported for their mental wellbeing.

Generally, there is a low rate of bonafide co-infections in early COVID-19 pulmonary infection as currently appreciated. Reports of high co-infection rates must be tempered by limitations in current diagnostic methods since amplification technologies do not necessarily confirm live pathogen and may be subject to considerable laboratory variation. Some laboratory methods may not exclude commensal microbes. Concurrent serodiagnoses have long been of concern for accuracy in these contexts. Presumed virus co-infections are not specific to COVID-19. The association of influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 in co-infection has been considerably variable during influenza season. Other respiratory virus co-infections have generally occurred in less than 10% of COVID-19 patients. Early COVID-19 disease is more commonly associated with bacterial co-pathogens that typically represent usual respiratory micro-organisms. Late infections, especially among severe clinical presentations, are more likely to be associated with nosocomial or opportunistic pathogens given the influence of treatments that can include antibiotics, antivirals, immunomodulating agents, blood products, immunotherapy, steroids, and invasive procedures. As anticipated, hospital care carries risk for multi-resistant bacteria. Overall, co-pathogen identification is linked with longer hospital stay, greater patient complexity, and adverse outcomes.

In 2019, the Mexican government committed to providing hepatitis C treatment with priority for people who use injectable drugs, people living with HIV, and people living in prison or jail, yet the immediate plan for prioritized treatment allocation and rollout remained unclear prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding which prevention and intervention strategies and at what level of scale-up can achieve the WHO goal of 80% incidence reduction by 2030 along the border is needed. METHODS We adapted our previously published dynamic, deterministic model of hepatitis C transmission among people who use injectable drugs to determine the direct-acting antiviral treatment allocations in combination with harm-reduction interventions (opiate agonist therapy and needle and syringe programmes) needed to achieve the WHO elimination goal between 2021 and 2030. Our model is calibrated and parameterised to epidemiological data from Ciudad Juarez (where approximately 10 000 people who use injectable drugs reside and the seroprevalence of hepatitis C among people who use injectable drugs is 92%) and minimal harm reduction. FINDINGS To reduce hepatitis C incidence by 80% between 2021 and 2030, 910 direct-acting antiviral treatments per 10 000 people who use injectable drugs in Ciudad Juarez per year are needed. Overall, fewer treatments are required if combined with harm reduction. If opiate agonist therapy and needle and syringe programmes are scaled-up to 50%, approximately 30-40% fewer people who use injectable drugs would need to be treated each year (650 direct-acting antiviral treatments per 10 000 people who use injectable drugs per year). Between 2021 and 2030, using direct-acting antivirals alone, an estimated total of 8190 people who use injectable drugs in Ciudad Juarez would need to be treated, compared with 6255 (nearly 25%) fewer people who use injectable drugs overall if treatment is scaled-up alongside 50% of opiate agonist therapy and needle and syringe programmes combination intervention coverage. INTERPRETATION Hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals should be prioritised for people who use injectable drugs along the USA-Mexico border and progress towards hepatitis C elimination should be monitored. Regional hepatitis C micro-elimination among people who use injectable drugs could be possible if national treatment allocations are prioritised and distributed to people who use injectable drugs as planned and in the presence of essential harm-reduction programmes.

METHODS: Weekly stroke admission & discharge counts in the three HASUs were collected locally from Emergency Department (ED) data and Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme core dataset prior to, and during the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan 2020 to May 2020). Whilst adjusting for local traffic-related air pollution and ambient measurement, an interrupted time-series analysis using a segmented generalised linear model investigated key population level events on the rate of stroke team ED assessments, admissions for stroke, referrals for transient ischaemic attack (TIA), and stroke discharges. RESULTS: The median total number of ED stroke assessments, admissions, TIA referrals, and discharges across the three HASU sites prior to the first UK COVID-19 death were 150, 114, 69, and 76 per week. The stable weekly trend in ED assessments and stroke admissions decreased by approximately 16% (and 21% for TIAs) between first UK hospital COVID-19 death (5(th) March) and the implementation of the Act-FAST campaign (6(th) April) where a modest 4% and 5% increase per week was observed.

However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) remain unclear. In this study, we found that MHV N protein inhibited Sendai virus and poly(I:C)-induced IFN- production by targeting a molecule upstream of retinoic acid-induced gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5). Further studies showed that both MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins directly interacted with protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT), a cellular dsRNA-binding protein that can bind to RIG-I and MDA5 to activate IFN production. The NCPACT interaction sequestered the association of PACT and RIG-I/MDA5, which in turn inhibited IFN- production. However, the N proteins from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), which are also classified in the order Nidovirales, did not interact and counteract with PACT. Taken together, our present study confirms that both MHV and SARS-CoV N proteins can perturb the function of cellular PACT to circumvent the innate antiviral response.

A task force of the Semantic Web in Health Care and Life Sciences Community Group of the World-Wide Web consortium engaged informaticians and drug-drug interaction experts in in-depth examination of recent literature and specific potential interactions. A consensus set of information items was identified, along with example descriptions of selected potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs). User profiles and use cases were developed to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Ten core information items were identified: drugs involved, clinical consequences, seriousness, operational classification statement, recommended action, mechanism of interaction, contextual information/modifying factors, evidence about a suspected drug-drug interaction, frequency of exposure, and frequency of harm to exposed persons. Eight best practice recommendations suggest how PDDI knowledge artifact creators can best use the 10 information items when synthesizing drug interaction evidence into artifacts intended to aid clinicians. This model has been included in a proposed implementation guide developed by the HL7 Clinical Decision Support Workgroup and in PDDIs published in the CDS Connect repository. The complete description of the model can be found at https://w3id.org/hclscg/pddi.","output":"A Minimal Information Model for Potential Drug-Drug Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The global outbreak of COVID-19 has become an international public health crisis. Specific antiviral treatments for COVID-19 are not yet available, and prevention is of particular importance to fighting the virus. This study tends to explore and compare the roles of cognitive and affective factors in predicting preventive behavior adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods: : An online survey using a quota sampling method to collect responses from 3,000 Chinese adults was conducted from March 2, 2020 to March 23, 2020. Questions included sociodemographic features, coronavirus knowledge, negative emotion, risk perception, and behavioral responses. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the predictors of behavioral responses toward COVID-19. Results: : On average, respondents had low levels of knowledge about COVID-19 (the overall correct response rate was 7.5 percent). Most respondents reported moderate to strong negative emotions towards the virus (3.47 out of 5). The average reported perceived chance of infection was 23.89%. For behavioral responses, respondents reported low frequencies of going out for activities (1.98 out of 4) and high frequencies of taking preventive measures (3.22 out of 4). Behavioral responses toward COVID-19 were found to be determined by cognitive and affective variables. Knowledge was negatively related to frequency of going out for activities (=-0.11, p<.001). Negative emotion (=0.34, p<.001), and risk perception (=0.05, p=.007) were positively associated with going out for activities. The explanatory power of affective variables (R 2 =12.1%) was greater than cognitive variables (R 2 =1.0%). For preventive behaviors, knowledge was positively associated with preventive behaviors (=0.22, p<.001). Negative emotion (=-0.28, p<.001) and risk perception (=-0.05, p=.002) were all negatively associated with preventive measures. Affective variables still showed stronger explanatory power (R 2 =8%) than cognitive variables (R 2 =4.4%) in predicting preventive behaviors. Conclusions: : After the rising period of the COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, cognitive and affective variables still played important roles in predicting behavioral responses. Compared with cognitive factor, affective factors demonstrated stronger explanatory power in predicting behavioral responses towards COVID-19. The findings may have implications for enhancing individual compliance with guidelines of adopting preventive behaviors in response to COVID-19.","output":"Effects of Cognition and Affect on Preventive Behaviors During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives. To identify spatiotemporal patterns of epidemic spread at the community level.Methods.

We analyzed 6527 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases and identified microepidemics in more than 1100 neighborhoods, and more than half of the neighborhoods that had hotspots in a season became hotspots in the next season. We used data from 731 COVID-19 cases, and we found that a neighborhood was 1.90 times more likely to become a COVID-19 hotspot if it had been an influenza hotspot in 2018 to 2019.Conclusions. The use of readily available hospital data allows the real-time identification of spatiotemporal trends and hotspots of microepidemics.Public Health Implications. As local governments move to reopen the economy and ease physical distancing, the use of historic influenza hotspots could guide early prevention interventions, while the real-time identification of hotspots would enable the implementation of interventions that focus on small-area containment and mitigation.","output":"Real-Time Spatiotemporal Analysis of Microepidemics of Influenza and COVID-19 Based on Hospital Network Data: Colocalization of Neighborhood-Level Hotspots"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a new public health emergency victimization the world with the emergence and spread of COVID-19 However, India has performed very well to tackle this emergency of public health so far but at the time of writing the manuscript (as on 06 04 2020), India is on the stage to increase the lockdown period in the current situation because of peak rise in the confirmed cases of COVID-19 The present study aims to review the decisions of the Indian government that are being implemented so far to hold the situation of COVID-19 along with the challenges faced so far However, only time will tell that the decisions taken so far are sufficiently strong to protect the majority of Indian during on-going COVID-19 pandemic At last, special considerations highlight on major footsteps and challenges so far in India due to COVID-19 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Journal of Clinical & Experimental Investigations is the property of Modestum Publications and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in India: A Perspective so far"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Melanin is the basis of coloration in many animals, and although it is often used in communication, thermoregualtion or camouflage, melanin has many other physiological functions. For example, in polluted habitats, melanin can have a detoxifying function. Melanic coloration would help to sequester in the skin the heavy metals contaminants from inside the body, which will be expulsed to the exterior when the skin is sloughed. Moreover, animals should have evolved more melanic colorations in more polluted habitats (\\"industrial melanism\\" hypothesis). We examined whether the fossorial amphisbaenian reptile, Trogonophis wiegmanni, is able to eliminate heavy metals, derived from soil pollution by seagulls depositions, through sloughing its skin. Our results suggest a covariation between levels of soil pollution by heavy metals and the concentration of heavy metals in the sloughed skins of amphisbaenians. This suggests that amphisbaenians may expel heavy metals from their bodies when they slough the skins. We also tested whether amphisbaenians inhabiting soils with higher levels of heavy metal pollution had darker (melanin-dependent) body colorations. However, contrary to predictions from the \\"industrial melanization\\" hypothesis, we found a negative relationship between soil pollution and proportions of melanic coloration. This contradictory result could, however, be explained because heavy metals have endocrine disruption effects that increase physiological stress, and higher stress levels could result in decreased melanogenesis. We suggest that although amphisbaenians might have some detoxifying mechanism linked to melanin in the skin, this process might be negatively affected by stress and result ineffective under conditions of high soil pollution.

Little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms regulating muscle protein homeostasis during the recovery or convalescence phase. We adapted a sepsis-recovery mouse model that uses cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), followed 24 h later by cecal resection and antibiotic treatment, to identify putative cellular pathways regulating protein synthesis and breakdown in skeletal muscle. Ten days after CLP, body weight and food consumption did not differ between control and sepsis-recovery mice, but gastrocnemius weight was reduced. During sepsis-recovery, muscle protein synthesis was increased 2-fold and associated with enhanced mTOR kinase activity (4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation). The sepsis-induced increase in 4E-BP1 was associated with enhanced formation of the eIF4E-eIF4G active cap-dependent complex, while the increased S6K1 was associated with increased phosphorylation of downstream targets S6 and eIF4B. Proximal to mTOR, sepsis-recovery increased Akt and TSC2 phosphorylation, did not alter AMPK phosphorylation, and decreased REDD1 protein content. Despite the decreased mRNA content for the E3 ubiquitin ligases atrogin-1 and muscle RING-finger 1, proteasomal activity was increased 50%. In contrast, sepsis-recovery was associated with an apparent decrease in autophagy (e.g., increased ULK-1 phosphorylation, decreased LCB3-II, and increased p62). The mRNA content for IL-1, IL-18, TNF, and IL-6 in muscle was elevated in sepsis-recovery. During recovery after sepsis skeletal muscle responds with an increase in Akt-TSC2-mTOR-dependent protein synthesis and decreased autophagy, but full restoration of muscle protein content may be slowed by the continued stimulation of ubiquitin-proteasome activity.","output":"Restorative Mechanisms Regulating Protein Balance in Skeletal Muscle During Recovery From Sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Infectious diseases and vaccines can occasionally cause new-onset or flare of immune-mediated diseases (IMDs) The adjuvanticity of the available SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is based on either TLR-7/8 or TLR-9 agonism, which is distinct from previous vaccines and is a common pathogenic mechanism in IMDs METHODS: We evaluated IMD flares or new disease onset within 28-days of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination at five large tertiary centres in countries with early vaccination adoption, three in Israel, one in UK, and one in USA We assessed the pattern of disease expression in terms of autoimmune, autoinflammatory, or mixed disease phenotype and organ system affected We also evaluated outcomes FINDINGS: 27 cases included 17 flares and 10 new onset IMDs 23/27 received the BNT - 162b2 vaccine, 2/27 the mRNA-1273 and 2/27 the ChAdOx1 vaccines The mean age was 54 4 +/- 19 2 years and 55% of cases were female Among the 27 cases, 21 (78%) had at least one underlying autoimmune/rheumatic disease prior the vaccination Among those patients with a flare or activation, four episodes occurred after receiving the second-dose and in one patient they occurred both after the first and the second-dose In those patients with a new onset disease, two occurred after the second-dose and in one patient occurred both after the first (new onset) and second-dose (flare) For either dose, IMDs occurred on average 4 days later Of the cases, 20/27 (75%) were mild to moderate in severity Over 80% of cases had excellent resolution of inflammatory features, mostly with the use of corticosteroid therapy Other immune-mediated conditions included idiopathic pericarditis (n = 2), neurosarcoidosis with small fiber neuropathy (n = 1), demyelination (n = 1), and myasthenia gravis (n = 2) In 22 cases (81 5%), the insurgence of Adverse event following immunization (AEFI)/IMD could not be explained based on the drug received by the patient In 23 cases (85 2%), AEFI development could not be explained based on the underlying disease/co-morbidities Only in one case (3 7%), the timing window of the insurgence of the side effect was considered not compatible with the time from vaccine to flare INTERPRETATION: Despite the high population exposure in the regions served by these centers, IMDs flares or onset temporally-associated with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination appear rare Most are moderate in severity and responsive to therapy although some severe flares occurred FUNDING: none","output":"Immune-Mediated Disease Flares or New-Onset Disease in 27 Subjects Following mRNA/DNA SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has imposed many challenges on health systems. The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical activity of pediatricians. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional and descriptive online survey among pediatricians practicing in Cameroon. Data were collected through an anonymous pre-tested Google Form?. RESULTS: Among the 118 pediatricians eligible for the survey, 101 responded (85.6%), of whom 61.2% were women. The pediatric outpatient consultations dropped significantly from 60.4% of pediatricians seeing more than 30 patients per week before the pandemic to 9.9% during the pandemic (P<0.000). According to the occupancy rate of hospitalisation beds, 45.5% of pediatricians reported having 76-100% of pediatric hospitalisation beds occupied per week before the pandemic but no pediatrician reported a similar rate during the pandemic (P<0.000). There was a significant increase in the use of telehealth, ranging from no pediatrician using telehealth \\"very frequently\\" before the pandemic to 23.8% using it during the pandemic (P<0.000). Most of the pediatricians had at their disposal surgical masks (96%), care gloves (80.2%), hydroalcoholic gel (99.0%), and soap and water (86.1%). For the management of children, 90.1% and 71.3% of pediatricians experienced difficulties accessing COVID-19 PCR and chloroquine, respectively, and 74.3% declared difficulties for proper isolation of patients. More than half (65.3%) of the pediatricians interviewed were \\"very afraid\\" or \\"extremely afraid\\" of being infected with SARS-Cov-2, respectively 45.5% and 19.8%. The most frequent reasons included fear of infecting their relatives (85.1%) and of developing a severe form of the disease (43.6%). The reluctance to consult health services expressed by the parents was due to: fear of being infected when leaving their home and especially in the health facility (96%), strict compliance with confinement (30.7%), and financial difficulties of families (13.9%). CONCLUSION: This work highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the clinical activity of Cameroonian pediatricians. Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a significant drop in the use of health facilities, which probably has a negative impact on children's overall level of health. Although the preventive measures explain this drop in attendance at health facilities, the parents' fear of being infected when leaving the house was the predominant reason likely to explain this drop in attendance at health facilities. This could constitute an axis for developing messages to parents to encourage a gradual return to child health services.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatricians' clinical activity in Cameroon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This open-label, single-period study describes the human absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and pharmacokinetics of velsecorat (AZD7594). Healthy subjects received inhaled velsecorat (non-radiolabeled; 720 g) followed by intravenous (IV) infusion of 14C-velsecorat (30 g). Plasma, urine and feces were collected up to 168 hours post-dose. Objectives included identification and quantification of velsecorat and its metabolites (i.e. drug-related material; DRM) in plasma and excreta, and determining the elimination pathways of velsecorat by measuring the rate and route of excretion, plasma half-life (t1/2), clearance, volume of distribution and mean recovery of radioactivity. On average, 76.0% of administered 14C dose was recovered by the end of the sampling period (urine=24.4%; feces=51.6%), with no unchanged compound recovered in excreta, suggesting biliary excretion is the main elimination route. Compared with IV 14C-velsecorat, inhaled velsecorat had a longer t1/2 (27 vs 2 hours), confirming that plasma elimination is absorption-rate-limited from the lungs. Following IV administration, t1/2 of 14C-DRM was longer than for unchanged velsecorat and 20% of the 14C plasma content was related to unchanged velsecorat. The geometric mean plasma clearance of velsecorat was high (70.7 L/h) and the geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state was 113 L. Velsecorat was substantially metabolized via O-dealkylation of the indazole ether followed by sulfate conjugation, forming the M1 metabolite, the major metabolite in plasma. There were 15 minor metabolites. Velsecorat was well tolerated, and these results support the progression of velsecorat to phase 3 studies. Significance Statement This study describes the human pharmacokinetics and metabolism of velsecorat, a selective glucocorticoid receptor modulator, evaluated via co-administration of a radiolabeled intravenous microtracer dose and a non-radiolabeled inhaled dose. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of the disposition of velsecorat in humans. It also highlights a number of complexities associated with determining human absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion for velsecorat, related to the inhaled route, the high metabolic clearance, sequential metabolite formation and the low intravenous dose.","output":"Characterization of clinical ADME and pharmacokinetics of velsecorat using an intravenous microtracer combined with an inhaled dose in healthy subjects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[...]a more experientially heterogeneous team with more experts, made possible by advantages characteristic to virtual teams, will yield higher salience of each team members expertise in relation to the group.

METHODS: We assessed 30 symptoms pertaining to different organ systems in 749 adults (age = 55  14 years; 47% female) during in-person visits conducted at 6-11 months after hospitalization due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including six psychiatric and cognitive manifestations. Symptom co-occurrence was initially investigated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and latent variable modeling was then conducted using Item Response Theory (IRT). We investigated associations of latent variable severity with objective indices of persistent physical disability, pulmonary and kidney dysfunction, and C-reactive protein and D-dimer blood levels, measured at the same follow-up assessment. RESULTS: The EFA extracted one factor, explaining 64.8% of variance; loadings were positive for all symptoms, and above 0.35 for 16 of them. The latent trait generated using IRT placed fatigue, psychiatric, and cognitive manifestations as the most discriminative symptoms (coefficients > 1.5, p < 0.001). Latent trait severity was associated with decreased body weight and poorer physical performance (coefficients > 0.240; p a 0.003), and elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein (coefficient = 0.378; 95% CI 0.215-0.541; p < 0.001) and D-dimer (coefficient = 0.412; 95% CI 0.123-0.702; p = 0.005). Results were similar after excluding subjects with pro-inflammatory comorbidities.

Vaccines are a game-changer by providing a real opportunity to sustainably protect everyone against infection and eliminate the circulation of the virus. The Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines, the three currently authorized in France, overall induce remarkable protection rates of 95 %, 94 % and 70 % respectively. The surprise came from that this efficacy was obtained after a rapid development, by targeting only the viral protein S as antigen, and by using the administration of expression vectors innovative in vaccinology, consisting of either messenger RNA or recombinant adenovirus. However, bringing the epidemic under control requires a well-organized mass vaccination campaign. It also requires careful monitoring of many parameters such as the occurrence of adverse events, duration of induced immunity, vaccine efficacy against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2, interest or not of vaccinating people already infected, vaccination of immunocompromised patients.

The physical properties of aerosol particles which may contain viable virus have implications for the safe use of personal protective equipment and infection control protocols.

However, if the number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article, using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary measures put in place in France from March to May 2020.

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality [risk ratio (RR) =2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69 to 5.75, I2=90.9%] or the duration of lung inflammation [weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91], while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD =-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR =1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD =0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD =0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%).

Except for the abnormalities in her chest CT image, she was asymptomatic. She had an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery, and her infant was discharged home for isolation. Because of the positive result of the maternal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 obtained on the 2nd day after sampling, we transferred the mother to the designated hospital and followed up with her by telephone interviews. Luckily, it was confirmed on February 23 that the newborn did not develop any COVID-19 symptoms after observation for 14 days after birth. Case 2: Another pregnant woman, with a gestational age of 38 weeks and 2 days, was also admitted to our hospital because of spontaneous labor with cervical dilation of 5 cm. Since she had the typical manifestations of COVID-19, including cough, lymphopenia, and abnormal chest CT images, she was highly suspected of having COVID-19. Based on the experience from case 1, we helped the mother deliver a healthy baby by vaginal delivery. On the 2nd day after delivery, the maternal nasopharyngeal swab result was positive, while the infants result was negative.

The minimum genetic distance to the closest 'non-IBADAN' strains (UK/7/93 at the nucleotide level; H120 and M41 at the amino acid level) reached 24 and 32 % at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. The full genome of the IBADAN reference strain (NGA/A116E7/2006) had a genetic distance of 9.7-16.4 % at the nucleotide level with all available fully sequenced strains.

RESULTS: In completion of routine diagnostics, we identified and confirmed a viral etiology of infection by our metagenomic approach in four patients (three Rhinovirus A, one Rhinovirus B infection) despite initial negative results in specific multiplex PCR. Notably, the majority of samples were also positive for Torque teno virus (TTV) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). While TTV viral loads increased with immunosuppression in both throat swabs and blood samples, HHV-7 remained at low levels throughout the observation period and was restricted to the respiratory tract. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of metagenomic sequencing for virus diagnostics in cases with previously unknown etiology of infection and in complex diagnostic situations such as in immunocompromised hosts.","output":"Metagenomic sequencing complements routine diagnostics in identifying viral pathogens in lung transplant recipients with unknown etiology of respiratory infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Podiatrists regularly use scalpels in the management of foot pathologies, yet the teaching and learning of these skills can be challenging. The use of 3D printed foot models presents an opportunity for podiatry students to practice their scalpel skills in a relatively safe, controlled risk setting, potentially increasing confidence and reducing associated anxiety. This study evaluated the use of 3D printed foot models on podiatry students anxiety and confidence levels and explored the fidelity of using 3D foot models as a teaching methodology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple study designs were used. A repeated measure trial evaluated the effects of a 3D printed foot model on anxiety and confidence in two student groups: novice users in their second year of podiatry studies (n = 24), and more experienced fourth year students completing a workshop on ulcer management (n = 15). A randomised controlled trial compared the use of the 3D printed foot models (n = 12) to standard teaching methods (n = 15) on students anxiety and confidence in second year students. Finally, a focus group was conducted (n = 5) to explore final year students perceptions of the fidelity of the foot ulcer models in their studies. RESULTS: The use of 3D printed foot models increased both novice and more experienced users self-confidence and task self-efficacy; however, cognitive and somatic anxiety was only reduced in the experienced users. All changes were considered large effects. In comparison to standard teaching methods, the use of 3D printed foot models had similar decreases in anxiety and increases in confidence measures. Students also identified the use of 3D foot models for the learning of scalpel skills as authentic and lifelike and led to enhanced confidence prior to assessment of skills in more high-risk situations. CONCLUSION: Podiatry undergraduate programs should consider using 3D printed foot models as a teaching method to improve students confidence and reduce their anxiety when using scalpels, especially in instances where face-to-face teaching is not possible (e.g., pandemic related restrictions on face-to-face teaching).","output":"An exploration of the use of 3D printed foot models and simulated foot lesions to supplement scalpel skill training in undergraduate podiatry students: A multiple method study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In humanitarian contexts, ensuring access to safe, nutritious, good quality and culturally appropriate food in the right quantity at the right time and place during an emergency or a protracted crisis is an enormous challenge, which is likely to increase given uncertainties such as climate change, global political and economic instability and emerging pandemics like COVID-19. Several international organizations and non-government organizations have well established systems to respond to food security emergencies. However, the role of food science and technology in humanitarian response is not well understood and is seldom considered in humanitarian circles. Scope and approach: The role of food science and technology in humanitarian response and the importance of addressing the requirements of the local consumers within the local food systems are discussed. Key findings and conclusions: Humanitarian food aid policies focus on immediate and short-term assistance to save lives. The implementation of emergency programs and projects tends to induce dependency on aid, rather than strengthening local food systems and ensuring resilience. Transformative change must embrace innovation across the whole food system with an increased emphasis on food science and technology that addresses local food security, generates employment and contributes to the local economy. There needs to be a move beyond rehabilitating and increasing agricultural production to addressing the whole food system with a view to link humanitarian assistance and longer-term support to sustainable livelihoods and resilience.","output":"The role of food science and technology in humanitarian response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system tract through the gut-brain axis.

However, studies on the clinical risk score system of the risk factors for the development of severe disease are limited. Hence, we conducted a clinical risk score system for severe illness, which might optimize appropriate treatment strategies. Methods We conducted a retrospective, single-center study at the JinYinTan Hospital from January 24, 2020 to March 31, 2020. We evaluated the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and performed a 10-fold cross-validation to split the data into a training set and validation set. We then screened the prognostic factors for severe illness using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and logistic regression, and finally conducted a risk score to estimate the probability of severe illness in the training set. Data from the validation set were used to validate the score. Results A total of 295 patients were included. From 49 potential risk factors, 3 variables were measured as the risk score: neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.15C1.39), albumin (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70C0.83), and chest computed tomography abnormalities (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.41C2.86) and the AUC of the validation cohort was 0.822 (95% CI, 0.7667C0.8776).

Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more 'egalitarian' forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account.

Despite the increasing number of individuals who are contracting and recovering from this disease, little is known about their functional recovery. Understanding functional outcomes in these patients is critical to address their rehabilitation needs. The purpose of this study is to characterize the 30-day patient-reported functional outcomes of older and younger adults following acute hospitalization for COVID-19. Methods: A single-center prospective cohort study was performed from April to October 2020 of adult survivors of hospitalization for COVID-19 (n=28). A standardized telephone questionnaire was administered 30-days after hospital discharge to participants addressing their ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, mobility, fatigue symptoms (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems-PROMIS) and general disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index - HAQ-DI). Results: Participants' were 23-95 years old. Twenty-one (75%) were less than 65 years old. Fifteen (54%) were female and 19 (68%) were white. Mean hospital length of stay was 11.3 days and 10 (36%) participants required ICU admission.

In comparison, 71% of adults aged &gt;65 years developed new impairments and 29% new dependence. The most common new impairments in both age groups were transferring for basic ADLs and preparing meals and grocery shopping for instrumental ADLs.

However, increasing reports show that some tumors are resistant to metformin. Identification of factors affecting metformin mediated cancer therapy is of great significance. FGFR1 is a receptor-tyrosine-kinase that is frequently overexpressed in breast cancer, which is associated with poor-prognosis. To investigate the effect of FGFR1 overexpression on metformin-induced inhibition of breast cancer cells, we demonstrated that FGFR1 overexpression rendered MCF-7 and T47D cells resistant to metformin. In particular, we found that, in addition to AKT and ERK1/2 activation, FGFR1-induced activation of IRS1 and IGF1R, key regulators connecting metabolism and cancer, was associated with metformin resistance. Targeting IRS with IRS1 KO or IRS inhibitor NT157 significantly sensitized FGFR1 overexpressing cells to metformin. Combination of NT157 with metformin induced enhanced inhibition of p-IGF1R, p-ERK1/2 and p-mTOR. Moreover, we demonstrated that IRS1 functions as a critical mediator of the crosstalk between FGFR1 and IGF1R pathways, which involves a feedback loop between IRS1 and MAPK/ERK.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in dogs and their owners, as well as the presence of RNA of influenza A virus in nasal exudates of dogs and, thereby, assess the possible transmission of the virus between humans and dogs. METHODS: Serum samples from household dogs and their owners were analyzed to detect the presence of antibodies against three subtypes of human influenza virus (H1N1pdm09, H1N1, and H3N2), as well as subtype H3N8 of equine influenza. We analyzed dog nasal exudates to detect influenza viral RNA. The relationship between the seropositivity of dogs and various factors (age, sex, constantly at home, and seropositivity of owners) was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Seroprevalence for human influenza in dogs was 09% (1 of 113), and it was 4% (5 of 113) for equine influenza. In humans, seroprevalence was 22% for subtype H1N1pdm09, 20% for subtype H1N1, and 11% for subtype H3N2. No significant association (P > 005) was found between seropositivity and any of the assessed factors. Furthermore, no viral RNA was detected in the nasal exudate samples.

Methods Relevant studies on TCMs related to the study aim were undertaken through a literature search to synthesize the extracted data. Results The China National Health Commission guidelines recommend 15 oral and injectable TCMs for COVID-19. Studies on TCMs have demonstrated that these compounds possess broad-spectrum antiviral and antibacterial properties, and they have certain advantages in the treatment of viral pneumonia and other emergent infectious diseases. Many TCMs also have potent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Treatment based on syndrome differentiation is one of the significant features in TCM. TCM compounds contain a variety of active ingredients that have proven multi-target effects, making it difficult for viruses to develop drug resistance. A variety of clinical pathways are involved in the actions of these TCMs. These properties allow TCMs to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.

Measurements of communities mask use behavior have mostly relied on self-report. This studys objective was to devise a method for measuring the prevalence of mask-wearing and proper mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14?20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The average mask use prevalence among observed visitors of the 382 visited public areas was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 17% of the public areas, at least one unmasked visitor was among the observed visitors; in 48%, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed. The average mask use among staff was 92%, but unmasked staff were observed in fewer public areas, as an unmasked staff member was observed in 11% of the visited public areas. The average prevalence of proper make use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade type, and geographical area. Observing unmasked and incorrectly masked visitors was more common in small (less than 1500 square feet) public areas than larger ones, also in food and grocery stores than other retail stores. Also, the majority of the observed unmasked persons were male and middle age adults.","output":"Stratified Random Sampling Methodology for Observing Community Mask Use within Indoor Settings: Results from Louisville, Kentucky during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since it was first reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic outbreak resulting in a tremendous global threat due to its unprecedented rapid spread and an absence of a prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic drugs treating the virus. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a key player in the viral entry into cells through its interaction with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein, and the RBD has therefore been crucial as a drug target. In this study, we used phage display to develop human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. A human synthetic Fab phage display library was panned against the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-2 RBD), yielding ten unique Fabs with moderate apparent affinities (EC(50) = 19C663 nM) for the SARS-2 RBD. All of the Fabs showed no cross-reactivity to the MERS-CoV spike protein, while three Fabs cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Five Fabs showed neutralizing activities in in vitro assays based on the Fabs activities antagonizing the interaction between the SARS-2 RBD and ACE2. Reformatting the five Fabs into immunoglobulin Gs (IgGs) greatly increased their apparent affinities (K(D) = 0.08C1.0 nM), presumably due to the effects of avidity, without compromising their non-aggregating properties and thermal stability. Furthermore, two of the mAbs (D12 and C2) significantly showed neutralizing activities on pseudo-typed and authentic SARS-CoV-2. Given their desirable properties and neutralizing activities, we anticipate that these human anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs would be suitable reagents to be further developed as antibody therapeutics to treat COVID-19, as well as for diagnostics and research tools.","output":"Neutralizing Human Antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Isolated from a Human Synthetic Fab Phage Display Library"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over 27,000 people were sickened by Ebola and over 11,000 people died between March of 2014 and June of 2016. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) was one of many public health organizations that sought to stop this outbreak. This agency deployed almost 2,000 individuals to West Africa during that timeframe. Deployment to these countries exposed these individuals to a wide variety of dangers, stressors, and risks. Being concerned about the at-risk populations in Africa, and also the well-being of its professionals who willingly deployed, the CDC did several things to help safeguard the health, safety, and resilience of these team members before, during, and after deployment. The accompanying special report highlights innovative pre-deployment training initiatives, customized screening processes, and post-deployment outreach efforts intended to protect and support the public health professionals fighting Ebola. Before deploying, the CDC team members were expected to participate in both internally-created and externally-provided trainings. These ranged from pre-deployment briefings, to Preparing for Work Overseas (PFWO) and Public Health Readiness Certificate Program (PHRCP) courses, to Incident Command System (ICS) 100, 200, and 400 courses. A small subset of non-clinical deployers also participated in a three-day training designed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS; Bethesda, Maryland USA) to train individuals to assess and address the well-being and resilience of themselves and their teammates in the field during a deployment. Participants in this unique training were immersed in a Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) that simulated deployment to one of seven different types of emergencies. The CDC leadership also requested a pre-deployment screening process that helped professionals in the CDCs Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) determine whether or not individuals were at an increased risk of negative outcomes by participating in a rigorous deployment at that time. When deployers returned from the field, they received personalized invitations to participate in a voluntary, confidential, post-deployment operational debriefing one-on-one or in a group. Implementing these approaches provided more information to clinical decision makers about the readiness of deployers. It provided deployers with a greater awareness of the kinds of challenges they were likely to face in the field. The post-deployment outreach efforts reminded staff that their contributions were appreciated and there were resources available if they needed help processing any of the potentially-traumatizing things they may have experienced.","output":"CDCs Multiple Approaches to Safeguard the Health, Safety, and Resilience of Ebola Responders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the observation that 14.5% of COVID-19 patients had positive RT-PCR testing again after discharge.

METHODS: Systematic review based on searching two electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science) according to the principle of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) for epidemiological studies on SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 and travel by train or bus. RESULTS: Searches of the two electronic databases yielded 746 publications. Of these, 55 met the selection criteria and were included in the full-text search. Finally, 5 original publications were used to answer the question about SARS-CoV-2 infections related to long-distance travel by train and 4 related to bus travel. The studies were very heterogeneous and referred almost exclusively to long-distance travel in China. They consistently showed a risk of infection when infected persons travelled in the same train, car or bus without mouth-to-nose (MNB) coverage. The risk was not limited to those sitting in close proximity to an infected fellow traveler. Despite all the differences between travel by train and bus in China and Germany, there is no fundamental doubt that the reported results from China can also be extrapolated to Germany in qualitative terms. However, it must be taken into account that the results of the three key publications predominantly included the period before the lockdown in China without the strict use of MNB. Thus, the question remains whether the results would be similar under current conditions with MNB and more virulent viral mutations. No single study was found related to infection when using public transportation. CONCLUSIONS: There are several lines of evidence that travel by train is associated with a significantly lower risk of infection compared with the risk of infection in the home environment. Due to a lack of observational data, one will need to model the risk of infection for long-distance travel by bus and use of local public transport based on air exchange in the passenger compartment, travel duration, distance from other passengers, and ultimately passenger density.","output":"[SARS-CoV-2 Infections during Travel by Train and Bus: A Systematic Review of Epidemiological Studies]./ SARS-CoV-2 Infektionen w?hrend Reisen mit Bahn und Bus.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Using >34 hours of previously acquired and annotated heart sound recordings, we trained a deep neural network to detect murmurs. To test the algorithm, we enrolled 962 patients in a clinical study and collected recordings at the 4 primary auscultation locations. Ground truth was established using patient echocardiograms and annotations by 3 expert cardiologists. Algorithm performance for detecting murmurs has sensitivity and specificity of 76.3% and 91.4%, respectively. By omitting softer murmurs, those with grade 1 intensity, sensitivity increased to 90.0%. Application of the algorithm at the appropriate anatomic auscultation location detected moderate\\\\to\\\\severe or greater aortic stenosis, with sensitivity of 93.2% and specificity of 86.0%, and moderate\\\\to\\\\severe or greater mitral regurgitation, with sensitivity of 66.2% and specificity of 94.6%.

The induction required both myeloid differentiation factor 2 (MD2) and the pattern-recognition receptor CD14, which are two TLR4-associated accessory proteins. The -PGA with high molecular weights (2000 and 5000 kDa) was able to activate the subsequent signals through TLR4/MD2 to result in dimerization of IRF-3, a transcription factor required for IFN gene expression, leading to increases in mRNA levels of the type I IFN-response genes, 2C5 OAS and ISG56. Moreover, -PGA (2000 kDa) displayed an antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus and hepatitis C virus. Our results identify high-molecular weight -PGA as a TLR4 ligand and demonstrate that -PGA requires both CD14 and MD2 for the activation of type I IFN responses.

Results. Multilevel modeling showed that both trait loneliness and anxious attachment predicted the prospective development of SI during the study period. Reduced in-person contact, but not remote contact, was proximally associated with increased SI. Participants with low attachment anxiety, high attachment avoidance, and high trait loneliness were more likely to develop SI in the context of reduced daily in-person contact compared to participants without these traits.

This pathway was designed to continue using low-cost mucolytic aerosols (hypertonic saline, N-acetylcysteine) but decrease new starts and total doses per 100 patient days (P100PD) dornase-alfa among patients for whom there is little to no supporting evidence. Interventions included a departmental journal club for fellow and attending physicians and a rolling introduction of the pathway to residents and respiratory therapists. Control charts serially tracked ordering changes and location-specific dornase alfa orders. RESULTS: New dornase-alfa starts P100PD decreased by 53% (1.17C0.55), and total doses P100PD decreased by 75% (16C4). N-acetylcysteine ordering more than doubled; however, total doses of P100PD remained unchanged after the intervention. The use of 3% sodium chloride increased significantly from 0.28 to 4.15 new starts and 4.37 to 38.84 total doses P100PD. Mechanical ventilation days P100PD decreased, suggesting there were no measured adverse effects of pathway implementation. The reduction in dornase-alfa utilization resulted in a cumulative and sustained 59% mucolytic cost reduction ($2183.08C$885.77 P100PD).

The main outcome was reliability of the duodenoscope assessment tool, which was estimated using Cronbach's coefficient alpha (). The secondary outcome was validity of the assessment tool. RESULTS The assessment tool evaluated technical performance of reusable duodenoscopes in 1,080 ERCP procedures. Indications were biliary in 92.8% and pancreatic in 7.2% procedures. The overall Cronbach's coefficient  for maneuverability was 0.81, assessment of mechanical/imaging characteristics was 0.92, and ability to perform requisite interventions was 0.87. On multiple linear regression analysis, prolonged procedure duration, older patient age and pancreatic interventions were significantly positively associated with higher (worse) scores. CONCLUSIONS The newly developed assessment tool appears reliable and valid for evaluating the technical performance of duodenoscopes.","output":"Prospective evaluation of an assessment tool for technical performance of duodenoscopes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To investigate the effect of rapamycin (Rapa) on growth or regression of Walker tumor used alone or in combination with CsA and MMF.

Participants were asked to identify features of acute illness as well as persistence of symptoms at time of study completion. We used logistic regression models to examine association between sociodemographic and clinical features and persistence of symptoms at or beyond 2 months. Setting: Ten waves of a fifty-state survey between June 13, 2020 and January 13, 2021. Participants: 6,211 individuals who reported symptomatic COVID-19 illness confirmed by positive test or clinician diagnosis.

Severe measures were introduced to face the pandemic, significantly impacting all healthcare services, including pediatric palliative care (PPC) networks. We investigated how the Covid-19 pandemic modified the provision of PPC services in Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy. Both the acute and long-term impacts on the families were addressed. METHODS: We administered a retrospective three-sections online questionnaire to the eligible families assisted by our regional PPC network. Inclusion criteria were: child needing specialistic PPC, adequate knowledge of the Italian language, being in charge of the PPC regional network of Friuli Venezia Giulia from February 1, 2020. The three sections examined the same issues in different periods: the pre-covid period (until February 29, 2020), the lockdown period (March 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020), and the post-lockdown period (May 2021). RESULTS: Twelve patients were included. During the lockdown period, 54.6% of children had to stop physiotherapy sessions, while, among those who continued, 80.0% experienced a reduction in the sessions frequency. In the post-lockdown period, 45.5% of children did not have physiotherapy as often as before the pandemic onset. Overall, the access to medical visits during the lockdown and after its end was significantly reduced (p = 0.01). The level of support perceived by the families descended from grade 3 (intermediate) in the pre-covid period to 2 (low) during the lockdown (p < 0.05) and returned to grade 3 in the post-lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic and the related restrictions impacted the families and caused a transitory contraction of the perceived support. The most significant change was reduced access to medical visits and physiotherapy, which lasted over a year after the start of the pandemic.

Results: Thirty-two subjects (children: 50.0%, female: 50.0%) participated. There were few disagreements. Meanings of general and health-related QoL could be grouped under three broad themes: (1) physical, (2) psychological and (3) social health, consistent with the current definition of HRQoL. We found that Singaporean and Western children/adolescents share a remarkably similar notion of general and health-related QoL. Compared to adolescents, children were more likely to report positive emotions, be less mindful of others opinions and had less varied social activities.

However, previous attempts did not take into account temporal dynamics of the disease. By including the dimension of time, we aim to gain further insights into the heterogeneity of COVID-19. Methods: : We used highly granular data from 3202 adult critically ill COVID patients in the multicenter Dutch Data Warehouse that were admitted to one of 25 Dutch ICUs between February 2020 and March 2021. Parameters including demographics, clinical observations, medications, laboratory values, vital signs, and data from life support devices were selected based on relevance and availability. Twenty-one consecutive datasets were created that each covered 24 hours of ICU data for each day of ICU treatment up until day 21. After aggregation and multiple imputation of the temporal data, clinical phenotypes in each dataset were identified by performing multiple cluster analyses. Clinical phenotypes were identified by aggregating values from all patients per cluster. Both evolution of the clinical phenotypes over time and patient allocation to these clusters over time were tracked. Results: : The final patient cohort consisted of 2438 critically ill COVID-19 patients with a registered ICU mortality outcome. Forty-one parameters were chosen for the cluster analysis. On admission, both a mild and a more severe clinical phenotype were found. After day 4, the severe phenotype split into an intermediate and a severe phenotype for 11 consecutive days. Heterogeneity between phenotypes appears to be strongly driven by inflammation and dead space ventilation. During the 21-day period only 8.2% and 4.6% of patients in the initial mild and severe clusters remained assigned to the same phenotype respectively. The clinical phenotype half-life was between 5 and 6 days for the mild and severe phenotypes, and about 3 days for the medium severe phenotype. Conclusions: : Patients typically do not remain in the same cluster throughout intensive care treatment. This may have important implications for prognostic or predictive enrichment.

However, this treatment strategy has not been examined in a large comparative series. The purpose of this study was to review our experience using preoperative embolization to understand the efficacy, technical considerations and complications of this technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of patients undergoing intracranial meningioma resection at our institution (March 2001 to December 2012). Comparisons were made between embolized and nonembolized patients, including patient and tumor characteristics, embolization method, operative blood loss, complications, and extent of resection. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors predictive of operative blood loss and extent of resection. RESULTS Preoperatively, 224 patients were referred for embolization, of which 177 received embolization. No complications were seen in 97.1%. There were no significant differences in operative duration, extent of resection, or complications. Estimated blood loss was higher in the embolized group (410 versus 315 mL, P=.0074), but history of embolization was not a predictor of blood loss in multivariate analysis. Independent predictors of blood loss included decreasing degree of tumor embolization (P=.037), skull base location (P=.005), and male sex (P=.034). Embolization was not an independent predictor of gross total resection. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative embolization is a safe option for selected meningiomas. In our series, embolization did not alter the operative duration, complications, or degree of resection, but the degree of embolization was an independent predictor of decreased operative blood loss.","output":"Preoperative embolization of intracranial meningiomas: efficacy, technical considerations, and complications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe the rapid conceptualization and implementation of an interdisciplinary epilepsy clinic for children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) at Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) during the COVID 19 pandemic. METHODS Focusing on care design and care coordination for children with DRE, multiple stakeholder groups decided to implement a clinic after the systematic rating of constructs present in a theoretical meta-analytic framework. Based on the projected success, the new interdisciplinary clinic (composed of an epileptologist, a neurosurgeon, and a neuropsychologist and coordinated by a full-time nurse) was established. Clinic operations were further refined through discussions with patients, families, and care providers. We collected data retrospectively (August 2020 to June 2021) to determine referral patterns, clinic scheduling metrics, patient characteristics, clinical recommendations, and epilepsy quality metrics. RESULTS Of the 32 Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs assessed, 24 were positively rated to predict a high probability of successful implementation of the clinic. For approximately 100 patient visits, appearance and usage rates were >75%, yielding a clinic utilization rate of approximately 60%. Among 76 unique patients (average age of 12 years, 60% focal epilepsy), 39 patients (51.3%) were deemed eligible for epilepsy surgery evaluation. The majority of the patients (53.9%) were advised for additional diagnostic testing, and 31.6% of patients were scheduled for vagus nerve stimulation.

However, conferences carry an ecological footprint due to greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, traditional conference formats have recently not been possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Herein we examine the carbon footprint associated with travel by presenting delegates to the Fall SPU conferences from 2013 to 2019, and the 2015 ESPU conference. METHODS: Online programs for the targeted SPU Fall meetings and the 2015 ESPU Annual Meeting were retrospectively reviewed. Variables collected included meeting location and presenter home base. Distance traveled by the presenter, and likely CO2e of this return trip were estimated using online calculators. Analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis-H test with pairwise comparisons to detect differences in round trip distances and CO2e between meeting locations. RESULTS: Six Fall SPU conferences and one ESPU conference were reviewed. The majority of presenters were from the region (North America and Europe, respectively), for both SPU and ESPU. The median round trip distance was 2596.34a?miles (IQR 1420.96-4438.30), and the median CO2e 0.61 metric tons (IQR 0.36-1.02). We found that the distances traveled to conferences in the Western USA and Europe were slightly further than those to conferences in Central Canada and the Southern US. The difference in CO2e between these locations did not achieve statistical significance.

SARS-CoV-2 related AKI and hypercoagulability are negative prognostic factors. The incidence of thromboembolic events is about 30%, of AKI up to 20%. We report a patient with severe AKI who required hemodialysis (HD) and developed a massive DVT developing from the femoral CVC, and belatedly testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of typical pulmonary involvement. METHOD: A 53-year-old male with a clinical history of hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, in therapy with metformin and ace-inhibitor, was admitted to our E.R. with diarrhea, nausea and vomiting for about 2 days. Main signs: ideomotor slowdown, mild hypohydration and reduced urine output (unrelevant sediment). Initial blood tests showed severe AKI with hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis and hyponatremia (sCreatinine 18.76 mg/dl, BUN 161 mg/dl, K+ 7.8 mmol/l, Na+ 128 mmol/L, HCO3- 9.8 mmol/l). Mild neutrophilic leukocytosis with lymphopenia was detected, with slightly increased inflammation indices (CRP 1.05 mg / dl, D-dimer 720 ng / ml). CT scan: absence of typical SARS-CoV-2 signs, normal kidneys, no dilation of urinary tract. SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test and the first molecular swab test were negative. After femoral CVC insertion, HD was needed for a few sessions. Broad range antibiotic therapy was also set. On Day 3: a second SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab test resulted negative. He never manifested fever or dyspnea. On Day 6, despite an improvement of renal function (sCr 2.7 mg/dl), the patient, although he walked, presented right leg pain with signs of DVT. Ultrasound and angio-CT scan documented peri-catheter DVT extended to the common femoral and external iliac vein and superficial femoral vein involvement, without pulmonary embolism. I.v. therapy with sodium heparin was therefore started with quite a difficulty in reaching the expected range. On day 8, massive flittene appeared, the CVC was removed and a caval filter was placed; marked neutrophilic leucocytosis and increased inflammatory indices (CRP 11.50 mg/dl) was documented. Nevertheless, thrombosis has progressed to the entire venous axis and the inferior cava. Through a tibial vein introducer local i.v. alteplase was also started. Just after, copious bleeding from the site of the removed CVC followed by haemorrhagic shock occurred and the patient was transferred to the ICU (D-dimer 219800 ng/ml). The same day a third swab for SARS-CoV-2 resulted positive while a further CT-scan did not show signs of virus-like interstitial pneumonia. On the following day (day 9) the patient underwent thrombus aspiration (Aspirex?S device) and fasciotomy of the right leg for a compartment syndrome. RESULTS: Despite the continuation of heparin, PTT ratio was never >1.5, with an extension of DVT and also involvement of the contralateral iliac vein, as well as a worsening of the clinical-laboratory picture and patients death on day 14. Serum complement, autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, ENA, ANTI-dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, AMA, anti-B-glycoprotein) and factor V Leiden test were normal. All blood cultures were found to be sterile. CONCLUSION: Our case confirms the heterogenicity of COVID-19 manifestations, often without pulmonary involvement. According to our experience from the onset of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 can also be found later in patients with already advanced organ damage. In this case, in the absence of other possible factors, AKI and intestinal involvement may have been early signs of COVID-19, with a virus initially not detectable in the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Furthermore, the increased thromboembolic risk of COVID-19 should not be underestimated in the presence of risk factors as external devices, also given the difficult management of anticoagulation target.

Sodium pyruvate was recently shown by us to decrease inflammasome activation during IAV infection. Here, we investigated sodium pyruvates effects on IAV in vivo. We found that nebulizing mice with sodium pyruvate decreased morbidity and weight loss during infection. Additionally, treated mice consumed more chow during infection indicating improved symptoms. There were notable improvements in pro-inflammatory cytokine production (IL-1) and lower virus titers on days 7 post-infection in mice treated with sodium pyruvate compared to control animals.

When compared with non-severe patients, severe patients were more likely to have decreased lymphocyte counts (0.610?/L vs 1.110?/L, p<0.001), eosinopaenia (<0.0210?/L; 73% vs 24%, p<0.001), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (471.0 U/L vs 230.0 U/L, p<0.001) and elevated interleukin 6 level (47.4 pg/mL vs 5.7 pg/mL, p=0.002) on admission. Eosinopaenia and elevated LDH were significantly associated with disease severity in both univariate and multivariate regression models including the above variables. Moreover, eosinophil count and LDH level tended to return to normal range over time in both groups after treatment and severe patients recovered slower than non-severe patients, especially in eosinophil count. CONCLUSIONS: Eosinopaenia and elevated LDH are potential predictors of disease severity in patients with COVID-19 with underlying chronic airway diseases. In addition, they could indicate disease progression and treatment effectiveness.","output":"Decreased eosinophil counts and elevated lactate dehydrogenase predict severe COVID-19 in patients with underlying chronic airway diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The epidemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection has presented as a critical period.

Given the challenges in implementing widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, there is increasing interest in alternative surveillance strategies. Methods: We tested nasopharyngeal swabs from 821 decedents in the Wayne County Medical Examiner's office for SARS-CoV-2. All decedents were assessed by a COVID-19 checklist, and decedents flagged by the checklist (237) were preferentially tested. A random sample of decedents not flagged by the checklist were also tested (584). We statistically analyzed the characteristics of decedents (age, sex, race, and manner of death), differentiating between those flagged by the checklist and not and between those SARS-CoV-2 positive and not. Results: Decedents were more likely to be male (70% vs 48%) and Black (55% vs 36%) than the catchment population. Seven-day average percent positivity among flagged decedents closely matched the trajectory of percent positivity in the catchment population, particularly during the peak of the outbreak (March and April). After a lull in May to mid-June, new positive tests in late June coincided with increased case detection in the catchment. We found large racial disparities in test results: despite no statistical difference in the racial distribution between those flagged and not, SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were substantially more likely to be Black (89% vs 51%). SARS-CoV-2 positive decedents were also more likely to be older and to have died of natural causes, including of COVID-19 disease.

Guidance has been presented on the management of persons with IBD in the time of this pandemic by different groups. We aimed to determine how gastroenterologists around the world were approaching the management of IBD. METHODS: Members of the World Gastroenterology Organization (WGO) IBD Task Force contacted colleagues in countries largely beyond North America and Europe, inviting them to review the WGO website for IBD and COVID-19 introduction, with links to guideline documents, and then to respond to 9 ancillary open-ended management questions. RESULTS: Fifty-two gastroenterologists from 33 countries across 6 continents completed the survey (April 14 to May 16, 2020). They were all adhering for the most part to published guidelines on IBD management in the COVID-19 era. Some differences and reductions in services related to access, and some related to approach within their communities in terms of limiting virus spread. In particular, most gastroenterologists reduced in-person clinics (43 of 52), limited steroid use (47 of 51), limited elective endoscopy (45 of 52), and limited elective surgeries (48 of 51). If a patient was diagnosed with COVID-19, immunomodulatory therapy was mostly held. CONCLUSIONS: In most countries, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the approach to persons with IBD. The few exceptions were mostly based on low burden of COVID-19 in individual communities.

The PCV2 capsid (Cap) protein is a leading antigen candidate for vaccine and serological diagnostic testing, due to its immunogenic properties. In this study, the codon-optimized PCV2 Cap gene was cloned into a pPICZA vector for secretory expression in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris after methanol induction. The screening of recombinant yeasts was followed by detection of the recombinant Cap (rCap) protein by Western blot, using sera from pigs naturally infected with PCV2. The rCap secreted protein was used without prior purification as a coating antigen in the ELISA test, with high discrimination between PCV2-positive and negative sera. These results reveal a high confidence in the specific immunoreactivity of the secreted antigen and show the antigenicity of the recombinant protein. The feasibility of the P. pastoris expression system for the production of PCV2 Cap as secreted protein and its apparent bioactivity, suggests there are good prospects for the use of this antigen in the investigation of PCV2 infections and testing for vaccine purposes.","output":"Secretory expression of Porcine Circovirus Type 2 capsid protein in Pichia pastoris."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to report the virtualization experience of the 81st Brazilian Nursing Week of a public university in the state of Rio de Janeiro.

Factor analysis was used to investigate the factors related to symptoms of COVID-19. Based on the combination of factors, the clinical types of the factors were defined according to our professional knowledge. Factor loadings were calculated, and pairwise correlation analysis of symptoms was performed. RESULTS Factor analysis showed that the clinical symptoms of COVID-19 cases could be divided into respiratory-digestive, neurological, cough-wheezing, upper respiratory, and digestive symptoms. Pairwise correlation analysis showed that there were a total of eight pairs of symptoms: fever-palpitation, coughexpectoration, expectoration-wheezing, dry mouth-bitter taste in the mouth, poor appetite-fatigue, fatiguedizziness, diarrhea-palpitation, and dizziness-headache.

Multiplex RT-PCR (SeeplexTM RV detection, Seegene) was performed to detected 12 respiratory viral pathogens. RESULTS: A total of 607 hospitalized patients were enrolled from 2011 to 2013. Viruses were identified in 35.75 % (217/607) of cases, including 78 influenza virus A and B (IVA and IVB), 47 para-influenza viruses (PIVs), 41 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and 38 adenovirus (ADV). For the children under 15 year old, the common detected viruses were influenza viruses, RSV, PIVS and ADV, while the principal respiratory viruses were human coronaviruses (HCoV), PIVs, influenza viruses for the old adults. Co-infections with multiple viruses were detected in 15.67 % of patients. Children under 5 years were more likely to have one or more detectable virus associated with their ARI.

The impact of boosting market of automobile vehicles in China during last decade on thoracic injury needs to be defined. This study aimed to review and analyze the demographic and clinical characteristics of RTCR thoracic injuries in China. METHODS: Clinical records of patients with thoracic trauma admitted to thoracic surgery department between January 2003 and June 2020 were retrospectively retrieved and reviewed. Patients profiles and clinical characteristics were comparatively analyzed between road traffic crashes caused injury and other injury mechanisms, and in RTCR chest trauma patients before January 2011 (2003 group), and after January 2011 (2011 group), when is considered as the beginning year of Chinese household vehicle era. RESULTS: The study included 5095 thoracic trauma patients with mean age of 50.2 years, of whom 79.4% were male. Most of the patients (70.3%, n = 3583) had rib fractures. Associated injuries were present in 52.0% of the patients, of them 78.5% (n = 2080) were extremity fractures. Road traffic crashes accounted for 41.4% (n = 2108) of the injuries, most of them (98.0%) were related to motor vehicles. In comparison with other chest trauma mechanisms, RTCR chest injuries affected females and older males more frequently, with a higher incidence of rib fractures and sternum fractures, and higher injury severity scores (ISS) (all p < 0.05). Surgeries were required in 1495 (70.9%) patients of the RRTCR chest traumas, while the majority of non-RTCR thoracic injuries were managed conservatively or with tube thoracostomy (30.2%, n = 901). RTCR chest traumas caused longer hospital stay (13.0  9.6 days vs. 11.8  7.4 days, p = 0.001), higher ICU usage (30.7% vs. 19.6%, p = 0.001), higher rate of ventilator support (12.9% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.001), and higher mortalities (3.8% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.005) than that of non-RTRA chest injuries. For RTCR patients, when compared with 2003 group, 2011 group had similar patterns in terms of accident category, associated injury and treatment. However, 2011 group had more females (38.5% vs. 18.0%, p = 0.001) and older males (50.6  9.7 vs. 47.9  17.2, p = 0.001), with a higher ISS (18.3  10.2 vs. 17.1  8.9, p = 0.004), and fewer were managed with chest tubes (25.0% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.031). Clinical outcomes were not significantly different between the groups in terms of hospital length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) usage, ICU length of stay, duration of ventilator hours and mortality. However, the 2011 group had more patients requiring ventilator support (14.4% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: Road traffic crashes remain to be the major etiology of thoracic injuries in China, which usually affects middle-aged males, causing rib fractures with concomitant injuries frequently occurring to other organ systems. Treatments mainly include tube thoracotomy and surgical procedures. Although the clinical characteristics and outcomes of traffic accident related chest traumas are largely unchanged in spite of the rapid increasing numbers of motor vehicles, variations in the pattern of injuries by gender, age, injury severity and ventilator usage may still provide important information for targeted management.","output":"Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of road traffic crashes related thoracic traumas: analysis of 5095 hospitalized chest injury patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although we have enough and cumulative information about acute effects of COVID-19, our knowledge is extremely limited about long-term consequences of COVID-19, in terms of its impacts and burdens on patients, families, and the health system.

Older adults have been identified as being at higher risk of poor outcomes if infected and in many countries have been subjected to greater restrictions on physical contacts with others. Most research so far points towards an increase in loneliness during the pandemic. However, there has been a lack of prospective studies based on representative samples of older adults, with the oldest old, older adults with low or no Internet usage, and those in poor health currently underrepresented. Despite the significance of cultural norms for individuals' standards for social relations and, thus, the experience of loneliness, there has been a lack of comparative research on loneliness in older adults during the pandemic. Reviews have found little evidence for what interventions and what elements of interventions are effective in reducing loneliness. There is potential for social relations to be maintained via technology-based solutions, although there is a risk of excluding older adults with limited resources who are both least likely to use technology and most vulnerable to loneliness. Furthermore, remote social contacts cannot fully compensate for the loss of physical contacts. Where stay-at-home orders are not imposed, supporting neighbourliness and the community use of accessible open spaces are other options. Finally, policy responses to the pandemic need to be more nuanced and non-ageist in order to avoid unnecessary increases in loneliness in older adults.","output":"Loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the circumstance in which people worldwide have to encounter and deal with COVID-19, there are great impacts on learning management that require adjustment and implementation of the online learning system. Advance technologies in the modern world facilitate the students at the higher education level to learn via the online system.

We identified brain organoid studies that provided insight into the neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV-2.

Conversely, choroidal epithelial cells consistently showed a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Brain organoid studies also elucidated potential mechanism for cellular entry, demonstrated viral replication, and highlighted downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, they suggest that the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 may be contributed by both direct neuronal invasion and indirect consequences of neuroinflammation.

We included only 25 hospitalized mother-infant dyads that fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of PD and tested mothers on their mental functioning (empathy, theory of mind, meta-cognition and alexithymia). RESULTS: Behavioral interaction analyses indicated that mothers with PD were prone to inactive maternal behavior, less positive maternal behavior along with more rejective behavior and also disengaged affect towards the infant. Distortions in mothers' mental functioning may have had an influence on the dysfunctional patterns of mother-infant dyads.

In addition to several novels and repurposed monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a therapeutic option against COVID-19, scientists from across the world have developed several candidate vaccines, developed mainly targeting the Wuhan strain, with very promising results to combat this pandemic. Unfortunately like any RNA viruses, SARS CoV-2 has also gone through the accumulation of hundreds and thousands of mutations in their genome lead to the development of several variants of concerns (VOC) and variants of interests (VOI), resulting in increased transmissibility and virulence of the virus, along with their capacity to escape cross-protection. Seemingly, the main hindrance of containing this pandemic right now is the effectiveness of currently available vaccines and mAbs against newly emerging variants. Therefore, it is important to monitor variants epidemiology, transmission dynamics, clinical characteristics, as well as their immune evasion capacity to implement appropriate vaccine strategy and other containment measures. BODY: In this review, we tried to focus on variants characteristics and to what extent they can escape immunity, provided by both available vaccinated sera and convalescent sera. A stringent literature review was performed using various databases, mentioned in the methodology portion. The current geographical distribution of these variants of SARS CoV-2 has been presented using a heat map. Findings from published articles comparing these variants, in terms of genome epidemiology, transmissibility, viral load dynamics, and association with different waves have been described briefly. Due strength was given while describing variants neutralization potency against current vaccines, mAbs, and also against convalescent sera. Data from both clinical trials and in vitro/ex-vivo studies have been discussed here. Comparative findings from several articles were brought into one concise paper. After careful reviewing of all the available data, it was clear that, without hesitation, we should strengthen our vaccination strategy, because the severity of COVID 19 is reasonably lower, irrespective of variants and vaccine used. CONCLUSION: We hope that many falsified myths and beliefs regarding vaccine immunity and emerging variants will be clarified in light of this available evidence, which we summarized in our paper.","output":"A review of epidemiology, clinical features and disease course, transmission dynamics, and neutralization efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Amidst COVID-19 pandemic, many states have issued stay at home advisories and non-essential business closures to limit public exposure.

Despite the potential benefits of SP, the effectiveness of this complex intervention remains uncertain. This paper presents the study protocol of the evaluation of the first SP project in Portugal. METHODS: A mixed-methods study will be conducted to evaluate the SP project. For the quantitative component, a longitudinal, prospective study with a pre-post design will be performed. Data on patients referred to SP will be collected in four different points in time throughout the intervention, using questionnaires on patients health status and sociodemographic characteristics, and scales on patients well-being, quality of life and activation. The secondary data will be collected using patients medical records and SPs forms about the referral and social responses elaborated within the intervention. Semi-structured interviews with patients and focus groups with stakeholders will be conducted to assess experiences of participation and improvement suggestions on SP. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive and complementary evidence will provide insights and learning for the implementation of future SP interventions. This can contribute to inform policy and practice, and to increase investment in social prescribing interventions.","output":"Evaluation of the Impact and Implementation of Social Prescribing in Primary Healthcare Units in Lisbon: A Mixed-Methods Study Protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA betacoronavirus with a high mutation rate. The rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants could increase transmissibility and diminish vaccine protection. However, whether coinfection with multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants exists remains controversial. This study collected 12,986 and 4,113 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID database on May 11, 2020 (GISAID20May11), and Apr 1, 2021 (GISAID21Apr1), respectively. With single-nucleotide variant (SNV) and network clique analyses, we constructed single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) coexistence networks and discovered maximal SNP cliques of sizes 16 and 34 in the GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 datasets, respectively. Simulating the transmission routes and SNV accumulations, we discovered a linear relationship between the size of the maximal clique and the number of coinfected variants. We deduced that the COVID-19 cases in GISAID20May11 and GISAID21Apr1 were coinfections with 3.20 and 3.42 variants on average, respectively. Additionally, we performed Nanopore sequencing on 42 COVID-19 patients and discovered recurrent heterozygous SNPs in twenty of the patients, including loci 8,782 and 28,144, which were crucial for SARS-CoV-2 lineage divergence.

METHODS: Twenty-nine patients that underwent unilateral rTSA (19 females, 10 males) and 31 healthy volunteers evaluated for JPS of shoulder using a dedicated high accuracy electronic goniometer. Error of active reproduction of joint position (EARJP) was assessed at the following reference positions: 30, 60, 90, and 120 for forward flexion and abduction and 15, 30, and 45 for internal and external rotation in rTSA, contralateral non-operated, and control shoulders. RESULTS: Results of EPRJP for rTSA, contralateral, and control (respectively) are as follows:Forward flexion: 30 = (8.0  5.7, 9.8  6.1, and 4.9  3.0), 60 = (5.0  2.8, 5.9  2.7, and 5.1  3.2), 90 = (3.1  1.6, 5.5  2.6, and 3.2  1.4), and 120 = (3.4  2.1, 5.6  4.0, and 3.5  1.7)Abduction: 30 = (5.2  2.5, 9.1  6.1, and 4.6  2.3), 60 = (5.2  3.6, 6.6  4.1, and 5.3  3.1), 90 = (3.8  2.0; 7.4  5.5, and 4.1  1.9), and 120 = (5.3  2.9, 7.7  5.3, and 4.2  1.9)Internal rotation: 15 = (4.3  3.1, 6.2  4.4, and 2.8  1.2), 30 = (3.2  1.9, 4.5  2.3, and 3.3  1.4), and 45 = (3.5  2.0, 4.1  1.8, and 2.8  1.0)External rotation: 15 = (3.0  1.7, 4.2  2.2, and 3.6  1.4) and 30 = (3.1  1.5, 3.8  2.6, and 3.4  1.6)The results showed significantly better JPS (lower EPRJP) in shoulders following rTSA and normal control shoulders comparing with the patient's contralateral shoulder. The explanation can be that rTSA improves joint kinematics and stability, which allows better muscular performance and proprioception feedback.

There has been a concern about new onset or worsening of gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) following LSG. OBJECTIVE The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of surgically treating hiatal weakness on GERD symptoms in patients undergoing LSG. SETTING Single tertiary referral institution, Sydney, Australia. METHODS A prospective observational cohort study was conducted with consecutive patients undergoing LSG. Hiatal findings, patient demographics, medications and reflux score were recorded prospectively. Patients were followed up post-operatively for a minimum of 12 months and assessed using GERD-HRQL score to quantify reflux symptoms. RESULTS Data from 100 patients with a minimum of 1-year follow-up were analysed. Mean follow-up was 18.9 months. Overall, GERD-HRQL improved from mean 4.5  5.8 pre-operatively to 0.76  1.5 after 18.9 months (p = 0.0001). For those with pre-operative reflux, GERD-HRQL improved from mean (SD) 8.43  6.26 pre-operatively to 0.94  1.55 (p = 0.0001). All the nine patients with troublesome daily reflux significantly improved. For those without pre-operative reflux, GERD-HRQL improved from 0.88  1.37 to 0.47  1.25 (p-ns) post-operatively. On multivariate analysis, higher pre-operative reflux and dysphagia/bloat scores, younger age and lower percentage excess weight loss after 18.9 months were associated with GERD-HRQL improvement.

The threat of a public health emergency catalyzed underlying xenophobic sentiments, manifesting them into racial discrimination of various degrees. With most discriminatory acts reported in liberal societies, this article investigates whether an economy more open to trade and migration can be more susceptible to xenophobia. Using our first-hand survey data of 1767 Chinese respondents residing overseas from 65 different countries during February of 2020, we adopt an instrumental variable strategy to identify the causal effect of openness to trade and migration of their residence country on the likelihood of them receiving discriminatory behaviors during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results show that greater openness to trade increases the likelihood of reported xenophobic behaviors, while openness to migration decreases it. On the other hand, stronger trade or immigration relationships with China are associated with less reported discrimination. And these effects primarily influence discriminatory behavior in interpersonal spaces, rather than through media outlets.

However, the diagnosis of SS remains difficult because the clinical triad rarely occurs at disease onset, and symptom severity varies. SS symptoms often suggest other diseases, in particular multiple sclerosis (MS), which is more common. Misdiagnosing SS as MS may cause serious complications because MS drugs, such as interferon beta-1a, can worsen the course of SS. This case report confirms previous reports that the use of interferon beta-1a in the course of misdiagnosed MS may lead to exacerbation of SS. Moreover, our case report shows that glatiramer acetate may also exacerbate the course of SS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of exacerbation of SS by glatiramer acetate. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case report of a patient with a primary diagnosis of MS who developed symptoms of SS during interferon beta-1a treatment for MS; these symptoms were resolved after the discontinuation of the treatment. Upon initiation of glatiramer acetate treatment, the patient developed the full clinical triad of SS. The diagnosis of MS was excluded, and glatiramer acetate therapy was discontinued. The patients neurological state improved only after the use of a combination of corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and azathioprine. CONCLUSIONS: The coincidence of SS signs and symptoms with treatment for MS, first with interferon beta-1a and then with glatiramer acetate, suggests that these drugs may influence the course of SS. This case report indicates that treatment with glatiramer acetate may modulate or even exacerbate the course of SS.","output":"Manifestation of Susac syndrome during interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate treatment for misdiagnosed multiple sclerosis: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a global threat that influenced healthcare systems around the world.

The experiment varied test provider (public clinic versus international health organization), proximity to illness, and a confidentiality reassurance. We find that Malawians expect higher uptake of testing in their community when the international health organization offered the test rather than a public clinic, an effect we attribute to higher trust in the organization and/or perceptions of greater capacity to ensure procedural integrity. The confidentiality reassurance did not substantially alter beliefs about the privacy of results, but did increase doubts about the willingness of community members to get tested in a public health clinic.

Although triggering of anti-viral immune responses is essential for clearance of infection, some patients have severe lung inflammation and multiorgan failure due to marked immune cell dysregulation and cytokine storm syndrome. Importantly, the activation of cytotoxic follicular helper T cells and a reduction of regulatory T cells have a crucial, negative prognostic role. These findings lead to the question of whether immunosuppressive and biologic therapies for gastrointestinal diseases affect the incidence or prognosis of COVID-19 and, thus, whether they should be adjusted to prevent or affect the course of the disease. In this Review, data on the use of such therapies are discussed with a primary focus on inflammatory bowel disease, autoimmune hepatitis and liver transplantation. In particular, the roles of corticosteroids, classic immunosuppressive agents (such as thiopurines and mycophenolate mofetil), small molecules (such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors), and biologic agents (such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) blockers, vedolizumab and ustekinumab) are reviewed. Finally, the use of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines for the prevention of infection in patients with gastrointestinal diseases and concomitant immunosuppressive or biologic therapy will be discussed.","output":"COVID-19: biologic and immunosuppressive therapy in gastroenterology and hepatology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: While myriads of studies have suggested that a survey of wound pH environment could indicate wound healing activities, it is not clear whether wound alkalinity can be used as a prognostic indicator of nonhealing wounds. Currently available systems cannot reliably assess the pH environment across wounds, which is the objective of this study. Approach: A disposable device, DETEC? pH, was developed and characterized on its ability to map wound alkalinity by pressing a freshly recovered wound dressing against its test surface. By comparing the wound's alkalinity and size reduction rates (7 days) following pH measurement, we assessed the capability of wound alkalinity to prognosticate subsequent short-term wound size reduction rates. Results: The device had high accuracy and specificity in determining the alkalinity of simulated wound fluids soaked onto wound dressing. The type of wound dressing type had an insignificant effect on its detection sensitivity. Upon testing discarded wound dressings from human patients, the device quickly determined alkaline and acidic wounds. Finally, statistical analyses of wound size reduction rates in wounds with various alkalinities confirmed that wound alkalinity has a strong influence on, at least, short-term wound healing activity. Innovation: Without directly contacting the patient, this device provides a quick assessment of wound alkalinity to prognosticate immediate and short-term wound healing activities. Conclusion: DETEC? pH may serve as a prognosis device for wound care specialists during routine wound assessment to predict wound healing progress. This information can assist the decision-making process in a clinical setting and augur well for chronic wound treatment. DETEC? pH can also be used as an aid for home health care nurses or health care providers to screen nonhealing wounds outside clinics.","output":"A Device to Predict Short-Term Healing Outcome of Chronic Wounds."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With improvements in personnel and vehicular body armor, robust casualty evacuation capabilities, and damage control resuscitation strategies, more combat casualties are surviving to reach higher levels of care throughout the casualty evacuation system. As such, medical centers are becoming more accustomed to managing the deleterious late consequences of combat trauma related to the dysregulation of the immune system. In this review, we aim to highlight these late consequences and identify areas for future research and therapeutic strategies. Trauma leads to the dysregulation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses, which places the injured at risk for several late consequences, including delayed wound healing, late onset sepsis and infection, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which are significant for their association with the increased morbidity and mortality of wounded personnel. The mechanisms by which these consequences develop are complex but include an imbalance of the immune system leading to robust inflammatory responses, triggered by the presence of damage-associated molecules and other immune-modifying agents following trauma. Treatment strategies to improve outcomes have been difficult to develop as the immunophenotype of injured personnel following trauma is variable, fluid and difficult to determine. As more information regarding the triggers that lead to immune dysfunction following trauma is elucidated, it may be possible to identify the immunophenotype of injured personnel and provide targeted treatments to reduce the late consequences of trauma, which are known to lead to significant morbidity and mortality.","output":"Late immune consequences of combat trauma: a review of trauma-related immune dysfunction and potential therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral infectious diseases represent a major threat to public health and are among the greatest disease burdens worldwide. Rapid and accurate identification of viral agents is crucial for both outbreak control and estimating regional disease burdens. Recently developed metagenomic methods have proven to be powerful tools for simultaneous pathogen detection. Here, we performed a systematic study of the capability of the short-read-based metagenomic approach in the molecular detection of viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections (n = 16). Using the high-throughput capacity of ultradeep sequencing and a dedicated data interpretation method, we successfully identified seven species of known respiratory viral agents from 15 samples, a result that was consistent with results of conventional PCR assays. We also detected a coinfected case that was missed by regular PCR testing. Using the metagenomic data, 11 draft genomes of the abundantly detected viruses in the samples were reconstructed with 21.84% to 98.53% coverage. Our results show the power of the short-read-based metagenomic approach for accurate and parallel screening of viral pathogens. Although there are some inherent difficulties in applying this approach to clinical samples, including a lack of controls, limited specimen quantity, and high contamination rate, our work will facilitate further application of this unprecedented high-throughput method to clinical samples.","output":"Unbiased parallel detection of viral pathogens in clinical samples by use of a metagenomic approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is characterized by hypoxia-reoxygenation, reported to be a critical risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This experiment aimed to evaluate the direct effects of IH on the human nasal mucosa. METHODS: The direct effects of IH on the human nasal mucosa was evaluated by measuring the ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and expression levels of inflammatory cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-). The normoxia group was exposed to a normoxic condition for 72 h. The IH group was exposed to 288 cycles of IH (1 cycle: hypoxia, 5 min; subsequent normoxia, 10 min) for 72 h. CBF was measured using an automated computer-based video image processing technique. Changes in the expression of cytokines were assessed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The normoxia group revealed a persistent CBF pattern and a physiological range of inflammatory cytokines. However, the IH group showed a cyclic decrease in CBF and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. Cytotoxicity assay indicated no difference in the survival rates between the two groups.

Therefore, the ultimate decision for surgery, should be based on which is the safest, quickest route and concurrently ensuring that HCWs are protected during these surgeries. During the time of crisis, HCWs need to concentrate and channel resources to the care of those affected by the coronavirus hence judicious allocation of resources is mandatory. We present the guidelines and recommendations on gynecological laparoscopic surgery during this COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thorough search of articles and recommendations were done to look into the characteristics of the virus in terms of transmission and risks during surgery. Smoke plume characteristics, composition and risk of viral transmission were also studied. Search includes The WHO Library, Cochrane Library and electronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar and Science Direct). CONCLUSION: We concluded that there is no scientific basis of shunning laparoscopic approach in surgical intervention. Ultimately, the guiding principles would be of reducing the anesthetic and surgical duration, the availability of full protective gear for HCWs during the surgery and the status of the patient.

From a common database prepared for COVID-19, we retrieved the relevant data and compared the clinical findings and outcomes of PCR-positive patients with those of PCR-negative cases who had been diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical and radiographic findings. RESULTS: A total of 349 patients were included in the analysis, of which 126 (36.1%) were PCR-negative. PCR-negative patients were younger (54.6  20.8 vs. 60.8  18.9 years, P = .009) but were similar to PCR-positive patients in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and presenting symptoms.

In addition, the emergence of new variants can potentially render vaccines with a relatively limited utility. Many investigators have attempted to elucidate the precise pathophysiological mechanisms causing COVID-19 respiratory and systemic disease. Spillover of lung-derived cytokines causing a cytokine storm is considered the cause of systemic disease. However, recent studies have provided contradictory evidence, whereby the extent of cytokine storm is insufficient to cause severe illness. These issues are highly relevant, as management approaches considering COVID-19 a classic form of acute respiratory distress syndrome with a cytokine storm could translate to unfounded clinical decisions, detrimental to patient trajectory.

Due to drug resistance and side effects of the conventional antiviral drugs, repurposing the available natural compounds with high tolerability and fewer side effects has attracted researchers attention. The aim of this study was to screen in vitro anti-influenza activity of three anionic compounds ascorbate, acetate, and citrate. METHODS: The non-cytotoxic concentration of the compounds was determined by MTT assay and examined for the activity against IAV in simultaneous, pre-, and post-penetration combination treatments over 1 h incubation on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cell line. The virus titer and viral load were determined using hemagglutination assay (HA) and qPCR, respectively. Few pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated at RNA and protein levels by qPCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: The non-cytotoxic concentrations of the ascorbate (200 mg/ml), acetate and citrate (both 3 mg/ml) reduced the viral titer by 6.5, 4.5, and 1.5 logs in the simultaneous combination treatment. The M protein gene copy number decreased significantly in simultaneous treatment (P < 0.01). The expression of cytokines was also affected by the treatment of these compounds.

Failure to clearly and consistently retract research has several risks, for example discredited or erroneous research may inform health research studies (e.g. clinical trials), policies and practices, potentially rendering these unreliable. OBJECTIVE: To investigate consistency and clarity of research retraction, based on a case study of retracted Covid-19 research. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of retracted Covid-19 articles reporting empirical research findings, based on searches of Medline, Embase and Scopus on 10(th) July and 19(th) December 2020. KEY RESULTS: We included 46 retracted Covid-19 articles. The number eligible for inclusion nearly doubled, from 26 to 46, in five months. Most articles (67%) were retracted from scientific journals and the remainder from preprint servers. Key findings: (1) reasons for retraction were not reported in 33% (15/46) of cases; (2) time from publication to retraction could not be determined in 43% (20/46) of cases; (3) More than half (59%) of retracted Covid-19 articles (27/46) remained available as original unmarked electronic documents after retraction (33% as full text and 26% as an abstract only). Sources of articles post-retraction were preprint servers, ResearchGate and, less commonly, websites including PubMed Central and the World Health Organization. A retracted journal article which controversially claimed a link between 5G technology and Covid-19 remains available in its original full text from at least 60 different websites. CONCLUSIONS: The retraction process is inconsistent and often ambiguous, with more than half of retracted Covid-19 research articles remaining available, unmarked, from a wide range of online sources. There is an urgent need to improve guidance on the retraction process and to extend this to cover preprint servers.

METHODS: We introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios. RESULTS: We derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed. CONCLUSIONS: This work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors.

The present study uses a sequential explanatory QUAN-qual design to investigate whether people who felt that their lives had changed for the better after being forced to engage in physical distancing, what factors predicted such well-being, and how they spent their time to generate this sense of well-being.

An extreme-case content analysis of participants' personal projects found that participants with low self-transcendent wisdom reported more survival-oriented projects (e.g., acquiring groceries or engaging in distracting entertainments), while participants reporting high self-transcendent wisdom reported more projects involving deepening interactions with other people, especially family.

Our data spans 14 years of tweets from 122K Twitter profiles and more than 293M tweets. From this data, we selected the most extreme profiles in terms of consistency of toxic content and examined their tweet texts, and the domains, hashtags, and URLs they shared. We found that these selected profiles keep to a narrow theme with lower diversity in hashtags, URLs, and domains, they are thematically similar to each other (in a coordinated manner, if not through intent), and have a high likelihood of bot-like behavior (likely to have progenitors with intentions to influence). Our work contributes a substantial and longitudinal online misbehavior dataset to the research community and establishes the consistency of a profile's toxic behavior as a useful factor when exploring misbehavior as potential accessories to influence operations on OSNs.","output":"A deep dive into the consistently toxic 1% of Twitter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 pandemic was associated to fear among patients, doctors and nurses, it was responsible of a work impairment in health structures organisation All patients were at home, only Covid patients were at hospital Our country has a quick reaction, we declared the pandemic as a social disease with free management All hospital had the order to create their own Covid-19 circuit We report the experience of our hospital in the crisis management with the creation of the circuit, its organisation, the management of the different financial, technical, human, sanitary, psychological and logistical aspects The great point of this crisis was the fear, stress of caregivers for themselves and their families The other point for members of Covid Cell was the race against time, the learning of a new job: a manager or a polyvalent chief The presence of a Covid-19 circuit is necessary for each hospital at the epidemic time but it must be managed by infectious diseases doctors, lung specialists, intensive care givers and emergency room caregivers in collaboration An enhancement of the structures is necessary at the level of medical wards and beds of intensive care ? 2020, Maison du Medicine All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 circuit management: La rabta experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viral reproduction of SARS-CoV-2 provides opportunities for the acquisition of advantageous mutations, altering viral transmissibility, disease severity, and/or allowing escape from natural or vaccine-derived immunity.

The micro-mesopore structure possessed unique spatial effect; micropores played a dominant role in adsorption process, especially narrow micropores (pore size  1.0 nm) emerged stronger adsorptive force toward toluene molecules due to overlapping attractive forces from neighboring pore walls. And mesopores not only displayed excellent transport diffusion but also provided adsorption sites. Additionally, the high graphitization degree enhanced the interaction between graphene layer equipped electron-rich regions and -electrons on the aromatic ring by the - conjugated effect. The hydroxyl and carbonyl functional groups served as chemisorption sites and led to higher adsorption amounts. Fortunately, the regeneration can be achieved by thermal treatment at the low temperature ( 150 C) or even gas purging at room temperature (20 C), which avoided an explosion accident in the process of high-temperature regeneration.","output":"Control of pore structure and surface chemistry of activated carbon derived from waste Zanthoxylum bungeanum branches for toluene removal in air."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We apply topological data analysis, specifically the Mapper algorithm, to the U.S. COVID-19 data.

METHODS: Using Amazons Mechanical Turk, we crowdsourced public opinions regarding aesthetic interventions from April 30 to May 3, 2020. The survey assessed prior experience with and interest in 6 aesthetic interventions before and during the pandemic and reasons for changing interest. United States residents aged 18 years and over who passed the attention check were included. RESULTS: We included 704 of 838 total responses. One-half of respondents were female; the median age group was 25 to 34 years. During the pandemic, 21% of respondents had increased and 33% decreased interest in at least one intervention. Non-invasive procedures (7.3%), facial aesthetic surgery (6.6%), and medical-grade skincare (5.9%) elicited the greatest interest increase. Seeing themselves in the mirror more often (43.2%), desire to look better after the crisis (41.8%), and increased time on social media (40.4%) were the top reasons for increased interest. The most common reasons for decreased interest were changing spending priorities (58%), focusing on other health aspects (49.8%), and worrying about infection in medical facilities (46.3%). Almost one-half of respondents considered virtual consultations for interventions of increased interest. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected interest in medical aesthetics.

Therefore, ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) may complicate the course of the disease. The aim of the current article was to investigate possible predictive factors for bacterial VAP on a retrospective manner, in a cohort of mechanically ventilated CoViD-19 patients. Additionally, determinant factors of lethality were analysed. Methods Medical records of patients hospitalized in the intensive care units (ICU) at the university hospital UZ Brussel during the epidemic were reviewed. VAP was defined following the National Healthcare Safety Network 2017 criteria. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions analyses were performed. Results Among the 39 patients included in the study, 54% were diagnosed with bacterial VAP. Case fatality rate was 44%, but 59% of the deceased patients had a do-not-resuscitate status. Multivariate logistic regression for prediction of VAP showed significant differences in duration of ICU hospitalisation and in minimal lung compliance. Additional analyses were performed on CoViD-19 patients who were affected by bacterial respiratory superinfection. The responsible pathogens correspond to the commonly found bacteria in VAP. However, 71% of the isolated germs were multi-drug resistant and bacteraemia was reported in 38%. Multivariate analyses for prediction of lethality found significant difference in SOFA score. Conclusions Mechanically ventilated CoViD-19 patients might frequently develop VAP. Longer ICU hospitalization was associated with pulmonary superinfection in the current cohort. Moreover, decreased minimal lung compliance was correlated to VAP and higher SOFA score at VAP diagnosis was associated with lethality.","output":"Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in Coronavirus 2019 disease, a retrospective monocentric cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We develop a variant of intervention analysis designed to measure a change in the law of motion for the distribution of individuals in a cross-section, rather than modeling the moments of the distribution. To calculate a counterfactual forecast, we discretize the distribution and employ a Markov model in which the transition probabilities are modeled as a multinomial logit distribution. Our approach is scalable and is designed to be applied to micro-level data. A wide panel often carries with it several imperfections that complicate the analysis when using traditional time-series methods; our framework accommodates these imperfections. The result is a framework rich enough to detect intervention effects that not only shift the mean, but also those that shift higher moments, while leaving lower moments unchanged. We apply this framework to document the changes in credit usage of consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider multinomial logit models of the dependence of credit card balances with categorical variables representing monthly seasonality, homeownership status, and credit scores. We find that, relative to our forecasts, consumers have greatly reduced their use of credit.

Health-care professionals who use and believe in mobile health applications are more likely to encourage and empower their patients to use it. Likewise, students in health-profession related specialties who use mobile health applications are more likely to continue to do so when they join the workforce. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the rate of adoption of mobile health applications in students in health colleges, identify the types of health applications used by health students, and identify the barriers that prevent the use of mobile health applications. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among university students. Students were invited to participate in a self-administrated survey from five health colleges. The survey included questions about the pattern of utilization, the purpose of the health-related application being used, and the barriers to adoption. The analysis included descriptive statistics using SPSS. Results: A total of 383 students participated in this study. The within gender comparison showed that more female students were using health-related applications 59.8% compared to male students 49%. The most frequent purpose of using mobile health applications were tracking physical activities 72.5% followed by counting calories intake 44%. We also identified the frequency and duration of use as well as the factors which may impact students intention to use. Conclusion: Fitness and dietary related applications were more common which might be explained by the fact that we only included a younger age group.

It may be a useful and inexpensive way to identify individuals before further decline in bone mineral density and the risk of fracture. PURPOSE: Self-reported physical functional health may predict bone mineral density (BMD) and thus provide a method to identify people at risk of low BMD. In this study, the association between the 36-item short-form questionnaire (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) score and future BMD in participants aged 40C79 years enrolled in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer-Norfolk study was investigated. METHODS: Associations between a participants SF-36 PCS score, measured 18 months after baseline health check, and broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUAa measure of BMD), measured 2C5 years after baseline, were examined using sex-specific linear and logistic regression analyses adjusting for age, BMI, medical co-morbidities, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: Data from 10,203 participants, mean (standard deviation (SD)) age 61.5 (8.9) years (57.4% women), were analysed from 1993 to 2000. For every five points lower PCS score in men and women, there was approximately a 0.5 dB/MHz lower mean BUA. In women, a PCS score of less than one standard deviation (1SD) below the sex-specific mean was associated with having a low BUA (< 1SD below sex-specific mean) and very low BUA (< 2.5SD below the sex specific mean); odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) 1.53 (1.24, 1.88) and 8.28 (2.67, 25.69), respectively. The relationship was lesser so in men; corresponding OR (95% CI) were 1.34 (0.91, 1.98) and 2.57 (0.72, 9.20), respectively.

The US military began to explore the use of teledentistry in the mid-90s with the technology available at the time. The dental profession is slow at adopting the use of virtual health technologies as a capability to triage, screen, and monitor. Dentist to dentist consults routinely occur in both a civilian and military dental practice via email and phone consults. The idea of teledentistry for the future battlefield requires using existing technology such as advanced digital imaging, cloud technology, and video conferencing to shift towards a real-time virtual encounter. Real-time encounters create opportunities to evaluate a patient at a remote location when a dentist is not physically present. Advance development of virtual health technologies to include teledentistry expands the potential utilization of tele-triage, tele-screening, tele-consult, and tele-monitoring. These capabilities will be useful on the future battlefield during multi-domain operations as part of the Operational Virtual Health (OVH) capability. The application of OVH enables military forces to minimize morbidity and mortality on the battlefield to include prevention of unnecessary medical evacuation. METHODS Comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed for published teledentistry research using military-related and battlefield use of teledentistry keywords.

This is resulting in a growing demand for alternative approaches to designing and evaluating interventions in complex systems. Theory of Change (ToC) is an approach which may be useful because it enables stakeholders to present and test their theories and assumptions about why and how impact may occur, ideally within an environment conducive to iterative reflection and learning. However, ToC is yet to be appropriately mainstreamed into development by donors, researchers and practitioners. We carried out a literature review, triangulated by interviews with 26 experts in African and Asian food security, consisting of researchers, advisors to programs, and donors. Although 17 (65%) of the experts had adopted ToC, their responses and the literature revealed four challenges to mainstreaming: (i) different interpretations of ToC; (ii) incoherence in relationships among the constituent concepts of ToC; (iii) confused relationships between ToC and project logframes; and (iv) limitations in necessary skills and commitment for enacting ToC. A case study of the evolution of a ToC in a West African AR4D project over 4 years which exemplified these challenges is presented. Five recommendations arise to assist the mainstreaming of ToC: (i) select a type of ToC suited to the relative complexity of the problem and focal system of interest; (ii) state a theory or hypotheses to be tested as the intervention progresses; (iii) articulate the relationship between the ToC and parallel approaches (e.g. logframe); (iv) accept that a ToC is a process, and (v) allow time and resources for implementers and researchers to develop ToC thinking within projects.

Specifically, a high false-negative rate of 41% on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was observed in China.

In this work, we present a methodological approach based on constant-pH molecular dynamics (MD), which aims to provide a detailed description of a pH-dependent protein-protein association, and apply it to the dimerization of ?-lactoglobulin (BLG). A selection of analyses is performed using the data generated by constant-pH MD simulations of monomeric and dimeric forms of bovine BLG, in the pH range 3-8. First, we estimate free energies of dimerization using a computationally inexpensive approach based on the Wyman-Tanford linkage theory, calculated in a new way through the use of thermodynamically based splines. The individual free energy contribution of each titratable site is also calculated, allowing for identification of relevant residues. Second, the correlations between the proton occupancies of pairs of sites are calculated (using the Pearson coefficient), and extensive networks of correlated sites are observed at acidic pH values, sometimes involving distant pairs. In general, strongly correlated sites are also slow proton exchangers and contribute significantly to the pH-dependency of the dimerization free energy. Third, we use ionic density as a fingerprint of protein charge distribution and observe electrostatic complementarity between the monomer faces that form the dimer interface, more markedly at the isoionic point (where maximum dimerization occurs) than at other pH values, which might contribute to guide the association. Finally, the pH-dependent dimerization modes are inspected using PCA, among other analyses, and two states are identified: a relaxed state at pH 4-8 (with the typical alignment of the crystallographic structure) and a compact state at pH 3-4 (with a tighter association and rotated alignment). This work shows that an approach based on constant-pH MD simulations can produce rich detailed pictures of pH-dependent protein associations, as illustrated for BLG dimerization.","output":"Approach to Study pH-Dependent Protein Association Using Constant-pH Molecular Dynamics: Application to the Dimerization of ?-Lactoglobulin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The progressive nature of heart failure (HF) coupled with high mortality and poor quality-of-life (QoL) mandates greater attention to palliative care (PC) as a routine component of HF management.

Successful implementation involved close collaboration between pathology, infectious diseases, and outpatient clinics. The most common clinician concerns were appropriateness/utility of testing, patient charges/insurance coverage, and assay specificity. In analyzing test utilization, serologic testing in the first month after go-live was almost entirely outpatient and appeared to be strongly driven by patient interest (including health care workers and others in high-risk occupations for exposure to SARS-CoV-2), with little evidence that the results impacted clinical decision-making. Test volumes for serology declined steadily through October 31, 2020, with inpatient ordering assuming a steadily higher percentage of the total. In a 5-month period, SARS-CoV-2 serology test volumes amounted to only 1.3% of that of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.

Studies on neuropsychological rehabilitation of visual field defects provide an inconsistent picture regarding the effectiveness of so-called \\"restorative approaches\\" in visual field recovery (VFR). During a current research project on the clinical evaluation of VFR - in combination with head mounted virtual reality displays (HMD) - a patient (\\"Patient 7\\") suffering from visual neglect was investigated. Although the concept of VFR is originally not intended for patients suffering from higher cortical regions (as in neglect), we hypothesized that due to the strong attention-demanding training situation in HMDs, neglect patients might benefit from these intervention procedures based on restorative approaches. Methods and Analysis. Patient 7 was examined perimetrically using a \\"Humphrey Field Analyzer\\", \\"Goldmann Perimetry\\" and our newly developed and validated eye-tracking supported perimetric methodology \\"Eye tracking based visual field analysis\\" (EFA). Based on these high resolution results from the EFA, the exact location of the transition area between intact and defect visual field of Patient 7 was assessed. Next, bright light stimuli were placed along this area in our newly developed HMD \\"Salzburg Visual Field Trainer\\" (SVFT). The aim was to stimulate neuroplasticity - according to the concept of restitutive approaches - in the corresponding cortical areas of the patient. Patient 7 trained with the SVFT for a time period of 254 days. In 6 appointments the objective and subjective rehabilitation progress was assessed. Results. Perimetric assessment with the EFA shows an expansion of Patient 7's visual field of 48.8% (left eye) and 36.8% (right eye) after 254 days of training with the SVFT. Individual areas in the patient's visual field show a visual improvement of approximately 5.5 to 10.5 degree of visual angle. Subjective self-report of Patient 7 additionally shows improvements in self-evaluation of up to 317% in visual field functionality compared to self-evaluation on the first assessment date. Conclusions. The results from Patient 7 indicate that patients suffering from visual neglect potentially benefit from a neuropsychological intervention with HMD based on the restorative concept of visual field recovery. However, further studies with large case numbers and a focus both on daily-life improvements and on a clear distinction between patients with lesions in earlier and higher cortical areas are needed to make empirically valid and generalizing statements about our findings.","output":"Visual field improvement in neglect after virtual reality intervention: a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Owing to the expanding globalization, the trans\\\\boundary spread of an epizootic can easily result from uncontrolled animal movements and human traffic.

Through integrating multiple Department of Defense surveillance systems, the Army Public Health Center can provide near real-time case counts to Army leadership on a daily basis. MATERIALS AND METHODS The incidence of COVID-19 was tracked by incorporating data from the Disease Reporting System Internet, laboratory test results, Commanders' Critical Incidence Reports, reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention military liaison, and media reports. Cases were validated via a medical record review for all Army beneficiaries. Descriptive analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel and SAS 9.4 to measure demographic frequencies. RESULTS In the first year of the pandemic from February 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021, a total of 96,315 COVID-19 cases were reported to the Disease Reporting System internet, the Army's passive surveillance system, of which 95,429 (99%) were confirmed and 886 (1%) were probable. A total of 76 outbreak reports were submitted from 14 Army installations. The proportion of Army beneficiaries with severe illness was low: 2,271 (2.4%) individuals required hospitalization and 269 (0.3%) died. Installations in Texas reported the highest proportion of confirmed-not hospitalized cases (n = 19,246, 20.7%), confirmed-hospitalized cases (n = 1,037, 45.7%), and deaths (n = 137, 50.9%) as compared to other states with Army installations.

With two thirds of women presenting at their first antenatal visit either overweight or obese in urban South Africa (SA), the preconception period is an opportunity to optimise health and offset transgenerational risk of both obesity and NCDs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Bukhali is the first individual randomised controlled trial in Africa to test the efficacy of a complex continuum of care intervention and forms part of the Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (HeLTI) consortium implementing harmonised trials in Canada, China, India and SA. Starting preconception and continuing through pregnancy, infancy and childhood, the intervention is designed to improve nutrition, physical and mental health and health behaviours of South African women to offset obesity-risk (adiposity) in their offspring. Women aged 18C28 years (n=6800) will be recruited from Soweto, an urban-poor area of Johannesburg. The primary outcome is dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry derived fat mass index (fat mass divided by height(2)) in the offspring at age 5 years. Community health workers will deliver the intervention randomly to half the cohort by providing health literacy material, dispensing a multimicronutrient supplement, providing health services and feedback, and facilitating behaviour change support sessions to optimise: (1) nutrition, (2) physical and mental health and (3) lay the foundations for healthier pregnancies and early child development.

Based on existing research, we hypothesized that living in a high-crime neighborhood during pregnancy would affect neonatal frontolimbic connectivity over and above other individual- and neighborhood-level adversity and that these associations would be mediated by maternal psychosocial stress. METHODS: Participants included 399 pregnant women, recruited as part of the eLABE (Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders) study. In the neonatal period, 319 healthy, nonsedated infants were scanned using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (repetition time = 800 ms; echo time = 37 ms; voxel size = 2.0  2.0  2.0 mm3; multiband = 8) on a Prisma 3T scanner and had at least 10 minutes of high-quality data. Crime data at the block group level were obtained from Applied Geographic Solution. Linear regressions and mediation models tested associations between crime, frontolimbic connectivity, and psychosocial stress. RESULTS: Living in a neighborhood with high property crime during pregnancy was related to weaker neonatal functional connectivity between the thalamus-anterior default mode network (aDMN) (? = -0.15, 95% CI = -0.25 to -0.04, p = .008). Similarly, high neighborhood violent crime was related to weaker functional connectivity between the thalamus-aDMN (? = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.29 to -0.04, p = .01) and amygdala-hippocampus (? = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.29 to -0.03, p = .02), controlling for other types of adversity. Psychosocial stress partially mediated relationships between the thalamus-aDMN and both violent and property crime. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to crime is associated with weaker neonatal limbic and frontal functional brain connections, providing another reason for targeted public policy interventions to reduce crime.","output":"The Effects of Prenatal Exposure to Neighborhood Crime on Neonatal Functional Connectivity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 pandemic has put unprecedented pressures on obstetrics and gynecology care services.

However, a significant majority of empirical research has shown that users do find and interact with opposing views. Furthermore, we argue that the notion of filter bubble overestimates the social impact of digital technologies in explaining social and political developments without considering the not-only-technological circumstances of online behavior and interaction. This provides us with motivation to reconsider this notions validity and re-elaborate it in light of existing epistemological theories that deal with the discomfort people experience when dealing with what they do not know. Therefore, we will survey a series of philosophical reflections regarding the epistemic limitations of human cognitive systems. In particular, we will discuss how knowledge and mere belief are phenomenologically indistinguishable and how peoples experience of having their beliefs challenged is cause of epistemic discomfort. We will then go on to argue, in contrast with Parisers assumptions, that digital media users might tend to conform to their held viewpoints because of the immediate way they experience opposing viewpoints. Since online people experience others and their viewpoints as material features of digital environments, we maintain that this modality of confronting oneself with contrasting opinions prompts users to reinforce their preexisting beliefs and attitudes.","output":"Through the Newsfeed Glass: Rethinking Filter Bubbles and Echo Chambers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Objective] To better understand the research status of emergency management during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China, and further improve the level of China's emergency management, [method] In this paper, the big data of emergency management research during COVID-19 was visualized and analyzed, and the visual knowledge map was drawn to study the big data of China's emergency management literature.

RESULTS: Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, KTRs with severe COVID-19 had prolonged viral shedding and a stronger humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2. These preliminary data need to be confirmed with further studies and over a longer period of time.","output":"Viral Clearance and Serological Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Kidney Transplant Recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction La maladie  coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), due au SRAS-CoV-2, a t dclare pandmie mondiale le 11 mars 2020.

However, the severe performance degradation coming from the instability of the MoOX and its interfaces has not been well addressed. In this work, we started with a c-Si(p)/MoOX heterojunction solar cell which yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.86 %, in which the MoOX film was synthesized by industry-compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). The initial PCE dropped to 10.20 % after two days because of severe migration of O and Ag at the MoOX/Ag interface. We solved this by the insertion of a CrOX layer between the MoOX layer and the Ag electrode. The solar cell was found to be stable for over 8 months in air due to the suppression of interface degradation.

First, the main advantage of this approach is to detect the long-term relationship as well as the short-term dynamics and to represent the interdependence between the variables. We further estimate a multivariate GARCH type model that enables us to examine the dynamic conditional correlations (short-run links) among the considered variables under the effects of long-run interactions and volatility persistence. We determine that the volatility transmission was time-varying and that influence from the crisis. Moreover, the joint distribution is explored using the Gumbel copulas in order to describe the nonlinear structure of dependence between the variables. The empirical results provide evidence of fractional cointegration between the exchanges rates and show long-run causal links between the variables and we find significant bidirectional causal links. In particular, we show a positive dynamic correlation and the dependence structure is represented by the optimal copula coefficient used for measuring the risk spillovers between the exchange rates.","output":"Interdependence between exchange rates: Evidence from multivariate analysis since the financial crisis to the COVID-19 crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) has been declared pandemic since March 2020.

We assessed the pattern of respiratory mechanics and LUS, their changes over time, and the differences between survivors and non-survivors. We additionally analyzed the relationship between LUS findings and the severity of gas exchange impairment and interleukin 6 (IL-6). This was a two-center retrospective, observational trial carried out in the intensive care units of the hospitals of Bolzano and Merano, Italy, from March 15 to April 20, 2020. We enrolled 41 consecutive patients. Seven patients (17%, 95% CI 8.5-31.3%) died. Mean compliance of the respiratory system on ICU admission was 41.6 ( 18.8) ml/mbar (42.5 ( 19.6) for survivors, 38.0 ( 16.3) for deceased, p = 0.605). Non-survivors had a significantly lower compliance over time, decreasing from day 14 after symptom onset, compared with survivors (p = 0.008). Mean LUS score on admission was 11.2 ( 3.7) and survivors had lower LUS scores on admission than non-survivors (10.5 ( 3.6), 13.9 (2.8), respectively, t test, p = 0.029).

The study had three arms, consisting of two groups treated with LL-37 at concentrations of 0.5 or 1.6 mg/mL, and a placebo cohort. Patients had a mean age of 67.6 years, a median ulcer duration of 20.3 months, and a mean wound size at the time of randomization of 11.6 cm2 . Efficacy analysis performed on the full study population did not identify any significant improvement in healing in patients treated with LL-37 as compared with the placebo. In contrast, a post hoc analysis revealed statistically significant improvement with LL-37 treatment in several interrelated healing parameters in the subgroup of patients with large target wounds (a wound area of at least 10 cm2 at randomization), which is a known negative prognostic factor for healing. The study drug was well tolerated and safe in both dose strengths. In summary, this clinical trial did not detect any significant differences in healing of venous lower leg ulcers in the entire study cohort comparing patients treated with LL-37 versus placebo.

Patient demographics and clinic outcomes were reviewed using electronic patient records and radiographs. RESULTS: Fifty patients were identified (Male:Female 37:13; mean age 26 years, range 3-89 years). Of these, 41/50 were discharged directly following VFC advice, with no adverse event. The remaining 9/50 had a face-to-face Fracture Clinic review due to safeguarding concerns (2), concurrent neck of fourth MC fracture (2), concerns regarding fracture pattern (4), and an unclear indication (1). These 9/50 were discharged after single review, with no adverse events to date.

In the first step, two residual networks were independently trained to identify the lung tissue for normal and Covid patients in a supervised manner. These two models, referred to as DL-Covid and DL-Norm for Covid-19 and normal patients, respectively, generate the voxel-wise probability maps for lung tissue identification. To detect Covid lesions, the CT image of the Covid patient is processed by the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models to obtain two lung probability maps. Since the DL-Norm model is not familiar with Covid infections within the lung, this model would assign lower probabilities to the lesions than the DL-Covid. Hence, the probability maps of the Covid infections could be generated through the subtraction of the two lung probability maps obtained from the DL-Covid and DL-Norm models. Manual lesion segmentation of 50 Covid-19 CT images was used to assess the accuracy of the unsupervised lesion segmentation approach. The Dice coefficients of 0.985 and 0.978 were achieved for the lung segmentation of normal and Covid patients in the external validation dataset, respectively.

As per WHO statistics, cancer is the most prevalent disease globally and causes 9.6 million deaths worldwide. The current strategies for treating cancer include chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery. However, chemotherapy and radiation exposure are usually associated with serious long-term side effects and deterioration in the quality of life (QOL) of patients. Furthermore, the hospitalization and medication costs for treating cancers are exorbitant and impose high economic burden on healthcare systems. People are desperately looking for cost-effective and affordable alternative therapies for treating GID and cancers. Therefore, there is an urgent need for clinically evaluating the anticancer compounds isolated from plants and animals. Such therapies would not only be economical and have fewer side effects, but also help to improve the QOL of cancer patients. Recently, bovine colostrum (BC) has caught the attention of many investigators to explore its anticancer potential in humans. BC impregnated dressings are highly effective in treating chronic wounds and diabetic foot ulcer. BC is rich in lactoferrin, a glycoprotein with strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and anti-microbial properties.

In our study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19-related patients admitted to our center with acute stroke and compare them with acute stroke patients without COVID-19 infection during the same period. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-four patients admitted with acute stroke from March 11, 2020, to May 11, 2020, were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics, work-up studies, and clinical scales including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin scale (mRS) scores were examined retrospectively. All patients diagnosed with acute stroke who were also evaluated for COVID-19 before hospitalization were divided into two groups: COVID-19-related and unrelated cases. RESULTS: COVID-19-related and unrelated acute stroke patients had similar characteristics in terms of age, gender, and stroke risk factors. The admission NIHSS (mean NIHSS: 9.8 vs. 5.9) scores and the discharge mRS values (mean mRS: 3.9 vs. 2.4) were significantly higher in the COVID-19-related stroke group (p=0.002 and p=0.001, respectively). The prognosis of the COVID-19-related stroke group was significantly worse (69.6% vs. 39.8%) and the mortality rate (39.1% vs. 6.2%) was significantly higher than the COVID-19-unrelated stroke group (p=0.007 vs. p=0.000, respectively). The proportion of patients with large infarcts in the COVID-19-related acute ischemic stroke group was significantly higher than the one in the COVID-19-unrelated acute ischemic stroke group (57.9% vs. 21.9%, p=0.003). CONCLUSION: This is the first comparative study to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcome of COVID-19-related acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients in Turkey. Our results suggest that COVID-19-related acute stroke is associated with more severe clinical presentation and worse outcome. This seems to be linked to the coagulation abnormalities induced by COVID-19 infection.","output":"Comparison of Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19-Related and Unrelated Acute Stroke Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PathogenChost cell interactions play an important role in many human infectious and inflammatory diseases. Several pathogens, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and even the recent 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), can cause serious breathing and brain disorders, tissue injury and inflammation, leading to high rates of mortality and resulting in great loss to human physical and mental health as well as the global economy. These infectious diseases exploit the microbial and host factors to induce serious inflammatory and immunological symptoms. Thus the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting bacterial/viral infection is an urgent need. In previous studies, YojI-IFNAR2, YojI-IL10RA, YojI-NRP1,YojI-SIGLEC7, and YojI-MC4R membraneCprotein interactions were found to mediate E. coli invasion of the bloodCbrain barrier (BBB), which activated the downstream anti-inflammatory proteins NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2(NLRP2), using a proteomic chip conjugated with cell immunofluorescence labeling. However, the studies of pathogen (bacteria/virus)Chost cell interactions mediated by membrane protein interactions did not extend their principles to broad biomedical applications such as 2019-nCoV infectious disease therapy. The first part of this feature article presents in-depth analysis of the cross-talk of cellular anti-inflammatory transduction signaling among interferon membrane protein receptor II (IFNAR2), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10RA), NLRP2 and [Ca(2+)]-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2G5), based on experimental results and important published studies, which lays a theoretical foundation for the high-throughput construction of the cytokine and virion solution chip. The paper then moves on to the construction of the novel GPCR recombinant herpes virion chip and virion nano-oscillators for profiling membrane protein functions, which drove the idea of constructing the new recombinant virion and cytokine liquid chips for HTS of leading drugs. Due to the different structural properties of GPCR, IFNAR2, ACE2 and Spike of 2019-nCoV, their ligands will either bind the extracellular domain of IFNAR2/ACE2/Spike or the specific loops of the GPCR on the envelope of the recombinant herpes virions to induce dynamic charge distribution changes that lead to the variable electron transition for detection. Taken together, the combined overview of two of the most innovative and exciting developments in the immunoinflammatory field provides new insight into high-throughput construction of ultrasensitive cytokine and virion liquid chips for HTS of anti-inflammatory drugs or clinical diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases including infectious diseases, acute or chronic inflammation (acute gouty arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, atheromatosis, diabetes, obesity, tissue injury and tumors. It has significant value in the prevention and treatment of these serious and painful diseases.

The aim of this study was to investigate key factors for cellular susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ocular surface cells. METHODS: We combined co-expression and SARS-CoV-2 interactome network to predict key genes at COVID-19 in ocular infection based on the premise that genes underlying a disease are often functionally related and functionally related genes are often co-expressed. RESULTS: The co-expression network was constructed by mapping the well-known angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), TMPRSS2, and host susceptibility genes implicated in COVID-19 genomewide association study (GWAS) onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium, and lung. We found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation, and innate immune response. We identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. The gene ECSIT, as a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis.

The epidemiologic and clinical features as well as clinical outcomes were compared between the confirmed and suspected cases. Results: Altogether 105 patients had been enrolled in this study by February 15, 2020 in north Shanghai, including 21 confirmed cases and 84 suspected cases of COVID-19. The incubation period of these confirmed patients with imported COVID-19 was 17.6 days (IQR 5-34 days) and the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 145.64 h (IQR 21-441 h). More than 50% of the confirmed patients were older than 51 (range, 51-60) years. Fifty (59.5%) of the 84 probably patients were younger than 40 years, including 27 (32%) patients younger than 30 years. Most confirmed patients were men (61.9%, 13/21), and less than 50% of them had underlying diseases, including diabetes (9.5%, 2/21), hypertension (19%, 4/21), COPD (23.8%, 5/21), and CD (23.8%, 5/21). In addition, 10 (47.6%) of the 21 confirmed patients were ordinary employees, and 12 (57.2%) of them had recently been to Wuhan or had close contacts with people from Wuhan. Of the 84 suspected patients, 28 (33.3%) were retired employees; 69 (82.1%) had recently been to supermarkets and groceries or had a history of traveling abroad or to other cities of China. The common onset symptoms of the patients in both groups were fever and cough. The symptom of Sputum production was more pronounced in probably patients (40.5%, 34/84) than that in confirmed patients (9.5%, 2/21).

METHODS: Three methods for disinfection using ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (group A), plasma circulation air sterilizer (group B), and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation plus plasma circulation air sterilizer (group C) were utilized to sanitize the air in the CT room dedicated to COVID-19 cases. Single-factor ANOVA was used to evaluate and compare the disinfection effect of the three air disinfection methods; an air microbial sampler was used to sample and measure the number of bacteria in the air of the machine room. RESULTS: The number of bacteria in the air immediately after disinfection was significantly lower than before disinfection (p < 0.01). All three disinfection methods met the disinfection requirement. No significant differences in the number of air bacteria in the machine room immediately after disinfection were observed among the three methods (p > 0.05). In addition, the effect of disinfection after 2 h was compared, and the number of bacteria in group C after 2 h was significantly lower than that in group A and group B. CONCLUSIONS: All three disinfection methods have significant disinfection effects. In addition, using ultraviolet disinfection lamps combined with a plasma air disinfection machine to sterilize the air in CT machine room has the best disinfection effect for the longest duration.

With the unavailability of vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent and/or treat SFTSV infection, early rapid diagnosis is critical for prevention and control of the disease. Here, we report the development of a simple, rapid and sensitive portable detection method for SFTSV infection applying reverse transcription-loop mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) combined with one-pot colorimetric visualization and electro-free reaction platform. This method utilizes a pocket warmer to facilitate diagnosis in a resource-limited setting. Specific primers were designed to target the highly-conserved region of L gene of SFTSV. The detection limit of the RT-LAMP assay was approximately 100 viral genome copies from three different SFTSV strains. This assay exhibited comparable sensitivity to qRT-PCR and 10-fold more sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, with a rapid detection time of 30 to 60 minutes. The RT-LAMP assay using SFTSV clinical specimens has demonstrated a similar detection rate to qRT-PCR and a higher detection rate compared to conventional RT-PCR.

In this study, we proposed the SEIQHRS model (susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-hospitalized-recovered-susceptible) model that predicts the trajectory of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy for COVID-19 in Ghana. We provided a short-term forecast of the early phase of the epidemic trajectory in Ghana using the generalized growth model. We estimated the effective basic Reproductive number Re in real-time using three different estimation procedures and simulated worse case epidemic scenarios and the impact of integrated individual and government interventions on the epidemic in the long term using compartmental models.

METHODS: A search in Google Scholar, PubMed(), MEDLINE(), and Scopus was performed using the keywords autopsy and COVID-19, postmortem and COVID-19, and pulmonary/lung pathology and COVID-19. RESULTS: Pulmonary autopsy hallmark findings of COVID-19 cases demonstrate the presence of diffuse alveolar damage. The presence of pulmonary thrombi was reported in the majority of patients. Cellular alterations included type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltrates predominantly by lymphocytes, other mononuclear cells, and neutrophils as evident by their specific immunohistochemical markers. Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of virus particles in different cell types, including types 1 and 2 pneumocytes.

The treatment of patients with active UC depends on the severity, localization and history of IBD medication. According to the classic step-up approach, treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds is the first step in the treatment of mild to moderately active UC. Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone are used in UC patients with moderate to severe disease activity, but only for remission induction therapy because of side effects associated with long-term use. Thiopurines are the next step in the treatment of active UC but monotherapy during induction therapy in UC patients is not preferred because of their slow onset. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of the pharmacologically active metabolites of thiopurines, 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN), has proven to be beneficial. Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TMPT) plays a role in the metabolic conversion pathway of thiopurines and exhibits genetic polymorphism; however, the clinical benefit and relevance of TPMT genotyping is not well established. In patients with severely active UC refractory to corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors such as ciclosporin A (CsA) and tacrolimus are potential therapeutic options. These agents usually have a rather rapid onset of action. Monoclonal antibodies (anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF] agents, vedolizumab) are the last pharmacotherapeutic option for UC patients before surgery becomes inevitable. Body weight, albumin status and antidrug antibodies contribute to the variability in the pharmacokinetics of anti-TNF agents. Additionally, the use of concomitant immunomodulators (thiopurines/methotrexate) lowers the rate of immunogenicity, and therefore the concomitant use of anti-TNF therapy with an immunomodulator may confer some advantage compared with monotherapy in certain patients.

METHODS: We collected global cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and non-binary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to ones gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation. RESULTS: Individuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%,n=264/964) and Thailand (20.6%,n=205). A majority were non-binary (66.8%,n=644) or transfeminine (29.4%,n=283). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 55.0% (n=320/582) reported reduced access to gender-affirming resources, and 38.0% (n=327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%,n=392/856). One in six (17.0%,n=112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n=724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36C1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31C1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07C2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender-affirming resources was reduced versus not. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and non-binary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve transgender and non-binary health globally, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be achieved through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives.","output":"Gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability in the time of COVID-19: a global cross-sectional study of transgender and non-binary people"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is taking a dangerous turn due to unavailability of approved and effective vaccines and therapy Currently available diagnostic techniques are time-consuming, expensive, and maybe impacted by the mutations produced in the virus Therefore, investigation of novel, rapid, and economic diagnosis techniques, prophylactic vaccines and targeted efficacious drug delivery systems as treatment strategy is imperative Carbohydrates are essential biomolecules which also act as markers in the realization of immune systems Moreover, they exhibit antiviral, antimicrobial, and antifungal properties Carbohydrate-based vaccines and therapeutics including stimuli sensitive systems can be developed successfully and used effectively to fight COVID-19 Thus, carbohydrate-based diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic alternatives could be promising to defeat COVID-19 propitiously Morphology of SARS-CoV-2 and its relevance in devising combat strategies has been discussed Carbohydrate-based approaches for tackling infectious diseases and their importance in the design of various diagnostic and treatment modalities have been reviewed","output":"Carbohydrates-based diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of infectious diseases: Special emphasis on COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) is a screening tool for quantifying the risk of diabetes mellitus (DM) development in the Indian population. The present study has evaluated the level of risk of developing DM in Chandigarh and Panchkula based on the IDRS score. METHODS: As a part of a national diabetes control trial funded by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) and the Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India, 1,916 participants from the Chandigarh and Panchkula regions were assessed for the risk of developing DM. Risk assessment was done on the basis of the IDRS score which includes age, family history, waist circumference, and physical activity as its contributing factors. Participants with an IDRS score <30 were in the low-risk category, those with 30 to 50 were in the moderate-risk category, and those with >60 were in the high-risk category for DM. RESULTS: Out of the 1,916 screened respondents (59.86% females and 40.14% males), 894 participants (46.65%) were at a high risk for DM (IDRS >60), 764 (39.87%) were at a moderate risk (IDRS = 30C60), and 258 (13.46%) were at a low risk (IDRS <30). Waist circumference contributed to 35.90% of the high-risk category followed by age (19.67%) and physical activity (11.67%). Age and waist circumference also showed a strong correlation with the total IDRS score. CONCLUSION: The Chandigarh and Panchkula population showed a high tendency to develop DM based on the IDRS score. Modifiable risk factors such as waist circumference and physical activity were the major contributing factors. Apart from the modifiable risk factors, age was also another major contributing risk factor. Based on these outcomes, lifestyle modifications like yoga and exercise can be proposed for this population as a preventive approach to reduce the risk of developing DM and other associated cerebrovascular complications.","output":"Management of Type II Diabetes by Modulating the Modifiable Risk Factors: A Future Roadmap for Prevention of Cerebrovascular Complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wearing face masks in times of COVID-19 is one of the essential keystones for effectively decreasing the rate of new infections and thus for mitigating the negative consequences for individuals as well as for society.

In an experimental study, participants (N = 88) had to assess how strange they felt when wearing a face mask while being exposed to displays of groups of varying numbers of mask wearers. Three different types of face masks were shown: simple homemade masks, FFP2 masks, and loop scarfs. The higher the frequency of people wearing masks in the displayed social group, the less strange the participants felt about themselves, an essential precondition for accepting wearing masks.

Especially, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become the only viable option for learning. The effectiveness of teaching various hard-core programming courses with a mix of theoretical content is determined by the student interaction and responses. In contrast to a digital lecture through Zoom or Teams, a lecturer may rapidly acquire such responses from students' facial expressions, behavior, and attitude in a physical session, even if the listener is largely idle and non-interactive. However, student assessment in virtual learning is a challenging task. Despite the challenges, different technologies are progressively being integrated into teaching environments to boost student engagement and motivation. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of various in-class feedback assessment methods such as Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, and polling to assist a lecturer in obtaining real-time feedback from students throughout a session and adapting the teaching style accordingly. Furthermore, some of the topics covered by student suggestions include tutor suggestions, enhancing teaching style, course content, and other subjects. Any input gives the instructor valuable insight into how to improve the student's learning experience, however, manually going through all of the qualitative comments and extracting the ideas is tedious.

One of our challenges was the closure of our sleep lab for sleep apnea testing and CPAP titration. We also encountered patient reluctance to perform sleep testing with re-usable home equipment. In attempt to address these issues, we employed the WatchPATTM ONE device (Itamar Medical) - a disposable Bluetooth-enabled technology that uses peripheral arterial tonometry - to assess patients for sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) without an in-person visit or a facemask. At-home CPAP initiation and auto-titration was performed in appropriate patients to create a fully contactless testing and treatment program. Methods: From March 2020 - March 2021 patients with suspected SDB during a virtual HF Clinic visit were referred for home sleep testing using the WatchPATTM ONE device. Suspicion for SDB breathing was based on meeting at least 1 of 5 screening criteria used in our HF Clinic and a STOP-BANG score > 3. After insurance approval, a device was mailed to the patient for overnight testing. Results were uploaded into the CloudPAT platform and read by our Center's sleep cardiologist. Patients without complex SDB, underwent remote device fitting via an online DME company followed by CPAP auto-titration.

The limited quantity of testing kits and increasing number of daily cases encouraged us to come up with a Deep Learning model that can aid radiologists and clinicians in detecting Covid-19 cases using chest X-rays. Therefore, in this study, we propose CoroNet, a Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automatically detect Covid-19 infection from chest X-ray images. The deep model called CoroNet has been trained and tested on a dataset prepared by collecting Covid-19 and other chest pneumonia X-ray images from two different publically available databases.

Studying the real-world effects of these vaccines is an urgent requirement. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between the mass roll-out of the first doses of these COVID-19 vaccines and hospital admissions for COVID-19. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study using the Early Pandemic Evaluation and Enhanced Surveillance of COVID-19-EAVE II-database comprising linked vaccination, primary care, real-time reverse transcription-PCR testing, and hospital admission patient records for 54 million people in Scotland (about 99% of the population) registered at 940 general practices. Individuals who had previously tested positive were excluded from the analysis. A time-dependent Cox model and Poisson regression models with inverse propensity weights were fitted to estimate effectiveness against COVID-19 hospital admission (defined as 1-adjusted rate ratio) following the first dose of vaccine. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, a total of 1 331 993 people were vaccinated over the study period. The mean age of those vaccinated was 650 years (SD 162). The first dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was associated with a vaccine effect of 91% (95% CI 85-94) for reduced COVID-19 hospital admission at 28-34 days post-vaccination. Vaccine effect at the same time interval for the ChAdOx1 vaccine was 88% (95% CI 75-94). Results of combined vaccine effects against hospital admission due to COVID-19 were similar when restricting the analysis to those aged 80 years and older (83%, 95% CI 72-89 at 28-34 days post-vaccination). INTERPRETATION: Mass roll-out of the first doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA and ChAdOx1 vaccines was associated with substantial reductions in the risk of hospital admission due to COVID-19 in Scotland. There remains the possibility that some of the observed effects might have been due to residual confounding.

Using data available up to 28 June 2021, the estimated additional deaths from a mitigation strategy are 1,750 to 4,600, implying a Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year saved by locking down in March 2020 of at least 13 times the generally employed threshold figure of $62,000 for health interventions in New Zealand; the lockdowns do not then seem to have been justified by reference to the standard benchmark. Using only data available to the New Zealand government in March 2020, the ratio is similar and therefore the same conclusion holds that the nation-wide lockdown strategy was not warranted. Looking forwards from 28 June 2021, if a new outbreak occurs that cannot be suppressed without a nation-wide lockdown, the death toll from adopting a mitigation strategy at this point would be even less than had it done so in March 2020, due to the vaccination campaign and because the period over which the virus would then inflict casualties would now be much less than the period from March 2020; this would favour a mitigation policy even more strongly than in March 2020. This approach of assessing the savings in quality adjusted life years and comparing them to a standard benchmark figure ensures that all quality adjusted life years saved by various health interventions are treated equally, which accords with the ethical principle of equity across people.","output":"The Costs and Benefits of Covid-19 Lockdowns in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sequence of the gene encoding the membrane protein of human coronavirus 229 E (HCV 229 E) has been determined.

The sharp increase in the number of patients has led to great psychological pressure on health care workers. The purpose of this study was to understand their mental health status and needs, so as to provide a scientific basis for alleviating the psychological pressure of health care workers. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, 540 health care workers were randomly selected from two designated tuberculosis medical institutions in Anhui Province. The basic situation, perceived social support, depression level, loneliness and COVID-19 related knowledge were collected and analyzed by questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 511 valid questionnaires were finally retrieved. There were 139 people in epidemic prevention and control positions (27.20%). Depression level: People in isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were at the level of mild to moderate depression. Female was higher than male; nurse was higher than doctor; middle and junior job titles were higher than senior titles; junior college degree or below were higher than bachelor's degree, master's degree and above; isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly higher than those of non-prevention and control positions (p < 0.05). Loneliness scores: Doctors were higher than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were higher than those of other medical departments (p < 0.05). Social support: Doctors were lower than that of medical technicians, and isolation ward, fever clinic and pre-check triage were significantly lower than those of other departments (p < 0.05).

The objective of this study was to assess the factors associated with the increased levels of mental health burden among a sample of undergraduate college students in Northern New Jersey, the region of the U.S. severely impacted by the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: College students (N = 162) enrolled in an introductory core curriculum course completed a cross-sectional survey. The survey collected information on demographics, knowledge levels and sources of COVID-19 information, behavior changes, academic and everyday difficulties, and mental health measurements (depression, anxiety, somatization, and stress). Multivariable regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Descriptive findings indicate that students have a fundamental knowledge of COVID-19 transmission and common symptoms. Students tend to use and trust the official sources and have changed their behaviors in accordance with public health recommendations (i.e., increased hand washing, wearing mask). However, students reported a number of academic and everyday difficulties and high levels of mental health distress. High levels of depression were associated with difficulties in focusing on academic work and with employment losses, while higher levels of anxiety were more likely to be reported by students other than freshmen and those who spend more than one hour per day looking for information on COVID-19. Inability to focus on academic work and an elevated concern with COVID-19 were more likely to be associated with higher levels of somatization, while trusting news sources was associated with lower levels of somatization. Those with higher levels of perceived stress were more likely to be females, unable to focus on academic work, and report difficulties in obtaining medications and cleaning supplies.

In order to document and quantify the effects of a specific vaccination campaign (Coglapix(?)) in a chronically diseased farrow-to-finish farm suffering from an acute episode in the fattening unit, lungs of 61 slaughter pigs in the mean in each run were evaluated using the electronic CLP(?) lung score program three times between 2016 and 2020, with the last measurement during the acute episode before the start of specific vaccination, followed by two analyses, one 8 months after implementation of vaccination measures, and one five months after cessation of the vaccination program. Percentages of lungs affected by dorsocaudal pleurisy immediately before and during vaccination were 43 and 5, respectively. The APP-index decreased from 1.2 to 0.1. The incidence of bronchopneumonic lungs also decreased by 75%, showing that pathophysiologies of pneumonias and pleurisies are closely correlated. Remarkably, EP (enzootic pneumonia)-indices seemed to correlate better with the severity of clinical signs than APP-indices, especially when comparing the chronic phase of swine pleuropneumonia and the acute episode with peracute fatalities. In summary, vaccination measures against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae proved to be very effective in restoring lung health in the affected herd, which was underpinned by an increase in APP-related parameters after cessation of vaccination. ABSTRACT: Porcine pleuropneumonia is of serious concern regarding lung health in pig production. Besides optimizing hygiene and pig management, specific vaccination against the causative agent, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, is an important tool in the fight against this disease. As porcine pleuropneumonia may present with different clinical courses of disease, it is not always easy to objectively assess herd lung health state or to monitor improvements following specific therapeutic or prophylactic measures. Here, the effects of specific vaccination on lung health in a chronically diseased farrow-to-finish farm in Lower Austria experiencing an acute episode were monitored by means of an app-based electronic tool, enabling the scorers to document lung pathologies real-time at slaughter. At the time, when vaccination measures took effect, percentages of lungs affected by dorsocaudal pleurisy had decreased from 43 to 5 and the APP-index from 1.2 to 0.1, respectively.

The aim of this article was to describe a novel device to contain aerosol within a small localized environment around the operative field-the negative pressure assisted microenvironment surgical hood (NEPA-MESH). METHODS: This device can be assembled using easily available materials-steel wires, image intensifier cover, surgical drape, and three-dimensional-printed self-locking copolyester double hoops. Large-bore pipes in continuity with a high-volume suction apparatus create a constant negative pressure microenvironment around the operative field. The CEM DT-9880 particle counter was used to estimate particle concentration inside the NEPA-MESH during various stages of a neurosurgical procedure as well as outside. The NEPA-MESH was tested in different craniotomies and endoscopic procedures. RESULTS: Mean particle concentration inside the NEPA-MESH and outside during drilling in various procedures was calculated and compared using unpaired t test. Significant reduction in particle concentrations was recorded for particles sized 0.3 m (t = 17.55, P < 0.0001), 0.5 m (t = 11.39, P < 0.0001), 1 m (t = 6.36, P = 0.0002), 2.5 m (t = 2.04, P = 0.074), 5.0 m (t = 7.026, P = 0.0008), and 10 m (t = 4.39, P = 0.0023). CONCLUSIONS: As definitive evidence demonstrating the presence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in aerosol particles is awaited, we describe a cost-effective strategy to reduce aerosol contamination.

Despite several available measures to improve safety, existing mechanisms are unreliable for workers to perceive alerts, due to the harsh working environment, with loud noise and limited vision. This research attempts to overcome hazard perception difficulties by introducing a new communication mechanism for intrusion hazard perception. METHOD The presented communication mechanism is based on past tactile sensing research, and is enhanced by signal profile and message modeling investigations. Experimental field trials were conducted for mechanism evaluation with a goal of improved situational awareness through tactile sensing. RESULTS The trial results show that users perceive warning messages well, even when their vision and hearing are limited, and that the signalized messages perceived could augment users' understanding of a potential hazard, allowing immediate precautionary actions. Practical Applications: The application of haptic signals in vulnerable work zones has the potential to improve upon limitations in innate sensing (e.g., vision and hearing), thus presenting an opportunity to better protect workers from potential accidents.","output":"Improved intrusion accident management using haptic signals in roadway work zone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Better data are essential for effective cancer care both during and after the covid-19 pandemic","output":"Prioritising research into cancer treatment delays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is associated with significant hypercoagulability.

With surging case numbers, clinical laboratories were forced to acquiesce and integrate multiple testing platforms with varying workflows and analytical sensitivities in order to meet testing volumes. Now a new challenge has emerged with the evolution of viral variants, both globally and locally, raising concerns for uncontrolled spread, increased disease severity, and weakened responses to vaccinations. Preliminary data suggests that these variants may be associated with higher viral titers and prolonged infections. While primarily leveraged for epidemiologic surveillance, the clinical utility of variant detection may quickly become paramount. Furthermore, laboratories must remain vigilant and nimble enough to pivot should variant identification play a role in the patient care. To prepare for the validation of clinical assays that identify important viral variants, we designed a novel method, termed VariantDirect, to screen SARS-CoV-2 positive samples for the presence of variants, focusing initially on the increasingly prevalent UK and South African (SA) variants. The detection strategy is based on primers designed to specifically target the viral receptor-binding domain mutation, N501Y, shared by the UK and SA strains. Screening for variants will be limited to nasopharyngeal swab samples of high viral titers (Ct values <25 by RT-qPCR assay, Roche Diagnostics). Pools of 9 different samples, 50 l each, are mixed and stored at -80C along with aliquots of the 9 original samples. These pools will then be tested, and if positive for the N501Y variant, the pooled 9 samples will be thawed and tested separately to identify the affected specimen. Most of these specimens are also being independently sequenced via a comprehensive but more resource-intensive NGS approach. Advantages of our pooled workflow are primarily in time and cost, with the capacity of screening up to 837 specimens on a single run. In addition, our collection strategy establishes a time capsule to document the evolution of viral strains within our geographical region. Finally, these studies serve to optimize technical parameters for the development of clinical assays. A validated nucleic acid (NA) extraction-free RT-qPCR method will be utilized for this assay. Our internal validation data showed comparable analytical sensitivities to NA extraction-based methods. Pooled samples in transport medium are diluted in normal saline at a ratio of 1:1, and then heat-inactivated in the presence of proteinase-K and ultimately analyzed on the Applied Biosystems? 7500 Fast Dx instrument. As new variants of interest emerge, primers and probes can be quickly redesigned and validated on clinical samples within our NGS-confirmed time capsule. This study will provide important information needed for current or future genomic and epidemiologic studies.","output":"VariantDirect: An extraction-free screening approach to detect circulating SARS-CoV-2 virus strains from pooled specimens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While social workers are a well established, part of the pediatric palliative care team, this manuscript presents the first published definition of the core competencies of a pediatric palliative care social worker.

Prevention of future zoonotic disease is contingent on informed surveillance for known and novel threats across diverse human-wildlife interfaces. Cities are a key venue for potential spillover events because of the presence of zoonotic pathogens transmitted by hosts and vectors living in close proximity to dense human settlements. Effectively identifying and managing zoonotic hazards requires understanding the socio-ecological processes driving hazard distribution and pathogen prevalence in dynamic and heterogeneous urban landscapes. Despite increasing awareness of the human health impacts of zoonotic hazards, the integration of an eco-epidemiological perspective into public health management plans remains limited. Here we discuss how landscape patterns, abiotic conditions, and biotic interactions influence zoonotic hazards across highly urbanized cities (HUCs) in temperate climates in order to promote their efficient and effective management by a multi-sectoral coalition of public health stakeholders. We describe how to interpret both direct and indirect ecological processes, incorporate spatial scale, and evaluate networks of connectivity specific to different zoonotic hazards to promote biologically informed and targeted decision-making.

Groundwater and surface water reservoirs for drinking water as well as water from receiving rivers of the Monterrey Metropolitan Area were sampled repeatedly during a SARS-CoV-2 peak phase between October 2020 and January 2021, and viral RNA was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Forty-four percent of the groundwater samples had detectable viral loads between 2.6 and 38.3 copies/ml. A significant correlation between viral load and sucralose concentration in groundwater reaffirmed the hypothesis of leaching and infiltrating effluent from surface and/or failing sewage pipes and emphasized the importance of water disinfection. Twelve percent of the surface water dam samples tested positive for viral RNA, with values varying between 3.3 and 3.8 copies/ml. Finally, 13% of the river samples were positive for viral RNA, with concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 7.0 copies/ml. Untreated wastewater samples taken in the same period showed viral loads of up to 3535 copies/ml, demonstrating a dilution effect and/or wastewater facilities efficiency of three orders of magnitude. Variations in the viral loads in the groundwater and surface water over time and at the submetropolitan level generally reflected the reported trends in infection cases for Monterrey. The viral loads in the freshwater environments of Monterrey represent a low risk for recreational activities according to a preliminary risk assessment model.

However, this system has not been externally validated. RESEARCH QUESTION: We aimed to prospectively validate the CO-RADS as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool at the emergency department (ED), and evaluate if the CTSS is associated with prognosis. STUDY DESIGN METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study in two tertiary centers in The Netherlands, between March 19 and May 28, 2020. We consecutively included 741 adult patients at the ED with suspected COVID-19, who received a chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 PCR (PCR). Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. Logistic regression was performed for CTSS in relation to hospital admission, ICU admission and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 741 patients were included. We found an AUC of 0.91 (CI 0.89-0.94) for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. The optimal CO-RADS cut-off was 4, with a sensitivity of 89.4% (CI 84.7-93.0) and specificity of 87.2% (CI 83.9-89.9). We found a significant association between CTSS and hospital admission, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality; adjusted odds ratios per point increase in CTSS were 1.19 (CI 1.09-1.28), 1.23 (1.15-1.32), 1.14 (1.07-1.22), respectively.

Motor impairments are important, persistent consequences of stroke and include, among others, decreased respiratory muscle function, decreased ability to expand the thorax and postural dysfunction. These deficits affect the patients ability to perform daily activities, produce fatigue and reduce endurance and quality of life. Inspiratory muscle training (IMT) aims to improve the strength and endurance of the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of 3 weeks of IMT on (i) maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) in adults having suffered a stroke, as well as (ii) functional activities and expiratory measurements. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing IMT with conventional neurorehabilitation (usual practice). The trial will include 80 patients with reduced MIP hospitalised at a specialised neurorehabilitation hospital in Denmark. The intervention group will receive IMT sessions, exercising at 30% of MIP. Patients in the intervention group will perform two daily sessions (one session of IMT with Threshold IMT consisting of two times 15 inspirations at normal breathing rhythm (5C10 min)), 7 days a week for 3 weeks. Training can be with or without physiotherapist supervision. Study outcomes: MIP assessed by the Power Breath, Functional Independence Measurement, The 6-min walk test, the Fatigue Severity Scale and average voice volume. Expiratory function will be assessed using spirometry. All assessments will be conducted at baseline and 3 weeks (at termination of the intervention) and 3 months after the intervention has concluded. DISCUSSION: IMT is a promising and partly self-managed tool for rehabilitation to improve respiratory function. The introduction of IMT in combination with traditional physical therapy may enhance faster recovery after stroke and may at the same time demand little personnel resources to increase training intensity. This trial will provide further evidence of IMT to clinicians, patients and health managers. Hereby, this study accepts the call for further research.

METHODS: Patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) from three epilepsy centers were included. We employed a voxel-based and connectome-based mapping approach to determine the association between favorable outcomes and surgery-induced temporal lesions. Analyses were conducted controlling for multiple confounders, including total surgical resection/ablation volume, hippocampal volumes, side of surgery, and site where the patient was treated. RESULTS: The cohort included 113 patients with TLE [54 women; 86 right-handed; 16.5 (SD = 11.9) age at seizure onset, 54.9% left] who were 61.1% free of disabling seizures (Engel class 1) at follow-up. Postoperative seizure freedom in TLE was associated with 1) surgical lesions that targeted the hippocampus as well as the amygdala-piriform cortex complex and entorhinal cortices; 2) disconnection of temporal, frontal, and limbic regions through loss of white matter tracts within the uncinate fasciculus, anterior commissure, and fornix; and 3) functional disconnection of the frontal (superior and middle frontal gyri, orbitofrontal region) and temporal (superior and middle pole) lobes.

In 2009, the Korean guideline for RSV prophylaxis had established up to five shots monthly per RSV season, only for children <1 year of age with hemodynamic significance CHD (HS-CHD). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: During the RSV seasons in 2009-2015, we performed a retrospective review of data for 466 infants with CHD, examined at six centers in Korea. RESULTS: Infants received an average of 3.71.9 (range, 1-10) injections during the RSV season. Fifty-seven HS-CHD patients (12.2%) were hospitalized with breakthrough RSV bronchiolitis, with a recurrence in three patients, one year after the initial check-up. Among patients with simple CHD, only five (1.1%) patients received one additional dose postoperatively, as per the limitations set by the Korean guideline. Among the 30 deaths (6.4%), five (1.1%) were attributed to RSV infection; three to simple CHD, one to Tetralogy of Fallot, and one to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Of the three HCM patients that exceeded guidelines for RSV prophylaxis, two (66.6%) were hospitalized, and one died of RSV infection (33.3%). CONCLUSION: In accordance to the Korean guideline, minimal injections of palivizumab were administered to patients having HS-CHD <one year of age during the RSV season; the risk of RSV infection remains significant among children with simple CHD, cardiomyopathy, and children above the age of one year with HS-CHD.","output":"Retrospective Multicenter Study of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Prophylaxis in Korean Children with Congenital Heart Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

The virulence of the new virus COVID-19 was much greater than either the SARs and MERSs viruses and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Department (WHO) declared a worldwide pandemic. Understanding the pathophysiology of virulence of the SARS-COV-2 virus is absolutely necessary for understanding the transmission, virulence factors, reduce risk factors, clinical presentation, predict outcomes of the disease and provide guidance for any current or future treatment protocols. Methodology: A comprehensive PubMed search was performed during December 20, 2019 and April 03, 2020, utilizing the words: Wuhan Virus, COVID-19, SARs coronavirus, ACE2, S-protein, virulence, clinical presentation, epidemiology, genome, treatment, structure, MERs, pathogenesis and/or pathology alone and in combination with other terms. Each paper was evaluated by three content experts for quality, reproducibility, credibility and reputation of the journal. Results: The SARS-COV-2 virus is much more virulent than either the SARs or MERs virus and its ability to cause serious disease inversely corresponds to the persons ability to produce T-cells which declines linearly with age. The ACE2 receptor binding site does not vary among different ethnic groups but do in ACE-2 expression levels. This variance in expression level may explain for different infectivity rates among men and women and predict and explain different susceptibilities to infection by different ethnic groups. Furthermore, by understanding the underlying pathophysiology one can explain and provide guidance to the clinical effectiveness of any treatment. Conclusions: The underlying pathophysiology of COVID-19 explains not only the virulence, and clinical presentation, but, explains at a molecular level the comorbidity risk factors such as hypertension, sex, and age. Ethnic and anatomic expression patterns of ACE-2 and associated pathophysiology suggests that Native Americans and Asians may be particularly susceptible to this disease.","output":"The Pathophysiology of Virulence of the COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND With the development of high-resolution cross-sectional imaging, anatomic identification of most areas of infection has become routine. Imaging a site of infection allows for diagnosis and treatment. In the past, molecular imaging for infection involved mainly the use of radiolabeled leukocytes for functional targeting at infection sites. With the recent development of functional nuclear imaging, bacterial and viral metabolism can also be imaged directly for potential identification of early infection. METHODS Review of pertinent English-language literature. RESULTS Cross-sectional imaging is used routinely to identify and treat sources of infection in patients with fever, leukocytosis, or unexplained hemodynamic instability. Although ultrasound is preferred for the identification of biliary or hepatic sepsis, computed tomography (CT) has proved to be accurate for the identification and treatment of intra-abdominal fluid collections and abscesses. Biologic imaging is a non-invasive technique that identifies sites of infection in cases in which no definite abnormality is identified via cross-sectional imaging. This is made possible by imaging the accumulation of radioisotopes that have been attached to white blood cells or glucose. Biologic imaging is useful for the identification of anatomic sites where there is inflammation or high metabolic demand. However, a drawback of biologic imaging is that it is not specific for infection. Techniques that image microbes directly increase the specificity of imaging results significantly and can be used to quantify and track infectious processes. For example, radiolabeling of antimicrobial proteins and antibiotics is one technique that has been demonstrated to identify areas of infection accurately in animals but is not currently being used clinically in humans. With the advent of gene therapy, many researchers are inserting the herpes viral thymidine kinase gene into both viruses and bacteria. This allows for tracking of the infectious process by imaging the accumulation of radiolabeled thymidine analogues. CONCLUSION This review summarizes standard imaging for infection as it is currently practiced clinically. We will also explore the promising new methods of microbial imaging that are likely to become standards in clinical care in the near future.","output":"Imaging for infection: from visualization of inflammation to visualization of microbes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During previous pandemics people who use drugs (PWUD) were categorized among the most vulnerable. In the current study, firstly, we wanted to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders among PWUD. Furthermore, we wanted to compare the prevalence of these disorders with that of members from the general population who did not use drugs. METHODS: We used a matched cohort design based on two separate repeated cross-sectional online surveys (April and November 2020) among PWUD and the general population. Results of GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used as outcome variables. We calculated absolute and relative risks for matched pairs for both affective disorders, and logistic regression to compare affective disorders over both waves for PWUD. RESULTS: In April, the prevalence of affective disorders was similar for PWUD and the general population. In November, the risks for anxiety disorders increased with 64% for PWUD compared to non-PWUD (RR = 1.64, 95%CI 1.42C1.88), whereas the risks for depressive disorders more than doubled (RR = 2.29, 95%CI 1.97C2.67). Having a job and being male were protective factors for PWUD for both anxiety and depressive disorders. LIMITATIONS: As this study used self-reported data, GAD-7 and PHQ-9 give an indication of the presence of anxiety and depression which might differ from a clinician's judgement. CONCLUSIONS: PWUD might be disproportionally affected by COVID-19.

We find, across scenarios, that evictions lead to significant increases in infections. Applying our model to Philadelphia using locally-specific parameters shows that the increase is especially profound in models that consider realistically heterogenous cities in which both evictions and contacts occur more frequently in poorer neighborhoods.

However, variable results have been obtained, mainly due to the effect of the microenvironment on the induction, increase, and maintenance of MSC immunoregulatory mechanisms. In addition, the importance of cellCcell contact for MSCs to efficiently modulate the immune response has recently been highlighted. Because these interactions would be difficult to achieve in the physiological context, the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their participation as intermediaries of communication between MSCs and immune cells becomes relevant. Therefore, this article focuses on analyzing immunoregulatory mechanisms mediated by cell contact, highlighting the importance of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the participation of EVs. Moreover, the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) and interferon-gamma (IFN-), the main cytokines involved in MSC activation, are examined. These cytokines, when used at the appropriate concentrations and times, would promote increases in the expression of immunoregulatory molecules in the cell and allow the acquisition of EVs enriched with these molecules. The establishment of certain in vitro activation guidelines will facilitate the design of conditioning protocols to obtain functional MSCs or EVs in different pathophysiological conditions.","output":"TNF- and IFN- Participate in Improving the Immunoregulatory Capacity of Mesenchymal Stem/Stromal Cells: Importance of CellCCell Contact and Extracellular Vesicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In virtually any practical field or application, discovering and implementing near-optimal decision strategies is essential for achieving desired outcomes.

Understanding the local dominant viral etiologies is important to inform infection control practices and clinical management. This study aimed to investigate the viral etiology and epidemiology of respiratory infections among pediatric inpatients in Macao. METHODS: A retrospective study using electronic health records between 2014 and 2017 at Kiang Wu Hospital was performed. Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from hospitalized children aged 13 years or younger with respiratory tract diseases. xMAP multiplex assays were employed to detect respiratory agents including 10 respiratory viruses. Data were analyzed to describe the frequency and seasonality. RESULTS: Of the 4880 children enrolled in the study, 3767 (77.1%) were positive for at least one of the 13 viral pathogens tested, of which 2707 (55.5%) being male and 2635 (70.0%) under 2 years old. Among the positive results, there were 3091 (82.0%) single infections and 676 (18.0%) multiple infections. The predominant viruses included human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV 27.4%), adenovirus (ADV, 15.8%), respiratory syncytial virus B (RSVB, 7.8%) and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA, 7.8%). The detection of viral infection was the most prevalent in autumn (960/1176, 81.6%), followed by spring (1095/1406, 77.9%), winter (768/992, 77.4%), and summer (944/1306, 72.3%), with HRV/EV and ADV being most commonly detected throughout the 4 years of study period. The detection rate of viral infection was highest among ARI patients presented with croup (123/141, 87.2%), followed by lower respiratory tract infection (1924/2356, 81.7%) and upper respiratory tract infection (1720/2383, 72.2%). FluA, FluB and ADV were positive factors for upper respiratory tract infections.

One strategy that attracted significant attention was the use of digital contact-tracing apps to quickly alert users of possible exposure to the virus, and to direct them into quarantine. The initially high expectations placed upon this strategy were not met-despite the implementation of a digital contact-tracing app in Germany, further restrictions have been placed on the general population in response to further waves of the virus. We consider how digital contact tracing might have been made more effective. Arguments: We argue that there is a conflict between collecting as little data as possible, and more effective epidemic control. In contrast to the \\"Corona-Warn-App\\" that was implemented in Germany, an app that stored more information on a central server (a so-called \\"centralized\\" app) had the potential to significantly decrease viral spread. We then look at the privacy-based arguments against the centralized storage of information, suggesting that \\"decentralized\\" systems have privacy problems of their own. Results: The German debate on digital contact tracing apps was quickly dominated by privacy concerns, to the detriment of other ethical factors such as enhancing potential effectiveness. Furthermore, the potential problems with privacy inherent in decentralized apps were obscured in the discussion.

Whether BP influences the benefit or safety of intra-arterial treatment (IAT) is not known. We aimed to assess the relation of BP with functional outcome, occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and effect of IAT. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). BP was measured at baseline, before IAT or stroke unit admission. We estimated the association of baseline BP with the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days and safety parameters with ordinal and logistic regression analysis. Effect of BP on the effect of IAT was tested with multiplicative interaction terms. RESULTS Systolic BP (SBP) had the best correlation with functional outcome. This correlation was U-shaped; both low and high baseline SBP were associated with poor functional outcome. Higher SBP was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25 for every 10 mm Hg higher SBP [95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.44]). Between SBP and IAT, there was no interaction for functional outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or other safety parameters; the absolute benefit of IAT was evident for the whole SBP range. The same was found for diastolic BP. CONCLUSIONS BP does not affect the benefit or safety of IAT in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by proximal intracranial vessel occlusion.

Although the risk factors and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are well documented in the general population, there has been little research on NA patients. METHODS: We present descriptive data based on chart reviews of COVID-19 patients hospitalized between April 1 and July 31, 2020 at the Whiteriver Service Unit (WRSU), an Indian Health Service site on the Fort Apache Reservation. RESULTS: Of the 2,262 COVID-19 cases during the observation period, 490 (22%) were hospitalized and 35 (1.6%) died within 28 days. Compared to previous reports, hospitalized patients at WRSU were younger (median age 54), more likely to be female (55% female), and more likely to have comorbidities (92% at least 1, median 2). Patients under 50 (n=200) often had a history of alcohol abuse (51%) or polysubstance abuse (20%). One third of hospitalized patients (34%) were monitored at home and referred for treatment through a high-risk outreach program. Patients were admitted much earlier at WRSU than in other locations, with a median interval of 4 days from symptom onset to hospitalization compared to 7 days reported elsewhere, but over half were still transferred to higher care. Although WRSU patients had higher rates of comorbidities, the 28-day hospital mortality rate from COVID-19 was nearly half of what has been previously reported (35/490, 7% vs 15-20% reported elsewhere, p < 0.001). This trend persisted after controlling for age.

Characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at WRSU [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Hospitalized patients at WRSU tended to be younger but with more comorbidities than previous studies. This may reflect the fact that NAs tend to acquire comorbidities at younger ages than the general population. This may also reflect the high rates of substance abuse in younger patients, which could be an additional risk factor for severe COVID-19.

The immune responses in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are still under investigation, and data are evolving. While it is known that humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 are elicited, it is uncertain whether these responses protect against reinfection or that they provide definitive evidence of viral clearance. Very few cases have been reported in the literature regarding reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. CASE REPORT We present a case of a middle-aged man with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection who later developed mild symptomatic COVID-19 after a period of 3 months. The source of reinfection was likely from the community, which had a soaring burden of infection with the highest number of COVID-19 cases per million in the world at that time. The patient had 2 negative COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests 2 weeks after the initial infection. During the second infection, a nasopharyngeal reverse-transcription PCR test and tests for the presence of COVID-19 immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were all positive. CONCLUSIONS Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is a strong possibility. This case raises concerns that asymptomatic infections may not provide long-term protective immunity to all patients, which could make them susceptible to reinfection. Possible explanations for reinfection include an interval decrease in protective antibodies titers after SARS-CoV-2 infection that may be more prevalent in patients who had an asymptomatic infection. Other possibilities include viral reactivation after a prolonged carriage of the virus or delayed immune response.","output":"A Patient with Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection Who Presented 86 Days Later with COVID-19 Pneumonia Possibly Due to Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The transmittable spread of viral coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in a significant rise in global mortality. Due to lack of effective treatment, our aim is to generate a highly potent active molecule that can bind with the protein structure of SARS-CoV-2. Different machine learning and deep learning approaches have been proposed for molecule generation; however, most of these approaches represent the drug molecule and protein structure in 1D sequence, ignoring the fact that molecules are by nature in 3D structure, and because of this many critical properties are lost. In this work, a framework is proposed that takes account of both tertiary and sequential representations of molecules and proteins using Gated Graph Neural Network (GGNN), Knowledge graph, and Early Fusion approach. The generated molecules from GGNN are screened using Knowledge Graph to reduce the search space by discarding the non-binding molecules before being fed into the Early Fusion model. Further, the binding affinity score of the generated molecule is predicted using the early fusion approach. Experimental result shows that our framework generates valid and unique molecules with high accuracy while preserving the chemical properties. The use of a knowledge graph claims that the entire generated dataset of molecules was reduced by roughly 96% while retaining more than 85% of good binding desirable molecules and the rejection of more than 99% of fruitless molecules. Additionally, the framework was tested with two of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins: RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro).","output":"Generating novel molecule for target protein (SARS-CoV-2) using drugCtarget interaction based on graph neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CoVID-19 is currently one of the biggest threats to mankind.

Factors associated with mortality were evaluated in multivariable Poisson regression analysis. Results: Among 582 adults included in this analysis 14.9% were 65+ years old, 49.1% were women, 59.3% had uni- or bi-lateral lung involvement on chest computed tomography, 27.1% had any co-morbidity, 13.2% patients had lymphopenia, 4.1% had neutophilosis, 4.8% had low platelet count, 37.6% had d-dimer levels of >0.5 mcg/l. Overall mortality was 2.1% (12/582). After excluding mild infections, mortality among patients with moderate-to-critical disease was 3.0% (12/399), while among patients with severe-to-critical disease mortality was 12.7% (8/63). Baseline characteristics associated with increased risk of mortality in multivariate regression analysis included: age []65 years (RR: 10.38, 95% CI: 1.30-82.75), presence of any chronic co-morbidity (RR: 20.71, 95% CI: 1.58-270.99), lymphopenia (RR: 4.76, 95% CI: 1.52-14.93), neutrophilosis (RR: 7.22, 95% CI: 1.27-41.12), low platelet count (RR: 6.92, 95% CI: 1.18-40.54), elevated d-dimer (RR: 4.45, 95% CI: 1.48-13.35), elevated AST (RR: 6.33, 95% CI: 1.18-33.98).

Emergency medicine physicians must grasp the clinical signs and laboratory results of direct and indirect organ failure, the source of infection management, and the criteria for treating sepsis and septic shock. The pathogenesis of sepsis is connected to inflammation and an excess of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which activate the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-PRR signaling pathways. The development of rapid, sensitive, and precise techniques for sepsis diagnosis might be aided by nanotechnology, a part of nanomedicine. Nanoparticles (NPs) such as magnetic NPs, gold NPs, fluorescent (silica and quantum dots), and lipid-based NPs have all been discussed to contribute to the detection of sepsis-related microbial infections. Because of the intrinsic and unique features of these nano-sized systems, researchers are evaluating nanotechnology-based alternatives for sepsis control. Recent advances in nanotechnology-based technologies for sepsis detection and management are discussed in this study. Databases (PubMed, Medline, PMC, Google Scholar) were used to source various studies that were carried out on sepsis in terms of assessment, types, diagnosis, and treatment controversies, with more attention being given with a focus on the most recent data, principles, and management guidelines.

Objectives: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of symptoms of adjustment disorder compared to posttraumatic symptoms, depression and generalized anxiety in a large sample of adult Poles, in the first phase of the current pandemic. Method: Self-report data from a web-based sample (N = 1,742) was collected between March 25 and April 27, just after the introduction of nationwide quarantine measures in Poland. Results: The current COVID-19 pandemic was a highly stressful event for 75% of participants and the strongest predictor of adjustment disorder. Increased symptoms of adjustment disorder were reported by 49%, and they were associated with female gender and not having a full-time job. However, after exclusion of co-occurring symptomatology, 14% of the sample were finally qualified as meeting diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder. A substantial proportion of the sample screened also positive for generalized anxiety (44%) and depression (26%);the rate for presumptive PTSD diagnosis was 2.4%.

In the past, CD4(+) T cell subsets were viewed as terminally differentiated lineages with limited flexibility. However, it is now clear that Th17 cells can in fact have a high degree of plasticity and convert, for example, into pro-inflammatory Th1 cells or anti-inflammatory Tr1 cells. Interestingly, Th17 cells in experimental GN display limited spontaneous plasticity. Here we review the literature of CD4(+) T cell plasticity focusing on immune-mediated kidney disease. We point out the key findings of the past decade, in particular that targeting pathogenic Th17 cells by anti-CD3 injection can be a tool to modulate the CD4(+) T cell response. This anti-CD3 treatment can trigger a regulatory phenotype in Th17 cells and transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into immunosuppressive IL-10-expressing Tr1 cells (Tr1exTh17 cells).

The primary efficacy measure is failure of prophylaxis as confirmed COVID-19 by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at any time during the study period. This study on 400 participants from three centres is designed to establish non-inferiority for WS to HCQ for prophylaxis against COVID-19 at 80% power and significance P < 0.025, one sided. The interim analysis was carried out on 160 participants after completion of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Participants in both the arms were well matched at the baseline characteristics. 40 participants in the HCQ group and 26 participants in the WS group reported mild AE. The symptoms of confirmed COVID-19 were found to be 3.7% (95% CI 1.3 to 10.5%) in the HCQ and 1.3% (95% CI 0.02 to 6.7%) in the WS arm amongst the first 160 participants completing 8 weeks. CONCLUSION: Our intent was to explore a safer option to HCQ. We report that WS was not found inferior to HCQ and its efficacy was within the 15% non-inferiority margin set a-priori.

To date, glucocorticoids (GC) remain the cornerstone of treatment, but these have several drawbacks. Firstly, a large proportion of patients do not achieve GC-free remission within either the first (over 70%) or second year of treatment (over 50%). Secondly, GC-related adverse events (AE) occur in up to 65% of patients and can be severe. The current EULAR/ACR guidelines for PMR recommend early introduction of methotrexate (MTX) as a GC sparing agent in patients at risk for worse prognosis. However, earlier trials of low to medium quality only studied MTX dosages of 7.5C10 mg/week with no to modest effect. These doses may be suboptimal as MTX is recommended in higher doses (25 mg/week) for other inflammatory rheumatic diseases. The exact role, timing, and dose of MTX in PMR remain unclear, and therefore, our objective is to study the efficacy of MTX 25 mg/week in recently diagnosed PMR patients. METHODS: We set up a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled superiority trial (PMR MODE) to assess the efficacy of MTX 25 mg/week versus placebo in a 1:1 ratio in 100 recently diagnosed PMR patients according to the 2012 EULAR/ACR criteria. All patients will receive prednisolone 15 mg/day, tapered to 0 mg over the course of 24 weeks. In case of primary non-response or disease relapse, prednisolone dose will be temporarily increased. Assessments will take place at baseline, 4, 12, 24, 32, and 52 weeks. The primary outcome is the difference in proportion of patients in GC-free remission at week 52. DISCUSSION: No relapsing PMR patients were chosen, since the possible benefits of MTX may not outweigh the risks at low doses and effect modification may occur. Accelerated tapering was chosen in order to more easily identify a GC-sparing effect if one exists. A composite endpoint of GC-free remission was chosen as a clinically relevant endpoint for both patients and rheumatologist and may reduce second order (treatment) effects.

Recent high-profile reports from international expert bodies have called for a significant reduction in global dietary meat intake, particularly RPM, especially in high-income settings, while acknowledging the importance of animal-sourced foods to population nutrition in many lower-income countries. However, this presents a major yet under-investigated political challenge given strong cultural preferences for meat and the economic importance and power of the meat industry. METHODS A theoretically-guided narrative review was undertaken. The theoretical framework used to guide the review considered the interests, ideas and institutions that constitute food systems in relation to meat reduction; and the instrumental, discursive and structural forms of power that actors deploy in relation to others within the food system. RESULTS High production and consumption levels of RPM are promoted and sustained by a number of factors. Actors with an interest in RPM included business and industry groups, governments, intergovernmental organisations, and civil society. Asymmetries of power between these actors exist, with institutional barriers recognised in the form of government-industry dependence, trade agreement conflicts, and policy incoherence. Industry lobbying, shaping of evidence and knowledge, and highly concentrated markets are key issues. Furthermore, prevailing ideologies like carnism and neoliberalism present embedded difficulties for RPM reduction. The literature noted the power of actors to resist meat reduction efforts exists in varying forms, including the use of lobbying, shaping of evidence and knowledge, and highly concentrated markets. CONCLUSION There are a number of political challenges related to RPM reduction that contribute to policy inertia, and hence are likely to impede the transformation of food systems. Research on policy efforts to reduce RPM production and consumption should incorporate the role of power and political feasibility.","output":"Understanding the Political Challenge of Red and Processed Meat Reduction for Healthy and Sustainable Food Systems: A Narrative Review of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical students are in close contact with patients and should adhere to the same recommendations as healthcare workers. The study aimed to explore medical students' hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccine and evaluate fear of COVID-19 and its relationship with hesitancy. A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst a sample of medical students attending clinical years (November 2020-February 2021, Italy). Multivariable regressions were performed (p < 0.05 as significant). A total of 929 students participated (58.6% of eligible students). Hesitancy was reported by 6.7%;extreme fear of COVID-19 by 42.0%. Among hesitancy predictors, there were the survey completion before COVID-19 vaccine authorisation (adjOR = 6.43), adverse reactions after a vaccination (adjOR = 3.30), and receiving advice against COVID-19 vaccination from a relative (adjOR = 2.40). Students who received the recommended paediatric vaccinations (adjOR = 0.10), students with higher adherence to preventive measures (adjOR = 0.98), and students with fear of contracting COVID-19 with regard to the health of loved ones (adjOR = 0.17) were less likely to be hesitant. Females (adjOR = 1.85), students with poor health (adjOR = 1.64), students who had a loved one severely affected by COVID-19 (adjOR = 1.68), and students with fear of contracting flu (adjOR = 3.06) had a higher likelihood of reporting extreme fear. Hesitancy was remarkably lower than in similar studies. However, there is room for improvement in university activities that could deepen the competence in vaccines.

These intriguing RNA species are formed through a unique mechanism that is known as back splicing in which the 5 and 3 termini are covalently joined. Recent research has revealed that viruses also encode a repertoire of circRNAs. Some of these viral circRNAs are abundantly expressed and are reported to play a role in disease pathogenesis. A growing number of studies also indicate that host circRNAs are involved in immune responses against virus infections with either an antiviral or proviral role. In this review, we briefly introduce circRNA, its biogenesis, and mechanism of action. We go on to summarize the latest research on the expression, regulation, and functions of viral and host\\\\encoded circRNAs during the hostCvirus interaction, with the aim of highlighting the potential of viral and host circRNAs as a suitable target for diagnostic biomarker development and therapeutic treatment of viral\\\\associated diseases.

For most persons living with T1D, the determination of insulin delivery is based on a single measured parameter-glucose. To date, wearable sensors exist that enable the seamless, noninvasive, and low-cost monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this literature survey is to explore whether some of the physiological parameters that can be monitored with noninvasive, wearable sensors may be used to enhance T1D management. METHODS: A list of physiological parameters, which can be monitored by using wearable sensors available in 2020, was compiled by a thorough review of the devices available in the market. A literature survey was performed using search terms related to T1D combined with the identified physiological parameters. The selected publications were restricted to human studies, which had at least their abstracts available. The PubMed and Scopus databases were interrogated. In total, 77 articles were retained and analyzed based on the following two axes: the reported relations between these parameters and T1D, which were found by comparing persons with T1D and healthy control participants, and the potential areas for T1D enhancement via the further analysis of the found relationships in studies working within T1D cohorts. RESULTS: On the basis of our search methodology, 626 articles were returned, and after applying our exclusion criteria, 77 (12.3%) articles were retained. Physiological parameters with potential for monitoring by using noninvasive wearable devices in persons with T1D included those related to cardiac autonomic function, cardiorespiratory control balance and fitness, sudomotor function, and skin temperature. Cardiac autonomic function measures, particularly the indices of heart rate and heart rate variability, have been shown to be valuable in diagnosing and monitoring cardiac autonomic neuropathy and, potentially, predicting and detecting hypoglycemia. All identified physiological parameters were shown to be associated with some aspects of diabetes complications, such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy, as well as macrovascular disease, with capacity for early risk prediction. However, although they can be monitored by available wearable sensors, most studies have yet to adopt them, as opposed to using more conventional devices. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensors have the potential to augment T1D sensing with additional, informative biomarkers, which can be monitored noninvasively, seamlessly, and continuously. However, significant challenges associated with measurement accuracy, removal of noise and motion artifacts, and smart decision-making exist. Consequently, research should focus on harvesting the information hidden in the complex data generated by wearable sensors and on developing models and smart decision strategies to optimize the incorporation of these novel inputs into T1D interventions.","output":"The Potential of Current Noninvasive Wearable Technology for the Monitoring of Physiological Signals in the Management of Type 1 Diabetes: Literature Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change is driven primarily by humanitys use of fossil fuels and the resultant greenhouse gases from their combustion.

The absence of a National Dementia Strategy (NDS) in preparing the healthcare services for the ageing population is compounded by the lack of assessment of preparedness of future healthcare workers to manage complications related to ageing i.e., dementia. Studies in countries with NDS demonstrated lack of dementia knowledge among medical undergraduates. Hence, this study aimed to assess the knowledge on dementia among final year medical undergraduates in Malaysia and its associated factors, using the Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS). METHODS: This cross-sectional study, employed multistage sampling method to recruit final year medical undergraduates from eleven selected public and private medical institutions across Malaysia. Online self-administered measures were delivered to final year medical undergraduates through representatives of medical students society after approval from Deanery and institutional ethics board of participating universities. The measure collected demographic information, previous dementia exposure (i.e., formal or informal) and the 25-item Likert scale DKAS. Bivariate analysis and linear regression were conducted to confirm factors influencing dementia knowledge components. RESULTS: A total of 464 respondents from 7 universities participated in this study. Overall dementia knowledge among respondents with and without exposure, was low, with average score of 29.60  6.97 and 28.22  6.98, respectively. DKAS subscales analysis revealed respondents scored highest in care consideration subscale (9.49  2.37) and lowest in communication and behaviour subscale (4.38  2.39). However, only causes and characteristic subscale recorded significantly higher knowledge score among respondents with previous exposure (7.88  2.58) (p =0.015). Higher knowledge of dementia was associated with previous formal dementia education (p=0.037) and informal occupational/working experience in caring for dementia patients (p = 0.001). Informal occupational/working experience (B = 4.141, 95% CI 1.748C6.535, p = 0.001) had greater effect than formal education (i.e. lectures/workshops) (B = 1.393, 95% CI 0.086C2.700, p = 0.037) to influence respondents knowledge on dementia. CONCLUSION: Dementia knowledge among final year medical undergraduates is low. To improve dementia knowledge, Malaysian medical curriculum should be reviewed to incorporate formal education and informal occupational/working experience, as early as in undergraduate training to help prepare future healthcare providers to recognise dementia among ageing Malaysians.","output":"Assessment of dementia knowledge and its associated factors among final year medical undergraduates in selected universities across Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diabetic foot ulcer is a preventable complication of diabetes that imposes a significant burden on the community.

Although many of them are permentantly hazardous, a number of them live in and on our bodies and they are normally harmless or even helpful. Under certain circumstances, some organisms may cause diseases and these infectious diseases may be passed directly from person to person or via intermediate vectors including insects and other animals. Dengue virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the critical and common sources of infectious diseases. So, it is critical to understand the gene expression profiling and their inferred functions in comparison to the normal and virus infected conditions. Here, we have analyzed the gene expression profiling for dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, and normal human dataset. Similar to it, streptococcus pneumoniae infectious data were analyzed and both the outcomes were compared. Our study leads to the conclusion that the dengue hemorrhagic fever arises in result to potential change in the gene expression pattern, and the inferred functions obviously belong to the immune system, but also there are some additional potential pathways which are critical signaling pathways. In the case of pneumoniae infection, 19 pathways were enriched, almost all these pathways are associated with the immune system and 17 of the enriched pathways were common with dengue infection except platelet activation and antigen processing and presentation. In terms of the comparative study between dengue virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, we conclude that cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), MAPK signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, regulation of actin cytoskeleton, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction are commonly enriched in all the three cases of dengue infection and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, focal adhesion was enriched between classical dengue fever  dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue hemorrhagic fevernormal samples, and SP, and antigen processing and presentation and Leukocyte transendothelial migration were enriched in classical dengue fever normal samples, dengue hemorrhagic fevernormal samples, and Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.","output":"Gene Expression Profiling of Early Acute Febrile Stage of Dengue Infection and Its Comparative Analysis With Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Time and resource barriers limit widespread implementation of frailty assessment in oncology practice, and the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the number of in-person visits. To overcome these barriers, virtual geriatric assessments (GAs) have been developed, but lack important objective performance measures such as gait speed and cognitive tests-measures that are important predictors for poor outcomes in older patients with blood cancers (Liu et al., Blood, 2019;Hshieh et al., JAMA Oncol., 2018). We adapted an in-person frailty assessment to a virtual format that maintained both patient-reported and objective measures. Methods: Our cohort assessed in-person (February 2015 to March 2020;resumed June 2021 to July 2021) included all transplant-ineligible patients aged 75 years and older who presented to DFCI for initial consultation for their hematologic malignancy. On the same day as their initial consult, a research assistant administered to consented patients a screening geriatric assessment that assessed for 42 aging-related health deficits using patient-reported and objective performance measures spanning the domains of function, cognition, comorbidity, and mobility. From this assessment, frailty was measured using both the phenotypic (Fried et al., J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci, 2001) and deficit-accumulation approaches (Rockwood et al., J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci, 2007). The frailty phenotype uses five criteria to define a syndrome (slow gait speed, weakness [grip strength], self-reported exhaustion, low physical activity, and weight loss). The deficit-accumulation method calculates the proportion of deficits present in an individual out of the total number of possible deficits measured. To virtually adapt our assessment (Figure 1), patient-reported items were readily converted to questions administered over video- or teleconference. Of the objective measures, grip strength was replaced with self-reported grip strength. The Clock-in-the-Box test was changed to a simple clock draw that the patient completes and displays to the video camera for scoring. 4-meter gait speed is collected by teaching a caregiver to administer with a stopwatch and a 4-meter strip of ribbon. If video is unavailable, self-reported gait speed is measured instead. We expanded eligibility of virtual assessments to patients aged 70 and older. Geriatricians (C.D., T.H., and J.D.) and oncologists (G.A. and J.D.) reviewed the virtual GA for content validity. We measured the proportion of patients who consented and completed the virtual assessment. We assessed for differences in the distributions of age and frailty between virtual and in-person frailty assessments in patients 75 and older using Fisher exact (age) and Chi-square (frailty) tests. Results: Since starting our virtual frailty assessments in November 2020 through July 2021, 118 patients were enrolled and 89 (75%) completed assessments. Median age was 77.6 years (SD = 4.21), 55 (62%) were male, 38 (43%) had lymphoma, 32 (36%) had leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative disorders, and 19 (21%) had multiple myeloma. Of the 89 who completed virtual assessments, 67 (75%) completed the assessment over video with the remaining 22 (25%) over telephone. For the objective measures, 68 (76%) participants were able to complete the clock draw and 47 (53%) were able to complete the gait speed tests. The distribution of age (p = 0.78) and frailty categories (p = 0.49) in our virtual assessments was similar to that of our in-person assessments (Table 1). Conclusion: We developed and successfully delivered a virtual frailty assessment for older adults with blood cancers and found no evidence that frail patients or patients of the highest age categories were unable to complete them. These data suggest that virtual frailty assessment will allow decentralization of assessments even beyond the pandemic, potentially reaching more older adults with blood cancers. The ability to scale to more patients and measure frailty where it matters most-in their own homes-could help over ome barriers to frailty assessments in busy oncology clinics. Virtual frailty assessments also allow for serial measurement while on treatment to better understand and track the trajectory of frailty in this population.

Worldwide, a substantial care gap exists as children transition from care in a paediatric to adult setting. There is no current consensus on safe and equitable healthcare transition (HCT) for patients with chronic disease in resource-denied settings. Much of the existing literature is specific to HIV care. The objective of this narrative review was to summarise current literature related to adolescent HCT not associated with HIV, in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and other resource-denied settings, in order to inform equitable health policy strategies. Methods A literature search was performed using defined search terms in PubMed and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases to identify all peer-reviewed studies published until January 2020, pertaining to paediatric to adult HCT for adolescents and young adults with chronic disease in resource-denied settings. Following deduplication, 1111 studies were screened and reviewed by two independent reviewers, of which 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Resulting studies were included in thematic analysis and narrative synthesis. Results Twelve subthemes emerged, leading to recommendations which support equitable and age-appropriate adolescent care. Recommendations include (1) improvement of community health education and resilience tools for puberty, reproductive health and mental health comorbidities; (2) strengthening of health systems to create individualised adolescent-responsive policy; (3) incorporation of social and financial resources in the healthcare setting; and (4) formalisation of institution-wide procedures to address community-identified barriers to successful transition. Conclusion Limitations of existing evidence relate to the paucity of formal policy for paediatric to adult transition in LMICs for patients with childhood-onset conditions, in the absence of a diagnosis of HIV.

DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: Fifty-nine dogs (63 hemipelves). METHODS: Radiographs and medical records of dogs with ilial fractures presented to Iowa State University between 2003 and 2019 were reviewed. After fracture reduction, fractures were fixed with a locking plate system (LPS) or non-locking plate system (NLS). Perioperative, long-term complications, and follow-up data were recorded. The frequency of implant failure and pelvic collapse were compared using a logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively. Where the univariate test was statistically significant, a multivariate analysis across categories was performed to identify statistically different categories. RESULTS: LPS and NLS implants were used in 25/63 and 38/63 hemipelves, respectively. Median follow-up time was 8 weeks (3-624 weeks). Implant failure occurred in 18/63 (29%) of fracture repairs, consisting of 17 with NLS and 1 with LPS. Revision surgery was recommended in five cases of implant failure, all with NLS. The probability of implant failure was higher when fractures were fixed with NLS (p = .0056). All other variables evaluated did not seem to influence outcome measures.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of these drugs on QTc-interval and incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD). METHODS: We designed a longitudinal follow-up study of individuals within the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. Eligible individuals had available data on medication and repeated ECG measurements. The study period was between 1 January 1991 and 1 January 2014. We studied on current and past use of [hydroxy]chloroquine as a time-varying exposure; high versus low daily dose of [hydroxy]chloroquine. QTc-interval duration, and the occurrence of SCD were the main outcomes. SCD was defined as an unexpected and sudden death due to cardiac arrhythmia within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms, and in patients without cardiac symptoms within 24 hours before death. RESULTS : Among the study population of 14 594 individuals (58.8% women) with an average age of 65 years, 346 patients used [hydroxy]chloroquine at any time during follow-up. The total number of SCD cases was 609. In a multiple linear mixed model analysis, the current use of [hydroxy]chloroquine was associated with a significantly increased duration of the QTc-interval of 8.1 ms (95% CI: 3.6; 12.6) compared with non-users. The association was stronger among current-high daily dosage [15.3 (95%CI: 7.0; 23.6)] compared with current-low daily dosage [5.5 (95%CI: 0.4; 10.7)] users. In a Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the risk of SCD was significantly higher in participants who were current users of [hydroxy]chloroquine than in non-users [adjusted hazard ratio; 3.7 (95%CI: 1.1; 12.6)]. CONCLUSIONS : In this longitudinal study, persons who received [hydroxy]chloroquine had an increased QTc-interval duration and the association was dose-dependent. [Hydroxy]chloroquine was associated with a significantly increased risk of SCD. As long as their activity against COVID-19 is controversial, cardiotoxicity is a strong argument against using these drugs to treat COVID-19 infections.","output":"QTc-interval prolongation and increased risk of sudden cardiac death associated with hydroxychloroquine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The National Health Service for England Long Term Plan identifies respiratory disease as one of its priority workstreams. To assist with earlier and more accurate diagnosis of lung disease they recommend improvement in delivery of quality-assured spirometry. However, there is a likelihood that patients will present with abnormal gas exchange when spirometry results are normal and therefore there will be a proportion of patients whose time to diagnosis is still protracted. We wished to determine the incidence rate of this occurring within our Trust. METHODS: A retrospective review of all patients attending the lung function laboratory for their first pulmonary function assessment from June 2006 to December 2020 was undertaken. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV(1)/FVC) >?1.64 standardised residual (SR) was used to confirm no obstructive lung function abnormality and FVC >?1.64 SR to confirm no suggestion of a restrictive lung function abnormality. Lung gas transfer for carbon monoxide (TLCO) and transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide (KCO) <?1.64 SR confirmed the presence of a gas exchange abnormality. Spirometry and gas transfer reference values generated by the Global Lung Initiative were used to determine normality. RESULTS: Of 12 835 eligible first visits with normal FEV(1)/FVC and FVC, 4856 (37.8%) were identified as having an abnormally low TLCO and 3302 (25.7%) presenting with an abnormally low KCO. Of 3494 with FEV(1)/FVC SR <?1.64, 3316 also had a ratio of <0.70, meaning 178 (5%) of patients in this cohort would have been misclassified as having obstructive lung disease using the 0.70 cut-off recommended by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease for diagnosing obstructive lung disease. DISCUSSION: In conclusion, to assist with ensuring more accurate and timely diagnosis of lung disease and enhance patients diagnostic pathway, we recommend the performance of lung gas transfer measurements alongside spirometry in all healthcare settings. To assess and monitor gas transfer at the earliest opportunity we recommend this is implemented into new models being developed within community hubs. This will increase the identification of lung function abnormalities and provide patients with a definitive diagnosis earlier.","output":"Early respiratory diagnosis: benefits of enhanced lung function assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has changed the global landscape since last 2 years.

Much evidence has demonstrated that these soluble checkpoints are involved in positive or negative immune regulation and that changes in their plasma levels affect the development, prognosis and treatment of cancer. Since they are endogenous molecules, they will not induce immunological rejection in human beings, which might make up for the deficiencies of monoclonal antibodies and enhance the utility value of these molecules. Therefore, there is an increasing need for investigating novel soluble checkpoints and their functions, and it is promising to develop relevant therapies in the future.

We demonstrated evidence of selection for distinct compositions of synonymous codons in early and late viral genes related to the adaptation of translation efficiency to different bacteriophage developmental stages. Specifically, we showed that evolution of viral coding regions is driven, among others, by selection for codons with higher decoding rates; during the initial/progressive stages of infection the decoding rates in early/late genes were found to be superior to those in late/early genes, respectively. Moreover, we argued that selection for translation efficiency could be partially explained by adaptation to Escherichia coli tRNA pool and the fact that it can change during the bacteriophage life cycle.

National Governments responded to the global crisis by implementing mobility restrictions to slow down the spread of the virus. To assess the impact of those policies on human mobility, we perform a massive comparative analysis on geolocalized data from 13 M Facebook users in France, Italy, and the UK. We find that lockdown generally affects national mobility efficiency and smallworldness-i.e., a substantial reduction of long-range connections in favor of local paths. The impact, however, differs among nations according to their mobility infrastructure. We find that mobility is more concentrated in France and UK and more distributed in Italy. In this paper we provide a framework to quantify the substantial impact of the mobility restrictions. We introduce a percolation model mimicking mobility network disruption and find that node persistence in the percolation process is significantly correlated with the economic and demographic characteristics of countries: areas showing higher resilience to mobility disruptions are those where Value Added per Capita and Population Density are high. Our methods and findings provide important insights to enhance preparedness for global critical events and to incorporate resilience as a relevant dimension to estimate the socio-economic consequences of mobility restriction policies.","output":"Human mobility in response to COVID-19 in France, Italy and UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In her Budget Speech on 1 February 2020, Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, emphasised a three-pillar framework that promised fulfillment of the aspirations of different sections of the society, economic development and a caring society It is undeniable that all three issues are extremely important However, the need for caring and compassion has never been greater in India, than at the present time when the country has been ravaged by health, employment and livelihood related shocks due to Covid-19 This paper uses a gender lens to review the three pillar framework in the Union Budget 2020-21 A few months before preparing the Annual Union Budget, the Ministry of Finance issues a Budget Circular The Budget Circular 2020-21 was issued on 2 October 2019 and required all ministries and departments to report allocations for women and girls in their existing schemes in the Gender Budget Statement (GBS) for Budget 2020-21 This paper analyses the extent to which ministries and departments complied with this stipulation in the GBS It also highlights the inaccuracies in reporting that only 5 percent of Indias Total Budgetary Expenditure is spent on women and girls This inaccurate reporting has persisted since the introduction of the GBS both due to flaws in its conceptualisation as well as in the process followed for reporting in it The paper analyses the schemes and allocations reported in the GBS by the Department of Rural Development, to illustrate how reporting can be improved even within the existing format of the GBS, despite its flaws It draws attention to the Gender Budget prepared by the Government of Odisha to identify ways in which the Union Budget and Budgets of several State Governments can be made more caring and compassionate India was at the forefront of Gender Budgeting more than a decade ago However, over the years it has lost the gains made during the initial years of implementing Gender Budgeting It can regain that lost ground as well as achieve the promises made in the three pillars presented in Union Budget 2020-21 by using the six question framework and tools of Gender Budgeting discussed in the paper Not only will this help them to provide appropriate budgetary estimates in the GBS but it will also lead to gender and poverty transformative planning, budgeting, implementation and outcomes Perhaps next years Budget 2021-22 may then qualify as a Budget that represents a caring society","output":"Union Budget 2020-21 and the Gender Budget Statement: A Critical Analysis from a Gender Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since November 2019, SARS Coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread through more than 195 nations worldwide.

There are data suggesting the role of excessive immune activation and cytokine storm as the cause of lung injury in COVID-19. The excessive immune activation and cytokine storm usually occurs due to an imbalance in redox homeostasis of the individuals. Considering the antioxidant and free radical scavenging action of N acetyl cysteine (NAC), its use might be useful in COVID-19 patients by decreasing the cytokine storm consequently decreasing the disease severity. Therefore, we reviewed all the available resources pertaining to the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cytokine storm and the mechanism of action of NAC in preventing ROS.

Both entities are well known to be associated with severe post-traumatic complications, including pneumonia, a common complication with a significant impact on the further clinical course. However, the relevance of TBI, chest trauma and particularly their combination as risk factors for the development of pneumonia and its impact on outcomes are not fully elucidated. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of poly-traumatized patients treated between 2010 and 2015 at a level I trauma centre was performed. Inclusion criteria were: Injury Severity Score  16 and age  18 years. TBI and chest trauma were classified according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale. Complications (i.e. acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and pneumonia) were documented by a review of the medical records. The primary outcome parameter was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Over the clinical course, 19.9% of all patients developed pneumonia, and in-hospital mortality was 25.3%. Pneumonia (OR 5.142, p = 0.001) represented the strongest independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, followed by the combination of chest injury and TBI (OR 3.784, p = 0.008) and TBI (OR 3.028, p = 0.010). Chest injury alone, the combination of chest injury and TBI, and duration of ventilation were independent predictors of pneumonia [resp.

Pulmonary herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1) reactivation in invasively ventilated patients is a known phenomenon. To date very little is known about the frequency and the predisposing factors of HSV-1 reactivation in COVID-19. Therefore, we evaluated our cohort of invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia for HSV-1 in respiratory specimens and combined these results with functional immunomonitoring of the peripheral blood. Tracheal secretions and bronchial lavages were screened by PCR for HSV-1 positivity. Comprehensive immunophenotyping and quantitative gene expression analysis of Interferon-stimulated genes (IFI44L, MX1, RSAD2, ISIG15 and IFIT1) and IL-1 beta were performed in whole blood. Time course of infection beginning at symptom onset was grouped into three phases (early phase 1: day 1C10, middle phase 2: day 11C30 and late phase 3: day 31C40). Pulmonary HSV-1 reactivation was exclusively observed in the later phases 2 and 3 in 15 of 18 analyzed patients. By FACS analysis a significant increase in activated CD8 T cells (CD38(+)HLADR(+)) in phase 2 was found when compared with phase 1 (p<0.05). Expression of Interferon-stimulated genes (IFI44L, RSAD2 ISIG15, MX1, IFIT1) was significantly lower after HSV-1 detection than before. Taken together, reactivation of HSV-1 in the later phase of SARS-CoV-2- infection occurs in parallel with a drop of antiviral innate responsiveness as shown by decreased expression of Interferon-stimulated genes and a concurrent increase of highly activated CD38(+)HLADR(+) CD8 T cells.","output":"High rate of HSV-1 reactivation in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients: Immunological findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In June 2019, California expanded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility to Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries for the first time.

Findings demonstrate that SNAP enrollment improved participants access to nutritious foods of their choice, contributed to overall budgets, eased mental distress resulting from poverty, and reduced labor spent accessing food. For some participants, SNAP benefit amounts were too low to make any noticeable impact. For many participants, SNAP receipt was associated with stigma, which some considered to be a social cost of poverty. Increased benefit may be derived from pairing SNAP with other public benefits.

The purpose of this study was to describe the presenting symptoms, inpatient stay trajectory, and survival outcomes, for cancer patients infected with COVID-19; who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a single center during the early months of the pandemic. METHODS We reviewed the electronic medical records of all cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution for demographic information, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment intervention and outcomes. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. We determined their survival outcomes as of August 5, 2020. RESULTS Twenty-eight cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 16 (57%) presented to the ED during the study period. The median age of patients who presented to the ED was 61 years, 69% were women, and the median length of hospitalization was 11 days. There was no difference between the groups (ED vs. no ED visit) for demographics, treatment status or solid tumor versus hematologic malignancies or treatments. Dyspnea was a significant symptom with 67% of ED patients experiencing it versus only 17% of those that did not come to the ED (P=0.009). Do not resuscitate orders were initiated in eight patients, as early as two days from ED presentation and two of these patients died, while 88% of patients were discharged alive. CONCLUSIONS Most cancer patients with COVID-19 infection admitted though the ED experienced dyspnea and were discharged from the hospital. We did not notice a statistically significant difference between cancer types or type of therapy. A broad differential is of utmost importance when caring for cancer patients with COVID-19 due to the complexity of this population.

Seven types of CoVs have succeeded in making the leap from animals to humans. Among them, four produce the common cold, while the other three, more recently emerged CoVs, cause the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and exhibit a high epidemic/pandemic potential: SARS-CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The new SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent of the current and unprecedented pandemic, associated with a unique pathology named Corona-virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). These viruses belong to the Coronaviridae family - classified by ICTV (International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses) in the fourth Class, that of enveloped viruses with a positive-strand RNA genome, infectious for both birds and mammals. As an airborne pathogen, its high infectivity is intensified by the widespread expression of its specific entry receptors (ACE-2, TMPRSS2) in various human organs and tissues. SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly from China throughout the whole world, causing numerous infections (approximately 128 million), with a relatively high lethality (approximately 2.8 million). The particular feature of the severe evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is its association with Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS), mainly in older patients or those with comorbidities. In the absence of a standard therapeutic protocol, the medical systems worldwide have been challenged to continuously improve the COVID 19 treatment, based on emerging data from rapidly initiated clinical trials. At the same time, specialists in virology, immunology, and vaccinology have collaborated at an unprecedented pace to design and implement effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

Previous studies have attempted to classify the relationship between transit and TNCs, though analysis has been limited by a lack of granular TNC trip records, or has been conducted at aggregated scales. This study seeks to understand the TNC-PT relationship in Chicago at a spatially and temporally granular level by analyzing detailed individual trip records. An analysis framework is developed which enables TNC trips to be classified according to their potential relationship with transit: complementary (providing access to/from transit), substitutive (replacing a transit alternative), or independent (not desirably completable by transit). This framework is applied to both regular operating conditions and to early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, to identify the TNC-PT relationship in these two contexts. We find that complementary TNC trips make up a small fraction of trips taken (approximately 2%), while potential independent trips represent 48% to 53% and potential substitution trips represent 45% to 50%. The percentage of substitution trips drops substantially following COVID-19 shutdowns (to around 14%). This may be attributed to a reduction in work-based TNC trips from Chicago's north side, indicated by changes in spatial distributions and flattening of trips occurring during peak hours. Furthermore, using spatial regression, we find that an increased tendency of TNC trips to substitute transit is related to a lower proportion of elderly people, greater proportion of peak-period TNC travel, greater transit network availability, a higher percentage of white population, and increased crime rates. Our findings identify spatial and temporal trends in the tendency to use TNC services in place of public transit, and thus have potential policy implications for transit management, such as spatially targeted service improvements and safety measures to reduce the possibility of public transit being substituted by TNC services.","output":"The relationship between ridehailing and public transit in Chicago: A comparison before and after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2013, China proposed its Belt and Road Initiative to promote trade, infrastructure, and commercial associations with 65 countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. This initiative contains important health components. Simultaneously, China launched an unprecedented overseas intervention against Ebola virus in west Africa, dispatching 1200 workers, including Chinese military personnel. The overseas development assistance provided by China has been increasing by 25% annually, reaching US$7 billion in 2013. Development assistance for health from China has particularly been used to develop infrastructure and provide medical supplies to Africa and Asia. China's contributions to multilateral organisations are increasing but are unlikely to bridge substantial gaps, if any, vacated by other donors; China is creating its own multilateral funds and banks and challenging the existing global architecture. These new investment vehicles are more aligned with the geography and type of support of the Belt and Road Initiative. Our analysis concludes that China's Belt and Road Initiative, Ebola response, development assistance for health, and new investment funds are complementary and reinforcing, with China shaping a unique global engagement impacting powerfully on the contours of global health.","output":"China's Silk Road and global health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Several reports on epidemiological and clinical features of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been published. However, mortality and morbidity analyses, important for better understanding the pathogenesis of this disease, are scarce. We examine the clinical and laboratory features of 14 patients who died of COVID-19. Methods. The cohort consisted of 11 male and 3 female patients, with 9 patients aged 70 years or above, and nearly all had underlying diseases. Results. Fever with bilateral pneumonia was the main manifestation. Most patients had consolidations combined with ground glass opacity (GGO) on chest computed tomography scan. Laboratory tests showed lymphocytopenia in 10 patients, high blood glucose in 11, GGT in 5 of the 14 patients, and high LDH in 5 of 6 patients tested. In addition, this cohort had high level of cytokines such as interleukin-6 in all 8 patients tested. Conclusions.

METHODS Between December 2009 and December 2010, 30 patients underwent transumbilical laparo-endoscopic single-site adrenalectomy at our hospital. The procedure was carried out for adrenal cortical adenoma in 17 patients, adrenal pheochromocytoma in seven patients and other types of tumors in six patients. A multichannel port, bent laparoscopic instruments and Opti4 laparoscopic electrodes were used in all patients. The intraperitoneal space was approached through the umbilicus. The multichannel port was placed through a 2-cm incision at the inner edge of the umbilicus. A 5-mm flexible laparoscope was introduced to maintain an adequate laparoscopic view, and surgical specimens were extracted using an Endocatch bag. RESULTS All procedures were successfully completed, with only one incision through the umbilicus, and without conversion to a standard laparoscopic approach. Mean operative time was 120.1  34.7 min. Tumor laterality and patient body mass index did not affect surgical morbidity. The initial 15 patients had a significantly longer mean pneumoperitoneum time (95.8  37.5 min) than the last 15 patients (70.5  18.7 min). Only one postoperative complication was observed (postoperative hematoma).

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2021, to June 30, 2021, using an online survey across frontline healthcare professionals in Turkey. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale were used to evaluate the mental health of the participants, and the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7) was used to evaluate their sleep problems. The data obtained from two different periods, pre-vaccination and post-vaccination, were examined. Results: The study included 416 healthcare professionals. The frequency of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was 27.9%, 31.5%, and 41.1%, respectively, in the pre-vaccination period, and there was a decrease in these rates (22.8%, 21.9%, and 34.1%, respectively) in the post-vaccination period. The differences between the two periods were also statistically significant for the PHQ-9 (p=0.000), GAD-7 (p=0.002), and ISI-7 (p=0.038) scores. We determined that the presence of long weekly working hours, being female, living alone, and presence of psychiatric disease were effective in the development of depression and anxiety.

A quick progression to severe disease might decrease the chance for successful therapy.

Speculations have circulated that exposure to major epidemics helped health systems respond more quickly to COVID-19. This study leverages organizational memory theory to test whether health systems with any, more severe, more recent exposure to major epidemics enacted timelier COVID-19 policy responses. Methods: A dataset was constructed cataloguing 719 policies across 177 health systems in total, 12 of which had major epidemics within the last twenty years. Hypotheses testing used cluster robust regressions with WHO region fixed effects, controlling for several health system expenditure and political variables. Results: Results show that exposure to any major epidemics was nearly significant (p = 0.07) with approximately 20 days earlier response. As the number of total cases from major epidemics increase by one, this was associated with 0.0028 day earlier response (p < 0.001). A decrease of one year from last major epidemics was also associated with 0.4020 day earlier response (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study suggests that health systems do learn from past major epidemics. Policymakers ought to institutionalize lessons from COVID-19 to prevent erosion of organizational memory, and learn from other more severely affected health systems. Future studies can examine specific generalizable lessons and whether timelier responses correlated with lower health and economic impacts.","output":"How Previous Epidemics Enable Timelier COVID-19 Responses: A Cross-Sectional Study Using Organizational Memory Theory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surface polysacharide arabinomannan (AM) and related glycolipid lipoarabinomannan (LAM) play critical roles in tuberculosis pathogenesis.

Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a significant contributor to sterile inflammation after organ transplantation and is associated with detrimental short- and long-term outcomes. While the vicious cycle of sterile inflammation and cellular injury is remarkably consistent amongst different organs and even species, we have begun understanding its mechanistic basis only over the last few decades. This understanding has resulted in the developments of novel, yet non-specific therapies for mitigating IRI-induced graft damage, albeit with moderate results. Thus, further understanding of the mechanisms underlying sterile inflammation after transplantation is critical for identifying personalized therapies to prevent or interrupt this vicious cycle and mitigating allograft dysfunction.

One such broadly used agent is the commonly used macrolide antibiotic tacrolimus. Tacrolimus has several well-known adverse effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, infection, diarrhea. Reports of supraventricular tachycardia as a side effect of tacrolimus are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a 48-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post orthotopic heart transplant who presented to the hospital due to sudden onset palpitations with mild diaphoresis which lasted 30 minutes in duration. Patient reported some mild diaphoresis but no shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or dizziness. The patient stated that he had been experiencing episodes of tachycardia for the last few months but none that had persisted to this extent. He reported medication compliance. His vitals were Temp 98.4, BP 140/88, HR 260, RR 20. After review of his EKG, he was diagnosed with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (referenced EKG is after adenosine administration). The patient was hospitalized a few months prior to admission for COVID 19 infection and acute pulmonary embolism. His transplant antirejection regimen was changed from sirolimus to tacrolimus during this prior hospitalization due to the increased risk of thrombosis associated with sirolimus in view of the recognized prothrombic effects of COVID-19. Incidentally, the patient started experiencing sporadic episodes of tachycardia since this change in his medication regimen. In the emergency department, diagnostic studies such as troponins, CBC, BMP, magnesium, hepatic panel, TSH, CMV DNA were within normal parameters for the patient. Tacrolimus blood concentration level was found to be 17 with a goal normal level between 4 to 6. The patient had a right/left heart catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy which showed no evidence of coronary artery vasculopathy or acute cellular rejection, thereby ruling out other potential causes of his SVT. His tacrolimus dose was subsequently decreased with significant improvement in the frequency of his symptoms and no further reported episodes of SVT (with further tacrolimus levels not exceeding 7). DISCUSSION: The mechanism by which tacrolimus leads to SVT is not well understood. One purported mechanism is through the inhibition of the calcineurin-calcium-calmodulin complex. Calcium calmodulin is coincidentally also used by smooth muscle cells to contract. It is thought that by inhibiting this system, there is a subsequent increase in vasodilation which leads to the increased sympathetic and adrenergic response, thereby increasing the risk of arrhythmias such as SVT. CONCLUSIONS: Incessant dysrhythmias caused by tacrolimus can be life-threatening, whereby we seek to raise awareness of the importance of carefully monitoring patients on this drug.

We explored whether genes in other families are expressed exclusively by analyzing single cell RNA-seq data with a simple metric. Chromosomal segments and families are more likely to express genes concurrently than exclusively, possibly due to the evolutionary and biophysical aspects of shared regulation. Nonetheless, gene families with exclusive gene choice were detected in multiple cell types, most of them are membrane proteins involved in ion transport and cell adhesion, suggesting the coordination of these two functions.

This paper reflects, from both academic and lived experience perspectives, on involving people with lived experience in a study exploring cancer care in prison and how by doing this it enriched the research process. METHODS: This paper is based on written and verbal reflections of the lived experience researchers and academic researchers involved in a study exploring the diagnosis and treatment of people with cancer in prison. The study comprised interviews with people with cancer in prison, prison healthcare staff, oncology specialists and custodial staff. Lived experience researchers were involved throughout the research process, including co-conducting interviews with patients and analysing interviews. RESULTS: This paper highlights the importance and value of including lived experience researchers across the research process. We reflect on how lived experience of prison shapes the experience of conducting interviews and analysing data gathered in prison. We reflect on the working relationships between academic and lived experience researchers. We demonstrate how prison research is challenging, but collaboration between lived experience and academic researchers can help to better prepare for the field, to ask more meaningful questions and to create rapport with participants. These types of collaborations can be powerful avenues for skill development for both academic and lived experience researchers, but they require an investment of time and a willingness for shared learning.

Yet, a considerable proportion of cases remains undetected. Here, we propose GInPipe, a method that rapidly reconstructs SARS-CoV-2 incidence profiles solely from publicly available, time-stamped viral genomes. We validate GInPipe against simulated outbreaks and elaborate phylodynamic analyses. Using available sequence data, we reconstruct incidence histories for Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland, and Victoria (Australia) and demonstrate, how to use the method to investigate the effects of changing testing policies on case ascertainment. Specifically, we find that under-reporting was highest during summer 2020 in Europe, coinciding with more liberal testing policies at times of low testing capacities. Due to the increased use of real-time sequencing, it is envisaged that GInPipe can complement established surveillance tools to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In post-pandemic times, when diagnostic efforts are decreasing, GInPipe may facilitate the detection of hidden infection dynamics.","output":"Rapid incidence estimation from SARS-CoV-2 genomes reveals decreased case detection in Europe during summer 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Containment of highly lethal Ebola virus outbreaks poses a serious public health challenge. Although an experimental vaccine has successfully protected non-human primates against disease(1), more than six months was required to complete the immunizations, making it impractical to limit an acute epidemic. Here, we report the development of accelerated vaccination against Ebola virus in non-human primates. The antibody response to immunization with an adenoviral (ADV) vector encoding the Ebola glycoprotein (GP) was induced more rapidly than with DNA priming and ADV boosting, but it was of lower magnitude. To determine whether this earlier immune response could nonetheless protect against disease, cynomolgus macaques were challenged with Ebola virus after vaccination with ADVCGP and nucleoprotein (NP) vectors. Protection was highly effective and correlated with the generation of Ebola-specific CD8(+) T-cell and antibody responses. Even when animals were immunized once with ADVCGP/NP and challenged 28 days later, they remained resistant to challenge with either low or high doses of virus. This accelerated vaccine provides an intervention that may help to limit the epidemic spread of Ebola, and is applicable to other viruses.

Our approach borrows from Kalman filtering theory, is quick and easy to compute, generalisable, deterministic and unlike many current methods, requires no change-point or window size assumptions. We model R as a flexible, hidden Markov state process and exactly solve forward-backward algorithms, to derive R estimates that incorporate all available incidence information. This unifies and extends two popular methods, EpiEstim, which considers past incidence, and the Wallinga-Teunis method, which looks forward in time. We find that this combination of maximising information and minimising assumptions significantly reduces the bias and variance of R estimates. Moreover, these properties make EpiFilter more statistically robust in periods of low incidence, where several existing methods can become destabilised. As a result, EpiFilter offers improved inference of time-varying transmission patterns that are advantageous for assessing the risk of upcoming waves of infection or the influence of interventions, in real time and at various spatial scales.","output":"Improved estimation of time-varying reproduction numbers at low case incidence and between epidemic waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus, has overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide, putting medical professionals at a high risk of getting infected themselves due to a global shortage of personal protective equipment.

Our patient positioning routine comprises a novel robust dynamic fusion (RDF) algorithm for accurate 3D patient body modeling. With its multi-modal inference capability, RDF can be trained once and used across different applications (without re-training) having various sensor choices, a key feature to enable system deployment at scale. Our multi-view synthesizer ensures multi-view positioning visualization for the technician to verify positioning accuracy prior to initiating the patient scan.

METHODS: This was a comparative, cross-sectional study. Participants were included into two groups: group 1 (n = 30) wore surgical masks, and group 2 (n = 30) wore N95 masks with face shields. Demographic and ocular surface disease index questionnaires (OSDI) were performed. In addition, Tear break-up time (TBUT), corneal and conjunctival fluorescein staining, and meibography to assess meibomian gland loss (MGL) were performed on all participants. Independent T-test was used to compare continuous parameters and Chi-square test for categorical variables. The relationship between continuous variables was tested using bivariate Pearson correlation. RESULTS: Sixty healthcare workers participated in this study (36 females and 24 males). The mean (SD) age of the surgical mask and N95 groups was 35.33 (14.94) and 36.63 (10.64) years, respectively. Both masks caused dryness according to TBUT, MGL, and OSDI scores. DED per DEWS II definition was observed in 14 (46.7%) and 16 (53.3%) patients in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Comparing the two groups, N95 mask caused significantly more dryness according to TBUT (P = 0.042) and fluorescein staining (P = 0.038 for the right eye and P = 0.015 for the left eye).

This has resulted in the issuance of many warning letters by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). While social media continue to serve as the primary platform for the promotion of such fraudulent products, they also present the opportunity to identify these products early by employing effective social media mining methods. In this study, we employ natural language processing and time series anomaly detection methods for automatically detecting fraudulent COVID-19 products early from Twitter. Our approach is based on the intuition that increases in the popularity of fraudulent products lead to corresponding anomalous increases in the volume of chatter regarding them. We utilized an anomaly detection method on streaming COVID-19-related Twitter data to detect potentially anomalous increases in mentions of fraudulent products. Our unsupervised approach detected 34/44 (77.3%) signals about fraudulent products earlier than the FDA letter issuance dates, and an additional 6/44 (13.6%) within a week following the corresponding FDA letters.

Nine studies have reported that laws making indoor workplaces and public places smoke-free were associated with rapid, sizeable reductions in hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, most studies examined hospitalizations for 1 year or less after laws were implemented; thus, whether the observed effect was sustained over time was unknown. The Pueblo Heart Study examined the impact of a municipal smoke-free ordinance in the city of Pueblo, Colorado, that took effect on July 1, 2003. The rate of AMI hospitalizations for city residents decreased 27%, from 257 per 100,000 person-years during the 18 months before the ordinance's implementation to 187 during the 18 months after it (the Phase I post-implementation period). This report extends that analysis for an additional 18 months through June 30, 2006 (the Phase II post-implementation period). The rate of AMI hospitalizations among city residents continued to decrease to 152 per 100,000 person-years, a decline of 19% and 41% from the Phase I post-implementation and pre-implementation period, respectively. No significant changes were observed in two comparison areas. These findings suggest that smoke-free policies can result in reductions in AMI hospitalizations that are sustained over a 3-year period and that these policies are important in preventing morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease. This effect likely is mediated through reduced SHS exposure among nonsmokers and reduced smoking, with the former making the larger contribution.","output":"Reduced hospitalizations for acute myocardial infarction after implementation of a smoke-free ordinance--City of Pueblo, Colorado, 2002-2006."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In Natural Language (NL) applications, there is often a mismatch between what the NL interface is capable of interpreting and what a lay user knows how to express.

Methods: A convenience sample of young adults ages 21-28 (n = 29) were recruited online May-July 2020 to participate in semi-structured interviews about nicotine use behaviors specific to cigarillos and e-cigarettes. Audio-recorded interviews were 60-90 min long and were conducted remotely. Participants were asked opinions and behavioral effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on tobacco use. Verbatim transcripts and field notes from each interview were coded by a trained researcher using a codebook developed using inductive and deductive approaches. Thematic analysis was used to examine product access, use frequency, stress and use triggers. Results: Most current users reported tobacco use stayed the same or increased since the pandemic and attributed this to being home more with greater time/boredom. COVID-19 impacted purchasing behaviors such as purchasing products in greater quantities, through the Internet, or at a different store due to perceived cleanliness. Few reported using tobacco products less frequently and not smoking in public due to the perception of risks associated with smoking and COVID-19, plus having to take off their mask to smoke. Lack of social use modified shared product use, flavors selected, and setting of use. Financial impacts included increased product costs and job loss.

This study explores enablers and barriers experienced by primary care providers when adopting new digital health technologies, using the example of the electronic Patient Reported Outcome (ePRO) tool; a mobile application and web portal designed to support goal-oriented care. To better understand implementation drivers and barriers primary care providers usage behaviours are compared to their perspectives on ePRO utility and fit to support care for patients with complex care needs. METHODS: This qualitative sub-analysis was part of a larger trial evaluating the use of the ePRO tool in primary care. Qualitative interviews were conducted with providers at the midpoint (i.e. 4.5C6 months after ePRO implementation) and end-point (i.e. 9C12 months after ePRO implementation) of the trial. Interviews explored providers experiences and perceptions of integrating the tool within their clinical practice. Interview data were analyzed using a hybrid thematic analysis and guided by the Technology Acceptance Model. Data from thirteen providers from three distinct primary care sites were included in the presented study. RESULTS: Three core themes were identified: (1) Perceived usefulness: perceptions of the tools alignment with providers typical approach to care, impact and value and fit with existing workflows influenced providers intention to use the tool and usage behaviour; (2) Behavioural intention: providers had a high or low behavioural intention, and for some, it changed over time; and (3) Improving usage behaviour: enabling external factors and enhancing the tools perceived ease of use may improve usage behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple refinements/iterations of the ePRO tool (e.g. enhancing the tools alignment with provider workflows and functions) may be needed to enhance providers usage behaviour, perceived usefulness and behavioural intention. Enabling external factors, such as organizational and IT support, are also necessary to increase providers usage behaviour.

SARS-CoV-2-N IgG Indirect in Senegal using a panel of 636 blood samples covering several African-endemic diseases and healthy donors to determine test sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity panel of sera includes 461 serum samples collected from 91 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 cases were confirmed by qRT-PCR and samples were collected on an interval of three days until viral clearance. In addition, 272 sera obtained from COVID-19 negative individuals were selected from a well-documented biobank of sera collected before the COVID-19 outbreak.Finding: High-cross reactivity have been found in individuals with a history of exposure to Chikungunya, HIV, malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), rheumatoid factor as well as healthy donors with respective specificities of 55%, 41.8%, 70%, 70% and 75%. ELISA experiments with commercial assays targeting either SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein and Spike 2 protein or nucleocapsid protein only suggest that cross-reactivity might be directed against Spike 2 protein and not Nucleocapsid protein. Further samples characterisation reveals that anti-malaria IgG is the leading cause of such poor specificities, but exposure to other diseases contributed as well.Interpretation: We anticipate that COVID-19 seroprevalence can be biased if assays are not contextualized.

However, the uptake of ACP among patients with chronic diseases is relatively low. Web-based ACP programs can support patients and their relatives in ACP. However, information needs of patients and their relatives for ACP are unknown. The aim of this study is to explore information needs of patients with chronic disease and their relatives for web-based ACP. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with patients with chronic diseases and relatives at their home or at the study center. In three cases, the patient and relative were paired since they preferred to be interviewed together. We asked about information they would search for when to start with ACP, where they would search for information, what search terms they would use on the Internet, and what content and information they would consider important on an ACP website. The interviewer asked participants to clarify their responses during the interview. We used thematic analysis to analyze the interviewees responses. RESULTS: We interviewed nine patients with different chronic diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and kidney diseases, and seven relatives, namely partners or (adult) children. The interviewees were aged 24 to 80 years, nine were female and seven were male. Both patients with a chronic disease and relatives mentioned comparable information needs. Many interviewees indicated they would use the Internet to search for information about ACP. Mentioned search terms were advance care planning, treatment plan, disease trajectory and names of patient associations. Information needs concerned their disease trajectory and quality of life, medical treatment decisions, practical support in arranging care, the concept of ACP and guidance in ACP, communication of treatment and care preferences, peer support of others with chronic diseases, and information for relatives. Many appreciated encouragement of their healthcare providers to take a pro-active role in ACP. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that information needs for ACP included guidance in ACP, support in making decisions about medical treatment, and practical support in arranging care.

However, environmental impacts associated with this activity have received less attention despite an increasing body of scholarship examining environmental issues related to Antarctic tourism. Aside from raising important research questions, the potential negative effects of tourist visits in Antarctica are also an issue discussed by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. This study presents the results of a meta-analysis of scholarly publications that synthesizes and updates our current knowledge of environmental impacts resulting from Antarctic tourism. A first publication database containing 233 records that focussed on this topic was compiled and subjected to a general bibliometric and content analysis. Further, an in-depth content analysis was performed on a subset of 75 records, which were focussed on showing specific research on Antarctic tourism impacts. The main topic, methods, management proposals, and research gaps highlighted by the respective authors of these 75 publications were assessed. The range of research topics addressed, the methods used - including the application of established research designs from the field of environmental impact assessment -, and the conclusions reached by the study authors are discussed. Interestingly, almost one third of the studies did not detect a direct relationship between tourism and significant negative effects on the environment. Cumulative impacts of tourism have received little attention, and long-term and comprehensive monitoring programs have been discussed only rarely, leading us to assume that such long-term programs are scarce. More importantly, connections between research and policy or management do not always exist. This analysis highlights the need for a comprehensive strategy to investigate and monitor the environmental impacts of tourism in Antarctica. A first specific research and monitoring programme to stimulate a debate among members of the Antarctic scientific and policy communities is proposed, with the ultimate goal of advancing the regulation and management of Antarctic tourism collaboratively.","output":"What are the real environmental impacts of Antarctic tourism?

How many trials and he accumulated sample size by drug or combination of drugs, and by month in 2020 was depicted. We identified 412 clinical trials registers addressing the effect of pharmacological treatments on COVID-19, predominantly from Asia and Europe (42.2% and 31.1% of clinical trials registers, respectively). The most main outcomes studied were clinical recovery (54.4% of the clinical trials registers, respiratory recovery (28.2%) mortality (27.4%), viral load/negativity (20.4%). During 2020, a huge amount of clinical trials are expected to be completed: 41 trials (60,366 participants) using hydroxychloroquine, 20 trials (1,588 participants) using plasma, 18 trials (6,830 participants) using chloroquine, 12 trials (9,938 participants using lopinavir/ritonavir, 11 trials (1,250 participants) using favipiravir, 10 trials ( 2,175 participants) using tocilizumab and 6 trials (13,540 participants) using Remdesivir. The distribution of the number of registered clinical trials among the different therapeutic options leads to an excess of sample size for some and a lack for others. Our data allow us to conclude that by the end of June we will have results of almost 20 trials involving 40000 patients for hydroxychloroquine and 5 trials with 4500 patients for remdesivir; however, low statistical power is expected from the 9 clinical trials testing the efficacy of favipiravir or the 5 testing tocilizumab, since they will recruit less than 1000 patients each one.","output":"The race to find a SARS-CoV-2 drug can only be won by a few chosen drugs: a systematic review of registers of clinical trials of drugs aimed at preventing or treating COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multikinase inhibitors (MKIs), and particularly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), are currently some of the major breakthroughs in cancer treatment. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) revolutionised the treatment of acid-related diseases, but are frequently overused for epigastric pain or heartburn. However, long-term acid suppression from using PPIs may lead to safety concerns, and could have a greater impact in cancer patients undergoing therapy, like bone fractures, renal toxicities, enteric infections, and micronutrient deficiencies (iron and magnesium). Moreover, acid suppression may also affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs (at least during acid suppression) and decrease the absorption of many molecularly-targeted anticancer therapies, which are mostly weak bases with pH-dependent absorption. This type of drug-drug interaction may have detrimental effects on efficacy, with major clinical impacts described for some orally administrated targeted therapies (erlotinib, gefitinib, pazopanib, palbociclib), and conflicting results with many others, including capecitabine. Furthermore, the long-term use of PPIs results in severe alterations to the gut microbiome and recent retrospective analyses have shown that the benefit of using CPIs was suppressed in patients treated with PPIs. These very expensive drugs are of great importance because of their efficacy. As the use of PPIs is not essential, we must apply the precautionary principle. All these data should encourage medical oncologists to refrain from prescribing PPIs, explaining to patients the risks of interaction in order to prevent inappropriate prescription by another physician.","output":"Long-Term Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors in Cancer Patients: An Opinion Paper"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The disruption by the COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate medical education allowed for assessment of virtual curricular innovations. One of the difficulties encountered in the virtual curriculum is the teaching of clinical competencies that would traditionally require students to undergo in-person simulations and patient encounters. We implemented a novel informed consent activity module with standardized patients to improve self-efficacy in communication within our core surgery clerkship. STUDY DESIGN All medical students who participated in the virtual surgery clerkship were recruited to participate in a retrospective survey study regarding the novel informed consent module. These questions evaluated their perceived competence in four domains relating to informed consent: identifying the key elements, describing common challenges, applying the New Mexico Clinical Communication Scale (NMCCS, and documenting. RESULTS 34 out of the 90 students participated in the study (38% of the cohort). Respondents to the survey reported that their self-efficacy in communication skills related to informed consent improved as a result of their participation in the activity in each of the four domains surveyed (p<0.01), with the majority of students identifying as satisfactory or above in each domain post-module. Students generally viewed the virtual informed consent activity positively, but noted that it was not the same as an in-person clinical experience. CONCLUSION A virtual module of communication skills training using standardized patients and faculty improved student belief in their self-efficacy in obtaining informed consent. This communication module can be useful in a virtual or mixed curricular structure for both current and future medical students.","output":"Teaching Effective Informed Consent Communication Skills in the Virtual Surgical Clerkship."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the 5'-terminus encodes a polyprotein, which is further cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins whereas the 3' terminus encodes four structural proteins and eight accessory proteins. Among these 27 proteins, the present study aimed to discover likely antigenic proteins and epitopes to be used for the development of a vaccine or serodiagnostic assay using an in silico approach. For this purpose, after the full genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate and variant proteins that are detected frequently, surface proteins including spike, envelope, and membrane proteins as well as proteins with signal peptide were determined as probable vaccine candidates whereas the remaining were considered as possible antigens to be used during the development of serodiagnostic assays. According to results obtained, among 27 proteins, 26 of them were predicted as probable antigen. In 26 proteins, spike protein was selected as the best vaccine candidate because of having a signal peptide, negative GRAVY value, one transmembrane helix, moderate aliphatic index, a big molecular weight, a long-estimated half-life, beta wrap motifs as well as having stable, soluble and non-allergic features. In addition, orf7a, orf8, and nsp-10 proteins with signal peptide were considered as potential vaccine candidates. Nucleocapsid protein and a highly antigenic GGDGKMKD epitope were identified as ideal antigens to be used in the development of serodiagnostic assays. Moreover, considering MHC-I alleles, highly antigenic KLNDLCFTNV and ITLCFTLKRK epitopes can be used to develop an epitope-based peptide vaccine.","output":"In silico discovery of antigenic proteins and epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 for the development of a vaccine or a diagnostic approach for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a realistic model for the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic subject to the lockdown and quarantine measures, which takes into account the time-delay for recovery or death processes.

Disaster preparedness is an important step towards offsetting potential harm. Research comparing different age groups with respect to their disaster preparedness has produced inconclusive evidence. Some studies found older adults more prepared than younger age groups, whereas others found them to be equally or less prepared. To shed light on this issue, we examined disaster preparedness among N = 16,409 adults age 40 and older from the American Housing Survey. Using logistic regression analyses, we compared preparedness levels of four groups C households of middle-aged adults (age 40-64), older adults (age 65-84), oldest old adults (age 85+), and mixed households comprised of both middle-aged and older adults. Findings showed that households of older adults and the oldest old had significantly higher preparedness levels compared to middle-aged and mixed households, accounting for demographics, living alone, and disability. However, the oldest old group appeared less prepared compared to the older adult group. Thus, while our findings suggest that older adults aged 65-84 may be better prepared for disasters than middle-aged adults, the oldest old group, who are likely at a higher risk of adverse impacts from natural disasters, may be less prepared than their relatively younger counterparts. Therefore, older adults should not be treated as a homogenous group when considering disaster preparedness. Rather, policies and interventions to improve disaster preparedness may benefit from focusing on specific high vulnerability groups.","output":"Disaster Preparedness Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Who is the Least Prepared?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the first patient with 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was reported in Wuhan, China, and the disease spread rapidly across the country and surrounding countries within 2 mo. As of February 29, 2020, a total of 91 confirmed cases had been reported in Gansu Province. This case report of the diagnosis and treatment of an elderly patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia complicated by acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Gansu Province aims to provide a better reference for the treatment of patients in the future. CASE SUMMARY: The patient, a 94-year-old female, lived in Maiji District of Tianshui, Gansu Province, China. On January 30, 2020, she was admitted to the Fourth Peoples Hospital of Tianshui after 9 d of close contact with a patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia. She was subsequently admitted to Gansu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine for isolation and transferred to Tianshui Gansu Provincial Hospital of Infectious Diseases on February 3, 2020 for treatment. Upon initial examination, her body temperature was 36.7 C , pulse was 80, breathing was 20, and blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg. She was conscious with normal development and normal nutrition. The pharynx was not red, and bilateral tonsils were not red and swollen. The lungs sounded slightly coarse with no dry or wet rales. The first symptoms were cough and fatigue on 2 February. The patient was hospitalized for 12 d. After active treatment, she was discharged on February 14 with a good prognosis. CONCLUSION: A history of exposure to the affected area or patient is a major cause of 2019-nCoV infection, and population clustering is a high risk factor for transmission. Patients may not necessarily have respiratory system symptoms as the only clinical manifestation but may also have concomitant or first onset digestive symptoms. Attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Nucleic acid testing is extremely important and needs to be repeated several times. Laboratory and auxiliary examination indicators during the first week of admission are extremely important. It is feasible to carry out dynamic and continuous index monitoring, which can predict and guide the prevention and treatment of multiple organ dysfunction and the prognosis of the disease.","output":"Diagnosis and treatment of an elderly patient with 2019-nCoV pneumonia and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Gansu Province: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 72 million cases and 1.6 million deaths. End-stage lung disease from COVID-19 is a new and growing entity that may benefit from lung transplant, however there is limited data on the patient selection, perioperative management and expected outcomes of transplantation for this indication. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed with searches of MEDLINE and Web of Science databases as well the gray literature. All manuscripts, editorials, commentaries and gray literature reports of lung transplantation for COVID related respiratory failure were included. A case from the University of Virginia is described and included in the review. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies were included; 11 manuscripts, 5 commentaries, and 11 gray literature reports. The total number of transplantations for COVID related lung disease was 21. The mean age was 55  12 years, 16 (76%) were male, and the acuity was high with 85% on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation preoperatively. There was a 95% early survival rate, with one additional late death. There is growing histopathologic evidence for permanent structural damage with no replicating virus at the time of transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral lung transplantation is an effective treatment option with reasonable short-term outcomes for patients suffering from end-stage lung failure secondary to COVID-19. However, specific considerations in this new population require a multidisciplinary approach.

In the current article, we provide an overview of essential information about NA, including the etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic investigations, differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The causes of NA are multifactorial and include immunological, mechanical, or genetic factors. Typical clinical findings are a sudden onset of pain in the shoulder region, followed by patchy flaccid paralysis of muscles in the shoulder and/or arm. A diagnosis of NA is based on a patients clinical history and physical examination. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and high-resolution magnetic resonance neurography are useful for confirming the diagnosis and choosing the appropriate treatment. However, before a diagnosis of NA is confirmed, other disorders with similar symptoms, such as cervical radiculopathy or rotator cuff tear, need to be ruled out. The prognosis of NA depends on the degree of axonal damage. In conclusion, many patients with motor weakness and pain are encountered in clinical practice, and some of these patients will exhibit NA.

METHODS: Seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated for the majority of HCW in an English teaching hospital 2 months following the peak of COVID-19 first wave. A questionnaire investigating the long-term complications was sent through global e-mail to HCW 4 months following the peak of the wave enquiring about the persistent health issues still affecting them at that point. RESULTS: Out of 3759 subjects tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, 932 were positive (24%). Forty-five per cent of 138 HCW responding to the questionnaire reported persistent symptoms with 32% struggling to cope 3-4 months following the peak of the wave. Moderate-to-severe fatigue stood out as the most disabling symptom (39%) but mild-to-moderate shortness of breath, anxiety and sleep disturbance were almost universal in the subjects still struggling with symptoms. Only 16% consulted their general practitioner (GP) about their symptoms with only 2% taking sick leave after recovering from the acute illness.

The hospital was providing services to COVID positive patients, as well as emergency and tertiary care services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the participants in the study were high risk groups who were in direct interaction with COVID positive patients. Methods: : The COVID-19 training program was conducted for more than three months, with the aim of training all the health care workers at a tertiary care institute, during the Corona virus pandemic. Twenty trainers, who had completed at least 30 or more sessions of training more than 2700 health workers, were included in this study. These trainers were interviewed for an average of thirty minutes per participant and were asked 30 open ended questions each. Results: : The mean age of the trainers was 28.9 years, and 75% of them were females.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively included 73 consecutive patients who were treated for anterior circulation acute stroke by mechanical thrombectomy from December 2009 to September 2013. Each patient underwent MR imaging before mechanical thrombectomy. The presence (susceptibility vessel sign+) or absence of the susceptibility vessel sign (susceptibility vessel sign-) was recorded. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed either alone or in association with IV tPA according to the site and time after occlusion. Good functional outcome was defined by an mRS  2 at 3 months in susceptibility vessel sign+ and susceptibility vessel sign- groups. Patient clinical characteristics, initial NIHSS score and ASPECTS, site of occlusion, time between onset to groin puncture, TICI after mechanical thrombectomy, NIHSS score at day 1, and spontaneous hyperattenuation on CT at day 1 were also analyzed. RESULTS Fifty-three patients with susceptibility vessel sign+ and 20 with susceptibility vessel sign- were included in our study. mRS  2 at 3 months occurred in 65% patients in the susceptibility vessel sign+ group and 26% in the susceptibility vessel sign- group (P = .004).

venous access as an alternative 2 We report a case of acute pulmonary edema secondary to rheumatic heart disease which was managed successfully with ultrasoundguided low approach femoral central venous access Materials and methods: A 37-year-old woman with a history of rheumatic heart disease presented in intensive care with acute pulmonary edema The nasopharyngeal swab was taken for reverse-transcriptionpolymerase- chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay to rule out COVID-19 The patient was managed in a line of acute pulmonary edema with an upright position, oxygen support, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), furosemide, and morphine This patient required urgent central venous access for starting vasopressor and further management As the patient was unable to lie flat on the bed and multiple attempts for vascular access were already tried in the emergency department, we planned for low approach femoral access We used ultrasound with a linear probe to scan the femoral vessel at the level of the groin By keeping the femoral vein in the center of the screen, a needle was inserted from the middle of the linear probe at an angle of 30 to 45 The position of the guidewire inside the femoral vein was confirmed with ultrasound by using a long axis view before threading the catheter over it The cannulation was successful in the first attempt Discussions: In this case, we successfully inserted an ultrasound-guided femoral central line 5 cm below the inguinal ligament in a view to further reduce catheter induced infection rate It has been suggested that the risk of infection will be very much reduced if we use full barrier precaution, ultrasound guidance, low approach, tunneling, and medicated catheter Another advantage of low approach femoral access is that a person doing this procedure is away from the respiratory passage of the patient it may reduce chances of airborne infection during the COVID-19 pandemic Placing the catheter in the femoral vessel will not interfere with the respiratory care (helmet-based NIV) Proning patients during mechanical ventilation and dressing of the line is also not a problem with low approach femoral venous access Femoral access should be avoided in patients with peripheral venous and arterial disease and renal transplant Conclusion: In this case, we have highlighted that modification of femoral venous access helps to achieve the central access quite fast and also increases the safety of both patient and operator We suggest that in present times of COVID-19 pandemic, ultrasound-guided low approach femoral central

The study of humoral immune responses and in vitro T cell production after infection requires the obtaining of individualized blood samples to test the presence of antibodies or activated T cells specific for the virus. In vitro T cell studies are especially troublesome due to the need for more specialized resources often outside the daily routine of clinical laboratories. For this reason the development of a simple and objective method to achieve these T cell studies is needed. In this manuscript we reviewed the hypersensitivity reactions, the theoretical basis and the historical background of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) which uses the principles of use of this test in the clinical setting for the past century. In the second part of the review, we focus on COVID adaptive immune responses, to understand the differences and challenges offered by this new application of DTH to investigate immune responses elicited after infection.

METHODS: County\\\\level COVID\\\\19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban\\\\Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan/noncore). Daily COVID\\\\19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID\\\\19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11\\\\week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID\\\\19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August.

Recently, a few alkaloids from a traditional Indian medicinal plant, Vasaka (Justicia adhatoda), have been linked computationally to the main protease (Mpro) of SARS_CoV_2. To expand the knowledge and for further investigation, we have selected 41 quinazoline alkaloids from two natural product databases to create an adequate library and performed detailed computational studies against the main protease (Mpro) of SARS_CoV_2. The screening of the library was carried out through blending the rigid docking and pharmacokinetic analysis that resulted in nine alkaloids as initial leads against Mpro. These nine alkaloids were further subjected to advance flexible docking using first reference famotidine for the analysis of structure-based interactions. For further selection, a second screening was carried out based on binding energies and interaction profiles that yielded three alkaloids namely CNP0416047, 3-hydroxy anisotine and anisotine as hits. The stereo-electronic features of hit alkaloids were further investigated through additional structure-based E-pharmacophore mapping against a second reference, known X77 ligand. Additionally, the reactivity of hit alkaloids at the binding site of the protein was estimated by measuring the electron distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals and HOMO-LUMO band energies. Finally, the stabilities of complexes between hit alkaloids with the protein were accessed extensively using robust molecular dynamics simulation through RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and MM-PBSA calculation.

The performance accuracy of human activity recognition (HAR) models mainly depend on the features which are extracted from domain knowledge. The features are the input of the classification algorithm to efficiently identify human physical activities. Manually extracted features (handcrafted) need expert domain knowledge. Thus these features have significant importance to identify different human activities. Recently deep learning methods are utilized to extract the features automatically from raw sensory data for HAR models. However, state-of-the-art HAR literature established that the importance of handcrafted features cant be ignored as it is extracted from expert domain knowledge. Thus, in this paper we use the fusion of both the handcrafted features and automatically extracted features using deep learning (DL) for HAR model to enhance the performance of HAR.

We herein discuss clinical course and outcome of critically ill obese patients with COVID-19 admitted to critical care unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of critically ill obese patients hospitalized with COVID-19 over a span of 6 months. Management was guided according to the institutional protocol. Collected data included demographic parameters (age, sex, comorbidities, and body mass index (BMI)), complications, inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-6, Ferritin), length of mechanical ventilation, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and inhospital death. RESULTS: There was no appreciable difference in terms of demographics, inflammatory markers, predictors of mortality scores, and comorbidity indices between the survivors and nonsurvivors. Among outcome analysis, there was a statistically significant difference between ventilator days between survivors and nonsurvivors (p = 0.003(**)). CONCLUSION: Obesity itself is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 infection; however, if efficiently managed and in a protocol-determined manner, it can have a favorable outcome.

Macaca tonkeana is classified as a tolerant macaque species characterized by social interactions minimally constrained by dominance rank or kinship. Tonkean macaques, as other egalitarian species, rely on a complex facial communicative system. We found that the degree of mouth opening (ranging from covered to uncovered tooth yawns) and the duration of yawning were not strictly dependent. The shortest uncovered tooth yawns were associated with an intense locomotor/physical activity and peaked immediately after stressful social events thus indicating an increase in arousal. In contrast, longer yawns, independently from teeth exposure, were primarily associated with a relaxed state of the subject. In conclusion, our study suggests that to explore the potential different functions of yawning, it is necessary to focus on the variability of its expression both in terms of morphology and duration, because not all yawns tell the same story.","output":"Not all yawns tell the same story: The case of Tonkean macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Starting 2020, the whole world faced covid-19 pandemic that was spreading across countries including Malaysia.

OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in CT manifestations of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia and those of influenza virus pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We conducted a retrospective study of 52 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and 45 patients with influenza virus pneumonia. All patients had positive results for the respective viruses from nucleic acid testing and had complete clinical data and CT images. CT findings of pulmonary inflammation, CT score, and length of largest lesion were evaluated in all patients. Mean density, volume, and mass of lesions were further calculated using artificial intelligence software. CT findings and clinical data were evaluated. RESULTS. Between the group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the group of patients with influenza virus pneumonia, the largest lesion close to the pleura (i.e., no pulmonary parenchyma between the lesion and the pleura), mucoid impaction, presence of pleural effusion, and axial distribution showed statistical difference (p < 0.05). The properties of the largest lesion, presence of ground-glass opacity, presence of consolidation, mosaic attenuation, bronchial wall thickening, centrilobular nodules, interlobular septal thickening, crazy paving pattern, air bronchogram, unilateral or bilateral distribution, and longitudinal distribution did not show significant differences (p > 0.05). In addition, no significant difference was seen in CT score, length of the largest lesion, mean density, volume, or mass of the lesions between the two groups (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION. Most lesions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were located in the peripheral zone and close to the pleura, whereas influenza virus pneumonia was more prone to show mucoid impaction and pleural effusion.

A major reason why a vaccine is not available is the high mutability of the virus, which enables it to evolve mutations that can evade human immune responses. This challenge is exacerbated by the ability of the virus to evolve compensatory mutations that can partially restore the fitness cost of immune-evading mutations. Based on the fitness landscapes of HIV proteins that account for the effects of coupled mutations, we designed a single long peptide immunogen comprising parts of the HIV proteome wherein mutations are likely to be deleterious regardless of the sequence of the rest of the viral protein. This immunogen was then stably expressed in adenovirus vectors that are currently in clinical development. Macaques immunized with these vaccine constructs exhibited T-cell responses that were comparable in magnitude to animals immunized with adenovirus vectors with whole HIV protein inserts. Moreover, the T-cell responses in immunized macaques strongly targeted regions contained in our immunogen.

We describe the development of a reusable public health data analytics system for reuse of clinical data to evaluate the health burden, disparities, and impact of COVID-19 on populations served by health centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Multi-State Data Strategy engaged project partners to assess public health readiness and COVID-19 data challenges. An infrastructure for data capture and sharing procedures between health centers and public health agencies was developed to support existing capabilities and data capacities to respond to the pandemic. RESULTS: Between August 2020 - March 2021, project partners evaluated their data capture and sharing capabilities and reported challenges and preliminary data. Major interoperability challenges included poorly aligned federal, state, and local reporting requirements, lack of unique patient identifiers, lack of access to pharmacy, claims and laboratory data, missing data, and proprietary data standards and extraction methods. DISCUSSION: Efforts to access and align project partners existing health systems data infrastructure in the context of the pandemic highlighted complex interoperability challenges. These challenges remain significant barriers to real-time data analytics and efforts to improve health outcomes and mitigate inequities through data-driven responses.

This is important to predict the current and future status of the pandemic. With the recent emergence of new and more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variants, assays allowing for high throughput analysis of antibodies able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 become even more important. Here, we report the development and validation of a robust, high throughput method, which enables the assessment of antibodies inhibiting the binding between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The assay uses recombinantly produced spike-f and ACE2 and is performed in a bead array format, which allows analysis of up to 384 samples in parallel per instrument over seven hours, demanding only one hour of manual handling. The method is compared to a microneutralization assay utilising live SARS-CoV-2 and is shown to deliver highly correlating data. Further, a comparison with a serological method that measures all antibodies recognizing the spike protein shows that this type of assessment provides important insights into the neutralizing efficiency of the antibodies, especially for individuals with low antibody levels. This method can be an important and valuable tool for large-scale assessment of antibody-based neutralization, including neutralization of new spike variants that might emerge.","output":"A cell-free high throughput assay for assessment of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is still a global pandemic that has not been stopped. Many traditional medicines have been demonstrated to be incredibly helpful for treating COVID-19 patients while fighting the disease worldwide. We introduced 10 bioactive compounds derived from traditional medicinal plants and assessed their potential for inhibiting viral spike protein (S-protein), Papain-like protease (PLpro), and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) using molecular docking protocols where we simulate the inhibitors bound to target proteins in various poses and at different known binding sites using Autodock version 4.0 and Chimera 1.8.1 software. Results found that the chicoric acid, quinine, and withaferin A ligand strongly inhibited CoV-2 S -protein with a binding energy of ?8.63, ?7.85, and ?7.85 kcal/mol, respectively. Our modeling work also suggested that curcumin, quinine, and demothoxycurcumin exhibited high binding affinity toward RdRp with a binding energy of ?7.80, ?7.80, and ?7.64 kcal/mol, respectively. The other ligands, namely chicoric acid, demothoxycurcumin, and curcumin express high binding energy than the other tested ligands docked to PLpro with ?7.62, ?6.81, and ?6.70 kcal/mol, respectively. Prediction of drug-likeness properties revealed that all tested ligands have no violations to Lipinskis Rule of Five except cepharanthine, chicoric acid, and theaflavin. Regarding the pharmacokinetic behavior, all ligand predicted to have high GI-absorption except chicoric acid and theaflavin. At the same way chicoric acid, withaferin A, and withanolide D predicted to be substrate for multidrug resistance protein (P-gp substrate). Caffeic acid, cepharanthine, chicoric acid, withaferin A, and withanolide D also have no inhibitory effect on any cytochrome P450 enzymes. Promisingly, chicoric acid, quinine, curcumin, and demothoxycurcumin exhibited high binding affinity on SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and expressed good drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties.

This study aimed to investigate whether videos available on YouTube, presenting procedures of donning and doffing personal protective equipment, can be a useful learning resource for healthcare workers. METHODS: A search of YouTube was conducted using the keywords \\"Covid-19, personal protective equipment, donning, doffing\\". Two investigators reviewed each video and collected the basic video information. Total videos were assessed independently as educationally useful and non-useful categories using a valid tool. The relationship of each video's usefulness with viewers' preferences and the upload source were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 300 videos were assessed; 66 (22%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Total video scores of educationally useful videos were higher than non-useful ones; the differences were significant. Healthcare/government agencies and hospitals mostly created educationally useful videos, e-learning platforms, and individuals mainly created non-useful videos. Significant correlations were observed between the video's usefulness and the total view and views per day.

METHODS: In this open-label, single-center, phase 1 study, eligible Chinese subjects received one of three OPC doses (25, 50, or 100 mg), and Caucasian subjects received either 25 or 50 mg of OPC. All subjects were administered a single dose of OPC, whereas subjects in the 50-mg OPC group continued to receive once-daily doses of 50 mg OPC for 10 days. The primary endpoint was to evaluate and compare the plasma concentrations and PK parameters of OPC and its main metabolite, and erythrocyte-soluble catechol-O-methyltransferase (S-COMT) activity in Chinese subjects with that of Caucasian subjects. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate the safety of OPC in Chinese subjects. The estimated results for geometric mean ratios (GMRs) were evaluated with the standard bioequivalence (BE) limits between 80% and 125% to evaluate the ethnic differences. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. RESULTS: In total, 70 subjects (45 Chinese, 25 Caucasian) were enrolled; the majority of them were male (85.7%). The plasma exposure of both OPC and BIA 9-1103 increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner in both populations. Maximum S-COMT inhibition ranged from 79% to 95% after a single dose and was about 94% after a 10-day once-daily regimen in both populations. The point estimates of GMRs (Chinese/Caucasian) and 90% CI, except C(max) in 25-mg and 50-mg OPC groups, for PK and PD parameters were within 80% to 125%. Furthermore, no new risks or safety concerns associated with OPC were identified, indicating a tolerable safety profile in healthy Chinese subjects. CONCLUSION: Ethnicity had no significant impact on PK and PD parameters after single or multiple doses of OPC, and OPC was safe and tolerable in healthy Chinese subjects.

Epigenetic modification has been found to play an important role in cell differentiation and regulation, among which histone deacetylase (HDAC) is involved in suppressing genes by removing histone acetyl groups. The use of HDAC inhibitor to control this is increasing and has been widely studied by many researchers. This study aimed to induce differentiation by causing epigenetic changes in odontoblast-related genes and the MAPK signaling pathway in human dental pulp stem cells. Western blot and immunofluorescence staining showed increased expression of DMP-1, ALP, DSPP, and RUNX2 compared to the control. However, activation of the MAPK signaling system was similar to but slightly different from the expression of odontoblast-related proteins. After 3 days, as shown by MTT and LDH assays, proliferation decreased overall, but cytotoxicity decreased at only a specific concentration. We confirmed that there was no change in mRNA expression of caspase 3 or 9 using real-time PCR. In addition, flow cytometry analysis confirmed that differentiation occurred due to the decrease in the expression of the CD73 and CD146. Although overall proliferation was reduced due to the G2/M inhibition of the cell cycle, the expression of BCL-2 protected the cells from cell death. Overall, cell proliferation decreased in response to MS-275, but it did not induce cytotoxicity in 5 nM and 10 nM concentration and induces differentiation into odontoblast-like cells.","output":"The Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor (MS-275) Promotes Differentiation of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells into Odontoblast-Like Cells Independent of the MAPK Signaling System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tourism is capable of distributing wealth and participating substantially in the economic development of many countries. However, to ensure these benefits, the planning, management, and monitoring of a sustainable offer become crucial. Despite the increasingly widespread attention to sustainability in this sector, however, the concept of sustainable tourism still appears fragmented and fuzzy. The theoretical frameworks used in many studies often reduce sustainability to its environmental or social aspects and consider such pillars as separate issues. Furthermore, although most studies acknowledge that a potentially wide number of stakeholders play a role in sustainable tourism production, they have so far focused on host communities, tourism producers, or tourists themselves independently. Fewer explorations have addressed simultaneously different stakeholders, their perceptions of sustainable tourism experience, and the various concerns and tensions that may arise. This study aims to investigate sustainability issues in tourism by considering the voices of two relevant stakeholders involved in co-producing the tourism experience: tourists and tour operators. Based on a qualitative study conducted in Italy, the article critically discusses how travelers and tour operators craft the sustainability idea, the implicit assumptions that rely on their different perspectives, and their practical implications. The results highlight four different narratives on sustainable tourism, which are related to different assumptions on sustainability and actions legitimated to generate sustainable value.

Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grows linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave.

Deletion of single-stranded flanking sequences at either side of the hairpin also affected RNA accumulation with combined alterations at both sides of the hairpin showing the most detrimental effect in protoplasts. In vitro analysis with a partially purified TCV RdRp preparation demonstrated that the motif1-hairpin in its minus-sense orientation was able to stimulate RNA synthesis from the satC hairpin promoter (located at the 3' end of plus strands) by almost twofold. This level of RNA synthesis stimulation is approximately fivefold lower than that observed with a linear promoter, suggesting that a highly stable hairpin promoter is less responsive to the presence of the motif1-hairpin enhancer than a linear promoter. The motif1-hairpin in its plus-sense orientation was only 60% as active in enhancing transcription from the hairpin promoter. Since the motif1-hairpin is a hotspot for RNA recombination during plus-strand synthesis and since satC promoters located on the minus-strand are all short linear sequences, these findings support the hypothesis that the motif1-hairpin is primarily involved in enhancing plus-strand synthesis.","output":"In vivo and in vitro characterization of an RNA replication enhancer in a satellite RNA associated with turnip crinkle virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Family physicians or pediatricians and general practitioners (GPs) work in non-hospital settings GPs usually visit many patients, frequently at their homes, with low potential, if any, to control the work setting Particularly during the initial phases of the COVID-19 outbreak, they were not informed about the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, with inadequate information regarding the risk, a lack of suitable protective measures and, in some cases, deficient or poor accessibility to personal protective equipment (PPE) During the first wave of COVID-19, primary care physicians were on the front line and isolated the first cases of the disease The present study aims to estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a cohort of 133 GPs working in Catania (Italy) after the first wave of COVID-19 Serological analysis revealed a low seroprevalence (3%) among GPs The low seroprevalence highlighted in the results can be attributed to correct management of patients by GPs in the first wave It is now hoped that mass vaccination, combined with appropriate behavior and use of PPE, can help further reduce the risk of COVID-19 disease","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence Post-First Wave among Primary Care Physicians in Catania (Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the emergency department (ED) is a crucial necessity, especially in settings of overcrowding: establishing a pre-diagnostic test probability of infection would help to triage patients and reduce diagnostic errors, and it could be useful in resource-limited countries.

The cumulative score based on routine blood parameters can be used to predict an early and accurate diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in symptomatic patients, thereby facilitating triage and optimizing early management and isolation from the COVID-19 free population, particularly useful in overcrowding situations and in resource-poor settings.","output":"A Diagnostic Model to Predict SARS-CoV-2 Positivity in Emergency Department Using Routine Admission Hematological Parameters"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Predicting bed occupancy for hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requires understanding of length of stay (LoS) in particular bed types. LoS can vary depending on the patient's \\"bed pathway\\" - the sequence of transfers between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy. Design We obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020. Results In both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: \\"Ward, CC, Ward\\", \\"Ward, CC\\", \\"CC\\" and \\"CC, Ward\\". Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days. For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities. Conclusions We identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.","output":"Importance of patient bed pathways and length of stay differences in predicting COVID-19 bed occupancy in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To update the EULAR points to consider (PtCs) on the use of immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19. METHODS: According to the EULAR standardised operating procedures, a systematic literature review up to 14 July 2021 was conducted and followed by a consensus meeting of an international multidisciplinary task force. The new statements were consolidated by formal voting. RESULTS: We updated 2 overarching principles and 12 PtC. Evidence was only available in moderate to severe and critical patients. Glucocorticoids alone or in combination with tocilizumab are beneficial in COVID-19 cases requiring oxygen therapy and in critical COVID-19. Use of Janus kinase inhibitors (baricitinib and tofacitinib) is promising in the same populations of severe and critical COVID-19. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma may find application in early phases of the disease and in selected subgroups of immunosuppressed patients. There was insufficient robust evidence for the efficacy of other immunomodulators with further work being needed in relation to biomarker-based stratification for IL-1 therapy CONCLUSIONS: Growing evidence supports incremental efficacy of glucocorticoids alone or combined with tocilizumab/Janus kinase inhibitors in moderate to severe and critical COVID-19.

Our objective was to compare outcomes of laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) vs. open total gastrectomy (OTG) for gastric adenocarcinoma using a national cancer database. METHODS The National Cancer Database (2010-2014) was analyzed for total gastrectomy cases performed for gastric adenocarcinoma. Patient demographics and surgical outcomes were stratified by stage and compared based on laparoscopic vs. open surgical approach. Primary outcome measures included 30-day and 90-day mortality and Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate long-term survival. RESULTS There were 2584 cases analyzed, including 592 (22.9%) stage I, 710 (27.5%) stage II, and 1282 (49.6%) stage III cases. The distribution of LTG vs. OTG cases was 156 (26.4%) vs. 436 (73.6%) for stage I, 163 (23.0%) vs. 547 (77.0%) for stage II, and 241 (18.8%) vs. 1041 (81.2%) for stage III. For all stages analyzed, there was no difference between laparoscopic vs. open approach for adjusted 30-day mortality (stage I: adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0.52, p = 0.75; stage II: AOR 1.36, p > 0.99; stage III: AOR 0.46, p = 0.29) or 90-day mortality (stage I: AOR 0.46, p = 0.99; stage II: AOR 1.17, p = 0.99; stage III: 0.57, p = 0.29).

UPSIDES (Using Peer Support In Developing Empowering mental health Services) is a six-country consortium carrying out implementation research on peer support for people with severe mental health conditions in high- (Germany, Israel), lower middle- (India) and low-income (Tanzania, Uganda) settings. This commentary briefly outlines some of the key challenges faced by UPSIDES sites in low- and middle-income countries as a result of Covid-19, sharing early lessons that may also apply to other services seeking to address the needs of people with severe mental health conditions in similar contexts. CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED: The key take-away from experiences in India, Tanzania and Uganda is that inequalities in terms of access to mobile technologies, as well as to secure employment and benefits, put peer support workers in particularly vulnerable situations precisely when they and their peers are also at their most isolated. Establishing more resilient peer support services requires attention to the already precarious situation of people with severe mental health conditions in low-resource settings, even before a crisis like Covid-19 occurs. While it is essential to maintain contact with peer support workers and peers to whatever extent is possible remotely, alternatives to face-to-face delivery of psychosocial interventions are not always straightforward to implement and can make it more difficult to observe individuals reactions, talk about emotional issues and offer appropriate support. CONCLUSIONS: In environments where mental health care was already heavily medicalized and mostly limited to medications issued by psychiatric institutions, Covid-19 threatens burgeoning efforts to pursue a more holistic and person-centered model of care for people with severe mental health conditions. As countries emerge from lockdown, those working in global mental health will need to redouble their efforts not only to make up for lost time and help individuals cope with the added stressors of Covid-19 in their communities, but also to regain lost ground in mental health care reform and in broader conversations about mental health in low-resource settings.","output":"Challenges to peer support in low- and middle-income countries during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, commentators warned that some COVID trials were inadequately conceived, designed and reported. Here, we retrospectively assess the prevalence of informative COVID trials launched in the first 6 months of the pandemic. Methods We created a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and prevention efficacy trials that were initiated from 2020-01-01 to 2020-06-30 using ClinicalTrials.gov registration records. We evaluated trials on 3 criteria of informativeness: potential redundancy, design quality and feasibility of patient-participant recruitment. The study protocol was prospectively registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/fp726/). Results We included 500 trials in our cohort, 58% of which were Phase 2 and 84.8% were directed towards the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Close to one third of trials met all three criteria and were deemed informative (29.0% (95% Confidence Interval 23.7-36.9)). The proportion of potentially redundant trials in our cohort was 4.1%. Over half of the trials in our cohort (56.2%) did not meet our criteria for high quality trial design. The proportion of trials with infeasible patient-participant recruitment was 22.6%. Conclusions Less than one third of COVID-19 trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov during the first six months met all three criteria for informativeness.

They are conventionally perceived to lack traditional forms of power such as public influence, formal authority, education, money, and political positions; however, they still possess the resources to impact their situations, their circumstances, and the structures that determine their situations. Business ethics researchers seldom consider marginalized peoples voices and experiences as resources to understand their lives, as demonstrated through a review of 7500 articles published in the Journal of Business Ethics and Business Ethics Quarterly (2000C2019). Only 78 studies included aspects of marginalized groups. 69 of those studies discussed the topic of marginalized groups of people, but without integrating their explicit voices into the text. Only 9 of the 78 articles featured marginalized peoples explicit voices about their marginalization experiences incorporated into the text as a source for exploration. None of the identified studies discussed the potential for theorizing based on such voices. This paper contributes to business ethics theory by developing four theoretical possibilities vis--vis the critical voices of marginalized peoples experiences in business: (a) marginalized theory on critical agency and freedom of speech; (b) the gatekeeping role of academia; (c) primary sources; and (d) a participative perspective.

Drawing on qualitative data from the project COVID-19 Impact Tracing in Ethiopia: Social, Economic, Political, and Security Ramifications, carried out in the Tigray, Amhara and Oromia Regional States (RS) from June to September 2020, we offer new empirical and theoretical perspectives that shed light on the political status of health and health policies in Ethiopia and beyond. In all the three regions, COVID-19 and the governments pandemic response was subject to politicization and securitization. The degree of securitization and politicization differed between the regions and fluctuated over time; in areas with strong opposition to political authorities, the COVID-19 mitigating efforts wereduring the first phase of the pandemicmore politicized and securitized than in areas with less opposition. Yet, as the political opposition and instability increased, threatening national security and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmeds political project, the authorities and the public paid increasingly less attention to the pandemic and the mitigating policies. In our analysis of these dynamics, we draw on a classic distinction that scholars of global public health have borrowed from political science: that of low and high politics. We argue that a contextually situated use of the high/low distinction allows us to recognize the fleeting and context-dependent nature of healths political status, providing valuable insights that help us understand the ways that health emerges and disappears as high politics.

Despite efforts to limit the viral transmission, the vaccine is the only solution to ending the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy could reduce coverage and hinder herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: People's intention to get vaccinated can be shaped by several factors, including risk perception which, in turn, is influenced by affect. The present work aimed at investigating how risk perception and some factors associated with the decision to comply with vaccination modulated vaccine acceptance for COVID-19 as compared to seasonal influenza, and how these have varied during the lockdown phases. METHOD: The study followed the main phases of the emergency in Italy, investigating the intention to get vaccinated against flu and against SARS-CoV-2 (if a vaccine was available) before, during and after the first national lockdown, covering the period from the end of February to the end of June 2020. We investigated the effect of risk perception and other predictors on the decision of getting vaccinated. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-lockdown phase, during the lockdown more people were willing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, regardless of their beliefs about vaccines, and as risk perception increased, so did the intention to accept the vaccine. The acceptance of the flu vaccine increased after the re-opening phase. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and against flu increased if there was previous flu vaccination behavior but decreased with increasing doubts about the vaccines in general.

The Acute Care at Home (ACAH) team aims to improve outcomes in the older population by preventing hospital admission or facilitating early discharge, allowing patients to be treated in their own environment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ACAH team administered oxygen therapy, antibiotics, anticipatory medications and other vital interventions to combat the ill effects of COVID-19. Method: An observational approach has been used in this study. Patients were included if they were admitted to ACAH during March-June 2020 for treatment of COVID-19. Biochemistry, oxygen saturations and co-morbidities are among the studied parameters. Lymphocyte count and serum magnesium were compared with a non-COVID-19 cohort. Trends within parameters and associated mortality were analysed and tabulated. Results: 70% of admissions were lymphopenic, whilst 54% were hypoxic. There was a 28-day mortality rate of 35%, with an 18% increase in mortality rate when comparing residence in long-term care facilities (LTCF) to personal residence. All patients had existing co-morbidities. Conclusion: The data indicates that hypoxaemia, hyperferritinaemia and hypermagnesaemia are associated with early mortality in the older population infected with COVID-19. National Early Warning Score and frailty score are predictive of mortality in this cohort, with higher scores correlating to worse outcomes. Those living in LTCF are at an increased risk of mortality. However, ACAH mortality rates are comparable to those admitted to hospital, validating the concept of ACAH.

METHODS: The symposium was convened as a private event for 46 participants over the course of one and a half days in December 2019. Thematic analyses utilized the OHVBC Readiness Framework (DentaQuest Partnership, 2019) to further codify conversations as part of the gap-analysis process. Poll Everywhere, a text messaging application that allows participants to answer questions in real time, was also employed to solicit responses. RESULTS: Attendees of the symposium felt that OHVBC would have a large portion of market share within the next 10 years. A qualitative assessment of multiple table discussions determined that the participants developed more consensus around themes for the current state and the future-desired state than the action-planning needed to close the gap between the two. This may relate to individual ideology, and the siloed environment is still prevalent in the oral health realm. In a postsymposium survey, respondent attendees did not perceive that COVID-19 would delay or negatively impact the adoption of OHVBC and may result in accelerating its utilization. CONCLUSION: The oral health community is experiencing multiple drivers to adopt more OHVBC within business and care models. However, there is still a lack of uniformity on how to execute this delivery model.","output":"Understanding value in oral health: the oral health value-based care symposium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic mandated rapid, flexible solutions to meet the anticipated surge in both patient acuity and volume This paper describes one institution's emergency department (ED) innovation at the center of the COVID-19 crisis, including the creation of a temporary ED-intensive care unit (ICU) and development of interdisciplinary COVID-19-specific care delivery models to care for critically ill patients Mount Sinai Hospital, an urban quaternary academic medical center, had an existing five-bed resuscitation area insufficiently rescue due to its size and lack of negative pressure rooms Within 1 week, the ED-based observation unit, which has four negative pressure rooms, was quickly converted into a COVID-19-specific unit, split between a 14-bed stepdown unit and a 13-bed ED-ICU unit An increase in staffing for physicians, physician assistants, nurses, respiratory therapists, and medical technicians, as well as training in critical care protocols and procedures, was needed to ensure appropriate patient care The transition of the ED to a COVID-19-specific unit with the inclusion of a temporary expanded ED-ICU at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic was a proactive solution to the growing challenges of surging patients, complexity, and extended boarding of critically ill patients in the ED This pandemic underscores the importance of ED design innovation with flexible spacing, interdisciplinary collaborations on structure and services, and NP ventilation systems which will remain important moving forward","output":"Rapid deployment of an emergency department-intensive care unit for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the relationship between weekly and monthly observations of CDS, interest, and exchange rates (USDTRY) during 2005-2020 in Turkey.

Radiation doses for each technique were calculated using computational Monte Carlo modelling of a standard Cristy phantom rather than the application of previously published conversion factors. While these have frequently been used in other studies, they are based on out-dated ICRP tissue weightings (ICRP 60) and are for the whole chest rather than for structures irradiated in cardiac imaging. In order to allow a comparison, doses were calculated and expressed in terms of effective dose in millisieverts (mSv). RESULTS From a population presenting for angiography within a clinical service, the median radiation dose from cardiac CT with standard filtered back-projection (84 patients, 5.4 mSv) was comparable with the dose from invasive diagnostic coronary angiography (94 patients, 6.3 mSv). The dose for cardiac CT using iterative reconstruction was significantly lower (39 patients, 2.5 mSv). CONCLUSION The median effective dose from cardiac CT with standard filtered back-projection was comparable with the effective dose from invasive coronary angiography, even with application of the most contemporary ICRP tissue weightings and use of cardiac specific volumes.

This study aimed to evaluate if potential steroid benefits could be predicted by the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2) in mmHg) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) (P/F) in COVID-19 patients at admission. Materials and Methods: Medical records were retrospectively collected from all adult patients admitted because of COVID-19 from 29 January to 31 July 2020. The association of steroid therapy with 28-day all-cause mortality outcome was analysed in a multivariable logistic regression model adjusted for confounding factors. Results: Overall, 511 patients were analysed, of which 39.1% underwent steroid therapy. Steroid treated patients were mostly male, older, and more frequently treated with antiviral drugs and aminoquinolines; the most common comorbidities were hypertension, followed by cardiovascular disease. Overall, 51 patients died within 28-days, and overall 28-days mortality was 19.5% in the cohort of patients exposed to steroids versus 3.9% mortality in unexposed patients (p < 0.001). Steroid therapy on patients with P/F ratio of 235 mmHg or higher at admission can be considered as detrimental, with an 8% increased probability of death.

DESIGN: A nationwide, questionnaire-based survey. SETTING: Participating hospitals (n=416) were accredited by the Japanese Medical Specialty Board to offer medical residency programmes in 19 core specialties. Surveys were conducted in October 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Valid responses were obtained from 4306 physicians (response rate: 49%). OUTCOME MEASURES: Items pertaining to the Japanese Burnout Scale, depressive tendencies and suicidal ideation were included in questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses were performed: suicidal ideation was the response variable; sex, age, core specialty, marital status, income, weekly working hours and workplace (ownership, number of beds, number of full-time physicians and regional classification) were explanatory variables. RESULTS: Regarding the Japanese Burnout Scale, the highest score was recorded for sense of personal accomplishment, followed by emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalisation were associated with longer working hours, but there was no such trend for sense of personal accomplishment. Depressive tendencies and suicidal ideation were noted in 24.1% and 5.6% of respondents, respectively. These percentages tended to increase when respondents worked longer hours. Several factors were significantly associated with suicidal ideation: female sex (reference: male, OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.56 to 2.77), 12 million yen income (reference: <2 million yen, OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.79), 100 working hours/week (reference:<40 hours/week, OR: 3.64, 95% CI: 1.88 to 7.04) and 600C799 hospital beds (reference: <200 beds, OR: 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.82).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 10 renal transplant recipients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in this retrospective study. In addition, 10 of their family members diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the control group. INTERVENTION: Immunosuppressant reduction and low-dose methylprednisolone therapy. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The clinical outcomes (the severity of pneumonia, recovery rate, time of virus shedding, and length of illness) were compared with the control group by statistical analysis. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The clinical symptomatic, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 pneumonia in the renal transplant recipients were similar to those of severe COVID-19 pneumonia in the general population. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was greater in the transplant recipients than in the control group (five severe/three critical cases vs one severe case). Five patients developed transient renal allograft damage. After a longer time of virus shedding (28.4  9.3 vs 12.2  4.6 d in the control group) and a longer course of illness (35.3  8.3 vs 18.8  10.5 d in the control group), nine of the 10 transplant patients recovered successfully after treatment. One patient developed acute renal graft failure and died of progressive respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients had more severe COVID-19 pneumonia than the general population, but most of them recovered after a prolonged clinical course and virus shedding.

This study aims to report a case series of consecutive GBS patients after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination during the massive campaign in Mexico in 2021. Methods A single-center, observational study of consecutive GBS subjects diagnosed by Asbury criteria from January 1 to August 31, 2021. Including GBS-related symptoms on or after six weeks of vaccination record, both first and second doses. Results From a total of 53 GBS patients, eight had a history of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, 87.5% male, the median vaccination-symptom onset and symptom-to-admission time were 15 (IQR 12.75-23.25), and 3.5 (IQR 1.5-8.25), all of them had GBS Disability Scale 3 at admission.

Incident reporting (IR) is an important safety tool to identify system failures. This study evaluates the impact of SARS-COV-2 pandemic on IR trend in the COVID-19 wards of an Italian Academic Hospital (AH) in Italy. METHODS: The study analyzed the IR submitted by the wards of Infectious Diseases (ID), Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Pneumology (P) and Emergency Room (ER) of the AH of Udine from 2016 to 2020. For each ward, IR of 2020 were compared to IR of 2016-2019 period, expressed as the mean value. The IR's topics of ER unit, classified according to the International Standards of Patient Safety, were compared between 2019 and 2020. Variation in reporting was assessed using Chi-square tests. RESULTS: During 2020, 180 incidents were reported, 81.7% of which submitted by ER unit. Three wards showed a decrease in reporting compared to 2016-2019 period: -18% (7vs8,5) for ID unit, -26% (16v21,7) for ICU and -44% (10vs18) for P unit. ER unit, instead, showed a great IR increase (147vs49; +200%). Considering the reporting from 2016 to 2019, 196 out of 389 (50.4%) of IR came from ER unit. Analyzing the difference in reporting in ER unit between 2019 and 2020, the IR topics regarding Delay in execution and reporting exams increase from 2 to 21 (p < 0,05), Lack of human and/or instrumental resources from 4 to 29 (p < 0,05) and Prevention and Control of Hospital Infectious from 0 to 13 (p < 0,05). CONCLUSIONS: ER unit showed a higher attitude in reporting than the other considered wards, especially during the COVID-19 period, recognizing IR as an important tool to highlight critical issues. This aspect may reflect the stronger safety culture already present in this unit. SARS-COV-2 pandemic stressed in ER needs of human resources to cope with reorganization determined by COVID-19, rapid covid-test results for the patient's care path definition, implementation of infection control procedures.

An accurate prediction of the most likely individual disease progression can improve the planning of limited resources and finding the optimal treatment for patients. However, when dealing with a newly emerging disease such as COVID-19, the impact of patient- and disease-specific factors (e.g. body weight or known co-morbidities) on the immediate course of disease is by and large unknown. In the case of COVID-19, the need for intensive care unit (ICU) admission of pneumonia patients is often determined only by acute indicators such as vital signs (e.g. breathing rate, blood oxygen levels), whereas statistical analysis and decision support systems that integrate all of the available data could enable an earlier prognosis. To this end, we propose a holistic graph-based approach combining both imaging and non-imaging information. Specifically, we introduce a multimodal similarity metric to build a population graph for clustering patients and an image-based end-to-end Graph Attention Network to process this graph and predict the COVID-19 patient outcomes: admission to ICU, need for ventilation and mortality.

The main outcome variable was residents willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of vaccination willingness. RESULTS: Of the 7264 eligible participants, 14.5% of Beijing residents reported that they had not heard of H7N9. Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, and approximately half of them reported I am afraid of being infected by H7N9 and H7N9 vaccine can prevent infections, and 28.1% reported my daily life is affected by H7N9.

A qualitative content analysis was employed to analyze the transcribed data. Interviewees included media reporters, media supervisors, health and medical institution executives or spokespersons, and social observers. RESULTS: Altogether, 35 interviewees were recruited for in-depth interviews, and the duration of the interview ranged from 1 hour to 2 hours. Results revealed that the most important characteristics of health/medical institutions spokespersons are professional competence and good interaction with the media. In contrast, the most important behaviors they should avoid are concealing the truth and misreporting the truth. Three major flaws of spokespersons' performance were identified: they included poor understanding of media needs and landscape; blaming the media to cover up a mistake they made in an announcement; and lack of sufficient participation in decision-making or of authorization from the head of organization.

If airlines are to resume flying at commercially sustainable levels, they must work to restore passengers confidence and sense of security. This study examined commercial airline passengers health concerns and attitudes towards infection prevention and control measures for travel health and safety in the current COVID-19 global pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted inviting adult members of 39 frequent flyer groups across three social media platforms to participate in an online survey. RESULTS: A total of 205 respondents completed the survey. The majority (75.6%) reported feeling somewhat to extremely concerned about contracting an infectious disease while flying, particularly respiratory-related. Few (9.8%) reported perceiving their health as an essential priority for their preferred airline. Most respondents agreed airlines should provide complimentary hand sanitisers (86.8%), sanitary wipes (82.9%) and masks (64.4%) for passengers to use while flying as well as more information about preventing the spread of infections (90.7%), which would make the majority feel safer to fly. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has extensively challenged the air travel industry. Passengers have signalled that they expect more from airlines, and that they would actively engage in additional infection prevention and disease control measures while flying.

To define the genetic and structural basis for SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we determined the structures of two human monoclonal antibodies COV2-2196 and COV2-21301, which form the basis of the investigational antibody cocktail AZD7442, in complex with the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. COV2-2196 forms an aromatic cage at the heavy/light chain interface using germline-encoded residues in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) 2 and 3 of the heavy chain and CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain. These structural features explain why highly similar antibodies (public clonotypes) have been isolated from multiple individuals1C4. The structure of COV2-2130 reveals that an unusually long LCDR1 and HCDR3 make interactions with the opposite face of the RBD from that of COV2-2196. Using deep mutational scanning and neutralization escape selection experiments, we comprehensively mapped the critical residues of both antibodies and identified positions of concern for possible viral escape. Nonetheless, both COV2-2196 and COV2130 showed strong neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 strain with recent variations of concern including E484K, N501Y, and D614G substitutions.

The three primary outcomes were incidence rates of any SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic infection, and asymptomatic infection, during pregnancy during periods of SARS-CoV-2 circulation. Participants self-collected weekly mid-turbinate nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing, completed weekly illness symptom questionnaires, and submitted additional swabs with COVID-19Clike symptoms. An overall SARS-CoV-2 infection incidence rate weighted by population counts of women of reproductive age in each state was calculated. RESULTS: Among 1098 pregnant individuals followed for a mean of 10 weeks, nine percent (99/1098) had SARS-CoV-2 infections during the study. Population weighted incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection were 10.0 per 1,000 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.7C14.3) person-weeks for any infection, 5.7 per 1,000 (95% CI 1.7-9.7) for symptomatic infections, and 3.5 per 1,000 (95% CI 0-7.1) for asymptomatic infections.

METHODS Data were pooled from seven randomized, double-blind VERTIS phase 3 trials that evaluated ertugliflozin (5 mg and 15 mg) versus non-ertugliflozin (placebo, glimepiride, or sitagliptin) treatment in patients with T2DM. Change from baseline at week 52 of treatment in alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST, respectively) serum levels (overall and categorized into tertiles by baseline ALT and AST), Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and body weight were evaluated, along with the association between changes in ALT and AST and changes in HbA1c and body weight by treatment. RESULTS Baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups (ertugliflozin 5 mg, n = 1716; ertugliflozin 15 mg, n = 1693; non-ertugliflozin, n = 1450). At week 52 of treatment, serum levels of ALT and AST were reduced in patients in the ertugliflozin treatment groups (5 and 15 mg, respectively) compared with those in the non-ertugliflozin group. The comparator-adjusted mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) difference in change from baseline at week 52 for ALT was - 3.35 (- 4.40, - 2.31) IU/L for ertugliflozin 5 mg and - 4.08 (- 5.13, - 3.03) IU/L for ertugliflozin 15 mg; for AST, the respective values were - 1.81 (- 2.50, - 1.11) IU/L and - 2.12 (- 2.82, - 1.42) IU/L. The effects of ertugliflozin were detected across all baseline ALT and AST tertiles, with the highest tertile showing the greatest treatment differences. No meaningful differences were observed between treatment groups for FIB-4. Changes in ALT and AST showed a weak but statistically significant association with changes in HbA1c and body weight in all treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with ertugliflozin resulted in a reduction in the levels of hepatic transaminases compared with the non-ertugliflozin group after 52 weeks of treatment.

So far, analysis of new SARS-CoV-2 variants focused primarily on nucleotide substitutions and short deletions that are readily identifiable by comparison to consensus genome sequences. In contrast, insertions have largely escaped the attention of researchers although the furin site insert in the Spike (S) protein is thought to be a determinant of SARS-CoV-2 virulence. Here, we identify 346 unique inserts of different lengths in SARS-CoV-2 genomes and present evidence that these inserts reflect actual virus variance rather than sequencing artifacts. Two principal mechanisms appear to account for the inserts in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes, polymerase slippage and template switch that might be associated with the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs. At least three inserts in the N-terminal domain of the S protein are predicted to lead to escape from neutralizing antibodies, whereas other inserts might result in escape from T-cell immunity.

METHODS: In a multinational retrospective study, we collected all cases of CVST in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients admitted to nine tertiary stroke centers from the beginning of the pandemic to June 30th, 2020. We compared the demographics, clinical and radiological characteristics, risk factors, and outcome of these patients with a control group of non-SARS-CoV-2 infected CVST patients in the same seasonal period of the years 2012-2016 from the country where the majority of cases were recruited. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria (62% women, mean age 50.9  11.2 years). Six patients were discharged with good outcomes (mRS &#8804; 2) and three patients died in hospital. Compared to the control group, the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were significantly older (50.9 versus 36.7 years, p < 0.001), had a lower rate of identified CVST risk factors (23.1% versus 84.2%, p < 0.001), had more frequent cortical vein involvement (38.5% versus 10.5%, p: 0.025), and a non-significant higher rate of in-hospital mortality (23.1% versus 5.3%, p: 0.073). CONCLUSION: CVST should be considered as potential comorbidity in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients presenting with neurological symptoms. Our data suggest that compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, CVST occurs in older patients, with lower rates of known CVST risk factors and might lead to a poorer outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 infected group.","output":"Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with SARS-CoV-2; a multinational case series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Should the freedom of churches and other religious institutions come down to little more than a grudging recognition that what happens in the church, stays in the church?

IBV evolution has often been explained as variation in gene frequencies as if evolution were driven by genetic drift alone. However, the mechanisms regulating the evolution of IBV include both the generation of genetic diversity and the selection process. IBV's generation of genetic diversity has been extensively investigated and ultimately involves mutations and recombination events occurring during viral replication. The relevance of the selection process has been further understood more recently by identifying genetic and phenotypic differences between IBV populations prior to, and during, replication in the natural host. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple environmental forces within the host, including immune responses (or lack thereof) and affinity for cell receptors, as well as physical and biochemical conditions, are responsible for the selection process. Some scientists have used or adopted the related quasispecies frame to explain IBV evolution. The quasispecies frame, while providing a distinct explanation of the dynamics of populations in which mutation is a frequent event, exhibits relevant limitations which are discussed herein. Instead, it seems that IBV populations evolving by the generation of genetic variability and selection on replicons follow the evolutionary mechanisms originally proposed by Darwin.

We analyze 418 major state-government-enacted bills and 450 failed bills from 2015 to 2020, as well as the political contexts in which they were passed or defeated. We use bivariate analyses and regressions to explore correlations and partial correlations between the policy characteristics and political contexts of bills, and their passage or failure, their bipartisanship, and vote shares they received. Key results include (i) nearly one-third of these state-level decarbonization bills were passed by Republican-controlled governments. (ii) Bipartisan or Republican co-sponsors disproportionately passed financial incentives for renewable energy, and legislation that expands consumer or business choices in context of decarbonization goals; Democrat-only co-sponsors disproportionately passed bills that restricted consumer and business choice, such as mandatory Renewable Energy and Efficiency Portfolio Standards (REEPS) and emissions standards.

In the COVID 19 pandemic episode the use of these devices has become widespread, but, due to the shortage of conventional CPAP devices, alternative devices have been manufactured. The objective of this study is to describe the use of these devices, as well as their efficacy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data are collected from patients admitted for Pneumonia due to COVID 19 at the IFEMA Field Hospital. Data are collected from 23 patients with respiratory failure and need for ventilatory support. RESULTS: Study carried out on a total of 23 patients, dated admission to IFEMA. Alternative CPAP was used in five patients (21.7%), while ventilatory support with a reservoir mask or Ventimask Venturi effect was used in the remaining 18 patients (78.3%). A progressive increase in saturation is observed in those patients in whom alternative CPAP was used (from 94% on average to 98% and 99% on average after 30 and 60 min with the mask, respectively), although this change was not significant (p = 0.058 and p = 0.122 respectively). No significant change in RF was observed at the beginning and end of the measurement in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.423), but among those who did not use alternative CPAP (p = 0.001). A statistically significant improvement in the variable oxygen saturation / fraction inspired by oxygen is observed in patients who used alternative CPAP (p = 0.040) CONCLUSION: The use of these devices has helped the ventilatory work of several patients by improving their oxygenation parameters. To better observe the evolution of patients undergoing this therapy and compare them with patients with other types of ventilatory support, further studies are necessary.","output":"Alternative CPAP methods for the treatment of secondary serious respiratory failure due to pneumonia by COVID-19()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: : The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on the delivery of vascular surgery to patients around the world.

Diagnosis is made clinically using diagnostic guidelines; no specific test is available. \\"Incomplete\\" KD is a more recent concept, which refers to patients with fever lasting > or =5 days and 2 or 3 clinical criteria (rash, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, changes of extremities, adenopathy), without reasonable explanation for the illness. To describe the clinical and laboratory features of classical (or \\"complete\\") KD, and incomplete KD in adults, we report 10 cases of adult KD, including 6 patients who fulfilled the criteria for incomplete KD, diagnosed either at presentation (n = 4) or retrospectively (n = 2). At the time of clinical presentation, complete KD was diagnosed in 4 patients, while 4 patients fulfilled the criteria for incomplete KD. For 3 of the 4 patients with incomplete KD, presence of severe inflammation, laboratory findings (hypoalbuminemia, anemia, elevation of alanine aminotransferase, thrombocytosis after 7 days, white blood cell count > or =15,000/mm, and urine > or =10 white blood cell/high power field), or echocardiogram findings were consistent with the diagnosis. In 2 patients, the diagnosis of KD was made retrospectively in the presence of myocardial infarction due to coronary aneurysms, after an undiagnosed medical history evocative of incomplete KD. Seven patients received intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), after a mean delay of 12.5 days, which appeared to shorten the course of the disease. This relatively large series of adult KD highlights the existence of incomplete KD in adults and suggests that the algorithm proposed by a multidisciplinary committee of experts to diagnose incomplete KD in children could be useful in adults.

This scar tissue formation is dependent on immune system activation. Tacrolimus has unique properties that may contribute to the prevention of overactive scarring by inhibition of inflammatory cytokines. Methods Herein, we present a case using systemic immunosuppression to prevent recurrent adhesion accumulation in a patient with a prior spaghetti wrist injury. Tacrolimus began 1 week before repeat-secondary tenolysis surgery, and it continued for 3 months postoperative. Dosing was tapered to a serum level between 5 and 8 g/L. Results The 27-year-old male patient suffered a volar wrist laceration transecting all flexor tendons and volar wrist nerves. He underwent immediate repair but had a poor outcome despite early range of motion therapy. A primary tenolysis only improved his average arc of finger motion from 72 to 95 degrees. Secondary tenolysis augmented with systemic tacrolimus improved his arc of finger motion from 95 to 202 degrees. Mechanistically, tacrolimus prevents proper function of activated T and B cells. This results in decreased proliferation, angiogenesis, and cytoskeletal organization of fibroblasts on inflammation and integrin adhesions, and it potentially explains the reduced tendon molecule adhesions seen in this patient. Conclusions Tacrolimus may be effective in reducing motion, limiting tendon adhesions. The novel use of this medication resulted in the return of near-normal hand function in a patient placed on low-dose tacrolimus after primary tenolysis had failed.","output":"Systemic Immunosuppression for Prevention of Recurrent Tendon Adhesions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the avoidance of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) is paramount to reduce the risk of viral transmission to staff and other patients. Perioperative management of a new tracheostomy is challenging as routine care, such as suctioning, frequently involves AGPs. We developed and implemented an apparatus called the heat and moisture exchanger (HME) filter-protected open circuit. This enabled closed suctioning to be performed and allowed spontaneously breathing patients to be managed with an open circuit in a shared environment while reducing the risk of viral aerosolisation. We performed a prospective observational study of 20 cases, recording the incidence of desaturation (<90%), apparatus disconnection, apparatus dislodgement and apparatus replacement. The ease of use of the apparatus for recovery nursing staff and patient comfort were measured on a Likert scale. There were no incidents of desaturation. There were two circuit disconnections. Apparatus replacement with an alternate circuit was not required for any patient. Most recovery nursing staff agreed or strongly agreed that the apparatus was easy to use and that the apparatus bulk or weight did not interfere with patient care activities. Ninety-five per cent of patients reported that their breathing was comfortable prior to discharge from the Post Anaesthesia Care Unit. In conclusion, the HME filter-protected open circuit is a relatively safe, acceptable and practical device to use for spontaneously breathing patients with newly created tracheostomies in the perioperative environment.","output":"Post-operative use of HME filter?protected open tracheostomy circuit during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a novel tick-borne bunyavirus that recently emerged in East Asian countries.

Effective utilization of screening tools requires an understanding of health care worker perception and willingness to use the tools. We determined health workers' perspectives on screening tools to enhance their effective and consistent utilisation. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study among healthcare workers at 8 selected primary healthcare facilities in Zimbabwe. Interviewer guided, in-depth interviews were conducted with healthcare workers and their immediate supervisors. Inductive and deductive coding (hybrid) was applied to develop and analyze themes following a framework built around the grounded theory model to describe perspectives that influence the effective and consistent utilization of HIV screening tools and suggestions for improved eligibility screening. Results: Behavioural factors facilitating the utilisation of the screening tool included motivation to adhere to standard practice, awareness of screening role in targeting testing, and its ability to manage workload through screening out ineligible clients. This was evident across service delivery levels. Barriers included limited healthcare capacity, confidentiality space, multiple screening tools and opaque screening in/out criteria and the potential of clients not responding to screening questions truthfully. Conclusions: Across geographical and service delivery levels, correct placing of the screening tool at HIV testing entry point, healthcare worker knowledge on screening in/out criteria emerged as enablers for correct and consistent use of the screening tools.

One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies, whereas another has predicted lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasiexperiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people's movements.

Hence, we aimed to compute basic (R(0)) and real-time (Rt) reproduction number and predict the trend and the size of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the center of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the 887 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from February 20, 2020, to April 17, 2020 in the center of Iran. We considered three scenarios for serial intervals (SIs) with gamma distribution. R(t) was calculated by the sequential Bayesian and time-dependent methods. Based on a branching process using the Poisson distributed number of new cases per day, the daily incidence and cumulative incidence for the next 30 days were predicted. The analysis was applied in R packages 3.6.3 and STATA 12.0. RESULTS: The model shows that the R(t) of COVID-19 has been decreasing since the onset of the epidemic. According to three scenarios based on different distributions of SIs in the past 58 days from the epidemic, R(t) has been 1.03 (0.94, 1.14), 1.05 (0.96, 1.15), and 1.08 (0.98, 1.18) and the cumulative incidence cases will be 360 (180, 603), 388 (238, 573), and 444 (249, 707) for the next 30 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: Based on the real-time data extracted from the center of Iran, R(t) has been decreasing substantially since the beginning of the epidemic, and it is expected to remain almost constant or continue to decline slightly in the next 30 days, which is consequence of the schools and universities shutting down, reduction of working hours, mass screening, and social distancing.","output":"The real-time reproduction number, impact of interventions and prediction of the epidemic size of COVID-19 in the center of Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 rapid antigen detection (RAD) test kits are widely used as primary screening test in Japan because rapid diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for infection control.

Reliable forecast of the number of cases is of great significance to the planning of health resources and the investigation and evaluation of the epidemic situation. The data-driven machine learning models can adapt to complex changes in the epidemic situation without relying on correct physical dynamics modeling, which are sensitive and accurate in predicting the development of the epidemic. In this paper, an ensemble hybrid model based on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Deep Belief Networks (DBN), Q-learning, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models, namely TCN-GRU-DBN-Q-SVM model, is proposed to achieve the forecasting of COVID-19 infections. Three widely-used predictors, TCN, GRU, and DBN are used as elements of the hybrid model ensembled by the weights provided by reinforcement learning method. Furthermore, an error predictor built by SVM, is trained with validation set, and the final prediction result could be obtained by combining the TCN-GRU-DBN-Q model with the SVM error predictor. In order to investigate the forecasting performance of the proposed hybrid model, several comparison models (TCN-GRU-DBN-Q, LSTM, N-BEATS, ANFIS, VMD-BP, WT-RVFL, and ARIMA models) are selected. The experimental results show that: (1) the prediction effect of the TCN-GRU-DBN-Q-SVM model on COVID-19 infection is satisfactory, which has been verified in three national infection data from the UK, India, and the US, and the proposed model has good generalization ability; (2) in the proposed hybrid model, SVM can efficiently predict the possible error of the predicted series given by TCN-GRU-DBN-Q components; (3) the integrated weights based on Q-learning can be adaptively adjusted according to the characteristics of the data in the forecasting tasks in different countries and multiple situations, which ensures the accuracy, robustness and generalization of the proposed model.","output":"A data-driven hybrid ensemble AI model for COVID-19 infection forecast using multiple neural networks and reinforced learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout history, pandemics have had a major impact on humanity.

These include the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that, among other functions, downregulate cell-surface proteins involved in adaptive immunity. The RING-CH domain of MARCH proteins is thought to function by catalyzing the ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tails (CTs) of target proteins, leading to their degradation. MARCH proteins have recently been reported to target retroviral envelope glycoproteins (Env) and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein (VSV-G). However, the mechanism of antiviral activity remains poorly defined. Here we show that MARCH8 antagonizes the full-length forms of HIV-1 Env, VSV-G, Ebola virus glycoprotein (EboV-GP), and the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) thereby impairing the infectivity of virions pseudotyped with these viral glycoproteins. This MARCH8-mediated targeting of viral glycoproteins requires the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the RING-CH domain. We observe that MARCH8 protein antagonism of VSV-G is CT dependent. In contrast, MARCH8-mediated targeting of HIV-1 Env, EboV-GP and SARS-CoV-2 S protein by MARCH8 does not require the CT, suggesting a novel mechanism of MARCH-mediated antagonism of these viral glycoproteins. Confocal microscopy data demonstrate that MARCH8 traps the viral glycoproteins in an intracellular compartment. We observe that the endogenous expression of MARCH8 in several relevant human cell types is rapidly inducible by type I interferon. These results help to inform the mechanism by which MARCH proteins exert their antiviral activity and provide insights into the role of cellular inhibitory factors in antagonizing the biogenesis, trafficking, and virion incorporation of viral glycoproteins.","output":"Mechanism of Viral Glycoprotein Targeting by Membrane-associated-RING-CH Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior during a severe seasonal influenza epidemic or a novel respiratory pandemic. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.","output":"Accurate influenza forecasts using type-specific incidence data for small geographic units"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the effects of the historical prevalence of infectious diseases on contemporary entrepreneurship. Previous studies reveal the persistence of the effects of historical diseases on innovation, through the channel of culture. Drawing on the epidemiological origin of institutions, we propose a framework which argues that the impact of infectious disease prevalence on contemporary entrepreneurship is mediated by property rights. The central hypothesis posits that a guarantee of property rights reduces the effect of past diseases on entrepreneurship. Using data from 125 countries, we find strong and robust evidence on the proposed hypothesis and other results. Property rights are higher in countries where the prevalence of diseases was low, which leads to good entrepreneurship scores. In contrast, countries with high disease prevalence did not have time to develop strong institutions to secure property rights. This explains their low level of entrepreneurship today. These results are robust to alternative methods and measures of property rights. Furthermore, our results also confirm the level of development, culture and the digitalization of economies as transmission channels between past diseases and the current level of entrepreneurship.","output":"Historical Prevalence of Infectious Diseases and Entrepreneurship: The Role of Institutions in 125 Countries (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite broad agreement in policy circles on the need to reduce food loss and waste (FLW), considerable gaps in information still exist.

The term 'thyrotoxicosis' refers to a clinical state resulting from inappropriate high thyroid hormone action in tissues, generally due to inappropriate high tissue thyroid hormone levels. Thyrotoxicosis is a condition with multiple aetiologies, manifestations, and potential modes of therapy. By definition, the extrathyroidal sources of excessive amounts of thyroid hormones, such as iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, factitious ingestion of thyroid hormone, or struma ovarii, do not include hyperthyroidism. The aetiology of hyperthyroidism/and thyrotoxicosis should be determined. Although the diagnosis is apparent based on the clinical presentation and initial biochemical evaluation, additional diagnostic testing is indicated. This testing should include: (1) measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antibodies (TRAb); (2) analysis of thyroidal echogenicity and blood flow on ultrasonography; or (3) determination of radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU). A 123I or 99mTc pertechnetate scan is recommended when the clinical presentation suggests toxic nodular goitre.

The in vivo pathogenicity, transmissibility, and fitness of this new Variant of Concerns are unknown. We investigated these virological attributes of the Omicron variant in comparison with those of the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant in the golden Syrian hamster COVID-19 model. Omicron-infected hamsters developed significantly less body weight losses, clinical scores, respiratory tract viral burdens, cytokine/chemokine dysregulation, and tissue damages than Delta-infected hamsters. The Omicron and Delta variant were both highly transmissible (100% vs 100%) via contact transmission. Importantly, the Omicron variant consistently demonstrated about 10-20% higher transmissibility than the already-highly transmissible Delta variant in repeated non-contact transmission studies (overall: 30/36 vs 24/36, 83.3% vs 66.7%). The Delta variant displayed higher fitness advantage than the Omicron variant without selection pressure in both in vitro and in vivo competition models. However, this scenario drastically changed once immune selection pressure with neutralizing antibodies active against the Delta variant but poorly active against the Omicron variant were introduced, with the Omicron variant significantly outcompeting the Delta variant.

We sought to describe the site, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of VTE after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In a prospective study using the Registro Informatizado de Enfermedad TromboEmblica (RIETE) platform, patients with VTE 4C30 days after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 (1 February 2021 through 30 April 2021) were included. VTE patients recruited from the same centers into RIETE in the same months in 2018C2019 were selected as the reference group. All-cause mortality and major bleeding were the main study outcomes. Results: As of 30 April 2020, 102 patients with post-vaccination VTEs had been identified (28 after adenovirus-based vaccination [ChAdOx1 nCov-19; AstraZeneca] and 74 after mRNA-based vaccination [mRNA-1273; Moderna, and BNT162b2; Pfizer]). Compared with 911 historical controls, patients with VTE after adenovirus-based vaccination more frequently had CVST (10.7% vs. 0.4%, p < 0.001) or thrombosis at multiple sites (17.9% vs. 1.3%, p < 0.001), more frequently had thrombocytopenia (40.7% vs. 14.7%, p < 0.001), and had higher 14-day mortality (14.3% vs. 0.7%; odds ratio [OR]: 25.1; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7C94.9) and major bleeding rates (10.3% vs. 1.0%, OR: 12.03, 95% CI: 3.07C47.13).

However, the results of most impact studies could be confused by a dynamic and complex space-time process. Therefore, there is a need to analyse the impact of RV vaccination on RV and AGE hospitalisations in a space-time framework to detect geographical-time patterns while avoiding the potential confusion caused by population inequalities in the impact estimations. METHODS A retrospective population-based study using real-world data from the Valencia Region was performed among children aged less than 3 years old in the period 2005-2016. A Bayesian spatio-temporal model was constructed to analyse RV and AGE hospitalisations and to estimate the vaccination impact measured in averted hospitalisations. RESULTS We found important spatio-temporal patterns in RV and AGE hospitalisations, RV vaccination coverage and in their associated adverted hospitalisations. Overall, ~ 1866 hospital admissions for RV were averted by RV vaccination during 2007-2016. Despite the low-medium vaccine coverage (~ 50%) in 2015-2016, relevant 36 and 20% reductions were estimated in RV and AGE hospitalisations respectively. CONCLUSIONS The introduction of the RV vaccines has substantially reduced the number of RV hospitalisations, averting ~ 1866 admissions during 2007-2016 which were space and time dependent.

The olfactory epithelium (OE) in the nasal fossa is the peripheral organ for olfaction, and is subject to acquired damage, suggesting a likely site of pathology in aging. OE basal stem cells reconstitute the neuroepithelium in response to cell loss under normal conditions. In aged OE, patches of respiratory-like metaplasia have been observed histologically, consistent with a failure in normal neuroepithelial homeostasis or repair. Accordingly, we have focused on identifying cellular and molecular changes in presbyosmic OE. Combining psychophysical testing with olfactory mucosa biopsy analysis, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), and human olfactory culture studies, we identified evidence for inflammation-associated changes in the OE stem cells of presbyosmic patients. The presbyosmic basal stem cells exhibited increased expression of genes involved in response to cytokines or stress, or the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. To facilitate further study of human OE stem cells, we developed an adult human basal cell culture model. Characterization of cultures using scRNA-seq confirmed maintenance of a reserve stem cell-like phenotype, and brief cytokine exposure in basal cell cultures resulted in increased expression of TP63, a transcription factor acting to prevent OE stem cell differentiation. Our data are consistent with a process by which aging-related inflammatory changes in OE stem cells may contribute to presbyosmia, via the disruption of normal epithelial homeostasis, suggesting that OE stem cells may represent a rational therapeutic target for restoration of olfaction.

Economic developments in the region have progressively been influenced by the global spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic. Although it has reached Latin America with some delay compared to Europe and the United States, it shows a similar pattern of dissemination. Moreover, the region faces this pandemic in an economic situation which had already beforehand shown signs of weakness owing to various idiosyncratic reasons, related in part to the bouts of social tension in the final stretch of last year. Some factors, such as high labour market informality and the improvable quality of some institutions, may act as amplifiers of the impact of the health crisis. From the economic standpoint, the pandemic is affecting the region through various key channels, namely the trade, commodities, tourism, financial and domestic demand channels. The national containment measures, the impact of the pandemic on the population, the global nature of the shock and the differential effects on the region are seeing analysts revise their GDP forecasts for 2020 notably downwards, with a balance of risks tilted to the downside. The monetary and fiscal authorities have responded, swiftly adopting measures. Although the region has in recent years consolidated progressively more robust monetary and fiscal policy arrangements, it has less monetary and fiscal space than at the start of the 2008-2009 crisis. Moreover, the Latin American economies, with the exception of Peru, have notably increased their external debt since 2008, though they have more international reserves than in the previous global crisis. Against this background, the resolute response by national policies should ideally be supported by a coordinated global response, led by the main multilateral agencies and geared to minimising the possible long-term adverse effects on the regions economies.Three boxes accompany this report.

PARTICIPANTS: All 1162 subjects testing positive to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Reggio Emilia province with at least 30 days of follow-up by 22 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Median times from diagnosis and from symptom onset to viral clearance with IQR assessed using the KaplanCMeier estimator, stratified by included characteristics. The probability of viral clearance confirmation, stratified by time from diagnosis and putative determinants assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Viral clearance was achieved by 60.6% (704/1162) of patients, with a median time of 30 days from diagnosis (IQR 23C40) and 36 days from symptom onset (IQR 28C45).

Although often asymptomatic, a relevant percentage of affected people can develop severe pneumonia. Initial evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune response could contribute to the pathogenesis, as previously demonstrated for SARS-CoV. The presence of genome composition features involved in delaying viral recognition is herein investigated for human coronaviruses (HCoVs), with a special emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. A broad collection of HCoVs polyprotein, envelope, matrix, nucleocapsid and spike coding sequences was downloaded and several statistics representative of genome composition and codon bias were investigated. A model able to evaluate and test the presence of a significant under- or over-representation of dinucleotide pairs while accounting for the underlying codon bias and protein sequence was also implemented. The study revealed the significant under-representation of CpG dinucleotide pair in all HcoV, but especially in SARS-CoV and even more in SARS-CoV-2. The presence of forces acting to minimize CpG content was confirmed by relative synonymous codon usage pattern. Codons containing the CpG pair were severely under-represented, primarily in the polyprotein and spike coding sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, a significant under-representation of the TpA pair was observed in the N and S region of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Increasing experimental evidence has proven that CpG and TpA are targeted by innate antiviral host defences, contributing both to RNA degradation and RIG-1 mediated interferon production. The low content of these dinucleotides could contribute to a delayed interferon production, dysregulated immune response, higher viral replication and poor outcome. Significantly, the RIG-1 signalling pathway was proven to be defective in elderlies, suggesting a likely interaction between limited viral recognition and lower responsiveness in interferon production that could justify the higher disease severity and mortality in older patients.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronavirus show genome patterns previously associated to reduced viral recognition and altered immune response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the advent of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) in the late 2019, the resulting severe and pernicious syndrome (COVID-19) immediately was deployed all around the world.

Since T lymphocytes display a very low expression level of hACE2, a novel receptor might be involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into T cells. The transmembrane glycoprotein CD147 is highly expressed by activated T lymphocytes, and was recently proposed as a probable route for SARS-CoV-2 invasion.

RESULTS: We included 105 patients, of whom 51.5% had ARD and 68.57% reported at least one persistent symptom. The most frequent symptoms were dyspnoea, fatigue and chest pain. Sequelae were recorded in 31 patients. These included lung damage in 10.4% of patients, lymphopenia in 10%, a central retinal vein occlusion and an optic neuritis. Two patients died. Eleven patients required re-admission owing to COVID-19 problems (16.7% ARD vs 3.9% NARD; P = 0.053). No statistically significant differences were found between RMD groups in the final models. CONCLUSION: Many RMD patients have persistent symptoms, as in other populations. Lung damage is the most frequent sequela. Compared with NARD, ARD does not seem to differ in terms of persistent symptoms or consequences, although ARD might have more re-admissions owing to COVID-19.","output":"Persistent post-discharge symptoms after COVID-19 in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the live SARS-CoV-2 was detected and isolated from the excrement and urine of infected patients, the potential public health risk of its waterborne transmission should be paid broad and close attention. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the associations between COVID-19 incidences and hydrological factors such as lake area, river length, precipitation and volume of water resources in 30 regions of China. All confirmed cases for each areas were divided into two clusters including first cases cluster driven by imported cases during the period of January 20th to January 29th, 2020 and second cases cluster driven by local cases during the period of January 30th to March 1st, 2020. Based on the results of descriptive analysis and nonlinear regression analysis, positive associations with COVID-19 confirmed numbers were observed for migration scale index (MSI), river length, precipitation and volume of water resources, but negative associations for population density. The correlation coefficient in the second stage cases cluster is apparently higher than that in the first stage cases cluster. Then, the negative binomial-generalized linear model (NB-GLM) was fitted to estimate area-specific effects of hydrological variables on relative risk (RR) with the incorporation of additional variables (e.g., MSI) and the effects of exposure-lag-response. The statistically significant associations between RR and river length, the volume of water resources, precipitation were obtained by meta-analysis as 1.24 (95% CI: 1.22, 1.27), 2.56 (95% CI: 2.50, 2.61) and 1.59 (95% CI: 1.56, 1.62), respectively. The possible water transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential capacity of long-distance transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in water environment was also discussed.

The need to adapt to \\"new normal\\" and contain the rapid spread of disease, while maintaining a functional society, resulted with introduction of numerous new legal mechanisms and adaptation of the existing ones. However, it seems that one area of law remains on the fringes: the regulation of wills. Even before the start of the pandemic many authors often pointed to the fact that the current legal framework does not follow modern technological developments, but no significant attempts were made to overhaul the inheritance law. Also, once the pandemic started in its full, there were no references to introduction of extraordinary mechanisms or new legal solutions to overcome the potential difficulties in forming wills. Comparative analysis yielded no better results: although some countries (such as Austria) recently completely overhauled their regulation of inheritance law, it seems that no attempts were made to introduce new types of wills or new methods of drafting wills into their regulations. Furthermore, following the spread of the pandemic, increasing number of potential testators find themselves unable to use traditional methods of drafting wills as they, or the authorized persons tasked with assistance and creation of wills, remain isolated from one another due to various reasons (lock-downs, isolation in case of experiencing symptoms, etc.). Having in mind these circumstances, it is necessary to ascertain whether there is a genuine need to introduce new types of wills into existing legal framework, or to adapt the current legal framework by facilitating the communication between citizens and the institutions. Also, it is necessary to analyze whether the interpretation of the existing legal framework enables the introduction of certain facilitating mechanisms.

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographical outcomes of HTAR for TAAD and to evaluate the clinical outcomes of performing this procedure under mild hypothermia. METHODS: A total of 209 patients who underwent HTAR for TAAD were retrospectively analyzed and stratified into mild (n = 48) and moderate (n = 161) hypothermia groups to evaluate the effects of mild hypothermia on the clinical outcomes. Long-term clinical outcomes were evaluated by the overall survival and adverse aortic events (AAEs). A total of 176 patients with preoperative and at least one-time postoperative aortic computed tomography angiography in our institute were included for evaluating the late aortic remodeling (aortic diameter and false lumen thrombosis). RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 48.3 (interquartile range [IQR] = 28.4C73.7) months. The overall survival rate was 88.0, 83.2, and 77.1% at the 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, and in the presence of death as a competing risk, the cumulative incidence of AAEs was 4.8, 9.9, and 12.1% at the 1, 5, and 10 years. The aortic diameters were stable in the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta (P > 0.05 in all the measured aortic segments). A total of 100% complete false lumen thrombosis rate in the stent covered and distal thoracic aorta were achieved at 1 year (64/64) and 4 years (18/18), respectively after HTAR. The overall composite adverse events morbidity and mortality were 18.7 and 10.0%. Mild hypothermia (31.2, IQR = 30.2C32.0) achieved similar composite adverse events morbidity (mild: 14.6 vs. moderate: 19.9%, P = 0.41) and early mortality (mild: 10.4 vs. moderate: 9.9%, P = 1.00) compared with moderate hypothermia (median 27.7, IQR = 27C28.1) group, but mild hypothermia group needed shorter cardiopulmonary bypass (mild: 111, IQR = 93C145 min vs. moderate: 136, IQR = 114C173 min, P < 0.001) and aortic cross-clamping (mild: 45, IQR = 37C56 min vs. moderate: 78, IQR = 54C107 min, P < 0.001) time. CONCLUSION: Hybrid total arch replacement achieved desirable early and long-term clinical outcomes for TAAD. Performing HTAR under mild hypothermia was as safe as under moderate hypothermia. After HTAR for TAAD, dissected aorta achieved desirable aortic remodeling, presenting as stable aortic diameters and false lumen complete thrombosis.

Of 33 non-homogenized specimens, 31 (93.9%) analysed in triplicate were consistently categorized relative to 10 g/g, compared to all 33 (100%) homogenized specimens. Imprecision was higher (median 27.8%, (range 20.5% to 48.6%)) in non-homogenized specimens than in homogenized specimens (10.2%, (7.0 to 13.5%)). Considerable variation was observed in sequential clinical specimens from individual patients but no positive or negative trend in specimen degradation was observed over time (p = 0.26).Discussion: The FIT immunoassay evaluated is capable of detecting faecal Hb at concentrations well below the DG30 threshold of 10 g/g and is suitable for application in this context. The greatest practical challenge to FIT performance is reproducible sampling, the pre-analytical step associated with most variability. Further research should focus on reducing sampling variability, particularly as post-COVID-19 guidance recommends greater FIT utilization.","output":"Faecal immunochemical testing (FIT): sources of result variation based on three years of routine testing of symptomatic patients in English primary care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Electropositive membranes demonstrating high flux at low pressure differentials show great promise as universal separation platforms for viruses and other charged entities when centralized systems of water and power are scarce.

The development of disease-modifying treatments is significantly changing the natural history of SMA, but uncertainty remains about which patients can benefit from these treatments and how that benefit should be measured. METHODOLOGY: A group of experts specialised in neurology, neuropediatrics, and rehabilitation and representatives of the Spanish association of patients with SMA followed the Delphi method to reach a consensus on 5 issues related to the use of these new treatments: general aspects, treatment objectives, outcome assessment tools, requirements of the treating centres, and regulation of their use. Consensus was considered to be achieved when a response received at least 80% of votes. RESULTS: Treatment protocols are useful for regulating the use of high-impact medications and should guide treatment, but should be updated regularly to take into account the most recent evidence available, and their implementation should be assessed on an individual basis. Age, baseline functional status, and, in the case of children, the type of SMA and the number of copies of SMN2 are characteristics that should be considered when establishing therapeutic objectives, assessment tools, and the use of such treatments. The cost-effectiveness of these treatments in paediatric patients is mainly influenced by early treatment onset; therefore, the implementation of neonatal screening is recommended.

Even though new big data sources have shown unprecedented potential for disease diagnosis and outbreak detection, we need to investigate results in the existing literature to gain a comprehensive understanding of their impact on and benefits to human health. Objective: A systematic review of systematic reviews on identifying digital data sources and their impact area on people's health, including challenges, opportunities, and good practices. Methods: A multidatabase search was performed. Peer-reviewed papers published between January 2010 and November 2020 relevant to digital data sources on health were extracted, assessed, and reviewed. Results: The 64 reviews are covered by three domains, that is, universal health coverage (UHC), public health emergencies, and healthier populations, defined in WHO's General Programme of Work, 2019C2023, and the European Programme of Work, 2020C2025. In all three categories, social media platforms are the most popular digital data source, accounting for 47% (N = 8), 84% (N = 11), and 76% (N = 26) of studies, respectively. The second most utilized data source are electronic health records (EHRs) (N = 13), followed by websites (N = 7) and mass media (N = 5). In all three categories, the most studied impact of digital data sources is on prevention, management, and intervention of diseases (N = 40), and as a tool, there are also many studies (N = 10) on early warning systems for infectious diseases. However, they could also pose health hazards (N = 13), for instance, by exacerbating mental health issues and promoting smoking and drinking behavior among young people. Conclusions: The digital data sources presented are essential for collecting and mining information about human health. The key impact of social media, electronic health records, and websites is in the area of infectious diseases and early warning systems, and in the area of personal health, that is, on mental health and smoking and drinking prevention.

Responsible for the continuous presence are cats that are chronically shedding a high load of FCoV. The aim of the study was to determine a possible correlation between FCoV antibody titer and frequency and load of fecal FCoV shedding in cats from catteries. METHODS: Four fecal samples from each of 82 cats originating from 19 German catteries were examined for FCoV viral loads by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Additionally, antibody titers were determined by an immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Cats with antibodies were more likely to be FCoV shedders than non-shedders, and there was a weak positive correlation between antibody titer and mean fecal virus load (Spearman r = 0.2984; p = 0.0072). Antibody titers were significantly higher if cats shed FCoV more frequently throughout the study period (p = 0.0063). When analyzing only FCoV shedders, cats that were RT-qPCR-positive in all four samples had significantly higher antibody titers (p = 0.0014) and significantly higher mean fecal virus loads (p = 0.0475) than cats that were RT-qPCR-positive in only one, two, or three samples. CONCLUSIONS: The cats' antibody titers correlate with the likelihood and frequency of FCoV shedding and fecal virus load. Chronic shedders have higher antibody titers and shed more virus.

During the past few years, it has been demonstrated that RNAi, induced by specifically designed double\\\\stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules, can silence gene expression of human viral pathogens both in acute and chronic viral infections. Furthermore, it is now apparent that in in vitro and in some in vivo models, the prospects for this technology in developing therapeutic applications are robust.

Accordingly, the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were decreased sequentially in lung tissues. CIE alleviated OVA-induced airway inflammation by restraining phosphorylation of NF-B and the sequentially reduced expression of iNOS, COX-2, leading to reduced MMP-9 expression.

METHODS: Between 19 July and 14 August 2020, 4487 households were selected using a random sample stratified by region and citizenship of the head of household (UAE citizen or non-citizen). A cluster sample of 40 labour camps was selected. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, risk factors and symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were collected. Each participant was first tested by Roche Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay, followed, when reactive, by the LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay. RESULTS: Among 8831 individuals from households, seroprevalence was 104% [95% confidence intervals (CIs) 95-114], with higher seroprevalence in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain regions compared with those in Al Dhafra. In households, we found no sex difference and UAE citizens had lower seroprevalence compared with those of other nationalities.

An abundant group of rRNA modifications, present in all domains of life, is 2-O-methylation guided by box C/D small nucleolar RNAs, which are part of small ribonucleoprotein complexes (snoRNPs). Although 2-O-methylations are required for the proper production of ribosomes, the mechanisms by which these modifications contribute to translation have remained elusive. Here, we show that a change in box C/D snoRNP biogenesis in actively growing yeast cells results in the production of hypo-2-O-methylated ribosomes with distinct translational properties. Using RiboMethSeq for the quantitative analysis of 2-O-methylations, we identify site-specific perturbations of the rRNA 2-O-methylation pattern and uncover sites that are not required for ribosome production under normal conditions. Characterization of the hypo-2-O-methylated ribosomes reveals significant translational fidelity defects, including frameshifting and near-cognate start codon selection. Using rRNA structural probing, we show that hypo-2-O-methylation affects the inherent dynamics of the ribosomal subunits and impacts the binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1, thereby causing translational defects. Our data reveal an unforeseen spectrum of 2-O-methylation heterogeneity in yeast rRNA and suggest a significant role for rRNA 2-O-methylation in regulating cellular translation by controlling ribosome dynamics and ligand binding.","output":"Ribosomal RNA 2-O-methylations regulate translation by impacting ribosome dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: University campuses present an ideal environment for viral spread and are therefore at extreme risk of serving as a hotbed for a COVID-19 outbreak. While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.","output":"Reopening universities during the COVID-19 pandemic: A testing strategy to minimize active cases and delay outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cataclysmic contagion based calamity -- Covid-19 has shown us a clear need for a comprehensive community based strategy that overcomes the sheer complexity of controlling it and the caveats of current methods.

Therefore, taking a decision is no easy feat and must consider the community utility constrained by its priorities, budget, risks, collateral and abilities which can be encoded into the optimization of the strategy.

METHODS Clinical evaluation was performed to identify the optimal set of parameters based on clinical effects in 29 patients with PD and bilateral directional leads for Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) DBS. A second DBS program was generated in GUIDE XT? based on a VEsF optimally located within the dorsolateral STN. Reduction of motor symptoms (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, MDS-UPDRS) and the overlap of the corresponding VEsF of both programs were compared. RESULTS Clinical and imaging-guided programming resulted in a significant reduction in the MDS-UPDRS scores compared to off-state. Motor symptom control with GUIDE XT?-derived DBS program was non-inferior to standard clinical programming. The overlap of the two VEsF did not correlate with the difference in motor symptom reduction by the programs. CONCLUSIONS Imaging-guided programming of directional DBS leads using GUIDE XT? is possible without computational background and leads to non-inferior motor symptom control compared with clinical programming.

This cough data include 1.68 hours of TB coughs, 18.54 minutes of COVID-19 coughs and 1.69 hours of healthy coughs from 47 TB patients, 229 COVID-19 patients and 1498 healthy patients and were used to train and evaluate a CNN, LSTM and Resnet50. These three deep architectures were also pre-trained on 2.14 hours of sneeze, 2.91 hours of speech and 2.79 hours of noise for improved performance. The class-imbalance in our dataset was addressed by using SMOTE data balancing technique and using performance metrics such as F1-score and AUC.

While this is usually an effective and reliable method, the current efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic demand more efficient measures. Diagnostic assays can be scaled up by the method of High-Throughput qPCR via sample pooling. Pooling, the action of combining multiple samples into one tube, is most effective when the chance of positive detection of the target, SARS-CoV-2 RNA, is low. In such cases, large groups of samples can be conclusively classified as negative with a single test, with no need to individually test every sample. However, different frequencies of the target-product presence in the samples, require different pool/batch sizes for optimal results. Here, we present two possible optimized pooling strategies for diagnostic SARSCoV-2 testing on large scales, each one better suited for a different range of target frequency. In the first, we employ a simple information-theoretic heuristic to derive a highly efficient re-pooling protocol: an estimate of the target frequency determines the initial pool size, and any subsequent pools found positive are re-pooled at half-size and tested again. In the range of very rare target (<0.05), this approach can reduce the number of necessary tests dramatically. For example, this method achieves a reduction of a factor of 50 for a target frequency of 0.001. The second method is a simpler approach of optimized one-time pooling followed by individual tests on positive pools. We show that this approach is just as efficient for moderate target-product frequencies (0.05<0.2). For example, it reduces the number of tests needed by half if the frequency of positives samples is 0.07. We show that both methods are comparable to the absolute upper-bound efficiency given by Shannon's source coding theorem. Our strategies require no investment at all, and they offer a significant reduction in the amount of equipment and time needed to test large numbers of samples. Both approaches are dynamic; they can be easily implemented in different conditions with various infection rates and sample numbers. We compare our strategies to the naive way of testing and also to alternative matrix methods. Most importantly, we offer practical pooling instructions for laboratories that perform large scale qPCR assays to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 viral particles.","output":"Efficient and Practical Sample Pooling for High-Throughput PCR Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the survey was to find out what the possible consequences are of the COVID-19 disease on the nervous system and to propose a method of using artificial intelligence.

METHODS: RUCAS consists of a longitudinal study where inhabitants exposed and unexposed to the intervention will be compared over time within the study neighborhoods (cohorts), capitalizing on interventions as a natural experiment. Researchers have developed a specific conceptual framework and identified potential causal mechanisms. Proximal and more distal intervention effects will be measured with five instruments, implemented pre- and post-interventions between 2018 and 2021: a household survey, an observation tool to evaluate dwelling conditions, hygrochrons for measuring temperature and humidity inside dwellings, systematic observation of recreational areas, and qualitative interviews. Survey baseline data (956 households, 3130 individuals) is presented to describe sociodemographics, housing and health characteristics of both cohorts, noting that neighborhoods studied show worse conditions than the Chilean population. DISCUSSION: RUCAS' design allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the effects that the intervention could have on various dimensions of health and health determinants. RUCAS will face some challenges, like changes in the intervention process due to adjustments of the master plan, exogenous factors -including COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns- and lost to follow-up.

The 1,702 college students (mean age  standard deviation, 20.06  1.46, range 16C25; 71.9% females) with insomnia symptoms were divided into three trajectory groups: recovery group, remission group, and chronic insomnia group according to their insomnia scores in T2 phase. The results showed that there was no significant difference in demographic backgrounds or epidemic exposure among the three groups, however, there were significant differences in food intake, exercise, and Internet use. The regression results further showed that both the recovery group and the remission group adopted more regular food intake than the chronic group. The recovery group exhibited better daily exercise habits than both the remission group and the chronic group. The duration of Internet use was significantly shorter for the recovery group than for the chronic group. These findings indicate a strong relationship between the lifestyle and the recovery of insomnia for college students isolated at home during the epidemic period. Significance of the different aspects of lifestyle on the recovery of insomnia are discussed.","output":"The Moderating Role of Lifestyle on Insomnia in Home Quarantine College Students During the COVID-19 Epidemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loneliness and social isolation are established risk factors for many clinical conditions yet few scalable interventions exist. Papa Inc. is a national service that pairs older adults with Papa Pals (empathetic, laypeople) who provide companionship and assistance with everyday tasks. Participants have free access if their Medicare Advantage plan offers it. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Papa provided virtual companionship visits via telephone or video. This study evaluated the impact of virtual companionship visits on loneliness status (UCLA 3-item Loneliness Scale) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample (N=894) included adults ages 65+ who identified as lonely at baseline and who completed at least one virtual visit between March 18, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Virtual visits were classified into four categories based on participants total number of visit minutes: Low (124 ave min), Medium Low (ML) (305 ave min), Medium High (MH) (567 ave min), and High (1360 ave min). Lonely and severely lonely participants engaged a mean of 573 and 673 minutes in the program, respectively. Improvement in loneliness status was associated with greater use of minutes for the ML and MH participants compared to Low participants (ML OR: 1.46 95CI: 1.00 - 2.11, MH OR 1.65 95CI: 1.13 - 2.40). These findings indicate that a virtual companionship intervention can be an impactful and scalable tool for older adults who want to age at home and have limited social support, especially during the uncertain COVID landscape.

According to early and late phenotype, three types of CD are generally classified: (1) Thirteen CDs with early and late clinical landmarks. However, it must be pointed out that the different penetrances of the gene often leads to quantitative differences in the corneal phenotype in peers in distinct generations of the same family. (2) Seven CDs with late onset and very little progression of the corneal changes. (3) Two CDs with congenital haze which can be interpreted as the final phenotype of this dystrophy.

The severity of the situation has become so substantial that many or even most of the patients with mild to moderate symptoms had to self-isolate without specific medical treatments or even without being tested for COVID-19. Many patients joined internet membership groups to exchange information and support each other. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to determine the benefits and limits of using social media to understand the symptoms of patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms and, in particular, their symptoms of anosmia (loss of the sense of smell) and ageusia (loss of the sense of taste). The voluntary reports on an internet website of a membership group will be the platform of the analyses. METHODS: Posts and comments of members of an internet group known as COVID-19 Smell and Taste Loss, founded on March 24, 2020, to support patients with suspected COVID-19 were collected and analyzed daily. Demographic data were collected using the software mechanism called Group Insights on the membership group website. RESULTS: Membership groups on social media have become rare sources of support for patients with suspected COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. These groups provided mental support to their members and became resources for information on COVID-19 tests and medicines or supplements. However, the membership was voluntary, and often the members leave without notification. It is hard to be precise from the free voluntary reports. The number of women in the group (6995/9227, 75.38% as of October 12, 2020) was about three times more than men (2272/9227, 24.62% as of October 12, 2020), and the peak age of members was between 20-40 years in both men and women. Patients who were asymptomatic other than the senses comprised 14.93% (53/355) of the total patients. Recovery of the senses was higher in the patients who were asymptomatic besides having anosmia and ageusia. Most (112/123, 91.06%) patients experienced other symptoms first and then lost their senses, on average, 4.2 days later. Patients without other symptoms tended to recover earlier (P=.02). Patients with anosmia and ageusia occasionally reported distorted smell and taste (parosmia and dysgeusia) as well as experiencing or perceiving the smell and taste without the sources of the smell or taste (phantosmia and phantogeusia). CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of the social media database of suspected COVID-19 patients' voices demonstrated that, although accurate diagnosis of patients is not always obtained with social media-based analyses, it may be a useful tool to collect a large amount of data on symptoms and the clinical course of worldwide rapidly growing infectious diseases.","output":"Loss of Smell and Taste in Patients With Suspected COVID-19: Analyses of Patients' Reports on Social Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After several months of rapid pandemic expansion, it is now apparent that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus interferes with smell and taste sensation in a substantial proportion of COVID-19 patients.

Here, we discuss recent genetic and epidemiological data on the D614G spike protein variant and assess whether current evidence is consistent with the notion that this single nucleotide polymorphism augments chemosensory impairments in COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that this spike variant is an important viral genetic factor that facilitates infection of chemosensory epithelia, possibly acting together with yet to be identified host factors, and thereby increases smell and taste impairment.

However, the extra-pulmonary manifestations of this disease are not as well described. We present a patient who simultaneously developed acute EVALI and stress induced cardiomyopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 35-year-old female with a recent heavy vaping history presented to hospital via EMS due to disorganized behavior. Her past medical history was notable for polysubstance abuse and an extensive neuropsychiatric history. Her vital signs were notable for sinus tachycardia, hypotension and hypoxia with an oxyhemoglobin saturation 65%. Her physical exam was notable for cyanosis, rales to pulmonary auscultation and use of accessory muscles. She was intubated and started on empiric antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia, and vasopressors. A computer tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPE) was negative for acute pulmonary embolism but showed scattered bilateral airspace opacities with dependent consolidations (fig 1.). Relevant laboratory on admission included procalcitonin 28.17, WBC count 12.9 and troponin 1.58. SARs-COV-2, serum blood cultures, legionella antigen, streptococci pneumoniae antigen and HIV were negative. Urine toxicology was positive for cannabinoids. Bronchoalveolar lavage later demonstrated 50,000 TNC with neutrophil predominance. EKG showed sinus tachycardia and nonspecific ST depression. Echocardiogram revealed severe diffuse hypokinesis with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 13%. During her ICU course she continued on mechanical ventilation with lung protective strategy, systemic glucocorticoids and antibiotics. Vasopressors were subsequently weaned off. Repeated echocardiogram on ICU day five demonstrated a recovered LVEF at 55%. Patient's hypoxemia improved, and she was successfully extubated on ICU day eight. DISCUSSION: Pulmonary injury is the most well described clinical manifestation of EVALI, however a large majority of these patients also present with gastrointestinal symptoms and malaise, suggesting a systemic disease process. Our patient had newly reduced LVEF suggestive of stress induced cardiomyopathy which consequently improved with standard and supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: It is important to maintain a high index of suspicion of secondary organ damage, as prompt diagnosis and treatment of EVALI associated cardiac dysfunction can have an impact in short- and long-term prognosis.

The 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on eligibility for preventive therapy to treat latent TB infection (LTBI) include people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), household contacts of TB patients including children, and those with clinical conditions including silicosis, dialysis, transplantation, etc. and other country-specific groups. We aimed to estimate the potential impact of full implementation of these guidelines in the WHO South-East Asian (SEA) Region, which bears the largest burden of TB and LTBI amongst the WHO regions. METHODS: We developed mathematical models of TB transmission dynamics, calibrated individually to each of the 11 countries in the region. We modelled preventive therapy in the absence of other TB interventions. As an alternative comparator, reflecting ongoing developments in TB control in the region, we also simulated improvements in the treatment cascade for active TB, including private sector engagement and intensified case-finding. Relative to both scenarios, for each country in the region, we projected TB cases and deaths averted between 2020 and 2030, by full uptake of preventive therapy, defined as comprehensive coverage amongst eligible populations as per WHO guidelines, and assuming outcomes consistent with clinical trials. We also performed sensitivity analysis to illustrate impact under less-than-optimal conditions. RESULTS: At the regional level, full uptake of preventive therapy amongst identified risk groups would reduce annual incidence rates in 2030 by 8.30% (95% CrI 6.48C10.83) relative to 2015, in the absence of any additional interventions. If implemented against a backdrop of improved TB treatment cascades, preventive therapy would achieve an incremental 6.93 percentage points (95% CrI 5.81C8.51) of reduction in annual incidence rates, compared to 2015. At the regional level, the numbers of individuals with latent TB infection that need to be treated to avert 1 TB case is 64 (95% CrI 55C74). Sensitivity analysis illustrates that results for impact are roughly proportional to effective coverage (the product of actual coverage and effectiveness of the regimen). CONCLUSIONS: Full implementation of WHO guidelines is important for ending TB in the SEA Region. Although future strategies will need to be expanded to the population level, to achieve large declines in TB incidence, the uptake of current tools can offer a valuable step in this direction.","output":"The potential impact of preventive therapy against tuberculosis in the WHO South-East Asian Region: a modelling approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To identify early markers of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), we hypothesized that continuous abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy (A-NIRS) measurement of splanchnic tissue oxygen saturation and intermittent plasma intestinal fatty-acid binding protein (pI-FABP) measured every 6 hours can detect NEC prior to onset of clinical symptoms. Premature piglets received parenteral nutrition for 48-hours after delivery, followed by enteral feeds every three hours until death or euthanasia at 96-hours. Continuous A-NIRS, systemic oxygen saturation (SpO2), and heart rate were measured while monitoring for clinical signs of NEC. Blood samples obtained at 6-hour intervals were used to determine pI-FABP levels by ELISA. Piglets were classified as fulminant-NEC (f-NEC), non-fulminant-NEC (nf-NEC) and No-NEC according to severity of clinical and histologic features. Of 38 piglets, 37% (n=14) developed nf-NEC, 18% (n=7) developed f-NEC and 45% (n=17) had No-NEC. There were significant differences in baseline heart rate (p=0.008), SpO2 (p<0.001) and A-NIRS (p<0.001) among the three groups. A-NIRS values of NEC piglets remained lower throughout the study with mean for f-NEC of 693.8%, 71.94.04% for nf-NEC, and 78.41.8% for No-NEC piglets (p<0.001). A-NIRS <75% predicted NEC with 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity. NEC piglets demonstrated greater variability from baseline in A-NIRS than healthy piglets (10.1% vs. 6.3%; p=0.04). Mean pI-FABP levels were higher in animals that developed NEC compared to No-NEC piglets (0.66 vs. 0.09 ng/mL;p<0.001). In f-NEC piglets, pI-FABP increased precipitously after feeds (0.04 to 1.87 ng/mL;p<0.001). pI-FABP levels increased in parallel with disease progression and a value >0.25ng/mL identified animals with NEC (68% sensitivity and 90% specificity). NIRS is a real-time, non-invasive tool that can serve as a diagnostic modality for NEC. In premature piglets, low A-NIRS in the early neonatal period and increased variability during initial feeds are highly predictive of NEC, which is then confirmed by rising plasma I-FABP levels. These modalities may help identify neonates with NEC prior to clinical manifestations of disease.","output":"Low Abdominal NIRS Values and Elevated Plasma Intestinal Fatty Acid-Binding Protein in a Premature Piglet Model of Necrotizing Enterocolitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Stem cells are an important subject of research, and are increasingly used in the treatment of various diseases. Due to the development of advanced in vitro techniques, they have become an integral part of modern medicine.

Notably, recent research has focused on stem cells found in the oral cavity, both in the dental pulp and oral mucosa. Furthermore, isolation of stem cells from umbilical cord blood is also becoming increasingly popular, while whartons jelly and amniotic fluid also seem to be an interesting source of stem cells. The safety and efficacy of stem cells use can be established by animal studies, which are a key element of preclinical research. Mouse, rat and pig models allow for testing of stem cell therapies. Recent studies primarily use mesenchymal stem cells such as mouse C adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells and mouse and rat hematopoietic stem cells. Great hope for future therapies is the use of bioengineering to program cells into induced stem cells, which have the biggest ability for differentiation and transdifferentiation, which carries no risk of teratogenesis. Stem cells are used in many areas of medicine, especially in regenerative medicine, with a growing interest in orthopedics and in the treatment of heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells are the most used stem cell type, which despite their limited ability to differentiate, give great therapeutic results, mainly due to their immunomodulating effect.

Such questions involve the role of intercontinental commerce in maintaining sustainable production within important supply regions and the vulnerability of peripheral regions believed to have been especially sensitive to environmental and political disturbances. We provide archaeobotanical evidence from trash mounds at three sites in the central Negev Desert, Israel, unraveling the rise and fall of viticulture over the second to eighth centuries of the common era (CE). Using quantitative ceramic data obtained in the same archaeological contexts, we further investigate connections between Negev viticulture and circum-Mediterranean trade. Our findings demonstrate interrelated growth in viticulture and involvement in Mediterranean trade reaching what appears to be a commercial scale in the fourth to mid-sixth centuries. Following a mid-sixth century peak, decline of this system is evident in the mid- to late sixth century, nearly a century before the Islamic conquest. These findings closely correspond with other archaeological evidence for social, economic, and urban growth in the fourth century and decline centered on the mid-sixth century. Contracting markets were a likely proximate cause for the decline; possible triggers include climate change, plague, and wider sociopolitical developments.

In-hospital mortality was lower in patients treated with steroids than in controls (13.9% [55/396] versus 23.9% [16/67]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.51 [95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.96]; P = 0.044). Steroid treatment reduced mortality by 41.8% relative to the mortality with no steroid treatment (relative risk reduction, 0.42 [95% confidence interval, 0.048 to 0.65]). Initial treatment with 1 mg/kg of body weight/day of methylprednisolone versus steroid pulses was not associated with in-hospital mortality (13.5% [42/310] versus 15.1% [13/86]; odds ratio [OR], 0.880 [95% confidence interval, 0.449 to 1.726]; P = 0.710).

Objective: To determine long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors after infection. Data Sources: A literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and CHINAL and preprint servers MedR{chi}iv and BioR{chi}iv through January 15, 2021. Study Selection: Eligible studies were those reporting patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and who showed any symptoms persisting beyond the acute phase. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Incidence rate of symptoms were pooled using inverse variance methods with a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pain-related symptoms such as headache or myalgia. Secondary outcomes were symptoms relevant to pain (depression or muscle weakness) and symptoms frequently reported (anosmia and dyspnea). Heterogeneity among studies and publication bias for each symptom were estimated. The source of heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression, with follow-up period, age and sex as covariates. Results: In total, 35 studies including 18,711 patients were eligible. Eight pain-related symptoms and 26 other symptoms were identified. The highest pooled incidence among pain-related symptoms was chest pain (17%, 95% CI, 12%-25%), followed by headache (16%, 95% CI, 9%-27%), arthralgia (13%, 95% CI, 7%-24%), neuralgia (12%, 95% CI, 3%-38%) and abdominal pain (11%, 95% CI, 7%-16%). The highest pooled incidence among other symptoms was fatigue (45%, 95% CI, 32%-59%), followed by insomnia (26%, 95% CI, 9%-57%), dyspnea (25%, 95% CI, 15%-38%), weakness (25%, 95% CI, 8%-56%) and anosmia (19%, 95% CI, 13%-27%). Substantial heterogeneity was identified (I2, 50-100%). Meta-regression analyses partially accounted for the source of heterogeneity, and yet, 53% of the symptoms remained unexplained. Conclusions and Relevance: The current meta-analysis may provide a complete picture of incidence in PASC. It remains unclear, however, whether post-COVID symptoms progress or regress over time or to what extent PASC are associated with age or sex.","output":"Incidence of Long-term Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Related to Pain and Other Symptoms: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The unique situational challenges of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic have demanded creative modifications to the delivery of genetic services.

With an increase in more wired and wireless connections and devices on SME networks, unpredictable malicious activities and interruptions have risen. Finding the harmony between the advancement of technology and costs has always been a balancing act particularly in convincing the finance directors of these SMEs to invest in capital towards their IT infrastructure. This paper looks at various devices that currently are in the market to detect intrusions and look at how these devices handle prevention strategies for SMEs in their working environment both at home and in the office, in terms of their credibility in handling zero-day attacks against the costs of achieving so. The experiment was set up during the 2020 pandemic referred to as COVID-19 when the world experienced an unprecedented event of large scale. The operational working environment of SMEs reflected the context when the UK went into lockdown. Pre-pandemic would have seen this experiment take full control within an operational office environment;however, COVID-19 times has pushed us into a corner to evaluate every aspect of cybersecurity from the office and keeping the data safe within the home environment. The devices chosen for this experiment were OpenSource such as SNORT and pfSense to detect activities within the home environment, and Cisco, a commercial device, set up within an SME network. All three devices operated in a live environment within the SME network structure with employees being both at home and in the office. All three devices were observed from the rules they displayed, their costs and machine learning techniques integrated within them. The results revealed these aspects to be important in how they identified zero-day attacks. The findings showed that OpenSource devices whilst free to download, required a high level of expertise in personnel to implement and embed machine learning rules into the business solution even for staff working from home. However, when using Cisco, the price reflected the buy-in into this expertise and Ciscos mainframe network, to give up-to-date information on cyber-attacks. The requirements of the UK General Data Protection Regulations Act (GDPR) were also acknowledged as part of the broader framework of the study. Machine learning techniques such as anomaly-based intrusions did show better detection through a commercially subscription-based model for support from Cisco compared to that of the OpenSource model which required internal expertise in machine learning. A cost model was used to compare the outcome of SMEs decision making, in getting the right framework in place in securing their data. In conclusion, finding a balance between IT expertise and costs of products that are able to help SMEs protect and secure their data will benefit the SMEs from using a more intelligent controlled environment with applied machine learning techniques, and not compromising on costs. ? 2021 by the authors.","output":"Cost benefits of using machine learning features in NIDS for cyber security in UK small medium enterprises (SME)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fog of war is a major obstacle for a fighting force trying to accomplish a goal, and it has been a significant barrier in the fight against COVID-19.

It has a variable clinical presentation and little phenotype-genotype correlation. The pathognomonic sign of HS is cutaneous hyperpigmentation located mainly in the inner thighs and often accompanied by other systemic manifestations. Improvement after tocilizumab treatment has been reported in a few patients with HS. We report the first patient with HS who presented cardiogenic shock, multiorgan infiltration, and digital ischemia. CASE PRESENTATION: 8-year-old boy born to consanguineous parents of Moroccan origin who was admitted to the intensive care unit during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with tachypnoea, tachycardia, and oliguria. Echocardiography showed dilated cardiomyopathy and severe systolic dysfunction compatible with cardiogenic shock. Additionally, he presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody detection by chromatographic immunoassay were negative. A previously ordered gene panel for pre-existing sensorineural hearing loss showed a pathological mutation in the SCL29A3 gene compatible with H syndrome. Computed tomography scan revealed extensive alveolar infiltrates in the lungs and multiple poor defined hypodense lesions in liver, spleen, and kidneys; adenopathy; and cardiomegaly with left ventricle subendocardial nodules. Invasive mechanical ventilation, broad antibiotic and antifungal coverage showed no significant response. Therefore, Tocilizumab as compassionate use together with pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated. Improvement was impressive leading to normalization of inflammation markers, liver and kidney function, and stabilising heart function. Two weeks later, he was discharged and has been clinically well since then on two weekly administration of Tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: We report the most severe disease course produced by HS described so far in the literature. Our patients manifestations included uncommon, new complications such as acute heart failure with severe systolic dysfunction, multi-organ cell infiltrate, and digital ischemia. Most of the clinical symptoms of our patient could have been explained by SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating the importance of a detailed differential diagnosis to ensure optimal treatment. Although the mechanism of autoinflammation of HS remains uncertain, the good response of our patient to Tocilizumab makes a case for the important role of IL-6 in this syndrome and for considering Tocilizumab as a first-line treatment, at least in severely affected patients.","output":"Patient with H syndrome, cardiogenic shock, multiorgan infiltration, and digital ischemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Public-Private-People partnership (4P) is a significant element in disaster response.

The first section briefly reviews the most promising as well as the latest achievements in graphene synthesis based on growth and delamination techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition, liquid phase exfoliation via sonication or mechanical forces, as well as oxidative procedures ranging from chemical to electrochemical exfoliation. Two-dimensional carbon materials are highly attractive to be integrated in a wide field of sensing applications. Here, graphene is examined as recognition layer in electrochemical sensors like field-effect transistors, chemiresistors, impedance-based devices as well as voltammetric and amperometric sensors. The sensor performance is evaluated from the materials perspective of view and revealed the impact of structure and defects of the 2D carbon materials in different transducing technologies.

Methods: By interlinking data from national electronic registries, covering nearly 99% of the Greek population (approximately 11,000,000), between March 2020 and February 2021, when vaccination became available, we recorded confirmed infections and Covid-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths in essentially all adult patients with RA, AS, PsA, SLE, and SSc under treatment (n=74,970, median age of 67.5, 51.2, 58.1, 56.2, 62.2 years, respectively) and in individually matched (1:5) on age, sex, and region of domicile random comparators from the general population. Results: Binary logistic regression analysis after adjusting for age, sex and biologic agents, revealed that RA, PsA, SLE and SSc, but not AS patients, had significantly higher risk of infection (by 43%, 25%, 20% and 49%, respectively), and hospitalization for Covid-19 (by 81%, 56%, 94%, and 111%, respectively), possibly due, at least in part, to increased testing and lower threshold for admission. Patients with RA and SSc had indeed higher Covid-19 associated mortality rates [OR:1.86 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.52) and OR:2.90 (95% CI 0.97 to 8.67), respectively] compared to the general population. Each additional year of age increased the risk of hospitalization for Covid-19 by 3% (OR 1.030, 95% CI: 1.028 to 1.034) and the risk of Covid-19 related death by 8% (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.09), independently of gender, systemic rheumatic disease, and biologic agents. A further analysis using AS patients as the reference category, adjusting again for age, sex and use of biologic agents showed that patients with SSc had increased mortality (OR: 6.90, 95% CI: 1.41 to 33.72), followed by SLE (OR: 4.05 95% CI: 0.96 to 17.12) and RA patients (OR: 3.65, 95% CI: 1.06 to 12.54), whereas PsA patients had comparable mortality risk with AS patients.

Given the large number of people recovered from either the mild SARS-CoV-2 infection or more severe COVID-19 conditions, it is critical to understand the long-term consequences of the infection by this virus. Our histological evaluations revealed that patients died of COVID-19 exhibited thickened pulmonary vascular walls, one important hallmark of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). By contrast, such pulmonary vascular remodeling lesions were not found in patients died of SARS-CoV-1 during the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak or due to the infection by H1N1 influenza. The advancement in the treatment for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been remarkable that HIV-infected individuals now live for a long time, in turn revealing that these individuals become susceptible to developing PAH, a fatal condition. We herein hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 is another virus that is capable to triggering the increased susceptibility of infected individuals to developing PAH in the future. Given the large number of people being infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this pandemic and that most people recover from severe, mild or asymptomatic conditions, it is imperative to generate scientific information on how the health of recovered individuals may be affected long-term. PAH is one lethal consequence that should be considered and needs to be monitored. This may also foster the research on developing therapeutic agents to prevent PAH, which has not so far been successful.","output":"COVID-19 patients may become predisposed to pulmonary arterial hypertension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for death of aged people from Covid-19 became one of the major concerns of these days. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enhances the normal senescence and accelerates the precocious removal of chronologically young, yet biologically aged cells.

Nowadays, Covid-19 is considered a serious health problem worldwide. The host cellular environment is the key determinant of pathogen Infectivity. Most respiratory viral infections have a strong association with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Unfortunately, this enzyme deficiency markedly decreases with aging what is involved in increasing of the morbidity rate.

However, little is known about the causes of death and the virus's pathologic features. OBJECTIVE: To validate and compare clinical findings with data from medical autopsy, virtual autopsy, and virologic tests. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Autopsies performed at a single academic medical center, as mandated by the German federal state of Hamburg for patients dying with a polymerase chain reactionCconfirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS: The first 12 consecutive COVID-19Cpositive deaths. MEASUREMENTS: Complete autopsy, including postmortem computed tomography and histopathologic and virologic analysis, was performed. Clinical data and medical course were evaluated. Results: Median patient age was 73 years (range, 52 to 87 years), 75% of patients were male, and death occurred in the hospital (n = 10) or outpatient sector (n = 2). Coronary heart disease and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most common comorbid conditions (50% and 25%, respectively). Autopsy revealed deep venous thrombosis in 7 of 12 patients (58%) in whom venous thromboembolism was not suspected before death; pulmonary embolism was the direct cause of death in 4 patients. Postmortem computed tomography revealed reticular infiltration of the lungs with severe bilateral, dense consolidation, whereas histomorphologically diffuse alveolar damage was seen in 8 patients. In all patients, SARSCCoV-2 RNA was detected in the lung at high concentrations; viremia in 6 of 10 and 5 of 12 patients demonstrated high viral RNA titers in the liver, kidney, or heart.

We sought to evaluate the prevalence and etiology of all community acquired viral respiratory infections requiring hospitalization during an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, with a focus on co-infection rates and clinical outcomes. METHODS: Over a 10-week period, all admissions to our institution, the largest tertiary hospital in Singapore, were screened for respiratory symptoms, and COVID-19 as well as a panel of common respiratory viral pathogens were systematically tested for. Information was collated on clinical outcomes, including requirement for mechanical ventilation and in hospital mortality. RESULTS: One-fifth (19.3%, 736/3807) of hospitalized inpatients with respiratory symptoms had a PCR-proven viral respiratory infection; of which 58.5% (431/736) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 42.2% (311/736) tested positive for other common respiratory viruses. The rate of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 was 1.4% (8/431); all patients with co-infection had mild disease and stayed in communal settings. The in-hospital mortality rate and proportion of COVID-19 patients requiring invasive ventilation was low, at around 1% of patients; these rates were lower than patients with other community-acquired respiratory viruses admitted over the same period (p < 0.01).

The system involves inducible expression of individual viral proteins and identification of detrimental phenotypes in the yeast. Yeast knockout and overexpression libraries can then be used for genome-wide screening of host proteins that provide a suppressor phenotype. From the yeast hits, a narrowed list of candidate genes can be produced to investigate for roles in viral replication. Since the system only requires expression of viral proteins, it can be used for any current or emerging virus, regardless of biocontainment requirements and ability to culture the virus.

Trials with a broad relevance to the cardiology community and those with potential to change current practice were included. RESULTS: A total of 150 key cardiology clinical trials were identified for inclusion. Interventional cardiology data included trials evaluating the use of new generation novel stent technology and new intravascular physiology strategies such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) to guide revascularisation in stable and unstable coronary artery disease. New trials in acute coronary syndromes focused on shock, out of hospital cardiac arrest (OOHCA), the impact of COVID-19 on ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) networks and optimal duration/type of antiplatelet treatment. Structural intervention trials included latest data on transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and mitral, tricuspid and pulmonary valve interventions. Heart failure data included trials with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, sacubitril/valsartan and novel drugs such as mavacamten for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Prevention trials included new data on proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors.

ACEs are harmful to mental health, and psychological problems can influence personal economic poverty in adulthood. We focused on family dysfunction and discussed the effect of different types of ACEs on poverty and the corresponding mediating effect of depression. Materials and Methods: A total of 9,910 individuals who were 60 years or older from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2014 and 2015 were analysed. The chi-square test was used to compare poverty incidence among subgroups of independent or control variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to test the effect of different types of ACEs on depression, and four logistic regression models were established to observe the association between ACEs on older adult poverty and the mediating effect of depression. The path diagram of the direct effect and indirect effect was drawn to test the mediating effect of depression. Results: Early death of father, the male guardian getting upset and witnessing violence of father to mother are the risk factors for older adult poverty, whereas female guardian getting upset, relationship with female guardians and parental quarrel are protective factors for older adult poverty. Furthermore, depression has a partial mediating effect on some factors including early death of father, male guardian getting upset, relationship with female guardian, parental quarrel, and witnessing violence of father to mother. Conclusions: Paternal ACE factors can directly make children more likely to fall into poverty as older adults and can indirectly influence older adult poverty through the partial mediating effect of depression. Assisting poor families, providing psychological counselling, formulating family visit plans, nurturing orphan children under state supervision, and other policies that focus on groups that have experienced paternal ACE events are essential to eliminating the risk factors that influence older adult poverty.","output":"Impact of Adverse Childhood Experiences on Older Adult Poverty: Mediating Role of Depression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Alteration of smell and taste has been reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS A prospective cohort study enrolled 108 patients with Rutherford category 2-3 ischemia who had successful primary unilateral angioplasty and self-expanding bare metal stent implantation for superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenosis. The primary endpoint was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or transient ischemic attack, cardiovascular death, or >80% target lesion restenosis within 2 years after peripheral angioplasty. Target lesion restenosis (restenosis endpoint) and the composite of the aforementioned atherothrombotic events (atherothrombotic endpoint) within 2-year follow-up were defined as secondary endpoints. RESULTS CHE levels were not available in 4 patients due to technical problems and 4 patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 100 patients (median age 65 years; 62 men) met the minimum sample size requirement for statistical analysis. Median CHE levels were significantly lower in patients who subsequently experienced the primary endpoint compared with patients without ischemic events [7.1 (IQR 6.3-8.1) vs 8 (IQR 7-9.3) kU/L, p=0.007]. A CHE level <8.3 kU/L was identified as the best cutoff value to predict the primary endpoint, providing an 82.1% sensitivity and 44.3% specificity. The primary endpoint occurred significantly more often in patients with low CHE <8.3 kU/L than in patients with higher CHE levels (32 vs 7 patients, p=0.01). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, low CHE was associated with a 2.6-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.1 to 5.9, p=0.03) of the primary endpoint. Moreover, patients who suffered the secondary restenosis endpoint had significantly lower median CHE levels than patients without restenosis [7.1 (IQR 6.3-8.2) vs 7.9 (IQR 7-8.9) kU/L, p=0.02], and restenosis occurred more frequently in patients with low CHE compared with those with higher CHE levels (27 vs 7 patients, p=0.04).

Palliative care (PC) needs might emerge long before the last weeks of life. Many palliative care patients could be managed from the usual care staff, if appropriately trained; specialist palliative care should be provided to patients with more complex needs. Staff needs adequate training, so that only patients presenting a higher complexity are properly referred to the second level (specialized) PC services. In the considered hospital setting, tumour boards (multidisciplinary discussions) refer often to a low number of patients. Overall complexity of patients needs is hardly considered. METHODS: A mixed method pilot study with data triangulation of professionals interviews and an independently structured evaluation of complexity of referred patients, before and after the intervention, using the PALCOM instrument. We trained four teams of professionals to deliver first-level palliation and to refer patients with complex needs detected in multidisciplinary discussions. A multicomponent, first level PC educational intervention, including information technologys adaptation, a training course, and bedside training was offered from the specialized PC Services, to all the HPs involved in multidisciplinary pancreas, lung, ovarian, and liver tumour boards. RESULTS: While the level of complexity of referred patients did not increase, trainees seemed to develop a better understanding of palliative care and a higher sensitivity to palliative needs. The number of referred patients increased, but patients complexity did not. Qualitative data showed that professionals seemed to be more aware of the complexity of PC needs. A meaning shift was perceived, specifically on the referral process (e.g., when and for what referring to specialist PC) and on the teams increased focus on patients needs. The training, positively received, was adapted to trainees needs and observations that led also to organizational modifications. CONCLUSIONS: Our multicomponent intervention positively impacted the number of referrals but not the patients complexity (measured with the PALCOM instrument). Hospital staff does not easily recognize that patients may have PC needs significantly earlier than at the end of life.

Methods: All consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and requiring oxygen support admitted in our ICU unit of University Hospital of Guadeloupe were prospectively included. Patients were treated during the first wave with a combination of Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin and during the second wave with dexamethasone and reinforced anticoagulation. Results: In our cohort, 187 patients were included, 31 during the first one and 156 during the second. Patients were mostly male (69%) with a median age of 64years old. Patients tend to be younger during the second wave and body mass index was higher (respectively 31 vs 27kg/m2, p=0.01). Overall mortality at Day 60 was high (45%) and not different between the two waves.

HCC is generally diagnosed at an advanced stage, and most new cases are in people aged over 70 years with age-related comorbidities. Treatment options are often limited, with most patients receiving palliative treatment or supportive care only. As a consequence, maintaining quality of life (QoL) through symptom management is critically important and is a core objective of clinical care. Strong evidence supports the efficacy of supervised exercise training for addressing certain cancer-related symptoms, including QoL, physical function, and fatigue. However, there are many barriers to implementing supervised exercise programmes within cancer care pathways, including economic pressures on healthcare systems and personal barriers for patients. Recent advances in technology allow patients to exercise at home under the virtual supervision of an exercise professional through videoconferencing software (termed telehealth exercise). Despite its potential, there are uncertainties relating to the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of telehealth exercise in people living with HCC. METHODS: This is a protocol for a prospective, single-centre, single-arm, pretest-posttest feasibility trial. We aim to recruit 20 patients aged 60 years or older who have received treatment for HCC and are undergoing routine clinical monitoring. Patients will be invited to take part in two online, home-based, group exercise sessions per week for 10 consecutive weeks. The virtual exercise sessions will be delivered in real time by an exercise professional through videoconferencing software. Each session will comprise 30 min of aerobic and resistance exercise performed at a moderate intensity, as guided by the 10-point Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment, retention, adherence, intervention fidelity, and safety. Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed using a mixed-methods approach via monthly online surveys and an exit telephone interview. Physical function, accelerometry-measured physical activity, mid-upper arm circumference, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMS) will be assessed before and after the intervention to determine the feasibility of assessing outcome measures. Physical function outcomes include the short physical performance battery and Liver Frailty Index. PROMS include the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire, Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. DISCUSSION: This mixed-methods study will address uncertainties relating to the feasibility and acceptability of delivering live, online, home-based, group exercise sessions to patients with HCC. The findings will inform whether any modifications are required to refine and optimise the intervention, and the assessment of outcome measures will provide information on the likely size and variability of intervention effects. Collectively, the data generated will inform the design of a subsequent, adequately powered, randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the telehealth exercise intervention.

The study correspondingly tries to identify the behavioral changes of rubber farmer households and livelihoods. The study found that many rubber farmers are going to be hooked on loan from the community source. However, on the contrary, a large number of people become able to adjust and balance their lives in line with their financial aspects. The study found that, 93.6% farmers had decreasing incomes, while 47.7% had adequacy of household incomes, and 38.5% had economic dependency, e.g., borrowing money from the system outside. In contrast, to highlight the positive effects on the economy, the study found that most of the farmers (92.7%) saved money and considered more before spending during the pandemic.

These tests were directly booked following the referral after a nurse led triage. As per our colorectal straight to test protocol (STT) any patients over the age of 75 or unfit individuals will have a CT colonoscopy (virtual colonoscopy) instead of colonoscopy. CT trunk was used during COVID pandemic as the initial investigation when the aerosol generating procedures were stopped. CT trunks are also the initial investigation as per the STT protocol when patients are referred with suspected abdominal mass, weight loss or abdominal pain. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospective electronic data base of colorectal STT referrals from Feb 2020 to end of October 2020. RESULTS: Total no colorectal STT referrals -1524.

In 2018, the National Income Housing Coalition found that there is no state where a renter, working full-time at minimum wage can afford a two-bedroom apartment. Nationally, there is a shortage of more than four million affordable homes which in turn increases the price of all existing dwellings. This results in nearly 60% of renters nationwide unable to buy a home, with 70% of lowincome families severely cost-burdened, paying more than half their income on rent. Even as the economy continues to grow and the housing market rebounds from the 2008 recession, the population faces widening inequality. For many, an inability to comfortably pay for housing, stagnation of wages and increasing housing cost is making housing insecurity one of the hidden truths of the present real estate market. COVID-19 has made the situation more complicated by raising the cost of labor and materials, due to a scarcity of both, which makes affordable housing expensive to build and the attempt to follow a sustainable construction system of circular economy very complicated.

After fragmentation is completed and concretions are extracted, conventional irrigation with saline dissolves the polymer, which is then flushed out. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 68 subjects with a single stone in the proximal ureter and an indication for ureteroscopic lithotripsy were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multisite clinical study. Each subject was randomly assigned to the BackStop group (34) or the control group (34 with no antiretropulsion device). For subjects in the experimental group BackStop was dispensed into the ureter above the stone using a 3Fr or 5Fr catheter. Ureteroscopic lithotripsy was performed in all subjects using pneumatic or laser energy. Measured end points included the retropulsion rate, the need for subsequent procedures, the stone-free rate at followup, the occurrence of adverse events and ureteral occlusion, if any, and post-stone fragmentation and extraction. RESULTS Subjects randomized to the BackStop group experienced a statistically significant (p = 0.0002) lower rate of retropulsion (8.8%, 3 of 34) vs the control group (52.9%, 18/34).

The comparisons among the two groups were performed with proper statistical analysis methods. RESULTS: Two groups of patients were identified: ALI and COVID-19 infection with 23 patients and ALI without COVID-19 infection, with 49 patients. The overall mortality rate (OMR) was 20.8% (15 patients) in total cohort within the first 30 days. Covid-19 group had a higher OMR than non-Covid-19 group (30.4% versus 16.7%, p = 0.04).

RES development results in many effects, direct and indirect, linked to each other, societal, local and individual, i.e., multiple impacts of RES (MI RES). These effects need to be carefully assessed and evaluated to obtain the full picture of energy field transformation and its context, and enable further development of RES. Nevertheless, the MI RES concept is often presented misleadingly and its scope varies throughout the literature. This paper provides a literature overview of the methodologies of this concept and presents a new concept of MI RES, respecting the difference between effects resulting from the implementation of RES and ultimate multiple impacts. We have summarized the effects into four groups: economic, social, environmental, and technical, which all lead to group of ultimate multiple impacts. Finally, we provide the complex overview of all MI RES and present the framework, which is used to analyze the multiple impacts and effects of RES and to show how the RES development leads and contributes to these impacts and effects.

New daily positive cases (DPC) increased before the Olympic Games, and then decreased a few weeks after the Games. However, several cofactors influencing DPC exist; consequently, careful consideration is needed for future international events during an epidemic. METHODS: The impact of the Olympic Games on new DPC were evaluated in the Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi Prefectures using a well-trained and -evaluated long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In addition, we proposed a compensation method based on effective reproduction number (ERN) to assess the effect of the national holidays on the DPC. RESULTS: During the spread phase, the estimated DPC with LSTM was 30%C60% lower than that of the observed value, but was consistent with the compensated value of the ERN for the three prefectures. During the decay phase, the estimated DPC was consistent with the observed values. The timing of the decay coincided with achievement of a fully-vaccinated rate of 10%C15% of people aged <65 years. CONCLUSIONS: The up- and downsurge of the pandemic wave observed in July and September are likely attributable to high ERN during national holiday periods and to the vaccination effect, especially for people aged <65 years. The effect of national holidays in Tokyo was rather notable in Aichi and Osaka, which are distant from Tokyo. The effect of the Olympic Games on the spread and decay of the pandemic wave is neither dominant nor negligible due to the shifting of the national holiday dates to coincide with the Olympic Games.","output":"Did the Tokyo Olympic Games enhance the transmission of COVID-19?

We found that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) macrophage clusters FCN1+ and FCN1+SPP1+ predominant in severe COVID-19 were transcriptionally related to synovial tissue macrophage (STM) clusters CD48hiS100A12+ and CD48+SPP1+ that drive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovitis. BALF macrophage cluster FABP4+ predominant in healthy lung was transcriptionally related to STM cluster TREM2+ that governs resolution of synovitis in RA remission. Plasma concentrations of SPP1 and S100A12 (key products of macrophage clusters shared with active RA) were high in severe COVID-19 and predicted the need for Intensive Care Unit transfer, and they remained high in the post-COVID-19 stage. High plasma levels of SPP1 were unique to severe COVID-19 when compared with other causes of severe pneumonia, and IHC localized SPP1+ macrophages in the alveoli of COVID-19 lung. Investigation into SPP1 mechanisms of action revealed that it drives proinflammatory activation of CD14+ monocytes and development of PD-L1+ neutrophils, both hallmarks of severe COVID-19. In summary, COVID-19 pneumonitis appears driven by similar pathogenic myeloid cell pathways as those in RA, and their mediators such as SPP1 might be an upstream activator of the aberrant innate response in severe COVID-19 and predictive of disease trajectory including post-COVID-19 pathology.","output":"COVID-19 and RA share an SPP1 myeloid pathway that drives PD-L1+ neutrophils and CD14+ monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global mental health crisis, highlighting the need for a focus on community-wide mental health. Emotional CPR (eCPR) is a program and practice developed by persons with a lived experience of recovery from trauma or mental health challenges to train community members from diverse backgrounds to support others through mental health crises. eCPR trainers have found that eCPR may promote feelings of belonging by increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems. Thus, clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect would improve along with feelings of loneliness. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of eCPR. METHODS: We employed a pre-post design with 151 individuals, including peer support specialists, service users, clinicians, family members, and nonprofit leaders, who participated in virtual eCPR trainings between April 20, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Instruments were administered before and after training and included the Herth Hope Scale; Empowerment Scale; Flourishing Scale (perceived capacity to support individuals); Mindful Attention Awareness Scale; Active-Empathic Listening Scale (supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health challenges); Social Connectedness Scale (feelings of belonging and connection with others); Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; and University of California, Los Angeles 3-item Loneliness Scale (symptoms and emotions). The eCPR fidelity scale was used to determine the feasibility of delivering eCPR with fidelity. We conducted 2-tailed paired t tests to examine posttraining improvements related to each scale. Additionally, data were stratified to identify pre-post differences by role. RESULTS: Findings indicate that it is feasible for people with a lived experience of a mental health condition to develop a program and train people to deliver eCPR with fidelity. Statistically significant pre-post changes were found related to ones ability to identify emotions, support others in distress, communicate nonverbally, share emotions, and take care of oneself, as well as to ones feelings of social connectedness, self-perceived flourishing, and positive affect (P.05). Findings indicated promising evidence of pre-post improvements (not statistically significant) related to loneliness, empowerment, active-empathetic listening, mindfulness awareness, and hope. Nonprofit leaders and workers demonstrated the greatest improvements related to loneliness, social connectedness, empathic listening, and flourishing. Peer support specialists demonstrated the greatest improvements related to positive affect, and clinicians demonstrated the greatest improvements related to mindfulness awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Promising evidence indicates that eCPR, a peer-developed and peer-delivered program, may increase feelings of belonging while increasing supportive behaviors toward individuals with mental health problems and improving clinical outcomes related to positive and negative affect and feelings of loneliness.","output":"Feasibility and Preliminary Effectiveness of a Peer-Developed and Virtually Delivered Community Mental Health Training Program (Emotional CPR): Pre-Post Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite enormous strides in our field with respect to patient care, there has been surprisingly limited dialogue on how to train and educate the next generation of congenital cardiologists. This paper reviews the current status of training and evolving developments in medical education pertinent to congenital cardiology. The adoption of competency-based medical education has been lauded as a robust framework for contemporary medical education over the last two decades. However, inconsistencies in frameworks across different jurisdictions remain, and bridging gaps between competency frameworks and clinical practice has proved challenging. Entrustable professional activities have been proposed as a solution, but integration of such activities into busy clinical cardiology practices will present its own challenges. Consequently, this pivot towards a more structured approach to medical education necessitates the widespread availability of appropriately trained medical educationalists, a development that will better inform curriculum development, instructional design, and assessment. Differentiation between superficial and deep learning, the vital role of rich formative feedback and coaching, should guide our trainees to become self-regulated learners, capable of critical reasoning yet retaining an awareness of uncertainty and ambiguity. Furthermore, disruptive innovations such as \\"technology enhanced learning\\" may be leveraged to improve education, especially for trainees from low- and middle-income countries. Each of these initiatives will require resources, widespread advocacy and raised awareness, and publication of supporting data, and so it is especially gratifying that Cardiology in the Young has fostered a progressive approach, agreeing to publish one or two articles in each journal issue in this domain.","output":"Medical education and training within congenital cardiology: current global status and future directions in a post COVID-19 world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) defines a population of hematopoietic cells with one or more somatic mutations/copy number alterations that can expand with time and under positive clonal selection pressures.

The aims of this study were to describe patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital and intensive care, and to investigate predictors of outcome to characterize severe acute respiratory infection. METHODS: This observational cohort study used Canadian data from 32 selected hospitals included in a global multisite cohort between Jan. 24 and July 7, 2020. Adult and pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who received care in an intensive care unit (ICU) and a sampling of up to the first 60 patients receiving care on hospital wards were included. We performed descriptive analyses of characteristics, interventions and outcomes. The primary analyses examined in-hospital mortality, with secondary analyses of the length of hospital and ICU stay. RESULTS: Between January and July 2020, among 811 patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19, the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 53-75) years, 495 (61.0%) were men, 46 (5.7%) were health care workers, 9 (1.1%) were pregnant, 26 (3.2%) were younger than 18 years and 9 (1.1%) were younger than 5 years. The median time from symptom onset to hospital admission was 7 (IQR 3-10) days. The most common symptoms on admission were fever, shortness of breath, cough and malaise. Diabetes, hypertension and cardiac, kidney and respiratory disease were the most common comorbidities. Among all patients, 328 received care in an ICU, admitted a median of 0 (IQR 0-1) days after hospital admission. Critically ill patients received treatment with invasive mechanical ventilation (88.8%), renal replacement therapy (14.9%) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (4.0%); 26.2% died. Among those receiving mechanical ventilation, 31.2% died. Age was an influential predictor of mortality (odds ratio per additional year of life 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.09). INTERPRETATION: Patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 commonly had fever, respiratory symptoms and comorbid conditions. Increasing age was associated with the development of critical illness and death; however, most critically ill patients in Canada, including those requiring mechanical ventilation, survived and were discharged from hospital.","output":"Characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospital and intensive care in the first phase of the pandemic in Canada: a national cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE This study aims to compare percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT) and surgical tracheostomy's aerosol and droplet scattering by using a particle counter. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was carried out with 35 patients between October 2020 and June 2021. All personal protective equipment was provided to protect healthcare workers. Measurements were made in the 5 s period before the tracheal incision and the 5 s period after the tracheal incision. RESULTS The mean age of the 15 female and 20 male patients in this study was 68.88  13.48 years old (range: 33-95 years old). Patients were intubated for an average of 22 days. Particle amounts were found to be significantly higher at 5 m (p = 0.003) and 10 m (p = 0.012) during PCT. In surgical tracheostomy, there was no significant increase in the number of particles. When the particle measurement values of both methods were compared with each other, there was a significantly more particle scattering in PCT than in surgical tracheotomy at 0.3 m (p = 0.034), 5 m (p = 0.001), and 10 m (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION According to the data in our study, a surgical tracheotomy was not identified as an aerosol-generating procedure.

Apart from their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political decisions and intervention measures during an ongoing outbreak. However, reliably inferring the dynamics of ongoing outbreaks by connecting complex models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with specialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In an initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used as a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these parameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19 outbreak phase in Germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic estimates for important disease characteristics, such as generation time, fraction of undetected infections, likelihood of transmission before symptom onset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of real-world observations.","output":"OutbreakFlow: Model-based Bayesian inference of disease outbreak dynamics with invertible neural networks and its application to the COVID-19 pandemics in Germany (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: : The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a serious threat for the health of immunocompromised patients.

Phases of programme development included planning, stakeholder interviews and platform re-build, testing and iteration. SETTING: In Irkutsk, Siberia, HIV/TB coinfection prevalence is high relative to the rest of the Russian Federation. PARTICIPANTS: Pilot testing occurred for a cohort of 60 people with HIV and TB. RESULTS: Key steps emerged to ensure the mobile health-based programme could be operational and adequately adapted for the context, including platform language adaptation, optimisation of server management, iteration of platform features, and organisational practice integration. Pilot testing of the platform rebuild yielded favourable patient perceptions of usability and acceptability at 6 months (n=47 surveyed), with 18 of 20 items showing scores above 4 (on a scale from 1 to 5) on average. Development of this mobile health-based programme for integrated care of infections highlighted the importance of several considerations for tailoring these interventions contextually, including language adaptation and technological capacity, but also, importantly, contextualised patient preferences related to privacy and communication with peers and/or providers, existing regional capacity for care coordination of different comorbidities, and infection severity and treatment requirements. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrated that integration of care for TB and HIV can be well served by using multimodal mobile health-based programmes, which can enhance communication and streamline workflow between providers across multiple collaborating institutions and improve continuity between inpatient and outpatient care settings.

Objectives This study was carried out to determine the effects of different degrees of head-of-bed elevation (HOBE) on the respiratory pattern and drainage following thyroidectomy and to provide suggestions for evidence-based clinical practice. Methods The sample of this prospective, parallel arm, randomized controlled trial included 114 patients undergoing thyroidectomy in a university hospital in Turkey. The patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to supine 0 (baseline), 30 and 45 HOBE groups. Respiratory pattern including respiratory rate (RR), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and dyspnea, and drainage including amount of drainage and hematoma formation were evaluated at the 1rd, 2rd, 3rd and 4th hours following thyroidectomy. Results The majority of the patients (83.3%) were female and 84.2% had undergone total thyroidectomy. The mean RR (18.47, 95% CI=17.85-19.09) of the patients in the supine 30 HOBE group at the 1rd hour was significantly higher than that of the patients in the supine 0 group (17.32, 95% CI=16.88-17.76; p<0.05). There was no significant difference between the SpO2 values of the patients in the groups (p>0.05). The amount of drainage was significantly higher in the supine 0 group at the 2nd hour than that of the patients in the supine 45 HOBE group (5.925.18; 3.345.56 respectively; p<0.05). None of the patients in the groups had hematoma formation. While no patient in the supine 30 HOBE group had dyspnea, dyspnea occurred in 9 patients in the supine 0 group and in 3 patients in the supine 45 HOBE group. Conclusion This study showed that different HOBE positions resulted in clinically insignificant changes on the RR and amount of drainage during the first 4 hours following thyroidectomy but did not affect SpO2 value.","output":"The effects of different degrees of head-of-bed elevation on the respiratory pattern and drainage following thyroidectomy: a randomized controlled trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Previous data indicate that children might play a less crucial role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission than initially assumed. We conducted a study to gain further knowledge on prevalence, transmission and spread of SARS-CoV-2 among preschool children, their parents and caretakers.

Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was assessed up to 4 times during the study period in all participating adults and personal characteristics as well as epidemiological information of personal SARS-CoV-2 history were obtained. Stool viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 was analyzed every 2-4 weeks in all participating children. Results 318 children, 299 parents and 233 childcare workers were enrolled. By January 2021 11% of the participating adults were detected seropositive, whereas the rate of SARS-CoV-2 positive children was 6.8%. Overall, we detected 17 children with SARS-Cov-2 viral shedding in 8 different childcare facilities. In 4 institutions there occurred a maximum of three connected cases in children. About 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children could not be connected to a secondary case within our study population. Conclusion This study could not provide evidence for a relevant asymptomatic (silent) spread of SARS-CoV-2 in childcare facilities, neither in a low nor a high prevalence setting.

Several studies demonstrated improved recanalization and clinical outcomes with the stent retriever devices compared with the Merci device. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of the balloon guide catheter (BGC) and recanalization success in a substudy of the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. METHODS The investigator-initiated NASA registry recruited 24 clinical sites within North America to submit demographic, clinical, site-adjudicated angiographic, and clinical outcome data on consecutive patients treated with the Solitaire Flow Restoration device. BGC use was at the discretion of the treating physicians. RESULTS There were 354 patients included in the NASA registry. BGC data were reported in 338 of 354 patients in this subanalysis, of which 149 (44%) had placement of a BGC. Mean age was 67.315.2 years, and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 18. Patients with BGC had more hypertension (82.4% versus 72.5%; P=0.05), atrial fibrillation (50.3% versus 32.8%; P=0.001), and were more commonly administered tissue plasminogen activator (51.6% versus 38.8%; P=0.02) compared with patients without BGC. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture and number of passes were similar between the 2 groups. Procedure time was shorter in patients with BGC (12028.5 versus 16135.6 minutes; P=0.02), and less adjunctive therapy was used in patients with BGC (20% versus 28.6%; P=0.05). Thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 3 reperfusion scores were higher in patients with BGC (53.7% versus 32.5%; P<0.001). Distal emboli and emboli in new territory were similar between the 2 groups. Discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (mean, 1214.5 versus 17.516; P=0.002) and good clinical outcome at 3 months were superior in patients with BGC compared with patients without (51.6% versus 35.8%; P=0.02). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the use of BGC was an independent predictor of good clinical outcome (odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9).

Research works on lncRNA-disease relations will benefit to further understand the pathogenesis of human complex diseases at the molecular level, but only a small proportion of lncRNA-disease associations has been confirmed. Considering the high cost of biological experiments, exploring potential lncRNA-disease associations with computational approaches has become very urgent. In this study, a model based on closest node weight graph of the spatial neighborhood (CNWGSN) and edge attention graph convolutional network (EAGCN), LDA-EAGCN, was developed to uncover potential lncRNA-disease associations by integrating disease semantic similarity, lncRNA functional similarity, and known lncRNA-disease associations. Inspired by the great success of the EAGCN method on the chemical molecule property recognition problem, the prediction of lncRNA-disease associations could be regarded as a component recognition problem of lncRNA-disease characteristic graphs. The CNWGSN features of lncRNA-disease associations combined with known lncRNA-disease associations were introduced to train EAGCN, and correlation scores of input data were predicted with EAGCN for judging whether the input lncRNAs would be associated with the input diseases. LDA-EAGCN achieved a reliable AUC value of 0.9853 in the ten-fold cross-over experiments, which was the highest among five state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, case studies of renal cancer, laryngeal carcinoma, and liver cancer were implemented, and most of the top-ranking lncRNA-disease associations have been proven by recently published experimental literature works.

Cape Town was the SA metropole most affected in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Early observational data from Africa may provide valuable insight into what can be expected as the pandemic expands across the continent. OBJECTIVES To describe the prevalence, clinical features, comorbidities and outcome of an early cohort of HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients admitted with COVID-19. METHODS This was a descriptive observational study of an early cohort of adults with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted from 25 March to 11 May 2020. RESULTS Of 116 patients (mean age 48 years, 61% female) admitted, 24 were HIV-positive (21%). The most common symptoms reported were cough (n=88; 73%), shortness of breath (n=78; 69%), fever (n=67; 59%), myalgia (n=29; 25%) and chest pain (n=22; 20%). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (n=46; 41%), diabetes mellitus (n=43; 38%), obesity (n=32; 28%) and HIV (n=24; 21%). Mortality was associated with older age (mean (standard deviation) 55 (12) years v. 46 (14) years; p<0.01); the presence of hypertension or hypertension along with diabetes and/or obesity; lower partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio; and higher urea level, white cell count, neutrophil count, and C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, and high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio. The overall survival rate for all hospital admissions was 86/116 (73%). In this early cohort, survival was similar in patients with HIV (n=18; 75%) compared with those without HIV (n=67; 75%) (p=1). Of the 74 patients admitted to the wards, 63 (85%) survived, whereas 22 of 42 (52%) admitted to the intensive care unit survived.

Now that more whole genome data have become available, we used the bioinformatics tool SCREENED and a total of 4755 publicly available SARS-CoV-2 genomes, downloaded at two different time points, to evaluate the specificity of 12 RT-qPCR tests (consisting of a total of 30 primers and probe sets) used for SARS-CoV-2 detection and the impact of the virus genetic evolution on four of them. The exclusivity of these methods was also assessed using the human reference genome and 2624 closely related other respiratory viral genomes.

In this report, we describe the case of a 71-year-old woman who had undergone splenectomy 35 years ago. She came to our emergency department complaining of back pain, myalgia, asthenia, and a fever of 40.2oC. No other symptoms were noted upon her admission. Blood workup revealed hyperlacticaemia, increased C-reactive protein, and lymphopenia. A urinalysis and chest radiography were ordered, with no abnormal findings, and the SARS-CoV-2 test was negative. The patient developed persistent hypotension and drowsiness that did not improve with intravenous fluids. Therefore, she was started on a norepinephrine infusion. Cultures were collected, and intravenous antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 2.2 mg and azithromycin 500 mg. Besides all the diagnostic tests, no infectious cause was found. On the second day of hospitalization, she started to deteriorate, and antibiotic therapy was escalated to piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g, resulting in a good clinical response. On the third day after admission, thanks to a group discussion, we were able to identify C. canimorsus in the patients blood cultures.

Results showed that changes in climate change concern significantly and positively affected waste management and choice of energy supplier which offers a greater share of energy from renewable sources and purchased of low-energy homes. Meanwhile, personal responsibility significantly and positively influenced switching energy suppliers but had a negative effect on home insulation. Furthermore, residents who performed high-cost behaviours (purchase of low-energy homes) also switched energy suppliers and insulated their homes. Therefore, the results indicated that the benefit and cost of behaviour (time, money) are very important aspects to promote climate-friendly behaviour.

Little is known about the comprehensive obstetric clinical trial landscape, how it compares to other fields, or factors associated with the successful completion of obstetric trials. Objectives To characterize obstetric clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the primary objective of identifying features associated with early discontinuation and results reporting. Study Design This is a cross-sectional study with descriptive, logistic regression and cox regression analyses of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Our primary exposure variables were trial focus (obstetric or non-obstetric) and trial funding (industry, United States government or academic). We conducted additional exploratory analyses of other trial features including design, enrollment, and therapeutic focus. We examined the associations of exposure variables and other trial features with two primary outcomes: early discontinuation and results reporting. Results We downloaded data for all studies (n=332,417) registered on ClinicalTrials.gov from October 1, 2007 to March 9, 2020 from the Aggregate Analysis of the ClinicalTrials.gov database. We excluded studies with a non-interventional design (n=63,697) and those registered before October 1, 2007 (n=45,209). 4,276 (1.9%) obstetric trials (i.e. interventional studies), and 219,235 (98.1%) non-obstetric trials were compared. Among all trials, 2.8% of academic-funded trials, 1.9% of United States government-funded trials, and 0.4% of industry-funded trials focused on obstetrics. The quantity of obstetric trials increased over time (10.8% annual growth rate). Compared to non-obstetric trials, obstetric trials had a greater risk of early discontinuation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval: 1.21 to 1.62, p<0.0001) and similar odds of results reporting (adjusted odds ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.72 to 1.10, p=0.19). Among obstetric trials funders after controlling for confounding variables, United States government-funded trials were at lowest risk of early discontinuation (US government adjusted hazard ratio 0.23, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.69, p=0.009, industry reference; academic adjusted hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.74, p=0.88).

Building upon racial formation theory, this article examines three examples: the Native American boarding school system (1870s to 1970s), eugenic laws and practices (early/mid 1900s), and contemporary deportation. Analysis reveals that state-sponsored limitations on family privacy is a racial project that shapes the racial state. Performing an ideological genealogy with our cases, this article makes three contributions: it illustrates how the state leverages policies affecting families to define national belonging; it reveals how access to family privacy is patterned by race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexuality, and national origin; and it distills how Whiteness and a national racial hierarchy are socially constructed and maintained over time. With the racialization of privacy, we identify how the state seeks to reproduce institutionalized White supremacy and the effects this has on families.

Pre-existing disparities in healthcare may be intersecting with COVID-19 outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between county-level race/ethnic composition and COVID-19 mortality in the state of Texas and determine whether county-level health factors, healthcare access measures, and other demographic characteristics explain this relationship. METHODS: This retrospective study uses county-level case and fatality data obtained from the Texas Department of State Health Services and merged with the 2020 Robert Wood Johnson foundation (RWJF) county health rankings data. The outcome variables were fatalities per 100,000 population. A two-part/hurdle model examined (1) the probability of having a COVID-19 fatality and (2) fatalities per 100,000 population in counties with 1+ fatalities. For both parts of the hurdle model, we examined the impacts of racial and ethnic composition, adjusting for county characteristics and health factors. RESULTS: The odds of having a COVID-19 fatality decreased with a unit increase in the rate of primary care physicians in a county (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89, 0.99). In the second part of the model, there was a statistically significant increase in COVID-19 fatalities/100,000 population with every 1 % increase in the proportion of Hispanics (? = 5.41; p = 0.03) and African Americans (? = 5.08; p value = 0.04).

This study examined associations between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, fear of infection, and protection self-efficacy. METHODS: Adults either residing, having employment, or receiving health care in Arkansas (n = 754) participated in an online survey between October 30, 2020 and January 16, 2021. Participants were recruited in both rural and urban areas from 6 Arkansas primary care clinics. Survey questions addressed sociodemographic factors, COVID-19 infection fear, protection self-efficacy, and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess associations between dependent variables and respondents sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 infection fear, and COVID-19 protection self-efficacy. RESULTS: About 38% of participants reported COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Age, sex, race, and education were significantly associated with COVID-19 and general vaccine attitudes. Odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy decreased as age increased (OR = 0.98; P < .01). Women had higher odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy than men (OR = 1.52; P < .05). Respondents with a high school diploma and below and respondents with some college or a technical degree had greater odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (OR = 2.58; P < .001; and OR = 1.97; P < .01, respectively) compared to respondents with a 4-year college degree. Black/African American respondents had greater odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to White respondents (OR = 3.08; P < .001). No significant difference was observed among rural and urban respondents regarding COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; however, respondents in rural areas were more likely to report low general vaccine trust compared to those in urban areas (OR = 1.87; P < .01). Respondents reporting no fear (OR = 5.51; P < .001) and very little fear (OR = 1.95; P < .05) of COVID-19 had greater odds of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to respondents who feared COVID-19 infection to a great extent. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and general trust in vaccines differ significantly among age, sex, race, and education. These trust and hesitancy patterns are challenges for achieving population immunity and follow similar patterns of vulnerability to COVID-19. Vaccination programs and interventions must consider these differences in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and general vaccine trust to alleviate COVID-19 disparities.

MATERIAL AND METHODS A veneer and a crown preparation were performed on a central incisor and a second molar of a dental model, respectively, scanned with an intraoral scanner, and the .stl files were exported to an LCD-based SLA three-dimensional (3D)-Printer. Twenty-four preparations were 3D-printed for each veneer and crown and divided into four groups (n = 6/group): (a) Acrylic resin (Acrlico Marche); (b) Bisacrylic resin (Protemp 4); (c) PMMA computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) (Vipiblock); and (d) 3D-printed resin for provisional restorations (Raydent C&B for temporary crown and bridge). Veneers and crowns restorations were performed and cemented with a flowable composite. Each specimen was scanned with a CT apparatus, files were imported for data analysis, and cement film thickness was quantitatively measured. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests ( = .05). RESULTS Crowns presented a thicker cementation film than veneers (P < .05).The bisacrylic resin showed the smallest veneer film thickness, similar to the acrylic resin (P = .151), which was not significantly different than the PMMA CAD/CAM material (P = .153). The 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker film, different than all other materials (P < .05). The bisacrylic resin showed a cement film thickness with a high number of voids in its surface. For crowns cementation, the 3D printed provisional material showed the thicker cementation film, different than all other materials (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Different provisional materials present different film thicknesses. The 3D printed provisional material showed the highest veneer and crown film thicknesses. Veneers film thicknesses were smaller than crowns for all provisional materials. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The 3D printed provisional material studied can be satisfactorily used, presenting appropriate adaptation with the tooth preparation, however, it shows the highest cement film thickness for both veneers and crowns cementations when compared with other provisional materials. A better internal fit, or smaller cement film thickness is obtained by CAD/CAM materials, acrylic and bisacrylic resins.

The virus, SARS-CoV, differs from the previously described human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43. 229E was previously shown to productively infect human monocytes/macrophages, whereas OC43 poorly infected the cells. In this study, we examined whether SARS-CoV could productively infect purified monocytes/macrophages (PM) derived from human donor cells. Unlike 229E-infected cells, which produced viral titers of 10(3.5) to 10(6) TCID(50)/ml, SARS-CoV replicated poorly in PM, producing titers of 10(1.75) to 10(2) TCID(50)/ml. This finding was similar to results reported for OC43-infected cells, with titers ranging from 10(1.2) to 10(2.7) TCID(50)/ml. Of interest, SARS-CoV proteins were detected only in PM that did not produce significant amounts of interferon (IFN)-, and in one such case, preliminary electron microscope studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-like particles could enter the cells, possibly via phagocytosis. These results suggest that SARS-CoV, like human CoV OC43, poorly infects human PM, and production of IFN- by these cells further limits the infection.

AIMS: To evaluate airborne contamination levels within intensive care unit (ICU) isolation rooms over 10C24-h periods in order to improve understanding of the variability of environmental aerial bioburden, and the extent to which ward activities may contribute. METHODS: Environmental air monitoring was conducted within occupied and vacant inpatient isolation rooms. A sieve impactor sampler was used to collect 500-L air samples every 15 min over 10-h (08:00C18:00 h) and 24-h (08:00C08:00 h) periods. Samples were collected, room activity was logged, and bacterial contamination levels were recorded as colony-forming units (cfu)/m(3) air. FINDINGS: A high degree of variability in levels of airborne contamination was observed across all scenarios in the studied isolation rooms. Air bioburden increased as room occupancy increased, with air contamination levels highest in rooms occupied for the longest time during the study (10 days) (mean 104.4 cfu/m(3), range 12C510 cfu/m(3)). Counts were lowest in unoccupied rooms (mean 20 cfu/m(3)) and during the night. CONCLUSION: Peaks in airborne contamination were directly associated with an increase in activity levels.

Domain-general brain networks play an important role in stroke recovery and characterizing their residual function with functional MRI has the potential to yield biomarkers capable of guiding patient-specific rehabilitation. However, this is challenging as such detailed characterization requires testing patients on multitudes of cognitive tasks in the scanner, rendering experimental sessions unfeasibly lengthy. Thus, the current status quo in clinical neuroimaging research involves testing patients on a very limited number of tasks, in the hope that it will reveal a useful neuroimaging biomarker for the whole cohort. Given the great heterogeneity among stroke patients and the volume of possible tasks this approach is unsustainable. Advancing task-based functional MRI biomarker discovery requires a paradigm shift in order to be able to swiftly characterize residual network activity in individual patients using a diverse range of cognitive tasks. Here, we overcome this problem by leveraging neuroadaptive Bayesian optimization, an approach combining real-time functional MRI with machine-learning, by intelligently searching across many tasks, this approach rapidly maps out patient-specific profiles of residual domain-general network function. We used this technique in a cross-sectional study with 11 left-hemispheric stroke patients with chronic aphasia (four female, age  standard deviation: 59  10.9 years) and 14 healthy, age-matched control subjects (eight female, age  standard deviation: 55.6  6.8 years). To assess intra-subject reliability of the functional profiles obtained, we conducted two independent runs per subject, for which the algorithm was entirely reinitialized. Our results demonstrate that this technique is both feasible and robust, yielding reliable patient-specific functional profiles. Moreover, we show that group-level results are not representative of patient-specific results. Whereas controls have highly similar profiles, patients show idiosyncratic profiles of network abnormalities that are associated with behavioural performance. In summary, our study highlights the importance of moving beyond traditional one-size-fits-all approaches where patients are treated as one group and single tasks are used. Our approach can be extended to diverse brain networks and combined with brain stimulation or other therapeutics, thereby opening new avenues for precision medicine targeting a diverse range of neurological and psychiatric conditions.","output":"A Bayesian optimization approach for rapidly mapping residual network function in stroke"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background England, UK has experienced a large outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: : In a first preliminary phase, we investigated 16 IgG, IgM, IgA and pan Ig serological ELISA using a panel of 180 sera, comprising 97 sera from patients with a positive RT-PCR, and 83 negative sera sampled before November 1, 2019. In a second phase and to complete the evaluation on the full panel (100 positive and 300 negative), tests that passed pre-defined exclusion criteria of 90% sensitivity and 97% specificity were further evaluated on 220 additional sera chosen to assess possible cross-reactivity with other human viral infections. RESULTS: : Among the 16 tests evaluated in the preliminary phase, two were excluded due to insufficient sensitivity at 15 days post-symptom onset and one was excluded due to poor specificity. Of the 13 tests evaluated using the full panel comprised of a diverse pool of sera including those reactive against known respiratory viruses, no systematic cross-reactivity was observed. However, heterogeneities across tests were found. Consistent with kinetics of antibody expression, maximal sensitivity was found two weeks post-symptom onset. CONCLUSION: : In this independent evaluation, we compared the performance of 16 SARS-CoV-2 serological tests using the same well-characterized samples and found 13 tests with more than 90% sensitivity at 15 days post-symptom onset and 97% specificity across a diverse range of negative samples.","output":"Evaluation of sixteen ELISA SARS-CoV-2 serological tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the widespread vaccination program for COVID-19 carried out in Israel, a survey was conducted to preliminarily assess behavior changes in the vaccinated population, prior to the expected upcoming policy change as to mask wearing and social distancing regulation in Israel. 200 people answered at least one question pertaining to preventive behaviour. Among the respondents, 21.1% reported a decrease in mask wearing compared to 47.3% who reported a decrease in social distancing. There was no difference in these measures between the sexes. However, people under the age of 50 were more likely to decrease mask wearing (28.1%) and decrease social distancing (56.1%), as compared with people over the age of 50 (17.2% and 41.8%, respectively). Among health care workers, there was a minimal decrease in mask wearing (1/23 people) compared to a more widespread decrease in social distancing (10/23). These data suggest that preventive attitudes change following COVID-19 vaccination, with less adherence to social distancing as compared to mask wearing, and should be taken into account when planning public policy in the future.","output":"Survey of Behaviour Attitudes Towards Preventive Measures Following COVID-19 Vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Blocking glioma cell invasion has been challenging due to cancer cells that can swiftly switch their migration mode, and agents that can block more than one migration mode are sought after. We found that small molecule 2-(1H-indole-3-carbonyl)-thiazole-4-carboxylic acid methyl ester (ITE), an endogenous aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist, can block more than one mode of glioma cell migration, based on cultured cell behavior captured by videos. Data from wound-healing assays and mouse xenograft glioma models corroborated ITE's migration-inhibiting effects while knocking down AHR by siRNA abolished these effects. To identify genes that mediated ITE-AHR's effect, we first collected gene expression changes upon ITE treatment by RNA-seq, then compared them against literature reported migration-related genes in glioma and that were potentially regulated by AHR. MYH9, a component of nonmuscle myosin IIA (NMIIA), was confirmed to be reduced by ITE treatment. When MYH9 was overexpressed in the glioma cells, a good correlation was observed between the expression level and the cell migration ability, determined by wound-healing assay. Correspondingly, overexpression of MYH9 abrogated ITE's migration-inhibiting effects, indicating that ITE-AHR inhibited cell migration via inhibiting MYH9 expression. MYH9 is essential for cell migration in 3D confined space and not a discovered target of AHR; the fact that ITE affects MYH9 via AHR opens a new research and development avenue.","output":"1'H-Indole-3'-Carbonyl-Thiazole-4-Carboxylic Acid Methyl Ester Blocked Human Glioma Cell Invasion via Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor's Regulation of Cytoskeletal Contraction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study explores the concept of social connectedness for adults with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), generally and during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, to help inform contemporary CF healthcare. Social connectedness is an essential component of belonging and refers to an individuals sense of closeness with the social world. Unique disease factors make exploration of social connectedness pertinent, added to by COVID-19, with the CF population potentially facing increased risk for severe illness. METHODS: Seventeen adults with CF in Western Australia undertook interviews, with findings categorized as overarching themes. RESULTS: In a general sense, participants described social connectedness challenges caused by CF, despite which they reported meaningful connections that benefits their mental and physical health. Within a COVID-19 specific context, participants demonstrated resilience in the face of adversity, highlighted the importance of empathy in relation to the pandemic, and described how social support is both an outcome and enhancer of social connectedness.

It seems that it started in China and has widely spread in almost all countries in the world. This pandemic situation is one of the widely spread diseases in recent history. However, there was an influenza pandemic in 1918 with the exact number of deaths still unknown. Some believe that the death toll would have been about 50C100 million people. At the time of writing this article, COVID-19 has infected 5,306,928 persons worldwide (when the article was finalised for publication, the number has increased up to 15,947,291). The article is aimed at analysing the positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 in a sociological perspective. It is further focused on possible challenges to the supply chain in South Asia. South Asian countries are highly influenced by the pandemic situation, and the regional representation is about 4% in the later part of May 2020 with an increasing tendency. Also, the article has a proposal for the control of the disease as well as the entire socio-economic, environmental and political atmosphere in a country, whilst particularly giving more weight to South Asia. The proposed actions are analysed in short-term, mid-term and long-term basis, and any expert and social worker who is involved in the pandemic control process can gain an insight into what to do and how to perform their tasks. A sociological analysis on COVID-19 is very important because there is a wing comprising dominant medical experts in the control and management of the disease. The article emphasises the importance of a sociological analysis in a pandemic situation. Naturally, anyone would think of a pandemic situation in very negative terms due to its emotional, socio-economic, environmental, political and cultural factors.

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation. SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary-care referral center. PATIENTS: Operating room staff with positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. METHODS: Epidemiologic and environmental investigations were conducted including contact tracing, environmental surveys, and sampling and review of the operating room schedule for staff-to-staff, staff-to-patient, and patient-to-staff SARS-CoV-2 transmission. RESULTS: In total, 24 healthcare personnel (HCP) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including nurses (29%), surgical technologists (25%), and surgical residents (16%). Moreover, 19 HCP (79%) reported having used a communal area, most commonly break rooms (75%). Overall, 20 HCP (83%) reported symptomatic disease. In total, 72 environmental samples were collected from communal areas for SARS-CoV-2 genomic testing; none was positive. Furthermore, 236 surgical cases were reviewed for transmission: 213 (90%) had negative preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing, 21 (9%) had a positive test on or before the date of surgery, and 2 (<1%) did not have a preoperative test performed. In addition, 40 patients underwent postoperative testing (mean, 13 days to postoperative testing), and 2 returned positive results. Neither of these 2 cases was linked to our outbreak.

The cohort was divided into those with versus without CS and logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of CS and mortality in patients admitted with TS. A total of 260,144 patients with TS were included in our study, of whom 14703 (6%) were diagnosed with cardiogenic shock (CS). In-hospital mortality among patients with CS was approximately 6-fold higher compared to those without CS (23% vs 4%, P <0.01). TS patients with CS had a higher incidence of malignant arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (15.0% vs 4%, P <0.01) and non-shockable cardiac arrests (12% vs 2%, P <0.01). Independent predictors of CS were male gender, Asian and Hispanic ethnicity, increased burden of comorbidities including congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and chronic diabetes. Independent predictors of mortality were male gender, advanced age, history of congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic liver disease.

The relative frequency of these complications and their impact on clinical outcomes have not been described, and no randomized trials exist to guide anticoagulation strategies in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Our objective was to examine the relative frequencies of bleeding and thromboembolic events and their associations with survival among a cohort of consecutive patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A single academic medical center. PATIENTS: Adult patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and anticoagulation. Eligibility criteria for this analysis were selected to emulate the population that would be recruited for a randomized trial of anticoagulation strategies during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Patients were excluded if they had active bleeding or thromboembolism prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation, a history of trauma or surgery in the 7 days prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation, an arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannula, or if they received greater than 48 hours of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support at another institution INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcomes included bleeding and thromboembolic events, duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital survival among 55 patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Bleeding events occurred in 25 patients (45.5%), and thromboembolism occurred in eight patients (14.5%). Bleeding events were associated with longer duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support (p = 0.007) and worse in-hospital survival (p = 0.02). Thromboembolic events did not appear to be associated with clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and anticoagulation, bleeding occurred more frequently than thromboembolism and was associated with worse survival.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed of inpatients hospitalized during the pandemic who had mobile telemetry devices placed; patients were studied up until the time of discharge or death. The primary outcome was a composite of management changes based on data obtained from the system and detection of new arrhythmias. Other clinical outcomes and performance characteristics of the mobile telemetry system were studied. RESULTS: 82 patients underwent mobile telemetry device placement, of which 31 (37.8%) met the primary outcome, which consisted of 24 (29.3%) with new arrhythmias detected and 18 (22.2%) with management changes. 21 patients (25.6%) died during the study, but none from primary arrhythmias.

METHODS Twenty-two out of 27 consecutive patients with PSS received PMT using the Trellis-8 peripheral infusion system (Covidien) between 2010 and 2014. Subsequent surgery was performed in 18 of those patients, 9 patients were treated with thoracoscopic, 7 patients with subclavicular, and 2 patients with transaxillary first rib resection, 4 patients were treated with PMT and anticoagulation alone. Technical success, complications, and patency were registered. RESULTS PMT was successful in 21 (95 %) patients; 1 patient with unsatisfactory lysis received further catheter-directed thrombolysis, which, however, did not improve the result. The mean endovascular procedure time was 105  33 min (range 70-200 min), and the required median amount of thrombolytic agent was 500,000 international unit (IU; range 250,000-1,000,000 IU).

Dispositional joy holds some promise as such a trait that could be especially important for well-being during the current pandemic and its consequences. The concept of the Joyful Life may operate as bridge between positive psychology and humanistic, existential, and spiritual views of the good life, by integrating hedonic, prudential, eudaimonic and chaironic visions of the good life. Previous phenomenological research on state joy suggests that momentary states of joy may have features that overlap with happiness but go beyond mere hedonic interests, and point to the experience of a life oriented toward virtue and a sense of the transcendent or the sacred. However, qualitative research on the Joyful Life, or dispositional joy, is sorely lacking. This study utilized a dialogical phenomenological analysis to conduct a group-based analysis of 17 volunteer students, who produced 51 autobiographical narrative descriptions of the joyful life. The dialogical analyses were assisted by integration of the Imagery in Movement Method, which incorporated expressive drawing and psychodrama as an aid to explicate implicit themes in the experiences of the participants. The analyses yielded ten invariant themes found across the autobiographical narrative descriptions: Being broken, being grounded, being centered, breaking open, being uplifted, being supertemporal, being open to the mystery, being grateful, opening up and out, and being together. The descriptions of a Joyful Life were consistent with a meaning orientation to happiness, due to their emphasis on the cultivation of virtue in the service of a higher calling, the realization of which was felt to be a gift or blessing. The discussion examines implications for future research, including the current relevance of a joyful disposition during a global pandemic. Due to the joyful dispositions tendency to transform suffering and tragedy into meaning, and its theme of an orientation to prosocial motivations, the Joyful Life may occupy a central place in the study of resiliency and personal growth in response to personal and collective trauma such as COVID-19.","output":"The Joyful Life: An Existential-Humanistic Approach to Positive Psychology in the Time of a Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been spreading since December 2019 and still no proven treatment or vaccination has been discovered.

Thus, the aim of this study was to construct indices for the assessment of crash rates and mobility patterns among young Colombians who live in the central region of the country. The specific objectives were developing SES, health and lifestyle indices, and assessing the self-reported RTCs and mobility features depending on these indices. A sample of 561 subjects participated in this cross-sectional study. Through a reduction approach of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), three indices were constructed. Mean and frequency differences were contrasted for the self-reported mobility, crash rates, age, and gender. As a result, SES, health and lifestyle indices explained between 56.3C67.9% of the total variance. Drivers and pedestrians who suffered crashes had higher SES. A healthier lifestyle is associated with cycling, but also with suffering more bike crashes; drivers and those reporting traffic crashes have shown greater psychosocial and lifestyle-related risk factors. Regarding gender differences, men are more likely to engage in road activities, as well as to suffer more RTCs. On the other hand, women present lower healthy lifestyle-related indices and a less active implication in mobility. Protective factors such as a high SES and a healthier lifestyle are associated with RTCs suffered by young Colombian road users. Given the differences found in this regard, a gender perspective for understanding RTCs and mobility is highly suggestible, considering that socio-economic gaps seem to differentially affect mobility and crash-related patterns.","output":"Socioeconomic Status, Health and Lifestyle Settings as Psychosocial Risk Factors for Road Crashes in Young People: Assessing the Colombian Case"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic, and it is increasingly important that physicians recognize and understand its atypical presentations.

Currently, the methods used to diagnose COVID-19 have several limitations, thus new techniques need to be investigated to improve the diagnosis and overcome these limitations. Taking into consideration the great benefits of electrocardiogram (ECG) applications, this paper proposes a new pipeline called ECG-BiCoNet to investigate the potential of using ECG data for diagnosing COVID-19. ECG-BiCoNet employs five deep learning models of distinct structural design. ECG-BiCoNet extracts two levels of features from two different layers of each deep learning technique. Features mined from higher layers are fused using discrete wavelet transform and then integrated with lower-layers features. Afterward, a feature selection approach is utilized. Finally, an ensemble classification system is built to merge predictions of three machine learning classifiers. ECG-BiCoNet accomplishes two classification categories, binary and multiclass. The results of ECG-BiCoNet present a promising COVID-19 performance with an accuracy of 98.8% and 91.73% for binary and multiclass classification categories. These results verify that ECG data may be used to diagnose COVID-19 which can help clinicians in the automatic diagnosis and overcome limitations of manual diagnosis.","output":"ECG-BiCoNet: An ECG-based pipeline for COVID-19 diagnosis using Bi-Layers of deep features integration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La bsqueda de tratamientos eficaces contra la pandemia actual por COVID-19 ha supuesto un desaf?o enorme para la comunidad cientfica.

Sustainable development is now a part of tourism strategies and visions, especially when it comes to the possible links between tourism and its impact on sustainable development. In addition, the ubiquitous digitalization has also made a significant impact on both. In this paper, we analyze the role of the sustainable tourism in the digital age using the example of the Burning Man festival, an annual event held in Nevada desert each year around Labour Day weekend with nearly sixty thousand people gathering to build a temporary city full of art, music, and interactivity. Our study is based on a unique own survey questionnaire administered at Burning Man festival in 2017. We use the travel cost method for computing the non-market valuation of demand from visiting Burning Man and show how digitalization helped the event to survive amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, this paper outlines the impact that the relationship between tourism, digitalization, and sustainable development can have on the economic growth and the institutional change. We argue that sustainable tourism can meet the needs of the current tourism industry (both domestic and international), while protecting the environment, promoting future opportunities, as well as taking into account the long-term impact of tourism on local communities and the local and international economy.","output":"Sustainable tourism in the digital age: Institutional and economic implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Memphis metropolitan statistical area (MSA) represents a Deep Southern U.S. city disproportionally affected by the ongoing transmission of new HIV cases as well as those diagnosed in late-stage disease. This region is a subset of nine states, including Memphis, Tennessee (project site), driving the epidemic in the United States. Memphis ranks 4th among all U.S. MSAs for new HIV infections and has been identified in the CDC's Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative as a high HIV burden geographic focus area. The Memphis Ryan White Part A Program conducted a pilot project among adults seeking services in Memphis emergency and transitional housing shelters to offer on-site, rapid HIV testing. In this paper we describe the results from this aforementioned pilot study, including the rate of HIV test acceptance and potential factors associated with a history of HIV testing in Memphis. Methods: Community-engaged research approaches were employed via a partnership between the local health department, a federally qualified faith-based health center, and an academic university. An interviewer-administered survey to measure potential factors associated with HIV testing history and voluntary HIV testing services were offered to adults living in transitional housing establishments. Bivariate chi-square analyses were performed to determine the association between predisposing, enabling, and need variables with HIV testing history in the past 12 months. Results: Survey respondents (n = 109) were mostly cisgender male (n = 96; 88.1%), African American (n = 79; 72.5%) and reported engaging in condomless sex in the past 12 months (n = 55; 50.5%). Acceptability and uptake of HIV testing was high (n = 97; 89.0%). Conclusions: Implementing rapid HIV testing programs outside of traditional health care settings is a strategy that can be used to engage high-risk individuals and those unaware of their HIV status to get tested.

There are a few case reports on nail findings after coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. We aimed to document the nail findings of the COVID-19 survivors and shed light on the interesting luminescence seen under the Wood's light. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection in the last 100 days were grouped in terms of the agents used in the treatment. Fifty-seven volunteers without a history of infection were included. RESULTS: Patients treated with favipiravir had a significantly higher positivity of luminescence (p: 0.0001). The most common nail findings in patients were splinter hemorrhage (13%), followed by leukonychia (12%) and longitudinal ridges (7.9%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: The luminescence may be seen due to the accumulation of favipiravir or its excipients (titanium dioxide and yellow ferric oxide) on the nails. Wood's lamp examination of the plasma taken from a patient after favipiravir's first dose revealed the same luminescence as we saw on the nails. Accordingly, this accumulation may be seen in the vital organs.

Possible irritant effects of ABHR may prevent their use by persons at risk of infection. METHODS: This systematic review is based on a PubMed search of articles published between January 2000 and September 2019 in English and German, and a manual search, related to the irritation potential of alcohol-based disinfectants restricted to n-propanol (1-propanol) and its structural isomer isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol, 2-propanol). RESULTS: The majority of the included studies show a low irritation potential of n-propanol alone. However, recent studies provide evidence for significant barrier damage effects of repeated exposure to 60% n-propanol in healthy, as well as atopic skin in vivo. The synergistic response of combined irritants, (ie, a combination of n-propanol or isopropanol with detergents such as sodium lauryl sulfate) is greater, compared with a quantitatively identical application of the same irritant alone. CONCLUSION: While recent studies indicate a higher risk of skin irritation for n-propanol and isopropanol than reported in the past, this risk still seems to be lower than that for frequent handwashing with detergents, as recommended by some to prevent COVID-19 infections.","output":"How irritant are n-propanol and isopropanol? - A systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Normal anion gap (non-gap) hyperchloremic acidosis with hypokalemia is a medical emergency.

For this purpose, an aggregated health production function is used allowing for spatial effects. The results indicate that an increase in the income level, health expenditure, trade openness, education attainment, or urbanisation might lead to an increase in life expectancy at birth, whereas calories intake or quantity of air pollutants have a negative impact on this health indicator. This implies that health policies should look beyond economic factors and focus also on social and environmental drivers. The results also indicate the existence of significant spillover effects, highlighting the need for coordinated European policies that account for the synergies between countries. Finally, a foresight analysis is conducted to obtain projections for 2030 under different socioeconomic pathways.

The study is to determine Mucin 5B (MUC5B) protein concentration and its proportion in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of CAP patients and evaluate its value to help assess disease severity. METHODS: A total of 118 patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study, including 45 with severe CAP (SCAP) and 73 with non-severe CAP (NSCAP). MUC5B concentration in BALF were determined by immunoblotting analysis. Total protein concentration of BALF was detected by Pierce BCA kit. Cytokines IL6, IL10, IFN, IL13, and IL17 in BALF were measured using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Spearmans correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the relationships between MUC5B concentration or MUC5B/total protein ratio and the CURB-65 score, as well as cytokines. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent factors associated with severe CAP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the assessment value of MUC5B/total protein ratio and other indexes for CAP severity. RESULTS: MUC5B concentration in the BALF of NSCAP group was higher than that in SCAP group [NSCAP 13.56 g/ml (IQR 5.92C25.79) vs. SCAP 8.20 g/ml (IQR 4.97C14.03), p = 0.011]. The total protein concentration in the BALF of NSCAP group was lower than that in SCAP group [NSCAP 0.38 mg/ml (IQR 0.15C1.10) vs. SCAP 0.68 mg/ml (IQR 0.46C1.69), p = 0.002].

Furthermore, GeneXpert for rapid diagnosis is not widely available in Indonesia. This study aims to develop and evaluate the CUHAS-ROBUST model performance, an artificial-intelligence-based RR-TB screening tool. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involved suspected all type of RR-TB patients with complete sputum Lowenstein Jensen DST (reference) and 19 clinical, laboratory, and radiology parameter results, retrieved from medical records in hospitals under the Faculty of Medicine, Hasanuddin University Indonesia, from January 2015-December 2019. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were built along with other classifiers. The model was tested on participants recruited from January 2020-October 2020 and deployed into CUHAS-ROBUST (index test) application. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were obtained for assessment. RESULTS: A total of 487 participants (32 Multidrug-Resistant/MDR 57 RR-TB, 398 drug-sensitive) were recruited for model building and 157 participants (23 MDR and 21 RR) in prospective testing. The ANN full model yields the highest values of accuracy (88% (95% CI 85C91)), and sensitivity (84% (95% CI 76C89)) compare to other models that show sensitivity below 80% (Logistic Regression 32%, Decision Tree 44%, Random Forest 25%, Extreme Gradient Boost 25%).

The aim of this study was to describe the long-term health consequences of patients with COVID-19 who have been discharged from hospital and investigate the associated risk factors, in particular disease severity. METHODS: We did an ambidirectional cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7, 2020, and May 29, 2020. Patients who died before follow-up, patients for whom follow-up would be difficult because of psychotic disorders, dementia, or re-admission to hospital, those who were unable to move freely due to concomitant osteoarthropathy or immobile before or after discharge due to diseases such as stroke or pulmonary embolism, those who declined to participate, those who could not be contacted, and those living outside of Wuhan or in nursing or welfare homes were all excluded. All patients were interviewed with a series of questionnaires for evaluation of symptoms and health-related quality of life, underwent physical examinations and a 6-min walking test, and received blood tests. A stratified sampling procedure was used to sample patients according to their highest seven-category scale during their hospital stay as 3, 4, and 5C6, to receive pulmonary function test, high resolution CT of the chest, and ultrasonography. Enrolled patients who had participated in the Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in China received severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody tests. Multivariable adjusted linear or logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between disease severity and long-term health consequences. FINDINGS: In total, 1733 of 2469 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled after 736 were excluded. Patients had a median age of 570 (IQR 470C650) years and 897 (52%) were men. The follow-up study was done from June 16, to Sept 3, 2020, and the median follow-up time after symptom onset was 1860 (1750C1990) days. Fatigue or muscle weakness (63%, 1038 of 1655) and sleep difficulties (26%, 437 of 1655) were the most common symptoms. Anxiety or depression was reported among 23% (367 of 1617) of patients. The proportions of median 6-min walking distance less than the lower limit of the normal range were 24% for those at severity scale 3, 22% for severity scale 4, and 29% for severity scale 5C6. The corresponding proportions of patients with diffusion impairment were 22% for severity scale 3, 29% for scale 4, and 56% for scale 5C6, and median CT scores were 30 (IQR 20C50) for severity scale 3, 40 (30C50) for scale 4, and 50 (40C60) for scale 5C6. After multivariable adjustment, patients showed an odds ratio (OR) 161 (95% CI 080C325) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 460 (185C1148) for scale 5C6 versus scale 3 for diffusion impairment; OR 088 (066C117) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and OR 177 (105C297) for scale 5C6 versus scale 3 for anxiety or depression, and OR 074 (058C096) for scale 4 versus scale 3 and 269 (146C496) for scale 5C6 versus scale 3 for fatigue or muscle weakness. Of 94 patients with blood antibodies tested at follow-up, the seropositivity (962% vs 585%) and median titres (190 vs 100) of the neutralising antibodies were significantly lower compared with at the acute phase. 107 of 822 participants without acute kidney injury and with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 90 mL/min per 173 m(2) or more at acute phase had eGFR less than 90 mL/min per 173 m(2) at follow-up. INTERPRETATION: At 6 months after acute infection, COVID-19 survivors were mainly troubled with fatigue or muscle weakness, sleep difficulties, and anxiety or depression. Patients who were more severely ill during their hospital stay had more severe impaired pulmonary diffusion capacities and abnormal chest imaging manifestations, and are the main target population for intervention of long-term recovery.

Many symptoms have already been identified as typical of COVID-19, but few studies show how they can be useful in identifying clusters of patients with different severity of illness. This interpretation may help to recognize the different profiles of symptoms of COVID-19 expressed in a population at certain time. The aim of this study was to identify symptom-based clusters of hospitalized patients with severe acute respiratory illness by SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil. The clusters were evaluated based on sociodemographic characteristics, admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), use of respiratory support, and outcome. METHODS: The Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA)-based cluster analysis was applied to symptoms presented before admission. Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare the proportions of symptoms between the clusters and to examine differences in the calculated rates for the following variables: sex, age group, race, Brazilian region, use of respiratory support, admission to the ICU and outcome. RESULTS: Three COVID-19 clusters with distinct symptom profiles were identified by MCA-based cluster analysis. Cluster 1 had the mildest severity profile, with the lowest frequencies for most symptoms investigated. Cluster 2 had a severe respiratory profile, with the highest frequencies of patients with dyspnea, respiratory discomfort and O2 saturation < 95%. Cluster 2 was also the most prevalent in all Brazilian regions and had the highest percentages of patients who used invasive respiratory support (27.4%) (p-value <0.001), were admitted to the ICU (42.6%) (p -value <0.001) and died (39.0%) (p-value <0.001). Cluster 3 had a prominent profile of gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The study identified three distinct COVID-19 clusters based on the symptoms presented by patients with severe acute respiratory illness by SARS-CoV-2, but without distinction in their prevalence in the Brazilian regions.","output":"Symptom-based clusters of hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness by SARS-CoV-2 in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants t 23 hat reduce antibody neutralization and vaccine efficacy is of significant global concern. .","output":"Identification of a SARS-CoV-2 Variant with L452R and E484Q Neutralization Resistance Mutations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2, or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020.

Although a tremendous amount of medical progress has been made since its inception, there continues to be ongoing research regarding the pathophysiology, treatments, and vaccines. While a vast majority of those infected develop only mild to moderate symptoms, about 5% of people have severe forms of infection resulting in respiratory failure, myocarditis, septic shock, or multi-organ failure. Despite maximal cardiopulmonary support and invasive mechanical ventilation, mortality remains high. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains a valid treatment option when maximal conventional strategies fail.

At the start of the pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as lockdowns, social distancing, and mask-wearing were the only tools available to combat transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. More recently, several vaccines have been approved for use, and mass inoculation of the population has begun in many countries. One pressing issue is the continued use of NPIs in the context of vaccine deployment: is there an advantage to perpetuating the use of these interventions even as inoculation proceeds? The present study aims to address this question, investigating the impact of masking on the time to viral immune evasion, i.e. how masking affects the length of time the immune response is effective against the virus before the virus mutates such that it can escape the immune system. Viral immune escape is formulated as an optimization problem. A simplified and idealized model of virus transmission is proposed, and an evolutionary strategies approach is used to model the evolution of the virus. Results indicate that there is strong justification for the continued use of masks, even as vaccines are deployed. Immune escape times for no masking, 50% of the population masking, and 100% of the population masking are 17.15 +/- 1.92 generations, 21.13 +/- 2.33 generations, and 62.27 +/- 13.68 generations respectively. This increase in viral immune escape time attributable to masking is most likely caused by decreased transmission, such that significant increases in genetic diversity are required for viral immune evasion.","output":"The Effect of Mask Usage on Viral Immune Escape Times: An Evolutionary Strategies-Inspired Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The importance of the working document is that it allows the analysis of the information and the status of cases associated with (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 as open data at the municipal, state and national level, with a daily record of patients, according to a age, sex, comorbidities, for the condition of (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 according to the following characteristics: a) Positive, b) Negative, c) Suspicious.

However due to the COVID-19 pandemic, practices are rapidly adapting telemedicine for patient care. We describe our experience in rapidly introducing video visits in a tertiary academic pediatric urology practice, serving primarily rural patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to assess visit success rate and identify barriers to completing video visits. The secondary aim identified types of pathologies feasible for video visits and travel time saved. We hypothesize socioeconomic status is a predictor of a successful visit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was prospectively collected and analyzed on video visits focusing on visit success, defined by satisfactory completion of the visit as assessed by the provider. Other variables collected included duration, video platform and technical problems. Retrospective data was collected via chart review and analyzed including demographics, insurance, and distance to care. Socioeconomic status was estimated using the Distressed Communities Index generated for patient zip code. RESULTS/DISCUSSION: Out of 116 attempted visits, 81% were successful. The top two reasons for failure were no-show (64%) and inability to connect (14%). Success versus failure of visit was similar for patient age (p=0.23), sex (p=0.42), type of visit (initial vs. established) (p=0.51), and socioeconomic status (p = 0.39). After adjusting for race, socioeconomic status, and type of provider, having public insurance remained a significant predictor of failure (p = 0.017). Successful visits were conducted on multiple common pediatric urologic problems (excluding visits requiring palpation on exam), and video was sufficient for physical exams in most cases (Summary Table). A median of 2.25 hours of travel time was saved. CONCLUSIONS: While socioeconomic status, estimated using the Distressed Communities Index, did not predict success of video visits, patients with public insurance were more likely to have a failed video visit. There is compelling evidence that effective video visits for certain pathologies can be rapidly achieved in a pediatric urology practice with minimal preparation time.","output":"Benefits and Barriers to Pediatric Tele-urology During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Universal testing was conducted in all 123 West Virginia nursing homes, with 42 COVID-19 cases identified in 28 (23%) nursing homes;the 42 cases occurred in 11 residents (0 1% of residents tested) and 31 staff members Universal testing identified eight outbreaks with 17 staff members and five residents who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, including six staff members and two residents who were asymptomatic The testing likely prevented the occurrence of ongoing transmission and larger outbreaks, had the asymptomatic infections gone undetected Proactive universal testing prevented additional infections, as illustrated by the lower percentages of residents and staff members with positive test results in outbreaks identified through universal testing compared with those identified through symptom screening Universal testing helped estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 in a population at increased risk for serious COVID-19 outcomes so that public health resources could be allocated to prevent further spread Statewide universal testing enabled rapid implementation of infection prevention and control measures that likely prevented the occurrence of larger outbreaks Since completing universal screening, West Virginia has maintained symptom screening in nursing homes, revised its outbreak case definition to constitute a single case in a nursing home, and adopted universal testing of all residents and staff members in response to an outbreak with weekly testing for a period of at least 14 days since the most recent positive result","output":"Universal statewide laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes - West Virginia, April 21-May 8, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The reconfiguration of supply chain is becoming a crucial concept used to deal with market disruptions and changes such as the COVID-19 pandemic, demand uncertainty, and new technologies.

The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, an acute respiratory infectious agent, is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. A recognized key to transmission of COVID-19, and droplet infections generally, is the dispersion of bioaerosols from the patient. Increased risk of transmission has been associated with aerosol generating procedures that include endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, open suctioning, administration of nebulized treatment, manual ventilation before intubation, turning the patient to the prone position, disconnecting the patient from the ventilator, noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, tracheostomy, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The knowledge that COVID-19 subjects can be asymptomatic and still shed virus, producing infectious droplets during breathing, suggests that health care workers (HCWs) should assume every patient is potentially infectious during this pandemic. Taking actions to reduce risk of transmission to HCWs is, therefore, a vital consideration for safe delivery of all medical aerosols. Guidelines for use of personal protective equipment (glove, gowns, masks, shield, and/or powered air purifying respiratory) during high-risk procedures are essential and should be considered for use with lower risk procedures such as administration of uncontaminated medical aerosols.

The high effectiveness of the widely-administered BNT162b vaccine in preventing not only the disease but also infection suggests a potential for a population-level effect, critical for disease eradication. However, this putative effect is difficult to observe, especially in light of highly fluctuating spatio-temporal epidemic dynamics. Here, analyzing vaccination records and test results collected during a rapid vaccine rollout for a large population from 223 geographically defined communities, we find that the rates of vaccination in each community are highly correlated with a later decline in infections among a cohort of under 16 years old which are unvaccinated. These results provide observational evidence that vaccination not only protects individual vaccinees but also provides cross-protection to unvaccinated individuals in the community.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among unvaccinated is negatively associated with community-level vaccination rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microbial diversity is associated with improved outcomes in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), but the mechanism underlying this observation is unclear.

Immune profiling of conventional and unconventional immune cell subsets revealed that the prevalence of V2 cells, the major circulating subpopulation of æ T cells, closely correlated with the frequency of MAIT cells and was associated with less aGVHD. Analysis of these populations using both single-cell transcriptomics and flow cytometry suggested a shift toward activated phenotypes and a gain of cytotoxic and effector functions after transplantation. A diverse intestinal microbiome with the capacity to produce activating ligands for MAIT and V2 cells appeared to be necessary for the maintenance of these populations after allo-HCT.

Its ability to predict other relevant endpoints has not been studied yet. Therefore, this exploratory study analyzed the endpoints unplanned termination of radiotherapy and treatment in the last 30 days of life in the METSSS-defined risk groups (low/medium/high). Methods: The risk group was assigned in the METSSS online calculator for our patient cohort with non-hematological malignancies treated between 2009 and 2014 during the first course of treatment (resembling details of the original METSSS study). All patients were treated with classical palliative dose/fractionation regimes such as five fractions of 4 Gy, 10 fractions of 3 Gy or 13 fractions of 3 Gy. No stereotactic high-dose radiation was utilized. Given that single-fraction radiotherapy cannot be discontinued, patients treated with 8 Gy x1 for uncomplicated painful bone metastases were excluded. Both completed and discontinued multi-fraction radiotherapy courses (at least two fractions intended) were included. Results: The study included 290 patients, 19 of whom failed to complete their prescribed course of palliative radiotherapy (7%). Thirty-nine (13%) were irradiated in the last 30 days of life. Only one patient was classified as low-risk according to the METSSS model (medium: 15, high: 274). Only Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was significantly associated with incomplete treatment. All 16 patients with low/medium METSSS risk scores completed their prescribed course of radiotherapy, compared to the 93% completion rate in the high-risk group, p=0.41. With regard to treatment in the last 30 days of life, ECOG PS, metastases to brain, liver and lung, and the number of prescribed fractions were statistically significant. One patient with a low/medium METSSS risk score was treated in the last 30 days of life (6%), compared to 14% in the high-risk group, p=0.49. Conclusion: Unexpected imbalances in the METSSS risk group size resulted in lower statistical power than anticipated. Patients with low/medium METSSS risk scores performed numerically better. However, other predictive factors, especially ECOG PS, which is not part of the METSSS model, maybe more relevant.

Fact checking might help combat fake news and a plethora of fact-checking platforms exist, yet few people actually use them. Moreover, whether fact checking is effective in preventing citizens from falling for fake news, particularly COVID-19 related, is unclear. Against this backdrop, we (a) examine potential antecedents to fact checking that can be a target for interventions and (b) establish that fact checking is actually effective for preventing the public from falling for harmful COVID-19 fake news. To do so, we use a representative U.S. sample collected in April of 2020. We find that awareness of fake news and patterns of active SM use (e.g., commenting on content on SM instead of just reading it) increases the fact checking of COVID-19 fake news, whereas SM homophily reduces fact checking and the effects of SM use as users are trapped in echo chambers. We also find that fact checking helps users identify and follow accurate information on how to protect themselves against COVID-19 instead of false and often harmful claims propagated on SM. These findings highlight the importance of fact checking for combating COVID-19 fake news and help identify potential interventions.","output":"Combating COVID-19Fake News on Social Media through Fact Checking: Antecedents and Consequences (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Caesarean delivery is an essential surgical skill within the primary care setting aimed at reducing maternal morbidity and mortality.

Cross-national Comparisons: Comparative cross-national studies show the heavy price of bad policies in the U.S, compared to the results achieved by others in three areas: Public Health: 200,000 avoidable deaths, six million avoidable infections and hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations. Economic: trillions of dollars of lost output and budget deficit, as well as millions of lost jobs. Political: a severely net negative perception of Trumps handling of pandemic policy at home and abroad followed by a precipitous decline in his overall job approval and deterioration of his standing in the head-to-head match-up with Biden.Misrepresenting the Research on Good Policy to Defend the U.S. Failure: The single study (the Imperial College epidemiological report to the World Health Organization) on which the Trump administration relies for its claim of 2.2 million lives saved is misread and misrepresented. The analysis focuses how good things could have been under good policy. Under the best policy and the spread of the virus that results from it, the study projects the number of U.S. deaths between 6,600 and 24,000 over two years, not the 230,000 that will have perished in the U.S. in less than 10 months before election day. The projected results for good policy are close to the results achieved by other nations.These results are consistent with other epidemiological studies published shortly thereafter, which were dismissed by the Trump administration and its supporters as political hit jobs. The Flu: The effort to excuse the poor U.S. outcome by claiming COVID is like the flu fares no better under close scrutiny. In the U.S., COVID has already killed 4 times as many Americans as the most severe flu season in the past decade and 20 times as many as in the least severe flu season in that decade. COVID has killed over twice as many as the worst flu season in the last 50 years.Globally, COVID has killed only one-twentieth as many people who died in the worst flu season ever (1918-1919). In the U.S. it has already killed about one-third as many and that number of deaths continues to rise.

Woodwards book gives the backstory on the Trump administrations response, recounting the presidents private thoughts and actions (or lack thereof), Cooper said.

When it comes to the response to the largest public health crisis of our time, our current political leaders have demonstrated that they are dangerously incompetent.The tragic irony of the research is that the Trump administration misinterpreted and the advice of its own experts that it disregarded, is that there never was a conflict between good policy (known as non-pharmaceutical interventions) and the development of a vaccine. We could have had both, but we got neither in an avoidable year of suffering.There never was a tradeoff between public health and economic performance. Controlling the virus first was the key to minimizing its economic impact. The only conflict was between the lifecycle of the virus as dramatically altered by good policy, and the political spin cycle of the of Trump administration that undermined an effective U.S. response.Learning the lessons about how not to react to a pandemic in the biosphere is urgent, because we face an ongoing pandemic in the atmosphere, climate change, in which the Trump made exactly the same policy mistakes two years earlier.","output":"The Political Economy of Pandemic Policy: 3rd Quarter"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Viruses rely on host chaperone network to support their infection. In particular, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident chaperones play key roles in synthesizing and processing viral proteins. Influx of a large amount of foreign proteins exhausts the folding capacity in ER and triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). A fully-executed UPR comprises signaling pathways that induce ER folding chaperones, increase protein degradation, block new protein synthesis and may eventually activate apoptosis, presenting both opportunities and threats to the virus. Here, we define a role of the MHV-68M1 gene in differential modulation of UPR pathways to enhance ER chaperone production. Ectopic expression of M1 markedly induces ER chaperone genes and expansion of ER. The M1 protein accumulates in ER during infection and this localization is indispensable for its function, suggesting M1 acts from the ER. We found that M1 protein selectively induces the chaperon-producing pathways (IRE1, ATF6) while, interestingly, sparing the translation-blocking arm (PERK). We identified, for the first time, a viral factor capable of selectively intervening the initiation of ER stress signaling to induce chaperon production. This finding provides a unique opportunity of using viral protein as a tool to define the activation mechanisms of individual UPR pathways.","output":"M1 of Murine Gamma-Herpesvirus 68 Induces Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone Production"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: To date, the Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in more than 24,400 confirmed cases in Ireland, with more than 30% involving Healthcare Workers (HCW). As more staff become involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, many key clinical considerations remain uncertain, including the possibility of re-infection following initial illness, the clinical significance of prolonged viral shedding and the degree of protection conferred by development of anti- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies.We present 3 cases of COVID19-infected HCWs, each with distinct episodes of recurrent symptoms following initial resolution and with persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results, ranging up to 60 days post onset of illness. PCR results, cycle threshold (Ct) values and clinical assessment are provided to discuss the diagnostic difficulties in assessing relapsed COVID-19 infection, or re-infection with new virus following return to work. Case presentations : Patient 1,2 and 3 (age range 25-36) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via rtPCR on oro/nasopharyngeal swab with initial Ct values of 21.72, 24.52 and 26.58 respectively, following presentation with respiratory symptoms. All completed 14 day periods of self-isolation with full resolution of symptoms. Each patient has a clinical role and was involved in the management of COVID-19 patients following return to work. Patient 1 was admitted to hospital 44 days after initial illness, with cough, dyspnoea and a concurrent diagnosis of neurosyphilis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR was positive with Ct value 31.36 and remained positive for at least 60 days following initial illness onset. A full clinical recovery followed. Patients 2 and 3 represented to the Emergency Department with recurrent respiratory symptoms 29 and 40 days following initial illness onset respectively.

Liver transplant (LT) recipients faced a multitude of challenges during the first wave of lockdown. The aim was to identify the psychosocial difficulties and quality of life during the first year of the pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on LT recipients with a predefined structured questionnaire that included clinical, COVID-19 anxiety scale, and Post-Transplant Quality of life questionnaire (pLTQ). RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were studied; with a mean age of 50.5  11.1 years, with a median post-transplant follow-up of 52.4 months and a live donor transplant in the majority (79.8%). Almost all (99.1%) could come to the hospital for regular follow-up, prior to the pandemic. But during the first wave only 57% could maintain planned hospital visits and about 88% could not pursue their regular activities, and 39% missed their routine exercise because of imposed restrictions. Similarly, financial implications were responsible for 4% defaulting from treatment; while 7.3% managed by curtailing supportive drugs (on their own) leading to deranged liver tests in 4.6%; requiring immediate attention. The psychosocial difficulties raised the stress of pandemic (median score 18), and impacted quality of life (mean total pLTQ score 4.7  0.9) CONCLUSIONS: For LT recipients, the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic affected their physical, mental, financial, and social wellbeing; in addition to the disease itself.

Uneven distribution and scarcity of critical care (CC) clinicians is one example: COVID19 overwhelmed many hospitals with critically ill patients forcing some clinicians to provide care beyond their normal scope of practice and level of comfort. METHODS: The National Emergency Tele-Critical Care Network (NETCCN) was developed to address this problem by providing on-demand access to CC experts. NETCCN was funded by the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act;as a collaboration between the U.S. Army's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), the Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (HHS ASPR), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). NETCCN focused on rapid development and deployment of technology platforms that were simple and user-friendly, cyber-secure, and HIPAA compliant, and only required a cellular connected mobile device. This federally funded resource allowed local non-CC caregivers to consult with CC experts. RESULTS: NETCCN has deployed to six states/territories, eight hospitals and cared for hundreds of patients in locations unfamiliar with managing critically-ill patients. While limited in scope, the NETCCN experience highlights key challenges and successes to address or sustain moving forward. Fear commonly prevented wider acceptance and use of NETCCN support. Clinicians fear judgment when asking questions;hospital administrators fear violating laws or disrupting normal practice patterns;and provider groups fear loss of market share. Despite laws that permit expedience during disaster conditions, major policy barriers, particularly local credentialing and privileging processes, hinder the use of tele-CC consultation solutions. Finally, lack of consistent federal, state, and local telehealth policies, especially for in-patient and e-consult services, caused confusion and prevented wider deployment of NETCCN. CONCLUSIONS: A federal capability that provides telemedicine support to hospitals or communities in crisis as part of a disaster response system is feasible, but policy barriers and cultural expectations impede rapid adoption.","output":"Development and lessons learned: Year 1 of the national emergency tele-critical care network project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Las infecciones neonatales son un problema de salud pblica mundial.

Using calibrated confidence, we design a decision engine to determine if a medical image belongs to some known diseases or a new disease. At last, we introduce a new visual explanation to further reveal the suspected region inside each image. Using both Skin Lesion and Chest X-Ray datasets, we validate that our framework significantly improves the accuracy of new disease discovery, i.e., distinguish COVID-19 from pneumonia without seeing any COVID-19 data during training. We also qualitatively show that our visual explanations are highly consistent with doctors ground truth. While our work was not designed to target COVID-19, our experimental validation using the real world COVID-19 cases/data demonstrates the general applicability of our pipeline for different diseases based on medical imaging.","output":"Discovering Unknown Diseases with Explainable Automated Medical Imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ongoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990C1000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232C478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R0) was 6.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 5.6C7.2). However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak. With these multiple scenarios with different parameters, healthcare professionals might be able to better prepare for this viral infection.","output":"A simulation on potential secondary spread of novel coronavirus in an exported country using a stochastic epidemic seir model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The goal of this column is to inform mental health care professionals about the evolving way the diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is being made, with emphasis on tests to assist in making the diagnosis and to determine the presence of antibodies to the virus.

The aim of this project is to analyze and compare social distancing policies implemented in Denmark and Sweden in 2020. Despite many similarities between the two countries, their response to the coronavirus pandemic differed markedly. Whereas authorities in Denmark initiated mandatory regulations and many severe restrictions, Swedish authorities predominantly promoted voluntary recommendations. METHODS: The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers in Denmark and Sweden with different disciplinary backgrounds. The project is based on a comparative analysis, an approach that attempts to reach conclusions beyond single cases and to explain differences and similarities between objects of analysis and relations between objects against the backdrop of their contextual conditions. Data will be gathered by means of document analysis, qualitative interviews, and a questionnaire survey to address three research questions: (1) What social distancing policies regarding the coronavirus have been formulated and implemented, who are the policymakers behind the policy measures, which implementers are expected to implement the measures, and who are the targets that the measures ultimately seek to influence? (2) How have the social distancing policies and policy measures been justified, and what types of knowledge form the basis for the measures? and (3) What are the differences and similarities in citizens perceptions of acceptability and compliance with social distancing policy measures in relation to the coronavirus? DISCUSSION: To create a structure for addressing the three research questions, the project applies a theoretical framework informed by the policy and implementation science literatures. The framework consists of five interdependent domains that have an impact on policy implementation: (1) policymakers, (2) policy characteristics, (3) implementers, (4) targets, and (5) policy environment.

We aimed to explore the feasibility of a non-invasive respiratory drive evaluation and describe how these parameters may help to predict the need for intubation. Materials and methods We conducted a prospective observational study. All consecutive patients with COVID-19-related AHRF requiring high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) were screened for inclusion. Physiologic data (including: occlusion pressure (P0.1), tidal volume (Vt), inspiratory time (Ti), peak and mean inspiratory flow (Vt/Ti)) were collected during a short continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) session. Measurements were repeated once, 12C24 h later. Results Measurements were completed in 31 patients after the screening of 45 patients (70%). P0.1 was high (4.4 [2.7C5.1]), but it was not significantly higher in patients who were intubated. The Vt (p = .006), Vt/Ti (p = .019), minute ventilation (p = .006), and Ti/Ttot (p = .003) were higher among intubated patients compared to non-intubated patients. Intubated patients had a significant increase in their diaphragm thickening fraction, Vt, and Vt/Ti over time. Conclusions Non-invasive assessment of respiratory drive was feasible in patients with AHRF and showed an increased P0.1, although it was not predictive of intubation.","output":"Feasibility of non-invasive respiratory drive and breathing pattern evaluation using CPAP in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by a platelet count less than 100  10^9/L without anemia or leukopenia. Patients with ITP may be asymptomatic, or they may have mild bleeding like petechiae, purpura, or epistaxis. In rare cases, they may present to the emergency department (ED) with life-threatening bleeding as a result of their thrombocytopenia. The emergency physician should thus be prepared to diagnose ITP and treat the bleeding that can result from it. The diagnosis of ITP requires excluding secondary causes of thrombocytopenia, and in the ED, the bare minimum workup for ITP includes a complete blood count and a peripheral blood smear. The peripheral blood smear should show a small number of large platelets with normal morphology, and there should not be an increased number of schistocytes. Many patients with ITP require no emergent treatment. However, if a patient with suspected ITP presents to the ED with critical hemorrhage, the emergency physician should initiate treatment with a platelet transfusion, corticosteroids, and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) as soon as possible. For less severe bleeding, platelet transfusions are not recommended, and the treatment consists of corticosteroids by themselves or in conjunction with IVIG.","output":"Assessment and Management of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) in the Emergency Department: Current Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We studied the possible role of the subways in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City during late February and March 2020. Data on cases and hospitalizations, along with phylogenetic analyses of viral isolates, demonstrate rapid community transmission throughout all five boroughs within days. The near collapse of subway ridership during the second week of March was followed within 1-2 weeks by the flattening of COVID-19 incidence curve. We observed persistently high entry into stations located along the subway line serving a principal hotspot of infection in Queens. We used smartphone tracking data to estimate the volume of subway visits originating from each zip code tabulation area (ZCTA). Across ZCTAs, the estimated volume of subway visits on March 16 was strongly predictive of subsequent COVID-19 incidence during April 1-8. In a spatial analysis, we distinguished between the conventional notion of geographic contiguity and a novel notion of contiguity along subway lines. We found that the March 16 subway-visit volume in subway-contiguous ZCTAs had an increasing effect on COVID-19 incidence during April 1-8 as we enlarged the radius of influence up to 5 connected subway stops. By contrast, the March 31 cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in geographically-contiguous ZCTAs had an increasing effect on subsequent COVID-19 incidence as we expanded the radius up to 3 connected ZCTAs. The combined evidence points to the initial citywide dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 via a subway-based network, followed by percolation of new infections within local hotspots.","output":"Critical Role of the Subways in the Initial Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Symptomatic or complicated liver cysts sometimes require surgical intervention and laparoscopic fenestration is the definitive treatment for these cysts. We performed minimally invasive surgery, hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) without scarring, for a huge liver cyst. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 82-year-old female presented with a month-long history of right upper abdominal pain. We diagnosed her condition as a huge liver cyst by morphological studies. She denied any history of abdominal trauma. Her serum CEA and CA19-9 were normal and a serum echinococcus serologic test was negative. Laparoscopic fenestration, using a hybrid NOTES procedure via a transvaginal approach, was performed for a huge liver cyst because we anticipated difficulty with an umbilical approach, such as single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). Her post-operative course was uneventful and she was discharged from our hospital three days after surgery. Pain killers were not required during and after hospitalization. No recurrence of the liver cyst or bulging was detected by clinical examination two years later. DISCUSSION A recent trend of laparoscopic procedure has been towards minimizing the number of incisions to achieve less invasiveness. This hybrid NOTES, with a small incision for abdominal access, along with vaginal access, enabled painless operation for a huge liver cyst. CONCLUSION We report a huge liver cyst treated by hybrid NOTES. This approach is safe, less invasive, and may be the first choice for a huge liver cyst.","output":"Scarless surgery for a huge liver cyst: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published A Guideline for Unknown Disease Outbreaks (UDO).

The Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) System has been widely used by many institutions and hospitals in the USA for data collection, entry, and management and could help solve this problem. This study reports on the experiences, challenges, and lessons learned from establishing and applying REDCap for a large US-Nigeria research partnership that includes two sites in Nigeria, (the College of Medicine of the University of Lagos (CMUL) and Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH)) and Northwestern University (NU) in Chicago, Illinois in the United States. The largest challenges to this implementation were significant technical obstacles: the lack of REDCap-trained personnel, transient electrical power supply, and slow/intermittent internet connectivity. However, asynchronous communication and on-site hands-on collaboration between the Nigerian sites and NU led to the successful installation and configuration of REDCap to meet the needs of the Nigerian sites. An example of one lesson learned is the use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) as a solution to poor internet connectivity at one of the sites, and its adoption is underway at the other. Virtual Private Servers (VPS) or shared online hosting were also evaluated and offer alternative solutions. Installing and using REDCap in LMIC institutions for research data management is feasible; however, planning for trained personnel and addressing electrical and internet infrastructural requirements are essential to optimize its use. Building this fundamental research capacity within LMICs across Africa could substantially enhance the potential for more cross-institutional and cross-country collaboration in future research endeavors.","output":"Application of the research electronic data capture (REDCap) system in a low- and middle income country- experiences, lessons, and challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED The papain-like protease (PLpro) domain from the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was overexpressed and purified. MERS-CoV PLpro constructs with and without the putative ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain at the N terminus were found to possess protease, deubiquitinating, deISGylating, and interferon antagonism activities in transfected HEK293T cells. The quaternary structure and substrate preferences of MERS-CoV PLpro were determined and compared to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) PLpro, revealing prominent differences between these closely related enzymes. Steady-state kinetic analyses of purified MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV PLpros uncovered significant differences in their rates of hydrolysis of 5-aminomethyl coumarin (AMC) from C-terminally labeled peptide, ubiquitin, and ISG15 substrates, as well as in their rates of isopeptide bond cleavage of K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. MERS-CoV PLpro was found to have 8-fold and 3,500-fold higher catalytic efficiencies for hydrolysis of ISG15-AMC than for hydrolysis of the Ub-AMC and Z-RLRGG-AMC substrates, respectively. A similar trend was observed for SARS-CoV PLpro, although it was much more efficient than MERS-CoV PLpro toward ISG15-AMC and peptide-AMC substrates. MERS-CoV PLpro was found to process K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains at similar rates and with similar debranching patterns, producing monoubiquitin species. However, SARS-CoV PLpro much preferred K48-linked polyubiquitin chains to K63-linked chains, and it rapidly produced di-ubiquitin molecules from K48-linked chains. Finally, potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro were found to have no effect on MERS-CoV PLpro. A homology model of the MERS-CoV PLpro structure was generated and compared to the X-ray structure of SARS-CoV PLpro to provide plausible explanations for differences in substrate and inhibitor recognition. IMPORTANCE Unlocking the secrets of how coronavirus (CoV) papain-like proteases (PLpros) perform their multifunctional roles during viral replication entails a complete mechanistic understanding of their substrate recognition and enzymatic activities. We show that the PLpro domains from the MERS and SARS coronaviruses can recognize and process the same substrates, but with different catalytic efficiencies. The differences in substrate recognition between these closely related PLpros suggest that neither enzyme can be used as a generalized model to explain the kinetic behavior of all CoV PLpros. As a consequence, decoding the mechanisms of PLpro-mediated antagonism of the host innate immune response and the development of anti-CoV PLpro enzyme inhibitors will be a challenging undertaking. The results from this study provide valuable information for understanding how MERS-CoV PLpro-mediated antagonism of the host innate immune response is orchestrated, as well as insight into the design of inhibitors against MERS-CoV PLpro.","output":"Catalytic function and substrate specificity of the papain-like protease domain of nsp3 from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused dramatic effects on the healthcare system, businesses, and education. In many countries, businesses were shut down, universities and schools had to cancel in-person classes, and many workers had to work remotely and socially distance in order to prevent the spread of the virus. These measures opened the door for technologies such as robotics and artificial intelligence to play an important role in minimizing the negative effects of such closures. There have been many efforts in the design and development of robotic systems for applications such as disinfection and eldercare. Healthcare education has seen a lot of potential in simulation robots, which offer valuable opportunities for remote learning during the pandemic. However, there are ethical considerations that need to be deliberated in the design and development of such systems.

Thus, we developed a novel ELISA-based strategy targeting these specific interactions to detect SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Here, we investigated whether the same principles apply to HCoV-OC43. We discovered that the S protein of HCoV-OC43 interacts with N protein and that cell penetrating Spike CD peptide inhibits virus protein expression and replication of HCoV-OC43. The interaction between HCoV-OC43 S and N proteins were recapitulated with a recombinant HCoV-OC43 Spike CD fusion protein and a recombinant HCoV-OC43 N fusion protein in vitro.

The goal was to generate impact from bench to bedside to community, to improve the health of Canadians. It engaged researchers, clinician scientists, health systems leaders, and community members including people with lived experience (PWLE) on six Mission Critical Area (MCA) councils, each of which was co-chaired by a researcher or clinician scientist and a person with lived experience. Together, council members were tasked with providing advice to Heart & Stroke about the most relevant and impactful priorities of our time. The aim of this research was to explore the value of the MCA councils to Heart & Stroke, and to council members themselves. The research questions focused on understanding the process of managing and participating on the councils, the challenges and outcomes. METHODS: Using an integrated knowledge translation approach, we conducted a case study with developmental evaluation over a 2-year time period (2018C2020). We collected qualitative data from various sources (Heart & Stroke team responsible for managing the councils, council co-chairs, council members, and key informants). We collected documents and analysed them for contextual background. RESULTS: Participants noted that the MCA councils continuously evolved over the 2 years in various ways: from an uncertain direction to a concrete one, better integrating the voice of PWLE, and increased cohesiveness within and across MCA councils. This evolution was achieved in parallel with successes and challenges at three levels: the MCA councils and its members, Heart & Stroke, and Canadians. The MCA councils were disbanded in 2020, yet learnings, developments, initiatives and established partnerships remain as their legacy. CONCLUSIONS: Heart & Strokes intended objectives for the MCA councils, to promote engagement and dialogue among community members including PWLE, clinician scientists, and researchers, and to provide advice into Heart & Strokes strategic renewal process, were achieved. This collaborative structure and process for PWLE engagement within a community of multidisciplinary clinician scientists and researchers is possible yet requires flexibility, commitment to stakeholder relationship management, and considerable resources.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study integrates multiple health care administrative data sources from 2010 through 2014, analyzed through an interrupted time series design and a hierarchical Bayesian model. We compared managed care physicians using CEHRT to a propensity-score matched comparisons from network physicians who did not adopt CEHRT. Inclusion criteria for physicians using CEHRT included attesting to the Childhood Immunization Status clinical quality measure in addition to meeting Meaningful Use (MU) during calendar year 2013. We used a first-presence patient attribution approach to develop provider-specific immunization scores. RESULTS: We evaluated 147 providers using CEHRT, with 147 propensity-score matched providers selected from a pool of 1253 PCPs practicing in Maryland. The estimate for change in odds of increasing immunization rates due to CEHRT was 1.2 (95% credible set, 0.88 to 1.73). DISCUSSION: We created a method for estimating immunization quality scores using Bayesian modeling. Our approach required linking separate administrative data sets, constructing a propensity-score matched cohort, and using first-presence, claims-based childhood visit information for patient attribution. In the absence of integrated data sets and precise and accurate patient attribution, this is a reusable method for researchers and health system administrators to estimate the impact of health information technology on individual, provider-level, process-based, though outcomes-focused, quality measures.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is transitioning long-term care services from institutional care to home- or community-based services, including reimbursement for nonclinical services. Although home care companies are positioned to handle this transition, they need innovative solutions to address the special challenges posed by caring for persons living with dementia. To live at home longer, these persons require support from formal caregivers (FCGs; ie, paid professionals), who often lack knowledge of their personal histories and have high turnover, or informal caregivers (eg, family or friends), who may have difficulty coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. The Generation Connect platform was developed to support these individuals and their formal and informal caregivers. In preliminary studies, the platform improved mood and influenced caregiver satisfaction. To enhance platform effectiveness, Generation Connect received a grant from the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research to improve clinical outcomes, reduce health care costs, and lower out-of-pocket costs for persons living with dementia who receive care through home care agencies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate information elicited from a series of stakeholder focus groups to understand existing processes, needs, barriers, and goals for the use of the Generation Connect platform by home care agencies and formal and informal caregivers. METHODS: A series of focus groups were conducted with home care agency corporate leadership, home care agency franchise owners, home care agency FCGs, and informal caregivers of persons living with dementia. The qualitative approach allowed for unrestricted idea generation that best informed the platform development to enable home care providers to differentiate their dementia care services, involve informal caregivers, improve FCG well-being, and extend the ability of persons living with dementia to age in place. Using the Technology-Enabled Caregiving in the Home framework, an inductive and iterative content analysis was conducted to identify thematic categories from the transcripts. RESULTS: Overall, 39 participants participated across the 6 stakeholder focus groups. The following five overarching themes were identified: technology related; care services; data, documentation, and outcomes; cost, finance, and resources; and resources for caregivers. Within each theme, the most frequent subthemes were identified. Exemplar stakeholder group statements provided support for each of the identified themes. CONCLUSIONS: The focus group results will inform the further development of the Generation Connect platform to reduce the burden of caregiving for persons living with dementia, evaluate changes in cognition, preserve functional independence, and promote caregiver engagement between these individuals. The next step is to evaluate the effectiveness of the revised platform in the National Institutes of Health Small Business Innovation Research phase 2 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of its evidence-based interventions and market viability.","output":"Refining a Digital Therapeutic Platform for Home Care Agencies in Dementia Care to Elicit Stakeholder Feedback: Focus Group Study With Stakeholders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various kinds of clays occur naturally and are accompanied by particular cations in their interlayer domains. Here we report the reassembled membranes with nanofluidic channel arrays by using the natural clays montmorillonite, mica, and vermiculite, which were imparted with the natural selectivity for realizing precise recognition and directional regulation of the naturally occurring interlayer cations. A typical surface-governed ionic transport behavior was observed in the clay nanofluidic channels. Through asymmetric structural modification, cationic current rectification was realized in montmorillonite channels that performed as a nanofluidic diode. Interestingly, in the mica nanofluidic channel, the K+ that was naturally occurring in the interlayer domain of mica showed a reciprocating motion and resulted in a periodically fluctuating current. Electrodialysis demonstrated that such a fluctuating current reflects a directional selectivity for K+, achieving at least a 6000 times permeation rate difference with Li+ ions. The specific selectivity for Li+/Mg2+ on vermiculite reached up to 856 times with similar cations by the current technique.

Brazil is the worlds second most COVID-19-affected country. In the present study, we identified the genomic and proteomic variants of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 isolates. We identified 16 different genotypic variants were found among the 27 isolates. The genotypes of three isolates such as Bra/1236/2021 (G15), Bra/MASP2C844R2/2020 (G11), and Bra/RJ-DCVN5/2020 (G9) have a unique mutant in NSP4 (S184N), 2O-Mutase (R216N), membrane protein (A2V) and Envelope protein (V5A). A mutation in RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, particularly the change of Pro to Leu at 323 resulted in the stabilization of the structure in BRA/CD1739-P4/2020. NSP4, NSP5 protein mutants are more virulent in Genotype 15 and 16. A fast protein folding rate changes the structural stability and leads to escape for current antivirals. Thus, our findings help researchers to develop the best potent antivirals based on the new mutant of Brazilian isolates.","output":"Identification of Genotypic Variants and its Proteomic mutations of Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 Isolates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of COVID-19 as a global pandemic presented a novel challenge to monitoring and evaluation in the humanitarian and development sectors. The measures taken to contain the spread of COVID-19 disrupted the traditional way of doing business in both the programming and monitoring and evaluation sectors. In particular, restrictions on movement in order to reduce the spread of the virus meant that monitoring and evaluation work had to transform from the traditional approaches. This study sought to investigate how monitoring and evaluation practice has evolved under the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe. The main objective of the study was to document lessons learned from different organisations and practitioners and to share best practice. The study deployed an online survey using Kobotoolbox and reached 171 respondents. A Webinar session with six presentations and discussions with programming, monitoring and evaluation practitioners in Zimbabwe was held to share experiences and lessons learned. This was followed up by key informant interviews with selected stakeholders. The study revealed a general shift from conventional monitoring and evaluation to COVID-19 tailored approaches which include deprioritisation of face to face data collection and increased remote data collection mechanisms, maximum utilisation of secondary data, limiting data collection to essential and critical data, simplifying the data collection methods and, rethinking sampling designs to promote inclusion. The study makes several recommendations for best practice and learning.","output":"The changing face of monitoring and evaluation in the age of COVID-19: practitioners field experiences from Zimbabwe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As scientists worldwide search for answers to the overwhelmingly unknown behind the deadly pandemic, the literature concerning COVID-19 has been growing exponentially.

Four studies conducted in China met the eligibility criteria. Sample sizes ranged from six to 182, and participants' ages from 65 to 87 years. Seven nutritional screening and assessment tools were used: the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002), the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), the MNA-short form (MNA-sf), the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), the Nutritional Risk Index (NRI), the Geriatric NRI (GNRI), and modified Nutrition Risk in the Critically ill (mNUTRIC) score. Nutritional risk was identified in 27.5% to 100% of participants. The NRS-2002, MNA, MNA-sf, NRI, and MUST demonstrated high sensitivity; the MUST had better specificity. The MNA and MUST demonstrated better criterion validity. The MNA-sf demonstrated better predictive validity for poor appetite and weight loss; the NRS-2002 demonstrated better predictive validity for prolonged hospitalization. mNUTRIC score demonstrated good predictive validity for hospital mortality.

The primary findings confirm overall dependence between COVID-19 and air pollution. Empirical results exhibit a strong negative effect of COVID-19 on air pollution in New York, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania; especially at medium to higher quantiles, while New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, and Georgia show strong negative effect mainly at lower quantiles. Contrarily, COVID-19 positively affects air pollution in Pennsylvania at extreme lower quantiles. On the other side, air pollution predominantly caused to increase in the intensity of COVID-19 cases across all states except lower quantiles of Massachusetts, and extreme higher quantiles of Arizona and New Jersey, where this effect becomes less pronounced or negative. Concludingly, a rare positive fallout of COVID-19 is reducing environmental pressure, while higher environmental pollution causes to increase the vulnerability of COVID-19 cases. These findings imply that air pollution is at the heart of chronic diseases, therefore the state government should consider these asymmetric channels and introduce appropriate policy measures to reset and control atmospheric emissions.","output":"Asymmetric link between environmental pollution and COVID-19 in the top ten affected states of US: A novel estimations from quantile-on-quantile approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There are various health benefits of regular physical activity (PA) and health risks of sedentariness. The Covid-19 pandemic may have decreased PA and increased sedentariness for several reasons (e.g., closure of gyms, family-related time constraints, and reduced outdoor mobility). Yet, to date, there are no longitudinal studies that examined whether the pandemic affects PA levels and what factors help people remain physically active during lockdown. This study aims to investigate changes in U.S. residents' PA during (vs. before) the Covid-19 pandemic and predictors of changes, with a focus on PA smartphone applications (apps) and their features (i.e., motivational, educational, or gamification related). The study utilized a two-wave longitudinal survey design with an online panel. Healthy adults (N = 431) from 45 U.S. states self-reported their PA levels before and during lockdown. PA app use and app feature ratings were assessed. t-tests and regression analyses were conducted. Moderate PA, vigorous PA, and PA measured in metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per week decreased during lockdown (all p < .01). Controlling for PA before lockdown and individuals' PA intentions, PA app use was positively related to overall change in PA, measured in MET minutes per week (? = 15.68, standard error = 7.84, p < .05). PA decreased less with increasing app use frequency. When app features were added to the model, a buffering effect for gamification features was identified. The Covid-19-caused lockdown decreased U.S. residents' PA levels by 18.2%.

Knowledge in nutrition is an important tool in tackling misinformation and in the promotion of adequate food choices. This study aimed to investigate the beliefs and perceptions of a sample of the Portuguese population regarding a series of food myths and facts, evaluating, consequently, the level of knowledge and the main sources of information. The research was conducted on a sample of 503 participants, using a questionnaire disclosed online, by email, and social networks, between May and June of 2021. Thirty statements, some true and others false, were analyzed to assess peoples perceptions. Based on the respondents answers, a score was calculated for each statement, allowing to differentiate the correct (positive score) from incorrect (negative score) perceptions. The results showed that most statements obtained positive scores, corresponding to correct perceptions. Moreover, the level of knowledge was measured, being very high for 21.7% of the participants and high for 42.1%. The main sources where the participants acquire nutritional information are scientific journals (43.3%), website of the Portuguese General Health Office (DGS) (31.4%), and technical books (31.0%), which is concordant with the level of trust in these sources.

We explored specific antibody seroprevalence of all employees at a single hospital in the epicentre of the outbreak, to identify areas of risk in nosocomial setting and to evaluate the usefulness of antibody testing. AIMS: Aim of this study was to explore SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a single hospital workers cohort. METHODS: All hospital workers were invited to fill in a questionnaire and undergo a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, using two commercial tests (DiaSorin and Abbott). Seropositivity was determined overall and according to demographic and occupations characteristics, for both tests singly and combined. RESULTS: The study enrolled 1562 hospital workers (95% of the eligible population). Overall, 153 (9.8%) participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG on DiaSorin test, and 150 (9.6%) were positive on Abbott test; both tests were positive in 123 (7.9%) cases and at least one was positive in 180 (11.5%) cases. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included: being a smoker, working in emergency or medicine departments, being a healthcare practitioner, self-reporting a relative with COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and having undergone a nasopharyngeal swab test. The tests were accurate in discriminating infected cases, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 using manufacturer-suggested cut-offs and 0.929 using optimised cut-offs. For discriminating symptomatic subjects, this value was 0.915 using optimised cut-offs. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population of hospital workers was overall about 10%, with an excess prevalence in roles and departments associated with contacts with COVID-19 patients.","output":"Risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among hospital employees in Italy: a single-centre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: RT-PCR testing for the identification of viral nucleic acid is the current standard diagnostic method for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection but technical reasons limit its utilization for large-scale screening Serological IgM/IgG testing has been proposed as a useful tool to detect SARS-CoV-2 exposure OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to compare the results provided by the rapid serological VivaDiag? test for SARS-CoV-2-related IgM/IgG detection with those of the standard RT-PCR laboratory test for virus acid-nucleic identification METHODS: We simultaneously performed both serological and molecular tests in a consecutive series of 191 symptomatic patients The results provided by a new rapid serological colorimetric test analyzing IgM/IgG expression were compared with those of RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection RESULTS: 70 out of 191 subjects (37%) had positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results while 33 (18%) a positive IgM and/or/IgG results 13 subjects (7%) had positive serological test results and negative RT-PCR results The rapid serological test showed a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 89% compared to the standard RT-PCR assay but, interestingly, these performances improved 8 days after symptom appearance After 10 days of symptoms, the predictive value of the rapid serological test was higher than that of the standard molecular assay Multivariate analysis showed that age&gt;58 yrs and more than 15 days from symptom onset were significantly and independently associated with serological test positivity CONCLUSIONS: The rapid serological test analyzed in the present study seems of limited usefulness for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection but it is a candidate test for providing relevant information on the immunoreaction of subjects to COVID-19 exposure","output":"Rapid serological and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assays: comparison performed simultaneously in symptomatic COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Le potentiel ouvert par les nanosciences, qui a justifi des initiatives de recherches telles que Human Brain Initiative - Human Brain Project (HBP) qui s'inscrit dans le cadre du programme de recherche et dveloppement H2020 de l'Union europenne, dont des quivalents existent aux tats-Unis (BRAIN (4) Initiative), au Japon (Brain/MINDS (5)) et dans d'autres pays, dpend pour sa concrtisation des nanotechnologies, des biotechnologies, de la nanomtrologie de prcision atomique sur trois dimensions a laquelle s'ajoute la mtrologie du temps (femtoseconde aujourd'hui, et vitesse d'une particule quantique (6) demain).

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of and characterize the O-serogroups of E. coli strains isolated from commercial layer and layer breeder flocks showing macroscopic lesions of colibacillosis and increased or normal mortality in Greece. Furthermore, we attempted to assess the interaction between infectious agents such as Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), Mycoplasma synoviae (MS), infectious bronchitis (IBV) and infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) with E. coli infections in layer flocks with increased mortality. Our study revealed that in addition to the common serogroups (O78, O2), many other, and less common serogroups were identified, including O111. The O78, O111 and O2 serogroups were frequently detected in flocks with lesions of colibacillosis and increased mortality whereas O2, O88 and O8 were reported more commonly in birds with colibacillosis lesions but normal mortality rates. These data provide important information for colibacillosis monitoring and define preventative measures, especially by using effective vaccination programs because E. coli vaccines are reported to mainly offer homologous protection.

As secondary endpoints, we analyzed the association between CND, Covid-19 severity, and laboratory abnormalities during admission. Methods: Retrospective cohort study that included all the consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 disease from March 8th to April 11th, 2020. The study setting was Hospital Clnico, tertiary academic hospital from Valladolid. CND was defined as those neurological conditions causing permanent disability.

Here, we propose a gene-based testing framework that incorporates data on long-range chromatin interactions, several recent technical advances for region-based tests, and leverages the knockoff framework for synthetic genotype generation for improved gene discovery. Through simulations and applications to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing data for multiple diseases and traits, we show that the proposed test increases the power over state-of-the-art gene-based tests in the literature, identifies genes that replicate in larger studies, and can provide a more narrow focus on the possible causal genes at a locus by reducing the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium. Furthermore, our results show that incorporating genetic variation in distal regulatory elements tends to improve power over conventional tests.

This was accompanied by the suspension of the surgical programme. The aim of the survey was to determine the effects of COVID-19 on surgical care in non-university hospitals in Germany. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was based on an anonymous online survey, which was accessible from April 24th to May 10th, 2020 for surgeons of the Konvent der leitenden Krankenhauschirurgen (Convention of leading Hospital Surgeons) in Germany. The analysis comprised of 22.8% (n = 148/649) completed surveys. RESULTS: Communication and cooperation with authorities, hospital administration and other departments were largely considered sufficient. In the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, 28.4% (n = 42/148) of the respondents complained about a short supply of protective equipment available for the hospital staff. 7.4% (n = 11/148) of the participants stated that emergency operations had to be postponed or rescheduled. A decreased quantity of emergency surgical procedures and a decreased number of surgical emergency patients treated in the emergency room was reported in 43.9% (n = 65/148) and 63.5% (n = 94/148), respectively. Consultation and treatment of oncological patients in the outpatient clinic was decreased in 54.1% (n = 80/148) of the surveyed hospitals. To increase the capacity for COVID-19 patients, a reduction of bed and operating room occupancy of 50.8  19.3% and 54.2  19.1% were reported, respectively. Therefore, 90.5% (n = 134/148) of all participants expected a loss of revenue of 28.2  12.9% in 2020. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on surgical care in Germany. The reduction in the bed and the operating room capacity may have lead to considerable delays in urgent and semi-elective surgical interventions. In addition to the risk of worsening patient care, we anticipate severe financial damage to the clinics in 2020 and beyond. National and supranational planning is urgently needed to ensure the surgical care of patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"The COVID-19 pandemic: impact on surgical departments of non-university hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The stress in the financial system in five eurozone countries (Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) was not connected before the COVID\\\\19 pandemic crisis.

Timely access to quality health care information during outbreaks of infectious diseases can be effective to curtail the spread of disease and feelings of anxiety. Although existing studies have extended our knowledge about online health informationCseeking behavior, processes, and motivations, rarely have the findings been applied to an outbreak. Moreover, there is relatively little recent research on how people in China are using the internet for seeking health information during a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore how people in China are using the internet for seeking health information during a pandemic. Drawing on previous research of online health information seeking, this study asks the following research questions: how was the #COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help hashtag being used by patients in Wuhan seeking health information on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak? and what kinds of health information were patients in Wuhan seeking on Weibo at the peak of the outbreak? METHODS: Using entity identification and textual analysis on 10,908 posts on Weibo, we identified 1496 patients with COVID-19 using #COVID-19 Patient Seeking Help and explored their online health informationCseeking behavior. RESULTS: The curve of the hashtag posting provided a dynamic picture of public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many patients faced difficulties accessing offline health care services. In general, our findings confirmed that the internet is used by the Chinese public as an important source of health information. The lockdown policy was found to cut off the patients social support network, preventing them from seeking help from family members.

Furthermore, the risk/benefit analysis is totally different in both scenarios. In the case of seat belts, there is no way to discriminate between the users. In the case of vaccines, individuals present with unique circumstances that may differ substantially from those of another and might be foreseen a priori. This means that an analysis must be performed individually before vaccination is imposed. Finally, one must keep in mind that seat belts are often the only way in which we can protect third parties against a tragic hit by the occupant of another vehicle and are very efficient tools for this purpose. Vaccines, in contrast, do not always create sterilising immunity and are definitely not the only way by which we can avoid spreading a virus; immunity certificates, isolation, or even confinement may also serve as viable methods to achieve this purpose.","output":"Mandatory vaccination and the seat belt analogy argument: a critical analysis in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Approximately 9 out of 10 adults have some form of periodontal disease, an infection-induced inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting tissues. The initial form, gingivitis, often remains asymptomatic, but this can evolve into periodontitis, which is typically associated with halitosis, oral pain or discomfort, and tooth loss. Furthermore, periodontitis may contribute to systemic disorders like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Control options remain nonspecific, time-consuming, and costly; largely relying on the removal of dental plaque and calculus by mechanical debridement. However, while dental plaque bacteria trigger periodontal disease, it is the host-specific inflammatory response that acts as main driver of tissue destruction and disease progression. Therefore, periodontal disease control should aim to alter the hosts inflammatory response as well as to reduce the bacterial triggers. Vaccines may provide a potent adjunct to mechanical debridement for periodontal disease prevention and treatment. However, the immunopathogenic complexity and polymicrobial aspect of PD appear to complicate the development of periodontal vaccines. Moreover, a successful periodontal vaccine should induce protective immunity in the oral cavity, which proves difficult with traditional vaccination methods. Recent advances in mucosal vaccination may bridge the gap in periodontal vaccine development. In this review, we offer a comprehensive overview of mucosal vaccination strategies to induce protective immunity in the oral cavity for periodontal disease control.

METHOD: Between April and October 2020, hospital representatives completed a modified World Health Organisation (WHO) COVID-19 hospital readiness checklist consisting of 13 components and 124 indicators. Readiness scores were classified as adequate (score 80%), moderate (score 50C79.9%) and not ready (score <50%). RESULTS: Among 20 (17 tertiary and three secondary) hospitals from all six geopolitical zones of Nigeria, readiness score ranged from 28.2% to 88.7% (median 68.4%), and only three (15%) hospitals had adequate readiness. There was a median of 15 isolation beds, four ICU beds and four ventilators per hospital, but over 45% of hospitals established isolation facilities and procured ventilators after the onset of COVID-19. Of the 13 readiness components, the lowest readiness scores were reported for surge capacity (61.1%), human resources (59.1%), staff welfare (50%) and availability of critical items (47.7%).

It is important to quickly identify and isolate infected people among the unidentified infected population to prevent the infectious disease from spreading. Considering financial incentives as a strategy to control the spread of disease, we predict the effect of the strategy through a mathematical model. Although incentive costs are required, the duration of the disease can be shortened. First, we estimate the unidentified infected cases of COVID-19 in South Korea using the SUC model, and compute two parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the inverse of the average time for confirming infected individuals. We assume that when financial incentives are provided, there are changes in the proportion of confirmed patients out of unidentified infected people in the SUC model. We evaluate the numbers of confirmed and unidentified infected cases with respect to one parameter while fixing the other estimated parameters. We investigate the effect of the incentives on the termination time of the spread of the disease. The larger the incentive budget is, the faster the epidemic will end.

Here, we reported that breast cancer cells (4T1)-secreted exosomes (BCC-Ex) were able to differentiate bone marrow cells into MDSCs and significantly inhibited the proliferation of T lymphocytes to provide an immunosuppressive microenvironment for cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. The number of MDSCs in bone marrow and spleen of 4T1 tumour-bearing mice and BCC-Ex infused mice was significantly higher than that of normal mice, whereas the number of T lymphocytes in spleen was significantly decreased. In addition, BCC-Ex markedly promoted the differentiation of MDSCs from bone marrow cells or bone marrow cells derived macrophages, seen as the increased expressions of MDSCs-related functional proteins Arginase-1 (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Furthermore, BCC-Ex significantly down-regulated the expressions of chemokine receptor CXCR4 and markedly up-regulated the levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 in bone marrow cells and macrophages and remarkably inhibited the division and proliferation of T cells. Importantly, CXCR4 agonist, CXCL12, could reverse the function of BCC-Ex, indicating that BCC-Ex-induced MDSCs might be dependent on the down-regulation of CXCR4. Western blot showed that BCC-Ex significantly promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3 in bone marrow cells, resulting in the inhibitions of the proliferation and apoptosis of bone marrow cells, and the aggravation of the differentiation of bone marrow cells into MDSCs.","output":"Bone marrow cells are differentiated into MDSCs by BCC-Ex through down-regulating the expression of CXCR4 and activating STAT3 signalling pathway."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Clinical and epidemiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are now widely available, but there are few data regarding longitudinal serology in large cohorts, particularly those from low-income and middle-income countries.

The immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0 to 7 days, 10 to 28 days, and 6 to 10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates during the postinfection windows of 0 to 7 days, 10 to 28 days, and 6 to 10 weeks were 46%, 84.7%, and 85.3%, respectively (N = 743).

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients with lymphoma hospitalized for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) and to analyze pre-Covid-19 determinants of mortality. METHODS: This retrospective multicentric cohort study used the Programme de Mdicalisation des Systmes d'Information database to identify all adult patients with lymphoma, hospitalized for Covid-19 in March and April 2020, in 12 hospitals of three French regions with pandemic outbreaks. The characteristics of lymphoma and Covid-19 were collected from medical charts. FINDINGS: Eighty-nine patients were included. The median age was 67 years (range, 19C92), 66% were male and 72% had a comorbidity. Most patients had B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (86%) and had received a lymphoma treatment within one year (70%). With a median follow-up of 33 days from admission, 30-day overall survival was 71%, (95% confidence interval, 62C81%). In multivariable analysis, having an age  70 years (hazard ratio 287, 120C685, p = 002) and relapsed/refractory lymphoma (hazard ratio 254, 114C566, p = 002) were associated with mortality. Recent bendamustine treatment (n = 9) was also pejorative (hazard ratio 320, 133C772, p = 001), but was strongly associated with relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Remarkably, 30-day overall survival for patients < 70 years of age without relapsed/refractory lymphoma was 88% (78% - 99%). INTERPRETATION: Thirty-day mortality was associated with being older and relapsed/refractory lymphoma. Survival of patients younger than 70 years without relapsed/refractory lymphoma was comparable to that of the general population.

Cubic structures have been observed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membranes of cells under oxidative stress (e.g., tumor cells and virus-infected cells). It has been previously suspected that oxidation can result in the rearrangement of lipids from a fluid lamellar phase to a cubic structure in organelles containing membranes enriched with amphiphiles that have nonzero intrinsic curvature, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin. This study focuses on the oxidation of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), a lipid that natively forms an inverted hexagonal phase at physiological conditions. The oxidized samples contain an approximately 3:2 molar ratio of nonoxidized to oxidized DOPE. Optical microscopy images collected during the hydration of this mixture from a dried film suggest that the system evolves into a coexistence of a stable fluid lamellar phase and transient square lattice structures with unit cell sizes of 500-600 nm. Small-angle X-ray scattering of the same lipid mixture yielded a body-centered Im3m cubic phase with the lattice parameter of 14.04 nm. On average, the effective packing parameter of the oxidized DOPE species was estimated to be 0.657  0.069 (standard deviation). This suggests that the oxidation of PE leads to a group of species with inverted molecular intrinsic curvature. Oxidation can create amphiphilic subpopulations that potently impact the integrity of the membrane, since negative Gaussian curvature intrinsic to cubic phases can enable membrane destabilization processes.","output":"Oxidation of Membrane Curvature-Regulating Phosphatidylethanolamine Lipid Results in Formation of Bilayer and Cubic Structures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Providing scheduled consultations to persons with diabetes during the COVID-19 induced lockdowns posed a major challenge.

We argue and find that the residents of communities in which firms exhibit higher levels of CSR engaged in more SD during the Covid-19 pandemic. This was true when firms were (a) long-established, (b) isomorphic in their CSR, and (c) major employers and vendors. Moreover, CSR relating to the treatment of employees as well as positive and negative extremes in CSR bore especially strong relationships with SD.

However, previous studies have not discriminated between the effect(s) of different types of stress on these behavioural and biological outcomes. We investigated the effect(s) of repeated injection vs. permanent social isolation on behaviour, stress responsivity, immune system functioning and hippocampal neurogenesis, in young adult male mice, and found that the type of stress exposure does indeed matter. Exposure to 6 weeks of repeated injection resulted in an anxiety-like phenotype, decreased systemic inflammation (i.e., reduced plasma levels of TNF and IL4), increased corticosterone reactivity, increased microglial activation and decreased neuronal differentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG). In contrast, exposure to 6 weeks of permanent social isolation resulted in a depressive-like phenotype, increased plasma levels of TNF, decreased plasma levels of IL10 and VEGF, decreased corticosterone reactivity, decreased microglial cell density and increased cell density for radial glia, s100-positive cells and mature neuroblastsall in the DG. Interestingly, combining the two distinct stress paradigms did not have an additive effect on behavioural and biological outcomes, but resulted in yet a different phenotype, characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviour, decreased plasma levels of IL1, IL4 and VEGF, and decreased hippocampal neuronal differentiation, without altered neuroinflammation or corticosterone reactivity. These findings demonstrate that different forms of chronic stress can differentially alter both behavioural and biological outcomes in young adult male mice, and that combining multiple stressors may not necessarily cause more severe pathological outcomes.","output":"The type of stress matters: repeated injection and permanent social isolation stress in male mice have a differential effect on anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, and associated biological alterations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a wide pediatric clinical spectrum.

In the present study, the protective effect of isolated exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs-exo) against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury was explored. Hepatic I/R injury was achieved by inducing ischemia for 60 min followed by reperfusion for 2 and 6 h. Pre-treatment with ADSCs-exo revealed a significant reduction in necrosis and apoptosis in liver tissue induced by I/R injury. Hypoxic oxidative stress was managed by exosome-mediated reduced reactive oxygen species and increased superoxide dismutase that in turn protected mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Reduction in inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 and TNF- was also observed and protection of hepatocytes from I/R injury was evidenced by a significant decrease in biochemical markers of liver damage (alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase). Exosomal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-mediated ERK1/2 and GSK-3 phosphorylation were revealed to increase Bcl-2 and decrease Bax expression with mitochondrial permeability transition pore-inhibition which may be considered a prime mechanism of exosome-mediated hepatoprotection.

METHODS In a 2-month prospective, observational, resident-led nationwide cohort study, patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis were analysed. Logistic regression analyses were performed for identifying the possible effect of stump closure type and other risk factors for infectious complications. RESULTS Laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis was performed in 1369 patients in 62 hospitals; endoloops were used in 76.7 % and an endostapler in other patients. Median operating time was not different between endoloop and endostapler use (42.0 vs. 44.0 min, P = 0.243). A superficial surgical site infection was seen in 2.0 % after uncomplicated appendicitis and in 0.8 % after complicated appendicitis. The intra-abdominal abscess rate was 1.9 % after uncomplicated and 11.0 % after complicated appendicitis. No significant effect of stump closure type was observed for any infectious complication (OR 1.05; 95 % CI 0.625-1.766, P = 0.853) or an intra-abdominal abscess (OR OR 0.96; 95 % CI 0.523-1.768, P = 0.899).

Results: As of 4 July 2020, COVID-19 has affected 29 communes of Niger with 1093 confirmed cases, among whom 741 (67.8%) were males. Of them 89 cases died, resulting in a case fatality rate (CFR) of 8.1%. Both attack rates and CFRs were increased with age (P < 0.0001). Health care workers accounted for 12.8% cases. Among the reported cases, 39.3% were isolated and treated at home, and 42.3% were asymptomatic. 74.6% cases were clustered in Niamey, the capital of Niger.

Bacillus species, a predominant microorganism present in these foods, have demonstrated beneficial and deleterious impacts on human health. These microorganisms produce bioactive compounds during fermentation that have beneficial impacts in improving human health. However, the health risks associated with FSF, food pathogens, biogenic amines (BAs) production, and late-onset anaphylaxis, remain a concern. The purpose of this review is to present an in-depth analysis of positive and negative impacts as a result of consumption of FSF along with the measures to alleviate health risks for human consumption. METHODS: This review was composed by scrutinizing contemporary literature of peer-reviewed publications related to Bacillus and FSF. Based on the results from academic journals, this review paper was categorized into FSF, role of Bacillus species in these foods, process of fermentation, beneficial, and adverse influence of these foods along with methods to improve food safety. Special emphasis was given to the potential benefits of bioactive compounds released during fermentation of soybean by Bacillus species. RESULTS: The nutritional and functional properties of FSF are well-appreciated, due to the release of peptides and mucilage, which have shown health benefits: in managing cardiac disease, gastric disease, cancer, allergies, hepatic disease, obesity, immune disorders, and especially microbial infections due to the presence of probiotic property, which is a potential alternative to antibiotics. Efficient interventions were established to mitigate pitfalls like the techniques to reduce BAs and food pathogens and by using a defined starter culture to improve the safety and quality of these foods. CONCLUSION: Despite some of the detrimental effects produced by these foods, potential health benefits have been observed. Therefore, soybean foods fermented by Bacillus can be a promising food by integrating effective measures for maintaining safety and quality for human consumption. Further, in vivo analysis on the activity and dietary interventions of bioactive compounds among animal models and human volunteers are yet to be achieved which is essential to commercialize them for safe consumption by humans, especially immunocompromised patients.","output":"Impact of Bacillus in fermented soybean foods on human health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A battery of in vitro and in vivo tests were conducted on HCFC-141b as a vapour. Bacterial gene mutation assays with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium were negative in all tester strains. In vitro chromosomal aberration assays were positive on CHO cells but negative on human lymphocytes. Moreover, HCFC-141b was negative in vivo in a mouse micronucleus inhalation assay. On the basis of these data and previously reported genotoxicity testing, HCFC-141b is considered non-genotoxic. Groups of 80 male and 80 female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed, by inhalation (6 hr/day, 5 days/wk) to vapours of HCFC-141b for 104 wk at target concentrations of 0 (control), 1500, 5000 and 20,000 ppm (increased from 15,000 ppm after 17 wk of exposure). No exposure-related effects of toxicological significance were noted with respect to survival, clinical signs, ophthalmoscopy, haematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis or organ weight analysis. Reduced food intake and body weight gain were noted in both sexes of the 15,000 ppm group during the first 16 wk; thereafter, body weight gains in all groups were similar although the intergroup differences in body weight remained evident. Reduced food intake persisted in both sexes through wk 52 and in females during the second year of exposure. Treatment-related effects on macroscopic pathology were confined to increased incidences of testicular masses and altered appearance. Microscopic pathology examinations confirmed the testes as the target organ with findings of increased incidences of benign interstitial cell tumours and hyperplasia at 5000 and 20,000 ppm. The no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was 1500 ppm. The testicular changes at high exposure levels were considered to be due to a change of the senile hormonal imbalance in geriatric rats and of little significance for the assessment of human health effects.","output":"Evaluation of the genotoxicity potential and chronic inhalation toxicity of 1,1-dichloro-1-fluoroethane (HCFC-141 b)()()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic critically threatens global public health, development and sustainability As a direct result, ideas, which would otherwise have never been considered, are being presented as golden solutions One such case is that of the 'immunity passport', i e determining the movement of people within countries and across borders on the basis of their immunity status The argument being made is that such a passport would allow people with immunity to help on the front line, as for example to alleviate pressure in hospitals safeguarding the health of many Similar argumentation is used across sectors, with tremendous burden being placed on low-paid and seasonal workers, who may attempt to try and get infected to be 'able' to work or cross a border to seek work Additionally, legislative provisions on testing for immunity expose individuals to enforced 'solutions' infringing upon their rights and privacy, and even stigmatising them Thus, COVID19 represents a threat to human rights, individual freedoms and, ultimately, social cohesion, mostly impacting adversely vulnerable people already at a disadvantage The legal nature of this measure raises questions on whether this is necessary and in accordance to a legitimate aim in a democratic society Is there a difference between healthcare settings and the broader society?

To get specific and accurate information of a disease, the use of synthetic peptides in diagnostics have increased in the last few decades, because of their high purity profile and ability to get modified chemically. The discovered peptide probes are used either in imaging diagnostics or in non-imaging diagnostics. In non-imaging diagnostics, techniques such as Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), lateral flow devices (i.e., point-of-care testing), or microarray or LC-MS/MS are used for direct analysis of biofluids. Among all, peptide-based ELISA is considered to be the most preferred technology platform. Similarly, peptides can also be used as probes for imaging techniques, such as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). The role of radiolabeled peptides, such as somatostatin receptors, interleukin 2 receptor, prostate specific membrane antigen, 3 integrin receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide, chemokine receptor 4, and urokinase-type plasminogen receptor, are well established tools for targeted molecular imaging ortumor receptor imaging. Low molecular weight peptides allow a rapid clearance from the blood and result in favorable target-to-non-target ratios. It also displays a good tissue penetration and non-immunogenicity. The only drawback of using peptides is their potential low metabolic stability. In this review article, we have discussed and evaluated the role of peptides in imaging and non-imaging diagnostics.

The paper provides retrospective evidence for how to tackle the aggravating impact of pollution on COVID-19 pandemia using a systemic mode of macroeconomic governance. Ecological pollution is proxied by CO2 per capita (CPC). Macroeconomic governance is proxied by macro non-financial governance (consisting of fixed-capital formation, private consumption, governmental purchases, international trade, and foreign direct investment), and macro financial governance (money supply, public debt, savings, portfolio investment, and financialization). The paper introduces green and dirty complementarities as two analytical concepts for explaining the mode of governing pollution-macroeconomy nexus. In so doing, the paper takes a twelve-country sample out of the developed OECD countries for the period 1983-2014 using Westerlund and Edgerton (2008) cointegration test with structural breaks and panel ARDL model executed by PMG, MG, and DFE estimators. For the investigated countries, the paper finds green complementary relationship between the financial and non-financial variables of a systemic mode of macroeconomic governance geared towards reducing pollution in the long-run. Extrapolating from this conclusion, the paper suggests that a systemic mode of macroeconomic governance can be vital to mitigate the aggravating impact of pollution on COVID-19 pandemia, too, when applied in a way to dynamically contain the acute and idiosyncratic challenges posed by the pandemia in the short-run.","output":"How to Tackle the Aggravating Effect of Pollution on COVID-19 Pandemia?

Agents are connected through a weighted undirected network of contacts, and the planner's objective is to determine the policy that contains the spread of infection below a tolerable incidence level, and that maximizes the present discounted value of real income, in that order of priority. The optimal unique policy depends both on the configuration of the contact network and the tolerable infection incidence. Comparative statics analyses are conducted: (i) they reveal the tradeoff between the economic cost of the pandemic and the infection incidence allowed; and (ii) they suggest a correlation between different measures of network centrality and individual lockdown probability with the correlation increasing with the tolerable infection incidence level. Using unique data on the networks of nursing and long-term homes in the U.S., we calibrate our model at the state level and estimate the tolerable COVID-19 infection incidence level. We find that laissez-faire (more tolerance to the virus spread) pandemic policy is associated with an increased number of deaths in nursing homes and higher state GDP growth. In terms of the death count, laissez-faire is more harmful to nursing homes than more peripheral in the networks, those located in deprived counties, and those who work for a profit.

Many of the receptors are involved in proceeding with this infection in the organism's body. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play essential and protective functions from a wide range of microbial pathogens. Small setup of TLR adaptor proteins leads to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) and interferon-regulatory factor (IRF). Consequently, various advanced inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and interferon reaction properties can be up-regulated. Similarly, TLR flagging works on autophagy in macrophages. Autophagy is a cell response to starvation that helps to eliminate damaged cytosol organelles and persistent proteins. It is also able to prevent the replication of intracellular pathogens. Several microbes subvert the autophagy pathways to sustain their viability.

We aimed to assess the health, psychosocial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with chronic conditions in India. METHODS: Between July 29, to September 12, 2020, we telephonically surveyed adults (n = 2335) with chronic conditions across four sites in India. Data on participants demographic, socio-economic status, comorbidities, access to health care, treatment satisfaction, self-care behaviors, employment, and income were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with difficulty in accessing medicines and worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Further, a diverse sample of 40 participants completed qualitative interviews that focused on eliciting patients experiences during the COVID-19 lockdowns and data analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred thirty-four individuals completed the survey (response rate = 74%). The mean (SD) age of respondents was 57.8 years (11.3) and 50% were men. During the COVID-19 lockdowns in India, 83% of participants reported difficulty in accessing healthcare, 17% faced difficulties in accessing medicines, 59% reported loss of income, 38% lost jobs, and 28% reduced fruit and vegetable consumption. In the final-adjusted regression model, rural residence (OR, 95%CI: 4.01,2.90C5.53), having diabetes (2.42, 1.81C3.25) and hypertension (1.70,1.27C2.27), and loss of income (2.30,1.62C3.26) were significantly associated with difficulty in accessing medicines. Further, difficulties in accessing medicines (3.67,2.52C5.35), and job loss (1.90,1.25C2.89) were associated with worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Qualitative data suggest most participants experienced psychosocial distress due to loss of job or income and had difficulties in accessing in-patient services.

METHODS: We analysed National Health Service (NHS) datasets and literature reviews to estimate hospital care capacity before the pandemic (pre-pandemic baseline) and to quantify the impact of interventions (cancellation of elective surgery, field hospitals, use of private hospitals, deployment of former medical staff and deployment of newly qualified medical staff) for treatment of adult COVID-19 patients, focusing on general and acute (G&A) and critical care (CC) beds, staff and ventilators. RESULTS: NHS England would not have had sufficient capacity to treat all COVID-19 and other patients in March and April 2020 without the hospital provision interventions, which alleviated significant shortfalls in CC nurses, CC and G&A beds and CC junior doctors. All elective surgery can be conducted at normal pre-pandemic levels provided the other interventions are sustained, but only if the daily number of COVID-19 patients occupying CC beds is not greater than 1550 in the whole of England. If the other interventions are not maintained, then elective surgery can only be conducted if the number of COVID-19 patients occupying CC beds is not greater than 320. However, there is greater national capacity to treat G&A patients: without interventions, it takes almost 10,000 G&A COVID-19 patients before any G&A elective patients would be unable to be accommodated.

In this case, modern mobility techniques, by spreading the disease on a global scale, have produced the opposite effect, that is, the mobility limitations of lockdowns. On the other hand, we will embrace Jacques Ellul?s philosophy of technique, which shows how many problems produced by modern technique, such as the current pandemic, have an ultimate tendency toward the establishment of a centralized and authoritarian organization of humanity not compatible with the fundamental rights of liberal democracies.

However, the underlying pharmacological mechanism in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is still unclear. AIMS: To investigate the therapeutical effects of PRD on DN and to explore its pharmacological mechanisms using network pharmacology and experimental verification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The active compounds and putative targets in PRD, and disease-related targets of DN were extracted from public databases. The key targets were identified through the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module analysis. The GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed to discover potential pharmacological mechanisms. The expression of the key targets was detected in kidney tissue in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. The affinity between key proteins and corresponding compounds was evaluated by molecular docking and validated by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay. The indicators on major pathways and hub genes were verified by in vivo experiments. RESULTS: In network pharmacology, 137 common targets in PRD for DN treatment were screened. The key targets and main signaling pathways including AGE-RAGE and lipid pathways were identified. The statistical difference in the expression of the key targets was verified in GSE96804 database, confirming the association with DN. The docking scores obtained from molecular docking illustrated good binding force between hub proteins and active compounds. And the good component-protein affinities were validated by SPR assay. Furthermore, the results of animal experiment indicated that PRD could ameliorate the level of serum glucose and renal function in rat model. It could regulate the expression of hub targets (AKT1, MAPK3, and STAT3) and improve indicators related with oxidative stress and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: The key targets and major signaling pathways in the treatment of PRD on DN were identified. The mechanism might relate to regulation of oxidative stress and lipid metabolism.","output":"The therapeutic mechanism of PuRenDan for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy: Network pharmacology and experimental verification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, MacFarlane could not have imagined that anything good might come from the COVID-19 emergency.

This retrospective study was carried out to examine the relationship between seminal parameters and the Leydig cell compartment, and secondarily to assess other factors responsible for determining Leydig cell functional capacity. METHODS INSL3 was assessed together with seminal, anthropometric, and hormonal parameters in a Swedish cohort of 18-year-old men, representing the average population, and in a smaller, more heterogeneous cohort of men visiting an Australian infertility clinic. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Average INSL3 concentration at 18 years is greater than that reported at younger or older agesr and indicated a large 10-fold variation. In neither cohort was there a relationship between INSL3 concentration and any semen parameter. For the larger, more uniform Swedish cohort of young men, there was a significant negative relationship between INSL3 and BMI, supporting the idea that adult Leydig cell functional capacity may be established during puberty. In both cohorts there was a significant relationship between INSL3 and FSH, but not LH concentration. No relationship was found between INSL3 and androgen receptor trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms, reinforcing the notion that Leydig cell functional capacity is unlikely to be determined by androgen influence alone. Nor did INSL3 correlate with the T/LH ratio, an alternative measure of Leydig cell functional capacity, supporting the view that these are independent measures of Leydig cell function.","output":"Male seminal parameters are not associated with Leydig cell functional capacity in men."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent interim guidance from the British Society of Gastroenterology, aligned to historical paediatric practice, advises a no-biopsy protocol (NBP) for adults with high anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG-IgA) titres and other clinical factors.

Restrictions on gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 create an even greater risk for social isolation. Memory Cafs are a highly replicated program that provide individuals living with ADRD and care partners an opportunity to socialize in an inclusive and supportive environment without fear of judgment, pressure, or stigma. Following restrictions on in-person gatherings, virtual Memory Cafs offer regular social engagement opportunities in an online format. While the Memory Caf model has been replicated globally, their effects on loneliness and perceived social support are generally unknown. Even less is known about their impact when operating in a virtual environment. Methods: Semi-structured interviews in Spanish and English were conducted with individuals living with dementia and family care partners who regularly attend Memory Cafs hosted by partners in a Texas Memory Caf Network. Interviews took place online using video conferencing software, were transcribed, then analyzed for common themes using a combined inductive and deductive approach. Results: A total of 17 interviews were conducted with persons living with dementia (n = 5) and family care partners (n = 12) who attend Memory Cafs to learn about their perceived experiences of social connectedness since COVID-19. Care partners included spouses (n = 8) and adult children (n = 4). Interviews included attendees of different Memory Caf models, including in-person only (n = 2), virtual only (n = 9), and those who attend both models (n = 6).

Discussion: Findings substantiate evidence that Memory Cafs offer important benefits for families living with dementia, providing vital new insight into the potential for virtual Memory Cafs to offer similar benefits. Findings have implications beyond the context of COVID-19, where virtual models may support the social connectedness of those living in geographically marginalized and underserved areas. Virtual models may not address the needs of all families experiencing dementia due to lack of access to technology and limitations for virtual engagement with those experiencing later stage dementia.","output":"\\"We Don't Feel so Alone\\": A Qualitative Study of Virtual Memory Cafs to Support Social Connectedness Among Individuals Living With Dementia and Care Partners During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThis presentation draws on the findings of a national population-based study which collates real-time data on the deaths of children aged 0C17 years in England. More specifically, all child deaths are entered onto a national database within 48 hours of occurring. Additional detailed information on the circumstances of the childrens lives and deaths is subsequently added to support learning that could reduce the number of deaths in future. As the first database of this kind and by linking with national virology results, it was uniquely placed to investigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2, and the national lockdown used to control the virus, on child mortality.ObjectivesThere is an urgent need to understand the nature and effect of SARS-CoV-2 and measures to control it on illness and mortality in children. This work aims to investigate and quantify the characteristics of children dying with COVID-19 and to investigate patterns of causes or rate of childhood mortality during the pandemic lockdown periods.MethodsWe compared the characteristics of the children who died in 2020, split by SARS-CoV-2 status. A negative binomial regression model was used to compare mortality rates in lockdown (23 March-28 June), with children who died in the preceding period (6 January-22 March), as well with those who died during a comparable period in 2019.ResultsThere is no evidence of excess mortality among children during the period of lockdown;nor substantial changes in any other causes of death during the same period. Children who died and had a positive result for SARS-CoV-2 were more commonly older, and from ethnic minority groups. However, the age and ethnic profile of all-cause child mortality during lockdown appeared similar to deaths pre-lockdown and in 2019. We also found little evidence of over-representation of children with underlying health conditions among children who died with the virus. More specifically, we noted:1550 child deaths were notified between 23 March and 28 June 2020;437 of which were linked to SARS-CoV-2 virology records25 (5.7%) had a positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) result. PCR positive children were less likely to be white (37.5% vs 69.4%) and were older (12.2 vs 0.7 years) compared to child deaths without evidence of the virus.ConclusionsFor the period studied, it is reassuring to note that there is no evidence of excess mortality of children from SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the apparent higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 positive tests among children from Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups is consistent with findings in adults. However, ongoing surveillance is essential as the pandemic continues.","output":"Child mortality in the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of statins in the management of dyslipidemia in elderly patients with different cardiovascular risks remains unclear.

METHODS: Observational, cross-sectional study that included all people aged 90 or more residing in the Community of Madrid as of December 31, 2015. The clinical information was obtained from the database that contains the electronic medical records collected by family doctors in primary care. Comorbidity data are collected according to the International Classification of Primary Care, Second Edition (ICPC-2). RESULTS: The study population comprised 59,423 subjects, with a mean age of 93.3 (2.5) years (25.8% males). Slightly more than one quarter of the population (28.2%) was in treatment with statins, 21.9% were in primary prevention, and 48.1% in secondary prevention. The multivariate analysis revealed the factors independently associated with statin treatment to be younger age, not being institutionalized, a higher Barthel score, a lower Charlson score, a higher body mass index, and a history of diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease.

METHODS A 29-question survey was distributed to an international mailing list of patients with subglottic stenosis to assess the patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS A total of 543 patients with iSGS participated. Fewer than 1 in 10 patients with iSGS have experienced COVID-19 symptoms, which were predominantly mild to moderate, with only 2 hospitalizations. Most patients with iSGS (80.0%) have not been advised they are high risk for COVID-19, despite 36.5% of patients with iSGS being obese (body mass index of 30+). Delays to surgeries and in-office procedures have impacted 40.1% of patients currently receiving treatment, with 38.8% of patients increasingly struggling to breathe as a result. Anxiety and stress are increasing among patients, with 3 in 4 (75.2%) reporting they are anxious about travelling by public transport, contracting the virus in hospital and infecting loved ones (69.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Of greater concern is that 23.1% with increasing dyspnea state they are staying away from hospital despite their deteriorating health. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the physical and psychological health of patients with iSGS. Surgeons managing cases of laryngotracheal stenosis need to offer appropriate support and communication to these high risk patients. During the pandemic, this should include self-isolation if they are dyspneic or on treatments that may have reduced their immunity. In addition, they should offer safe clinical pathways to airway assessment and treatments, if they become necessary.

She was admitted and a new tomography showed increased ground glass opacities with septal thickening as well as pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with no pneumothorax. Pneumomediastinum is the presence of air in the mediastinum secondary to air leak. COVID-19 has been related to cases of spontaneous air leak with no clear explanation yet. Some authors suggest severe degree of alveolar and interstitial lung architectural damage seen in COVID-19 has a significant effect on alveolar ventilation due to hyaline membranes, fibrin thrombi and infarction. Both ventilation and perfusion are simultaneously affected increasing the degree of hypoxemia and shunt, worsening the perfusion and causing pulmonary tissue ischemic with risk for air leak. Other hypothesis consider viral infiltration of lung parenchyma as well as in visceral and parietal pleura may cause disruption of parenchymal integrity leading to subsequent air leak, related to high inflammation markers as well as an hypercoagulable state.

We aimed to measure and characterize recent fentanyl deaths in jurisdictions west of the Mississippi River. Design: Systematic search of states and counties in the Western U.S. for publicly available data on fentanyl-related deaths since the most recently published Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics, which cover through December 2018.

Method 119 healthy aging controls and 84 individuals with mild cognitive impairment or dementia (M age = 68.37, SD = 9.57;63% female;M education = 14.08, SD 2.73 years) were administered a brief neuropsychological battery including OTMT in counterbalanced face-to-face (FF) and videoconference (VC) conditions. T-tests and intraclass correlations (ICC's) were used to compare results between testing conditions across groups. Results Among controls, the mean differences (MD) between conditions on OTMT-A (MD = -1.6, SD = 1.96) and B (MD = 1.6, SD = 54.77) were small, but statistically significant for OTMT-A;p < 0.001 but not OTMT-B (p = 0.749). ICC's reflected good (0.85) and moderate (0.66) agreement on OTMT-A and B, respectively.

METHODS: : We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. CASE-CENTERED RECOMMENDATIONS: : Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25C50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. LIMITATIONS: : Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: : Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.","output":"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders (ED) can adversely affect the psychological health of patients caregivers. The present study aimed to validate a Japanese version of the Family Coping Questionnaire for Eating Disorders (FCQ-ED-J) and investigate the association between the coping strategies and psychological states of the caregivers of ED patients. METHODS: The caregivers completed the FCQ-ED-J and the Profile of Mood States. The FCQ-ED measures the coping strategies of caregivers of ED patients to the ED symptom-related behaviors. As confirmatory factor analysis did not yield an adequate model fit, the factor structure of the FCQ-ED-J was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis. Subsequently, the reliability and validity of the FCQ-ED-J were examined using Cronbachs alpha and Pearsons correlation coefficients in relation to the Profile of Mood States. RESULTS: Data from 150 caregivers, including 91 mothers and 34 fathers, was analyzed (mean age 51.1 years, SD = 12.0). The FCQ-ED-J, with 13 items grouped across four subscales [response to binge-eating (factor 1), response to frequent weighing (factor 2), response to too much physical exercise (factor 3), and response to abusing laxatives and/or diuretics (factor 4)] had Cronbachs alpha values representing acceptable to good internal consistency (0.71C0.85). Each subscale of the FCQ-ED-J was significantly correlated with the Profile of Mood States subscales. CONCLUSIONS: The FCQ-ED-J had sufficient reliability and validity. The Japanese caregivers responses to the patients ED symptom-related behavior were associated with their psychological states. Thus, the FCQ-ED-J may offer insight into more effective and reasonable care by caregivers for ED patients. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: The Family Coping Questionnaire has been used by researchers to assess the coping strategies of the relatives of patients. The present study aimed to validate a Japanese version of the Family Coping Questionnaire for Eating Disorders (FCQ-ED-J) and investigate the association between the coping strategies and psychological states of the caregivers of ED patients. Data from 150 caregivers, including 91 mothers and 34 fathers, were analyzed. The FCQ-ED-J comprised 13 items grouped into four subscales, with acceptable to good internal consistency (Cronbachs alpha values between 0.71 and 0.85). All subscales of the FCQ-ED-J were found to be statistically significantly correlated with the profile of mood states (POMS) subscales. The Japanese caregivers responses to the patients ED symptom-related behavior were associated with their psychological states. Thus, the FCQ-ED-J can be utilized to help caregivers provide more effective and reasonable psychological care and support to ED patients.","output":"Validating the family coping questionnaire for eating disorders for caregivers of Japanese patients with eating disorders: association between coping strategies and psychological characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Respiratory diseases including influenza A virus (IAV) infections represent a major threat to human health. While the development of a vaccine requires a lot of time, a fast countermeasure could be the use of defective interfering particles (DIPs) for antiviral therapy. IAV DIPs are usually characterized by a large internal deletion in one viral RNA segment. Consequentially, DIPs can only propagate in presence of infectious standard viruses (STVs), compensating the missing gene function. Here, they interfere with and suppress the STV replication and might act universally against many IAV subtypes. We recently reported a production system for purely clonal DIPs utilizing genetically modified cells. In the present study, we established an automated perfusion process for production of a DIP, called DI244, using an alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) system for cell retention. Viable cell concentrations and DIP titers more than 10 times higher than for a previously reported batch cultivation were observed. Furthermore, we investigated a novel tubular cell retention device for its potential for continuous virus harvesting into the permeate. Very comparable performances to typically used hollow fiber membranes were found during the cell growth phase. During the virus replication phase, the tubular membrane, in contrast to the hollow fiber membrane, allowed 100% of the produced virus particles to pass through. To our knowledge, this is the first time a continuous virus harvest was shown for a membrane-based perfusion process. Overall, the process established offers interesting possibilities for advanced process integration strategies for next-generation virus particle and virus vector manufacturing. Key points ? An automated perfusion process for production of IAV DIPs was established. ? DIP titers of 7.40E + 9 plaque forming units per mL were reached. ? A novel tubular cell retention device enabled continuous virus harvesting.

Here we describe a renal-transplant recipient who developed recurrent, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection 7 months after primary infection. To elucidate the immunological mechanisms responsible for reinfection, we performed longitudinal profiling of cellular and humoral responses during both primary and recurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that the patient responded to the primary infection with transient, poor-quality adaptive immune responses that was further compromised by intervening treatment for acute rejection of the renal allograft prior to reinfection. Importantly, we identified the development of neutralizing antibodies and humoral memory responses prior to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. However, these neutralizing antibodies failed to confer protection against reinfection, suggesting that additional factors are required for efficient prevention of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. Further, we found no evidence supporting viral evasion of primary adaptive immune responses, suggesting that susceptibility to reinfection may be determined by host factors rather than pathogen adaptation.","output":"Longitudinal immune profiling of a SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a solid organ transplant recipient"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.

The current reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is real time reverse transcriptase PCR on various platforms. However, even with automation, the turnaround time is huge enough to keep up with ever increasing numbers of patients. With increasing surge of COVID cases we need rapid diagnostic tests with good sensitivity and specificity. OBJECTIVES: Comparison between Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and real time reverse transcriptase PCR as a reference method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specimens from seventy-two individuals were obtained over a period of two months which were processed for ID NOW and RTPCR at a dedicated COVID-19 centre of AIIMS. Dry nasal swabs were used for ID NOW while nasopharyngeal swabs along with throat swab were used for RTPCR. Among the participants, 15 were healthcare workers. Mild COVID was seen in 36 participants, moderate in 19 and severe in 9. Eight participants had non COVID illness. RESULTS: From the given samples, we observed that ID NOW has a sensitivity of 93.22% (55/59) specificity 100% (13/13), PPV 100% (55/55) and NPV 76.47% (13/17). CONCLUSION: ID NOW is a convenient, rapid molecular test which makes it suitable for both in laboratory use and as a point of care test. It can be a rapid rule-in test for COVID-19.

To play such diverse roles, the N protein has two structured RNA-binding modules, the N- (NTD) and C-terminal (CTD) domains, which are connected by an intrinsically disordered region. Despite the wealth of structural data available for the isolated NTD and CTD, how these domains are arranged in the full-length protein and how the oligomerization of N influences its RNA-binding activity remains largely unclear. Herein, using experimental data from electron microscopy and biochemical/biophysical techniques combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that, in the absence of RNA, the N protein forms structurally dynamic dimers with the NTD and CTD arranged in extended conformations. In the presence of RNA, however, the N protein assumes a more compact conformation where the NTD and CTD are packed together. We also provide an octameric model for the full-length N bound to RNA that is consistent with electron microscopy images of the N protein in the presence of RNA. Together, our results shed new light on the dynamics and higher-order oligomeric structure of this versatile protein.","output":"Structural dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein induced by RNA binding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected the relationship between peoples behaviors and residential spaces, bringing to public and academic attention, on the one hand, the exacerbation of pre-existing problems and, on the other, the potential of spaces, such as communal gardens and apartment-block terraces, to become important resources of sociability or privacy. Overall, this raises the question of how to assess the responsiveness of the existing residential stock to needs that transcend the traditional concept of housing adequacye.g., the need for adaptable, open, and livable spaces. This research moves from the assumption that underused spaces in residential neighborhoods represent a crucial asset for creating new economic and social values through architectural and urban projects. Consequently, moving from an in-depth observation of a selection of public housing buildings in Turin as a paradigmatic case study, the aim is to explore the potential for the adaptive reuse of residential spaces at different scalesfrom the apartment to the neighborhoodshighlighting the implications for design.

Their effects can depend on the functional features of the species in the community. Since species belonging to the same trophic level, such as phytoplankton, may show functional differences, we investigated whether the effects of environment and dispersal differ among phytoplankton species from different functional groups. We analyzed data from a rainy and a dry period in 30 reservoirs in a subtropical region. In both periods, the environment as well as high and limited dispersal influenced the metacommunity structure. The functional groups had a low correspondence in their response to both dispersal and environment. Our results showed that the influence of the processes underlying the structure of the metacommunities, such as species sorting (environment influence), mass effect (high dispersal), and neutral dynamics (limited dispersal), depended on the functional characteristics of the organisms and could vary even among species of the same trophic level. These findings suggested that species at the same trophic level could not be considered ecological equivalents.

The present study aimed to evaluate oral health-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours of dental students in Arab countries and explore the potential sociodemographic predictors of their oral health outcomes. A multi-centre, cross-sectional study was conducted during the academic year 2019/2020 in three Arab countries: Lebanon, Syria, and Tunisia. The study used a validated Arabic version of the Hiroshima University Dental Behavioural Inventory (HU-DBI) composed of original twenty items that assess the level of oral health-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, and four additional dichotomous items related to tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, problematic internet use, and regular dental check-up The HU-DBI score ranges between 0 and 12. A total of 1430 students took part in this study, out of which 60.8% were females, 57.8% were enrolled in clinical years, 24.5% were tobacco smokers, 7.2% were alcohol drinkers, and 87% reported internet addiction. The mean HU-DBI score was 6.31  1.84, with Lebanon having the highest score (6.67  1.83), followed by Syria (6.38  1.83) and Tunisia (6.05  1.83). Clinical students (6.78  1.70) had higher HU-DBI scores than their preclinical peers (5.97  1.86). The year-over-year analysis revealed that dental public health and preventive dentistry courses had significantly and positively impacted the undergraduate students knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours. The gender-based differences were not statistically significant, with a modest trend favouring males, especially oral health behaviours.

Six-hundred and twenty-five articles were identified and after screening, 7 studies matched the inclusion criteria; covering 11 devices measuring SpO2 and/or RR. Studies reported on the reliability (n = 1), convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 2) and predictive validity (n = 2) of SpO2 devices and on the convergent validity (n = 1), concurrent validity (n = 1) and predictive validity (n = 1) of RR devices. SpO2 and RR devices were valid when compared against other respiration monitoring devices but were not precise in predicting exacerbation events. More well-designed measurement studies are needed to make firm conclusions about the accuracy of such devices.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/15412555.2021.1945021 .","output":"The Performance of Digital Monitoring Devices for Oxygen Saturation and Respiratory Rate in COPD: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here we report that negatively charged polysulfates can bind to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 via electrostatic interactions Using a plaque reduction assay, we compare inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 by heparin, pentosan sulfate, linear polyglycerol sulfate (LPGS) and hyperbranched polyglycerol sulfate (HPGS) Highly sulfated LPGS is the optimal inhibitor, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 67 g/mL (approx 1 6 M) This synthetic polysulfates exhibit more than 60-fold higher virus inhibitory activity than heparin (IC50: 4084 g/mL), along with much lower anticoagulant activity Furthermore, in molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that LPGS can bind stronger to the spike protein than heparin, and that LPGS can interact even more with the spike protein of the new N501Y and E484K variants Our study demonstrates that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells can be blocked via electrostatic interaction, therefore LPGS can serve as a blueprint for the design of novel viral inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2","output":"Polysulfates Block SARS-CoV-2 Uptake via Electrostatic Interactions (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, which poses great challenges to patients on maintenance hemodialysis Here we report the clinical features of 66 hemodialysis patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection Design, setting, participants, and measurements Retrospective, single-center case series of the 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 from 1 January to 5 March 2020;the final date of follow-up was 25 March 2020 Results The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with confirmed COVID-19 The incidence of COVID-19 in our center was 11 0% (66/602), of which 18 patients died According to different prognosis, hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were divided into the survival and death group A higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was found in the death group compared with the survival group Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer (p &lt; 05) More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage Furthermore, logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer were independent risk factors for death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1 077;95% CI, 1 014 to 1 439;p = 044;OR, 1 146;95% CI, 1 026 to 1 875;p = 034, OR, 4 974;95% CI, 3 315 to 6 263;p = 007, respectively) Conclusions The potential risk factors of fever, dyspnea, and elevated D-dimer could help clinicians to identify hemodialysis patients with poor prognosis at an early stage of COVID-19 infection","output":"Clinical characteristics and outcome of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19: a large cohort study in a single Chinese center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: International medical electives are a well-established part of the curriculum of many western medical schools. It is widely accepted that these electives contribute to improved clinical examination and communication skills. Overseas electives also exert a strong influence over future career decisions and often pave the way for later international work. Whilst the positive outcomes are known, little information exists regarding elective preferences and destinations overall, information that could help optimise a safe learning experience and maximise the potential for one of the highlights of medical education. In order to obtain analytical data that could assist medical elective framework development, we systematically reviewed the two largest German online databases cataloguing abroad elective testimonies. RESULTS: We identified 856 overseas elective reports uploaded within the last five years. European destinations were the most sought-after choice among German-speaking medical students. Interest in abroad electives in the United States (U.S.), a traditionally popular destination, was much lower than expected. U.S. elective reports accounted for only 3 % of long-term electives. Electives in low- and middle-income countries were generally less popular than electives in high-income countries. General surgery was the most popular elective discipline, followed by Emergency Medicine and Gynaecology and Obstetrics. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a large inhomogeneity in German-speaking medical students elective choices, potentially influenced by financial and organizational aspects as well as geopolitical developments. This highlights a crucial challenge for medical schools and other organizations involved in elective planning. In light of regional differences, our data suggest that a one size fits all preparation is not pertinent to optimize students elective experience. Country- or region-specific pre-departure trainings and more individualized elective frameworks might be necessary to address these differences and to ensure a safe learning experience for students.

Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. Methods: The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. Results: Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines. Conclusions: Since the onset of COVID-19, many pregnant and postpartum women report struggling with stress, depression, and anxiety symptomatology.

During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19.

It was unknown whether this negative messaging could be detrimental to the mental health of older individuals, and whether the relatively uncommon positive messaging about older individuals could benefit their mental health. METHOD: To address these gaps, we designed age-stereotype interventions based on actual news stories that appeared during the pandemic, and divided them into negative and positive versions of what we term personified (i.e., person-based) and enumerative (i.e., number-based) age-stereotype messaging. The negative versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of decline whereas the positive versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of resilience. RESULTS: As expected, the exposure of older individuals to the negative-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly worse mental health (more anxiety and less peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition; in contrast, the positive-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly better mental health (less anxiety and more peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition. The findings were equally strong for the personified and enumerative conditions. Also as expected, the interventions, which were self-irrelevant to the younger participants, did not significantly impact their mental health. DISCUSSION: This is the first-known study to experimentally demonstrate that institutional ageism, and statistics that reflect stereotypes about older individuals, can impact mental health.

Within the nasal airway, T2Rs detect secreted bacterial ligands and initiate bactericidal nitric oxide (NO) responses, which also increase ciliary beat frequency (CBF) and mucociliary clearance of pathogens. Various neuropeptides, including neuropeptide tyrosine (neuropeptide Y or NPY), control physiological processes in the airway including cytokine release, fluid secretion, and ciliary beating. NPY levels and/or density of NPYergic neurons may be increased in some sinonasal diseases. We hypothesized that NPY modulates cilia-localized T2R responses in nasal epithelia. Using primary sinonasal epithelial cells cultured at airCliquid interface (ALI), we demonstrate that NPY reduces CBF through NPY2R activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and attenuates responses to T2R14 agonist apigenin. We find that NPY does not alter T2R-induced calcium elevation but does reduce T2R-stimulated NO production via a PKC-dependent process.

In addition, PubMed was searched for review articles and original research related to the associations between viral infection and asthma, using the search words asthma, viral infections, atopy, development of asthma, rhinovirus (RV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). STUDY SELECTIONS: Articles were selected based on novelty and relevance to our topic of interest, the role of asthma and viral infections, and possible mechanisms to explain the association. RESULTS: There is a large body of evidence demonstrating a link between early viral infections (especially RV and RSV) and asthma inception and exacerbations. RV-induced wheezing is an important risk factor for asthma only when atopy is present, with much evidence supporting the idea that sensitization is a risk factor for early RV-induced wheezing, which in turn is a risk factor for asthma. RSV, on the other hand, is a more important risk factor for nonatopic asthma, with severe infections conferring greater risk. CONCLUSION: There are important differences in the development of atopic and nonatopic asthma, with several proposed mechanisms explaining the association between viral infections and the development of asthma and asthma exacerbations.

The aim and objectives of this knowledge-synthesis study were to identify the impact of the pandemic on childrens and adolescents mental health and to evaluate the effectiveness of different interventions employed during previous and the current pandemic to promote childrens and adolescents mental health. Methodology: We conducted the systematic review according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and included experimental randomized, nonrandomized controlled trials;observational studies;and qualitative studies. Results: Of the 5,828 articles that we retrieved, 18 articles met the inclusion criteria. We thematically analyzed and put up the major findings under the thematic areas of impact of pandemic on children and adolescents mental health. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship problems, academic issues, absenteeism from work). Interventions such as art-based programs, support services, and clinician-led mental health and psychosocial services effectively decrease mental health issues among children and adolescents. Conclusion: Children and adolescents are more likely to experience high rates of depression and anxiety during and after a pandemic. It is critical that future researchers explore effective mental health strategies that are tailored to the needs of children and adolescents. Explorations of effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidence-based, age-appropriate services are vital to lessen the effects and improve long-term capacities for mental health services for children and adolescents.","output":"Mental Health of Children and Adolescents Amidst COVID 19 and Past Pandemics: A Rapid Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Background] The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has brought many adverse effects on the study, daily life, graduation, and job hunting of college students Research data related to the sleep quality and stress load of college students are insufficient in the context of pandemic prevention and control [Objective] This study investigates college students' sleep quality and stress load during the coronavirus disease pandemic, and provide evidence for adjusting their sleep quality and stress load [Methods] Using convenience sampling method, college students from a university in Zhejiang Province were asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) on Wenjuanxing, an online questionnaire survey platform There were 932 valid questionnaires out of 1 000 questionnaires recovered, and the valid recovery rate was 93 20% The PSQI and SOS scores were analyzed by t test and analysis of variance respectively, the correlation by Pearson correlation analysis, and the factors affecting the sleep quality of college students by multiple logistic regression analysis [Results] The respondents' PSQI score (7 902 88) was higher than that of the domestic university student norm during non-pandemic period (5 113 22, n=733) (t=10 34, P 7 (poor sleep quality) (56 87%) The respondents' SOS score was 70 419 87, including 265 high-stress (highest risk) students (28 43%), 229 challenged (low risk) (24 57%), 233 fragile (low risk) (25 00%), and 205 low-stress (lowest risk) (22 00%) The PSQI score and SOS score varied among the college students across different grades (both P &lt; 0 001), and between those from severely or non-severely inflicted areas (both P &lt; 0 001) With the increase of SOS score, PSQI score increased, and there was a positive correlation between them (r=0 542, P &lt; 0 001) The multiple logistic regression analysis results showed that students from severe epidemic areas, sophomores to seniors, and students with high stress load showed poor sleep quality during the pandemic (all P &lt; 0 001) [Conclusion] During the pandemic, the college students' sleep quality is low, and the greater their pressure load, the worse their sleep quality Whether they come from a severely affected area, grade, and stress load are important factors affecting their sleep quality in the context of the current pandemic","output":"Status quo of sleep quality and stress load of students from a college during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the main drivers of firms external competitiveness in times of crisis.

To date, two studies have reported higher binding of the antagonist than the agonist in BC, but in both studies only a limited number of cases were evaluated.

Methods: Binding of 111In-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate (SSTR agonist) and 111In-DOTA-JR11 (SSTR antagonist) to 40 human BC specimens was compared using in vitro autoradiography. SSTR2 immunostaining was performed to confirm SSTR2 expression of the tumor cells. Furthermore, binding of the radiolabeled SSTR agonist and antagonist was analyzed in tissue material from 6 patient-derived xenografts. One patient-derived xenograft, the estrogen receptor-positive model T126, was chosen to generate in vivo mouse models containing orthotopic breast tumors for in vivo SPECT/MRI and biodistribution studies after injection with 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate or 177Lu-DOTA-JR11. Results:111In-DOTA-JR11 binding to human BC tissue was significantly higher than 111In-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate binding (P < 0.001). The median ratio of antagonist binding versus agonist binding was 3.39 (interquartile range, 2-5). SSTR2 immunostaining confirmed SSTR2 expression on the tumor cells.

Methods: The medical records including epidemiological, demographic, clinical, and laboratory data from 49 critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients were collected and analyzed in Huanggang City and Xiaogan City, Hubei Province, outside Wuhan. Results: Sixty-seven percent (33) of patients survived and 33% (16) of patients died in 49 critically ill patients (32 men, 17 women), with a median age of 63 years (IQR 53-73). Univariate analyses indicated that the deceased patients were more often associated with two or more comorbidities, one or more gastrointestinal symptoms, high neutrophil percentage, low lymphocytes and lymphocyte percentage, high C-reactive protein, high procalcitonin, high fasting blood glucose (FBG), and high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared with the survivors; moreover, the patients with T2DM had the higher neutrophil percentage, the lower lymphocyte percentage, and the higher levels of FBG and LDH compared with the patients without T2DM.

However, the incidence, medication use, and outcomes of acute kidney injury have been variably described. We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study to examine the risk factors and correlates associated with acute kidney injury in critically ill adults with a particular focus on medication class usage. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of all adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit between 1 February and 30 August 2020. Acute kidney injury was defined by the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Data included were demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory parameters, interventions, and outcomes. The primary outcome was acute kidney injury incidence. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression model was used to determine risk factors associated with acute kidney injury. Secondary outcomes including acute kidney injury recovery and intensive care unit mortality were analyzed using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Among 226 admitted patients, 108 (47.8%) experienced acute kidney injury. 37 (34.3%), 39 (36.1%), and 32 patients (29.6%) were classified as acute kidney injury stages ICIII, respectively. Among the recovery and mortality cohorts, analgesics/sedatives, anti-infectives, and intravenous fluids were significant (p-value < 0.05). The medication classes IV-fluid electrolytes nutrition (96.7%), gastrointestinal (90.2%), and anti-infectives (81.5%) were associated with an increased odds of developing acute kidney injury, odd ratios: 1.27, 1.71, and 1.70, respectively. Cox regression analyses revealed a significantly increased time-varying mortality risk for acute kidney injury-stage III, hazard ratio: 4.72 (95% confidence interval: 1C22.33). In the recovery cohort, time to acute kidney injury recovery was significantly faster in stage I, hazard ratio: 9.14 (95% confidence interval: 2.14C39.06) cohort when compared to the stage III cohort. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of vital signs, laboratory, and medication use data may be useful to determine acute kidney injury risk stratification. The influence of particular medication classes further impacts the risk of developing acute kidney injury, necessitating the importance of examining pharmacotherapeutic regimens for early recognition of renal impairment and prevention.","output":"Survival and recovery modeling of acute kidney injury in critically ill adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Supragastric belching (SGB) may play a role in the pathophysiology of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-refractoriness in gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). SGB may be present in up to 40% of reflux symptoms in PPI-refractory GERD. Most reports on SGB have come from Western countries, and little is known about the prevalence and relevance of SGB in Asian refractory GERD patients. This study aimed at comparing the role of SGB in GERD patients in Japan and the UK. METHODS We re-analyzed impedance-pH monitoring tracings from patients who were referred to tertiary centers in Japan and the UK due to PPI-refractory reflux symptoms. The prevalence of excessive SGB and the impact of SGB on reflux symptoms were compared between the two countries. RESULTS Impedance-pH tracings from124 Japanese and 83 British patients were re-analyzed. Japanese patients were significantly younger and had smaller body mass index than the British (P < 0.001). Japanese patients had significantly lower prevalence of excessive SGB (18.5%) than the UK (36.1%) irrespective of reflux phenotype (P = 0.006). Logistic regression analysis showed that the geographical/cultural difference was the only factor associated with the different prevalence of SGB (odds ratio; 2.91, 95% CI 1.09-7.73, P = 0.032). SGB were related to typical reflux symptoms very rarely in Japan [0% (0-4.9)] compared to the UK [35% (0-54.1)] (P = 0.071).

However, previous studies were performed in a small number of patients and determined a single cutoff point to make clinical discrimination. The authors sought to test the predictive value of PPV in a large, multicenter study and to express it using a gray zone approach. METHODS The authors studied 413 patients during general anesthesia and mechanical ventilation in four centers. PPV, central venous pressure, and cardiac output were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Response to VE was defined as more than 15% increase in cardiac output after VE. The following approaches were used to determine the gray zones: resampled and two-graph receiver operator characteristic curves. The impact of changes in the benefit-risk balance of VE on the gray zone was also evaluated. RESULTS The authors observed 209 responders (51%) and 204 nonresponders (49%) to VE. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92) for PPV, compared with 0.57 (95% CI: 0.54-0.59) for central venous pressure (P < 10). The gray zone approach identified a range of PPV values (between 9% and 13%) for which fluid responsiveness could not be predicted reliably. These PPV values were seen in 98 (24%) patients. Changes in the cost ratio of VE moderately affected the gray zone limits.

METHODS: We have colelcted 34 PM10 samples in Bergamo area (the epicenter of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic) by using two air samplers over a continuous 3-weeks period. Filters were properly stored and underwent RNA extraction and amplification according to WHO protocols in two parallel blind analyses performed by two different authorized laboratories.

RESULTS: The first test showed positive results for gene E in 15 out of 16 samples, simultaneously displaying positivity also for RdRP gene in 4 samples. The second blind test got 5 additional positive results for at least one ofthe three marker genes. Overall, we tested 34 RNA extractions for the E, N and RdRP genes, reporting 20 positive results for at least one of the three marker genes, with positivity separately confirmed for all the three markers.

Therefore, we sought to determine whether a pre- and post-OSCE could be used to confirm that interns achieved the goals and objectives of the Ambulatory Care rotation. The aims of this study were to determine whether a pre-rotation OSCE can help pharmacy interns self-assess their clinical strengths and weaknesses and assess whether their knowledge and skills improved after completing a post-rotation OSCE. METHODS: Pharmacy interns undergoing APPE Ambulatory Care rotations from September 2018 to March 2020 participated in a pre- and post-rotation OSCE to assess their knowledge of various chronic disease states. Interns completed pre- and post-OSCE surveys to assess their perceptions about their knowledge and the OSCE experience. RESULTS: Pharmacy intern knowledge about diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atrial fibrillation significantly improved post-OSCE compared to their pre-OSCE scores (p < 0.001). The mean post-OSCE scores for diabetes (p < 0.001), dyslipidemia (P = 0.046), anticoagulation (P = 0.006), and the overall mean post-OSCE scores (P = 0.005) were significantly higher compared to interns pre-OSCE scores.

METHODS: We collected data from the electronic medical record from 596 adult patients hospitalized in University Hospital of Liege between March 18 and April 17, 2020, for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. We classified patients into 3 groups according to the underlying respiratory disease, present before the COVID19 pandemic. RESULTS: Among patients requiring hospitalization for COVID19, asthma and COPD accounted for 9.6% and 7.7%, respectively. The proportions of asthmatics, patients with COPD, and patients without obstructive airway disease hospitalized in the ICU were 17.5%, 19.6%, and 14%, respectively. One-third of patients with COPD died during hospitalization, whereas only 7.0% of asthmatics and 13.6% of patients without airway obstruction died due to SARS-CoV2.

Changes are so wide and at a high rate that guidelines and mere scientific knowledge, which are represented by evidence-based medicine, are not sufficient to lead actions, thus the experiential aspects in the configuration of an ethos present as a fundamental part of the resources to deal with critical scenarios, such as a pandemic. In this regard, the recognition of tacit knowledge as a way of teaching and learning skills related to ethical aspects such as principles, virtues, and values, revealed as a fundamental part of the clinical field. The challenge is to strengthen binomial evidence-based medicine and values-based in order to achieve excellence in the health care of the patients and the well-being of the clinical personnel. Method: A 2-fold analysis was conducted taking pediatric endocrinology as an example. First, a systematic review was carried out in electronic databases BIREME, PubMed, and PhilPapers following PEO and PRISMA approaches. A total of 132 articles were garnered. After reading their title and abstract, 30 articles were obtained. Quantitative information was arranged in an Excel database according to three themes: ethics, axiology, and tacit knowledge. A quality criterion that meets our research question was assigned to each article and those which had a quality criterion of 3 (9) were taken to carry out the hermeneutic bioethical analysis, which consisted of three stages, namely na?ve reading, codification, and interpretation. The results were analyzed in Atlas.ti. to elucidate the relations between the three main themes in accordance with the objective. Results: Although there was no difference in the frequency of tacit knowledge skills, including cognitive, social, and technical, for medical practice, there is an intrinsic relationship between epistemic and ethical values with cognitive skills, this means that professionals who practice honesty, authenticity and self-control are capable of seeing patients as persons and thus respect their dignity. This suggested that there is a strong partnership between evidence-based medicine and value-based medicine, which reinforced this binomial as the two feet on which medical practice decisions rested. With regard to tacit knowledge in terms of the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenges refer to (1) adapting and learning a new way of establishing trust with the patient and (2) how to capitalize on the new knowledge that new experiences have posed. Discussion: The analysis of ethical-tacit knowledge in medicine is a recent phenomenon and is in full development. Although no references were found that dealt with any of the main topics in pediatric endocrinology, there is an interest in pediatrics to explore and discuss educational strategies in ethics related to its tacit dimension as a vector of enhancement in the clinical practice.

The observed nitrate aerosols have not exhibited a significant decreasing trend and constituted a major fraction (about 20%) of the total PM2.5, although the surface-measured NO2 concentration has decreased by over 20%. The contributions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) emissions mitigation to the nitrate and PM2.5 concentrations and how to alleviate nitrate aerosols efficiently under the current situation still remains elusive.

RESULTS: COVID-19 vaccination intention in nurses was correlated significantly with vaccine hesitancy (r = .58, p < .001), risk perception of COVID-19 (r =.22, p = .003), perception of vaccination as a professional duty (r = .59, p < .001), and attitude towards workplace infection control policies (r = .20, p = .007). Vaccine hesitancy (? = .40, p < .001) and the perception of vaccination as a professional duty (? = .44, p < .001) significantly influenced COVID-19 vaccination intention. The model developed in this study explained 50% of the variation in COVID-19 vaccination intention. CONCLUSION: Improving the perception of vaccination as a professional duty and lowering vaccine hesitancy may enhance nurses' COVID-19 vaccination intention. Above all, it is necessary to provide programs to encourage voluntary recognition of vaccination as a professional duty and develop strategies to reduce hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccinations.","output":"[Factors Influencing the COVID-19 Vaccination Intentions in Nurses: Korea, February 2021]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework on how to deal with stressors emerging from the COVID-19 outbreak. The theoretical framework aims to explain pandemic-related stressors and potential ways to prevent them, considering a wide range of interacting factors at individual, team and organizational levels to ensure their employees' health. Design/methodology/approach The authors drew on an integrative literature review to identify pandemic-related stressors influenceable by the organization and gathered solution approaches to counteract them. Popular psychological stress theories served as a theoretical base for the framework. Findings The authors based the framework on an integration of the transactional stress theory (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) and the job demands resources model (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004), focusing on their respective theoretical strengths. The final framework offers a solid orientation for scholars regarding the introduction of holistic and strategic measures in coping with pandemic-related stressors. A section describing possibilities for practitioners' use of the framework has been integrated. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to offer a framework on how to handle COVID-19-related stressors in the workplace by implementing teamwide and companywide measures.","output":"Managing COVID-19 in workplaces - a theoretical framework for integral employees' health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the context of covid-19 pandemics, different studies have reported an increase in the occurrence of psychological symptoms in the population, linking the coronavirus outbreak to a mental health epidemic.

During the pandemic most affected countries have implemented online mental health interventions to deal with social distancing and isolation. To this end, it appears necessary to manage long-term impacts of the pandemic on mental health through effective evidence-based therapies, easily administered online. In the present work, mind-body interventions are discussed as an effective tool to this purpose. Particular focus is paid on the link between mental processes and gene expression, through the application of valid new class of mind-body practices: Mind-Body Transformations Therapy (MBT-T) and Creative Psychosocial Genomic Healing Experience (CPGHE).

Without specific antivirals, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. CQ/HCQ entered the Solidarity and RECOVERY clinical trials against COVID-19 and showed lack of efficacy. Importantly, mefloquine is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ and HCQ and has been previously repurposed for other respiratory diseases. Unlike the 4-aminoquinolines that accumulate in the high pH of intracellular lysosomes of the lung, the high respiratory tract penetration of mefloquine is driven by its high lipophilicity. While CQ and HCQ exhibit activity in Vero E6 cells, their activity is obviated in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as Calu-3 cells, which more accurately recapitulate in vivo entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, here we report the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mefloquine in Calu-3 type II pneumocytes and primary human monocytes. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells with low cytotoxicity and EC50 and EC90 values of 1.2 and 5.3 M, respectively. In addition, mefloquine reduced up to 68% the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in infected monocytes, reducing viral-induced inflammation. Mefloquine blocked early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and was less prone than CQ to induce drug-associated viral mutations and synergized with RNA polymerase inhibitor. The pharmacological parameters of mefloquine are consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points that this drug may accumulate in the lungs. These data indicate that mefloquine could represent an orally available clinically approved drug option against COVID-19 and should not be neglected on the basis of the failure of CQ and HCQ.","output":"Unlike Chloroquine, mefloquine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in physiologically relevant cells and does not induce viral variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Incineration has become the main mechanism for hospital waste (HW) disposal in China after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003.

METHODS: In March 2019, we started mobile methadone dispensing in an urban underprivileged locality in Delhi, India. The doctor was available only at the main community drug treatment clinic for clinical services, while the nurse dispensed methadone from a converted ambulance. We involved patients in identifying community leaders for sensitization and in deciding the location and timings for dispensing. We conducted a retrospective chart review of the programme data collected during delivery of clinical services. We compared the numbers of patients registered for methadone therapy and their retention and adherence to therapy in the 12-month periods before and after implementation of the mobile service. FINDINGS: The number of patients registered for therapy at the clinic increased from 167 in the year before implementation to 671 in the year after. A significantly higher proportion of patients were retained in therapy at 3, 6 and 9 months after enrolment; 9-month retention rates were 19% (32/167 patients) and 45% (44/97 patients) in the year before and after implementation, respectively. There was no significant difference in patients adherence to therapy between the two periods. Challenges included providing suitable dispensing hours for patients in employment and concerns of local community near to the dispensing sites.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of acute stroke pathway parameters in all three stroke units in the Alsace region during the first month of the outbreak (1-31 March 2020), using the similar period from 2019 as a comparator. A secondary detailed analysis of all stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions was performed in the centre with the largest case volume. RESULTS: Compared to the same period in 2019, in March 2020 there were 39.6% fewer stroke alerts and 33.3% fewer acute revascularization treatments [40.9% less intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and 27.6% less mechanical thrombectomy (MT)]. No marked variation was observed in the number of stroke unit admissions (-0.6%). The proportion of patients with acute revascularization treatments (IVT or MT) out of the total number of stroke unit admissions was significantly lower in March 2020 (21.3%) compared to 2019 (31.8%), P = 0.034. There were no significant differences in time delays or severity of clinical symptoms for patients treated by IVT or MT, nor in the distribution of final diagnosis amongst stroke alerts and stroke unit admissions.

Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication.

By combing the uncertain events, this paper divides the uncertain factors into three categories. The first is Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU), which refers to the uncertainty of future tourism development and unpredictable effects of tourism policy. The second is geopolitical risk (GPR), which refers to the risks related to armed conflicts or tensions between countries, which are more exogenous than economic and have a huge impact on inbound and outbound tourism. The third is financial stress (FS), which is concentrated to reflect the uncertainty of changes in the financial system to market, which is more likely to cause uncertain effects on the financial aspects of tourism companies' such as investment and cash flow. A comprehensive discussion of these three types of external uncertainties' impact mechanisms on tourism would help tourism companies to prevent and deal with risk events, and is significant for promoting the upgrade of supply-side transformation of the tourism industry. Based on the existing research, the documents provide good academic value about the impacts of uncertain factors on tourism, but only qualitatively or statically. Therefore, there is still a lack of dynamic research. To this end, We introduces a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-SVAR-SV), which extends the constant parameters of the classic SVAR to the stochastic volatility parameters. This model could capture the time-varying changes of variables caused by external shocks, including gradual changes or potential structural mutations, without the need to split the time series into sub-sequences, that makes it possible to study the characteristics of heteroscedasticity, clustering, asymmetry, and periodic effects of tourism variables. Therefore, based on the advantages of the TVP-SVAR-SV, we studies the impact of EPU, GPR and FS on tourism companies in different intervals or at specific points in time, which will help tourism companies better deal with challenges, seize opportunities, and maintain sustainable development.In summary, this paper exploits the financial data of tourism companies to analyze the dynamic impact of three uncertain factors, EPU, GPR, and FS on China's tourism companies. The results show that the economic policy uncertainty has the greatest impact on the scenic enterprises, especially the uncertainty brought by the SARS epidemic, which has a long-term significant negative effect;The geographical risk will have an obvious downward impact on the travel agency enterprises, which tends to increase in the near future, but has a certain positive impact on the scenic and hotel enterprises;The aggravation of financial pressure will bring strong adverse effects to scenic spots and travel agency enterprises, while the alleviation of financial pressure has a positive effect on the development of the two types of enterprises;After the outbreak of highly uncertain events, tourism enterprises will show obvious time-varying lag response, usually more than one year.

Using virally infected cell cultures, we were able to efficiently detect and identify many diverse viruses. Related viral serotypes could be distinguished by the unique pattern of hybridization generated by each virus. Furthermore, by selecting microarray elements derived from highly conserved regions within viral families, individual viruses that were not explicitly represented on the microarray were still detected, raising the possibility that this approach could be used for virus discovery. Finally, by using a random PCR amplification strategy in conjunction with the microarray, we were able to detect multiple viruses in human respiratory specimens without the use of sequence-specific or degenerate primers.

METHODS: At the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, AYAs with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma who are prescribed prolonged maintenance chemotherapy that includes daily oral 6-MP are eligible, along with their matched caregivers. Participants will use an ecological momentary assessment app called ADAPTS (Adherence Assessments and Personalized Timely Support)a version of an open-source app that was modified for AYAs with cancer through a user-centered processand complete surveys in bursts over 6 months. Theory-informed engagement strategies will be microrandomized to estimate the causal effects on proximal survey completion. RESULTS: With funding from the National Cancer Institute and institutional review board approval, of the proposed 30 AYA-caregiver dyads, 60% (18/30) have been enrolled; of the 18 enrolled, 15 (83%) have completed the study so far. CONCLUSIONS: This protocol represents an important first step toward prescreening tailoring variables and engagement components for a just-in-time adaptive intervention designed to promote both 6-MP adherence and mHealth engagement.

However, toxicological and epidemiological studies focusing on the adverse effects of RCFs were still insufficient, particularly in China. We conducted a cross-sectional study to evaluate comprehensively the associations between occupational exposure to RCFs and respiratory health effects among Chinese workers. We measured and calculated cumulative RCFexposure levels of RCFs workers from the biggest RCFs factory in China. In total, 430 RCF-exposed workers and 121 controls were enrolled in this study. Physical examinations of the respiratory system were performed and serum levels of biomarkers including Clara cell protein 16 (CC16), surfactant protein D (SP-D), transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were determined among all subjects. RCF exposure workers showed a higher prevalence rate of respiratory symptoms (cough: 11.9%) and lower levels of small airways function indices (V50 %: 82.71  20.01, maximal mid expiratory flow (MMEF)%: 81.08  19.56) compared with the control group (cough: 5.0%, V50 %: 90.64  24.36, MMEF%: 88.83  24.22).

In response to the first few reported cases of COVID-19, the government of Ghana implemented comprehensive social and public health interventions aimed at containing the disease, albeit its effect on medical education is less clear. Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 has brought changes that may impact the plan of career progression for both students and faculty. Hitherto, medical education had students getting into contact with patients and faculty in a facility setting. Their physical presence in both in-and outpatients' settings has been a tradition of early clinical immersion experiences and the clerkship curriculum. Rotating between departments makes the students potential vectors and victims for COVID-19. COVID-19 has the potential to affect students throughout the educational process. The pandemic has led to a complete paradigm shift in the mode of instruction in a clinical care setting. Inperson training has either been reduced or cancelled in favour of virtual forms of pedagogy. The clinics have also seen a reduction in a variety of surgical and medical cases. This situation may result in potential gaps in their training. Outpatient clinics have transitioned mainly to telemedicine, thus minimizing students' exposure to clinic encounters.

Using a social-ecological framework, this cross-sectional study analyzes the extent to which individual, household, and neighborhood factors are associated with the frequency of IPV among a socially disadvantaged sample of urban ED patients. Confidential survey interviews were conducted with 1037 married/partnered study participants (46% male; 50% Hispanic; 29% African American) at a public safety-net hospital. Gender-stratified multilevel Tobit regression models were estimated for frequency of past-year physical IPV (perpetration and victimization) and frequency of severe IPV. Approximately 23% of participants reported IPV. Among men and women, impulsivity, adverse childhood experiences, substance use, and their spouse/partners hazardous drinking were associated with IPV frequency. Additionally, household food insufficiency, being fired or laid off from their job, perceived neighborhood disorder, and neighborhood demographic characteristics were associated with IPV frequency among women. Similar patterns were observed in models of severe IPV frequency. IPV prevention strategies implemented in urban ED settings should address the individual, household, and neighborhood risk factors that are linked with partner aggression among socially disadvantaged couples.","output":"Frequency of Intimate Partner Violence among an Urban Emergency Department Sample: A Multilevel Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has a page devoted to updates on state alcohol policies adopted in response to the pandemic, but it has no information on the effects of these policies, which include expanded home delivery, curbside pickup, to\\\\go cocktails, and more.

While COVID-19 has overwhelmed healthcare resources (e.g., healthcare personnel, testing resources, hospital beds, and ventilators) in a number of countries, limited research has been conducted to understand spatial accessibility of such resources. This study fills this gap by rapidly measuring the spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources with a particular focus on Illinois, USA. METHOD: The rapid measurement is achieved by resolving computational intensity of an enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method through a parallel computing strategy based on cyberGIS (cyber geographic information science and systems). The E2SFCA has two major steps. First, it calculates a bed-to-population ratio for each hospital location. Second, it sums these ratios for residential locations where hospital locations overlap. RESULTS: The comparison of the spatial accessibility measures for COVID-19 patients to those of population at risk identifies which geographic areas need additional healthcare resources to improve access. The results also help delineate the areas that may face a COVID-19-induced shortage of healthcare resources. The Chicagoland, particularly the southern Chicago, shows an additional need for resources. This study also identified vulnerable population residing in the areas with low spatial accessibility in Chicago. CONCLUSION: Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of healthcare resources provides an improved understanding of how well the healthcare infrastructure is equipped to save people's lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings are relevant for policymakers and public health practitioners to allocate existing healthcare resources or distribute new resources for maximum access to health services.","output":"Rapidly measuring spatial accessibility of COVID-19 healthcare resources: a case study of Illinois, USA"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess the operational experience and knowledge of staff who worked in the West Midlands Flu Response Centre (FRC) during the containment phase of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

The questionnaire included sections related to the respondents' FRC experience, knowledge about influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and the containment phase. RESULTS: This study had a 51% (89/176) response rate. Of the respondents, 59% were female, 64% were of White ethnicity, 55% were clinicians, 46% were aged 25C44 years, and 67% had no previous call centre experience. A significant proportion (P < 0.001) of respondents believed that the FRC had made a positive contribution to the public health management of the containment phase. Nearly all respondents indicated that they were familiar with the terms pandemic flu or influenza pandemic (99%), understood the aim of the containment phase (90%), and knew the severity of the illness caused by the virus (97%). However, specific knowledge was lacking regarding a number of public health interventions, and overall knowledge scores for clinicians and non-clinicians were similar.

Aims of this study focused on the experience of PA during the retirement transition were to understand typologies of PA and possible changes in these typologies, to identify behavioural types relative to PA practice and levels, and to distinguish the main drivers and barriers for practicing PA associated with the different behavioural types. A further goal of the study was to investigate the abovementioned aims considering differences between women and men. Analyses were carried out within a three-year qualitative longitudinal study (2014-2016), which explored the individual experience of PA during the transition from work to retirement of 24 women and 16 men in Italy, with interviews carried out one year before and one and two years after retirement. Results show that preferred PA for both women and men was walking, along the transition to retirement. Over time, several participants replaced physically demanding activities with lighter ones. Six behavioural types were identified, describing individuals who incremented, started, or maintained the same level of PA, people who decreased PA levels or stopped it, and individuals who had a fluctuant behavior towards PA, or who had never practiced it. In general, poor health represented the main barrier to PA. For men, the main driver to PA was its effects on body shape, while for women, socialization/networking.

Since then, a number of observational cohort studies have been carried out to address the main questions: does the use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB increase the risk of contracting the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, and whether the use of RAAS blockers is associated with worse outcomes of COVID-19 disease. The article provides an overview of the scientific evidence on the relationship between the use of RASS blockers and COVID-19 infection. Several cohort studies and two meta-analyzes found no association between prior use of an ACE inhibitor/ARB and the risk of COVID-19 infection (RR 0.96C0.99). In studies on the study of clinical and laboratory features of the action of RAAS blockers in COVID-19, a significantly larger number of subpopulations of T-lymphocytes CD3+ and CD8+, lower concentrations of biomarkers (C-reactive protein, ferritin, IL-6, procalcitonin), as well as a lower viral load. In clinical outcomes, with the use of an ACE inhibitor/ARB, there was a lower incidence of severe/critical forms, and a shorter duration of hospitalization. In large cohort studies with &gt;1000 patients, the use of an ACE inhibitor/ARB was not associated with an increase in the risk of death in patients with COVID-19 (RR &lt; 1.0), and some studies showed a 37C67% decrease in RR. Meta-analyzes also confirmed the absence of the effect of RAAS blockers on the risk of mortality, and in the population of patients with hypertension, a significant reduction in the risk of mortality and severe course of COVID-19 was revealed. Most international associations of specialists, as well as the Russian Cardiological Society, are recommended to continue the use of RAAS blockers in patients with cardiovascular diseases and not to be canceled in case of COVID-19 disease. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to generate new evidence. ? 2021, Remedium Group Ltd.

With the benefit of more data, our understanding of the training-performance puzzle has improved. What were we thinking 20 years ago, and how has our thinking changed over time? Although early investigators attributed overuse injuries to excessive training loads, it has become clear that rapid spikes in training load, above what an athlete is accustomed, explain (at least in part) a large proportion of injuries. In this respect, it appears that overuse injuries may arise from athletes being underprepared for the load they are about to perform. However, a question of interest to both athletic trainers (ATs) and researchers is why some athletes sustain injury at low training loads, while others can tolerate much greater training loads? A higher chronic training load and well-developed aerobic fitness and lower body strength appear to moderate the training-injury relationship and provide a protective effect against spikes in load. The training-performance puzzle is complex and dynamic-at any given time, multiple inputs to injury and performance exist. The challenge facing researchers is obtaining large enough longitudinal data sets to capture the time-varying nature of physiological and musculoskeletal capacities and training-load data to adequately inform injury-prevention efforts. The training-performance puzzle can be solved, but it will take collaboration between researchers and clinicians as well as an understanding that efficacy (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in an idealized or controlled setting) does not equate to effectiveness (ie, how training load affects performance and injury in the real-world setting, where many variables cannot be controlled).","output":"The Training-Performance Puzzle: How Can the Past Inform Future Training Directions?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Members of the China-ASEAN Joint Laboratory for International Cooperation in Traditional Medicine Research used the video conference platform to exchange and discuss the advantages of traditional medicine through the form of score exchange and report, and research and develop the amount and issues of the therapeutic COVID-19 products of concern.

In these challenging times nursing students, facing academic and psychological issues, are advised to use augmented reality applications in the field of health sciences for increasing their motivations and academic performances. The main motive of the study was to examine the acceptance status of nursing students in implementing augmented reality technology in their education and training. The study is a quantitative research study, and it uses the causal-comparative screening method. The data used in the study was collected online from 419 nursing students. The hybrid method was preferred. First, the hypotheses based on the linear relationships were defined between the variables which were then tested by the method of structural equation modeling. Second, the method of artificial neural networks was used to determine the non-linear relationships between the variables. The results show that the nursing students have a high intention of using augmented reality technology as a way of self-learning. It was also found that the most emphasized motive behind this intention is the expectation that using augmented reality technology will increase their academic performance. They also think that AR technology has many potential benefits to offer in the future. It was observed that a considerable number of students already use augmented reality technology for its usefulness and with a hedonic motivation. In conclusion, nursing students have a high acceptance of using augmented reality technology during their education and training process. Since we live in a world where e-learning and self-learning education/training have become widespread, it is estimated that students will demand augmented reality applications as a part of holistic education, and as an alternative to traditional textbooks.","output":"Assessing acceptance of augmented reality in nursing education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chromatin Interaction Analysis Using Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) is an established method to map protein-mediated chromatin interactions. A limitation, however, is that it requires a hundred million cells per experiment, which hampers its broad application in biomedical research, particularly in studies in which it is impractical to obtain a large number of cells from rare samples. To reduce the required input cell number while retaining high data quality, we developed an in situ ChIA-PET protocol, which requires as few as 1 million cells. Here, we describe detailed step-by-step procedures for performing in situ ChIA-PET from cultured cells, including both an experimental protocol for sample preparation and data generation and a computational protocol for data processing and visualization using the ChIA-PIPE pipeline. As the protocol significantly simplifies the experimental procedure, reduces ligation noise, and decreases the required input of cells compared to previous versions of ChIA-PET protocols, it can be applied to generate high-resolution chromatin contact maps mediated by various protein factors for a wide range of human and mouse primary cells. ? 2021 The Authors.

Declining demand for firms' output has caused significant financial stress for all kinds of firms worldwide. Production that requires environmental measures usually gets constrained when firms, especially small and medium-sized firms (SMEs), have difficulty in accessing credit. Firms thus face the dilemma of whether to continue environmental behaviors or to fulfill financial commitments to suppliers, employees, and so on. As such, an empirical question is whether the economic consequences of COVID-19 vary by firms types and their environmental behaviors. Using 4,888 sample firms from 14 EU member states, this study finds evidence that the severity of damage caused by COVID-19 depends on firm size and whether firms invested in pollution abatement techniques. Specifically, eco-friendly firms perform better during the COVID-19 pandemic, and SMEs are less vulnerable than large firms. In particular, eco-friendly SMEs are less affected by the pandemic than conventional SMEs and large firms. These findings are probably related to the efficacy of government relief programs targeted to eco-friendly SMEs and/or the healthy financial status of these firms prior to the pandemic.","output":"Are environmentally friendly firms more vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global emergence of an unusual viral pneumonia of COVID-19 epidemic was firstly started in Wuhan city, Hubei province in China in December 2019.

METHODS: This was a cohort study with retrospective comparison of 14,780 in-person encounters and 2,589 telehealth encounters, including 2,093 audio-video telemedicine and 496 scheduled telephone encounters, between October 1, 2019 and April 24, 2020. We compared in-person and telehealth encounters for patient demographics and diagnoses. For audio-video telemedicine encounters, we analyzed questionnaire responses addressing provider experience, follow-up plans, technical quality, need for in-person assessment, and parent/caregiver satisfaction. We performed manual reviews of encounters flagged as concerning by providers. RESULTS: There were no differences in patient age and major ICD-10 codes before and after transition. Clinicians considered telemedicine satisfactory in 93% (1,200 of 1,286) of encounters and suggested telemedicine as a component for follow-up care in 89% (1,144 of 1,286) of encounters. Technical challenges were reported in 40% (519 of 1,314) of encounters. In-person assessment was considered warranted after 5% (65 of 1,285) of encounters. Patients/caregivers indicated interest in telemedicine for future care in 86% (187 of 217) of encounters. Participation in telemedicine encounters compared to telephone encounters was less frequent among patients in racial or ethnic minority groups. CONCLUSIONS: We effectively converted most of our outpatient care to telehealth encounters, including mostly audio-video telemedicine encounters. Providers rated the vast majority of telemedicine encounters to be satisfactory, and only a small proportion of encounters required short-term in-person follow-up.

Association of exposure to different types of greenspace were reported for nine different behavioral outcomes including total behavioral difficulties (n = 16), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms and severity (n = 15), ADHD diagnosis (n = 10), conduct problems (n = 10), prosocial behavior (n = 10), emotional symptoms (n = 8), peer-relationship problems (n = 8), externalizing disorders (n = 6), and internalizing disorders (n = 5). Most of the reported associations (except for conduct problems) were suggestive of beneficial association of greenspace exposure with children's behaviors; however, the studies were heterogeneous in terms of their exposure indicators, study design, and the outcome definition.","output":"Greenspace exposure and children behavior: A systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the established cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2. However, it is unclear whether ACE1 inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) or angiotensin receptor blockers (e.g., losartan) alter tissue ACE2 expression. This study sought to determine whether lisinopril or losartan, as monotherapies or in combination, change tissue levels of ACE2 in healthy male and female mice. Mice were treated for 21 days with drinking water containing lisinopril (10 mg/kg/day), losartan (10 mg/kg/day), or both. A control group was given water without drug. ACE2 protein index, the ratio of ACE2 protein to total protein, was determined on tissues from the small intestine, lung, kidney, and brain. Oral lisinopril increased ACE2 protein index across all tissues (p < 0.0001 vs vehicle control). In contrast, the combination of lisinopril plus losartan did not increase ACE2 levels in any tissue (p = 0.89 vs vehicle control), and even decreased tissue expression of the Ace2 gene compared to controls (p = 0.0004). In a second cohort evaluated twenty-one days after cessation of drug treatment, the group previously treated with lisinopril had higher ACE2 than the group previously treated with vehicle control (p = 0.02). ACE2 protein index differed across tissues (p < 0.0001). Across both cohorts, plasma ACE2 did not correlate with ACE2 protein index in any tissue; however, a sex difference was observed: kidney ACE2 levels were higher in males than females (p < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that oral lisinopril increases ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in tissues that are relevant to the transmission and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Remarkably, the addition of losartan prevented lisinopril-induced increases in ACE2 across tissues. These results suggest that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers interact to determine tissue levels of ACE2.","output":"Oral Lisinopril Raises Tissue Levels of ACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor, in Healthy Male and Female Mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARSCoV)-2 is a zoonotic viral pathogen belonging to the same family as SARS-CoV. To the best of our knowledge, no case that was receiving mepolizumab for severe asthma and that developed COVID-19 has been reported to date in literature. In September 2020, a 61-year-old male patient undergoing monthly mepolizumab treatment for the last 6 months, in addition to his current asthma treatment, was admitted to our clinic with complaints of high fever (38- 38.5C), loss of senses of taste for 3-4 days, as well as nonproductive cough and shortness of breath. Patchy ground-glass densities were observed in basal parts of lower lobes of both lungs, and the patient recorded a positive nasopharyngeal real-time PCR SARS-CoV-2 test. The patient was initiated on hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and an anticoagulant, and home quarantine was recommended. The patient's complaints had relieved significantly by day 5 of the treatment. There is a need for larger and more extensive studies on the effect of medications used for the treatment of patients with severe asthma on COVID-19 infection, and due to its antiviral effects, the potential favorable contribution of mepolizumab to the treatment of COVID-19 infection in this patient group should be monitored.

This study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of intravenous dexmedetomidine in mechanically ventilated children in the intensive care unit (ICU) after neurosurgery. Pediatric patients aged 2-12 years, who were mechanically ventilated in ICU after neurosurgery, were allocated into a low-dose (n = 15) or high-dose (n = 14) group. The low-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.25 g/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.25 g/kg/h for 50 min, whereas the high-dose group received dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 0.5 g/kg for 10 min, followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 g/kg/h for 50 min. Serial blood samples were collected for a pharmacokinetic analysis up to 480 min after the end of the infusion. The sedative effect of dexmedetomidine was assessed using the Bispectral Index and University of Michigan Sedation Scale. Adverse reactions, electrocardiography findings, and vital signs were monitored for a safety assessment. A population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effects modeling. Dexmedetomidine induced a moderate-to-deep degree of sedation during infusion in both groups. The pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine were best described by a two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination kinetics. The parameters were standardized for a body weight of 70 kg using an allometric power model. The population estimates (95% confidence interval) per 70 kg body weight were as follows: clearance of 81.0 (72.9-90.9) L/h, central volume of distribution of 64.2 (50.6-81.0) L, intercompartment clearance of 116.4 (90.6-156.0) L/h, and peripheral volume of distribution of 167 (132-217) L. No serious adverse reactions or hemodynamic changes requiring the discontinuation of dexmedetomidine were observed. Dexmedetomidine had increased clearance and volume of distribution in mechanically ventilated children in ICU after neurosurgery, thereby indicating the need to adjust the dosage to obtain a target plasma concentration.","output":"A Population Pharmacokinetic Model of Intravenous Dexmedetomidine for Mechanically Ventilated Children after Neurosurgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A wide spectrum of clinical manifestations has become a hallmark of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) COVID-19 pandemic, although the immunological underpinnings of diverse disease outcomes remain to be defined.

More notably, critically ill patients displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation and shared B cell repertoire features previously described in autoimmune settings. Extrafollicular activation correlated strongly with large antibody-secreting cell expansion and early production of high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies. Yet, these patients had severe disease with elevated inflammatory biomarkers, multiorgan failure and death. Overall, these findings strongly suggest a pathogenic role for immune activation in subsets of patients with COVID-19.

Despite efforts to limit the viral transmission, the vaccine is the only solution to ending the pandemic. However, vaccine hesitancy could reduce coverage and hinder herd immunity. OBJECTIVE: People's intention to get vaccinated can be shaped by several factors, including risk perception which, in turn, is influenced by affect. The present work aimed at investigating how risk perception and some factors associated with the decision to comply with vaccination modulated vaccine acceptance for COVID-19 as compared to seasonal influenza, and how these have varied during the lockdown phases. METHOD: The study followed the main phases of the emergency in Italy, investigating the intention to get vaccinated against flu and against SARS-CoV-2 (if a vaccine was available) before, during and after the first national lockdown, covering the period from the end of February to the end of June 2020. We investigated the effect of risk perception and other predictors on the decision of getting vaccinated. RESULTS: Compared to the pre-lockdown phase, during the lockdown more people were willing to get vaccinated for COVID-19, regardless of their beliefs about vaccines, and as risk perception increased, so did the intention to accept the vaccine. The acceptance of the flu vaccine increased after the re-opening phase. In addition, the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and against flu increased if there was previous flu vaccination behavior but decreased with increasing doubts about the vaccines in general. CONCLUSIONS: The observation of vaccination intentions across the three main phases of the emergency allows important considerations regarding psychological, affect, and demographic determinants useful to tailor public health communication to improve public response to future epidemics.","output":"Associations of COVID-19 risk perception with vaccine hesitancy over time for Italian residents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"La pandemia COVID-19 causada por el virus SARS-CoV-2 ha causado decenas de miles de muertos en Espa?a y logrado colapsar los hospitales de la red sanitaria en la Comunidad de Madrid, debido en gran parte a su particular tendencia a causar neumonas graves con necesidad de soporte ventilatorio Este hecho ha ocasionado el colapso de nuestro centro, llegando a tener una ocupacin del 130% de sus camas por enfermos COVID-19, y causando por tanto el cese absoluto de actividad del servicio de urologa, la prctica desaparicin de la docencia de los residentes y la incorporacin de buena parte de la plantilla de urologa al grupo de personal mdico que atiende a estos pacientes Para la recuperacin de esta elevada cantidad de actividad suspendida ser necesaria una priorizacin de la patologa en base a criterios puramente clnicos, para la cual se proponen tablas que recogen la relevancia de cada patologa dentro de cada rea de la urologa Herramientas brindadas por la tecnologa como la formacin online o los simuladores quirrgicos podrn ser tiles para la necesaria restitucin de la formacin de residentes The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused tens of thousands of deaths in Spain and has managed to breakdown the healthcare system hospitals in the Community of Madrid, largely due to its tendency to cause severe pneumonia, requiring ventilatory support This fact has caused our center to collapse, with 130% of its beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, thus causing the absolute cessation of activity of the urology service, the practical disappearance of resident training programs, and the incorporation of a good part of the urology staff into the group of medical personnel attending these patients In order to recover from this extraordinary level of suspended activity, we will be obliged to prioritize pathologies based on purely clinical criteria, for which tables including the relevance of each pathology within each area of urology are being proposed Technology tools such as online training courses or surgical simulators may be convenient for the necessary reestablishment of resident education","output":"Impacto de la pandemia COVID-19 en el servicio de urologa de un centro de referencia en la Comunidad de Madrid"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CHINA C Werken met de feestdagen: voor zorgverleners is het heel gewoon.

METHODS New-onset episodes of psychiatric disorders were assessed among 139 health care workers by using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale. Past history of psychiatric illness, years of health care experience, and the perception of adequate training and support were tested as predictors of the incidence of new-onset episodes of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak. RESULTS The lifetime prevalence of any depressive, anxiety, or substance use diagnosis was 30%. Only one health care worker who identified the SARS experience as a traumatic event was diagnosed as having PTSD. New episodes of psychiatric disorders occurred among seven health care workers (5%). New episodes of psychiatric disorders were directly associated with a history of having a psychiatric disorder before the SARS outbreak (p=.02) and inversely associated with years of health care experience (p=.03) and the perceived adequacy of training and support (p=.03). CONCLUSIONS Incidence of new episodes of psychiatric disorders after the SARS outbreak were similar to or lower than community incidence rates, which may indicate the resilience of health care workers who continued to work in hospitals one to two years after the SARS outbreak. In preparation for future events, such as pandemic influenza, training and support may bolster the resilience of health care workers who are at higher risk by virtue of their psychiatric history and fewer years of health care experience.","output":"Prevalence of psychiatric disorders among Toronto hospital workers one to two years after the SARS outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the discovery, over a decade and a half ago, that genetically engineered DNA can be delivered in vaccine form and elicit an immune response, there has been much progress in understanding the basic biology of this platform.

AIMS OF THE STUDY: We captured reflections, contingencies, and current practices across of high-volume centers in cardiac and aortic surgery globally. We also aimed this study to assess decision on prioritization of the surgical patients, the need for personal protection equipment, and the choice of preoperative investigations in current dynamic and fluid climate. METHODS: A validated web-based questionnaire was constructed and was circulated to the international surgeons amongst high volume cardiac and aortic surgery centers. Their intrinsic feedback on decision making, the impact of the lockdown, and perspectives for the future ahead of us all were noted. A mixed-method approach was constructed. Qualitative data analysis was introduced to signify the impact globally. RESULTS: Overall, 23 centers from 18 countries participated in this international study. About 91.7% of the respondents stopped operating on elective patients during the pandemic. The majority of the surgeons agreed that acute aortic dissection (87.1%) should be operated as an emergency procedure and stable triple vessel disease (87.1%) to be considered as an elective procedure. Three-fifth (60%) of the respondents relied on computerized tomography chest as a preoperative screening modality. CONCLUSION: In the present climate where there is a paucity of evidence, this will give an interim consensus for the cardiac surgeons.

The primary outcomes were anti-spike antibody level >4160 AU/ml (neutralization-associated cutoff) and any seropositivity. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify variables associated with antibody response. T-cell response was evaluated in a subset of participants. Results were compared to a control group of 56 healthcare workers. Among KTRs, we found a seropositivity rate of 70% (133/190) after the third dose (37%, 70/190, after the second vaccine dose); and 27% (52/190) achieved levels above 4160 AU/ml after the third dose, compared to 93% of controls.

The comparisons were performed with the t test, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher exact test or the chi-squared test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results All of the cases were under the circumstance of sufficient medical staff and medical supplies. The rate of coexisting disease was lower in the severe COVID-19 group than in the severe H7N9 group (p < 0.05). Radiologically, severe COVID-19 patients had less consolidation and pleural effusion, but more crazy-paving pattern than severe H7N9 patients (p < 0.05). Clinically, compared to severe H7N9, severe COVID-19 patients were more inclined to surfer to relative better disease severity score, less secondary bacterial infection, a shorter time to beginning absorption on CT, but a longer duration of viral shedding from the admission (p < 0.05). Although more severe H7N9 patients needed non-invasive respiratory support, these two groups ultimately yielded comparable mortality.

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III, 1988-1994) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is a cross-sectional study, and proteinuria and frailty were measured only once at enrollment. The study included 2,272 participants with MetS aged 40-90 years from the NHANES III. The participants underwent assessments to evaluate frailty and frailty components (low body weight, weakness, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow walking). Proteinuria was represented as albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) (mg/g) and divided into tertiles: T1-normal range (ACR <30 mg/g), T2-microalbuminuria (ACR 30-299 mg/g), and T3-macroalbuminuria (ACR  300 mg/g). We applied multiple logistic regression to determine the odds ratios (ORs) of frailty for T2 vs. T1 and T3 vs. T1 in both sexes. In the adjusted analysis for male participants, the ORs of frailty for T2 and T3 vs. T1 were 3.106 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.078-8.948, P = 0.036) and 14.428 (95% CI = 4.231-49.193, P < 0.001), respectively.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Improved cleaning and patient management practices between April and August 2020 were associated with a substantial reduction of SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR positivity (from 11% to 2%) in hospital surface samples. Even though we recovered near-complete genome sequences in some, none of the positive samples (11 of 224 total) caused cytopathic effects in cultured cells suggesting this nucleic acid was either not associated with intact virions, or they were present in insufficient numbers for infectivity. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 genomes of the positive samples were derived from hospitalized patients. Genomic sequences isolated from qRT-PCR negative samples indicate a superior sensitivity of viral detection by sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the low likelihood that SARS-CoV-2 contamination on hospital surfaces contains infectious virus, disputing the importance of fomites in COVID-19 transmission. Ours is the first report on recovering near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences directly from environmental surface swabs.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 detection and genomic sequencing from hospital surface samples collected at UC Davis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Horizontal transfer of genetic elements is a common phenomenon in nature. Both prokaryotes, eukaryotes and viruses have been shown to contain genetic elements acquired through horizontal transfer. Some of these elements may be retained over long periods of time after being integrated into the recipient genome because they offer a selective advantage. The genetic element s2m has been acquired through horizontal transfer by many distantly related viruses, including the SARS-related coronaviruses. Here we show that s2m is evolutionarily conserved within this cluster of viruses and that while several short-lived SARS-CoV-2 lineages devoid of the element have been sequenced, there do not appear to be any species-level losses. This pattern strongly suggests that s2m is essential to virus replication in SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses, and that further experiments are needed to characterize its function.","output":"No Species-level Losses of the Horizontally Transferred Genetic Element s2m Within the SARS-related Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article author talks about the staff nurse who are facing problem because of coronavirus Topics include the survival as a nurse centres on inner belief in the clinical skills, the belief in the clinical relationship skills with patients, the COVID-19 pandemic, both personally and as a nurse, and the exception and many of the feel unable to put ourselves forward for promotion or clinical leadership or professional development","output":"From staff nurse to nurse consultant: Survival Guide part 11: Surviving self-doubt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen derivative which enables intercontinental transport of dispatchable renewable energy.

Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) progresses despite androgen depletion therapy. The mechanisms of resistance are yet to be fully discovered. However, it is hypothesized that androgens depletion enables androgen-independent cells to proliferate and recolonize the tumor. Objectives: Natural bioactive compounds from edible plants and herbal remedies might potentially address this need. This review compiles the available cheminformatics-based studies and the translational studies regarding the use of natural products to manage CRPC. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar searches for preclinical studies were performed, while ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed were searched for clinical updates. Studies that were not in English and not available as full text were excluded. The period of literature covered was from 1985 to the present. Results and Conclusion: Our analysis suggested that natural compounds exert beneficial effects due to their broad-spectrum molecular disease-associated targets. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed several bioactive compounds, including rutaecarpine, berberine, curcumin, other flavonoids, pentacyclic triterpenoids, and steroid-based phytochemicals. Molecular modeling tools, including machine and deep learning, have made the analysis more comprehensive. Preclinical and clinical studies on resveratrol, soy isoflavone, lycopene, quercetin, and gossypol have further validated the translational potential of the natural products in the management of prostate cancer.","output":"Natural Product-Based Studies for the Management of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Computational to Clinical Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: With the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Irish health system needed a contact tracing and management intervention at a national level to undertake high volume, low complexity contact tracing. This paper describes the establishment and first year of a national Contact Management Programme (CMP) in Ireland, its core components, outcomes on key measures (coverage, timeliness, and training) and learnings from the process. Methods: : CMP is centred on four steps, 1) case: rapid notification to a person of a result and provision of advice, 2) contacts: rapid identification of contacts, 3) control: rapid public health management of contacts, which includes testing and 4) active follow-up of close contacts with additional testing and public health advice reminder SMS and calls. The outcome measures used in this study are: 1) The proportion of all Irish cases contact traced through the CMP (Coverage), 2) the time taken to complete the 3 types of CMP calls (timeliness), 3) number of contact tracers trained and their feedback (training). Results: : 246,666 positive cases were recorded using the CMP between 17th March 2020 and 30th April 2021, with contact tracing successfully completed for 237,759 cases, representing 99% and 96%, respectively, of the 248,529 cases notified in Ireland up to the 30th of April 2021. The average time taken for contact tracing to be completed was 29.4 hours (95% CI 28.9, 29.9) and the median was 16.8 hours (approximate 95% CI 15.9, 17.7). Conclusion: Using the Quality Improvement (QI) approach, the Health Service Executive (HSE) successfully established and scaled up a Contact Management Programme that rapidly notified results to people and traced their close contacts. CMP contributed to the success of the Irish health service in managing the pandemic. CMP slowed COVID-19 transmission and lessened the impact on health services capacity.","output":"An overview of the establishment of a national contact tracing programme: a quality improvement approach in a time of pandemic (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose To evaluate the difference in mortality of patients treated with ivermectin vs patients treated with remdesivir with COVID-19 in United States using TriNetX Research network, a federated EMR network of over 44 healthcare organizations and 68 million patients from US, from 2009-2021. Methods & Materials We retrospectively identified adults (18 years) with a recorded COVID-19 infection between January 1, 2020 and July 11, 2021. We compared those with recorded use of ivermectin, but not remdesivir, against those with recorded use of remdesivir, but not ivermectin. We controlled for the following demographics, comorbidities, and treatments that may affect COVID-19 survival outcomes: age, gender, race, ethnicity, nicotine use diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic lower respiratory disease, ischemic heart diseases, tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, or ventilator use. We measured association with mortality as the primary outcome, with significance assessed at p<0.05. Results There were a total of 1,761,060 possible COVID-19 patients based on ICD-10 diagnostic terms and confirmatory lab results. Prior to controlling, our analysis yielded 41,608 patients who had COVID-19 resulting in two unique cohorts that were treated with either ivermectin (1,072) or remdesivir (40,536). Within the ivermectin cohort, average age was 51.9 + 17.8 years, 43% were male, 60% had glucocorticoids and 1% required ventilator support. In the remdesivir cohort, average age was 62.0 + 16.0 years, 54% were male, 64% had glucocorticoids and 2% required ventilator support. After using propensity score matching and adjusting for potential confounders, ivermectin was associated with reduced mortality vs remdesivir (OR 0.308, 95% CI (0.198,0.479)),Risk Difference -5.224%, CI (-7.079%,-3.369%), p <0.0001. Conclusion Ivermectin use was associated with decreased mortality in patients with COVID-19 compared to remdesivir. To our knowledge, this is the largest association study of patients with COVID-19, mortality and ivermectin. Further double-blinded placebo-controlled RCTs with large samples are required for definite conclusion.

The COVID-19 outbreak has led to important mobility restrictions and a dramatic re-adjustment of social habits and health systems. We aimed to assess the influence of the outbreak and mobility restrictions on the HRQoL of IBD patients with stable clinical remission on biologic treatment. We also sought to explore their self-perceived stress scores during the outbreak. METHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study in IBD patients on biologic treatment and stable clinical remission. Both Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis patients were included. Patients filled the IBDQ9 and the Perceived stress scale (PSS) electronically. To determine any changes, we compared the results of the IBDQ9 during the outbreak with the last IBDQ9 before the outbreak. RESULTS: We included 106 patients in clinical remission, with a median age of 42, 42% female, and 77% had CD. Median preCOVID-19 IBDQ9 was 72.1[66.5-80.12] and during the outbreak decreased to 69.2 [63.1-77.10] (p<0.001). The median PSS score was 12 [9-19]. There was a significant negative correlation between the PSS and the outbreak IBDQ9 (r=-0.66, p< 0.001). Regression analysis showed that the PSS score was associated with a lower IBDQ-9 during the outbreak(p<0.001) Conclusion: There is a negative impact of the COVID19 outbreak on the HRQoL of IBD patients in remission, with higher self-perceived stress scores associated with a lower QoL.

Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) play essential roles in viral RNA synthesis, and thus remains the target of choice for the prophylactic or curative treatment of several viral diseases, due to high sequence and structural conservation. To date, the most promising broad-spectrum class of viral RdRp inhibitors are nucleoside analogues (NAs), with over 25 approved for the treatment of several medically important viral diseases. However, Coronaviruses stand out as a particularly challenging case for NA drug design due to the presence of an exonuclease (ExoN) domain capable of excising incorporated NAs and thus providing resistance to many of these available antivirals. Here we use the available structures of the SARS-CoV RdRp and ExoN proteins, as well as Lassa virus N exonuclease to derive models of catalytically competent SARS-CoV-2 enzymes. We then map a promising NA candidate, GS-441524 (the active metabolite of Remdesivir) to the nucleoside active site of both proteins, identifying the residues important for nucleotide recognition, discrimination, and excision. Interestingly, GS-441524 addresses both enzyme active sites in a manner consistent with significant incorporation, delayed chain termination, and altered excision due to the ribose 1'-CN group, which may account for the increased antiviral effect compared to other available analogues. Additionally, we propose structural and function implications of two previously identified RdRp resistance mutations in relation to resistance against Remdesivir. This study highlights the importance of considering the balance between incorporation and excision properties of NAs between the RdRp and ExoN.","output":"Remdesivir and SARS-CoV-2: Structural requirements at both nsp12 RdRp and nsp14 Exonuclease active-sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reversible circuits are one of the technologies that can provide future low energy circuits.

Abstracts and unpublished literature were not included. The definition of ALI accords to ESVS guidelines. Results Most identified papers were case reports or case series; population-based data and data from randomised controlled trials were also identified, 114 unique and relevant papers were retrieved. Data were conflicting concerning whether the incidence of ALI increased, or remained unchanged, during the pandemic. Case reports and series reported ALI in patients who were younger and healthier than usual, and a greater proportion affecting the upper limb. Whether this is coincidental remains uncertain. The proportion of men/women affected seems unchanged. Most reported cases were in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19. Patients with ALI as their first manifestation of COVID-19 were reported. Patients with ALI have a worse outcome if they have a simultaneous COVID-19 infection. High levels of D-dimer may predict the occurrence of arterial thromboembolic events in patients with COVID-19. Heparin resistance was observed. Anticoagulation should be given to hospitalized COVID-19 patients in prophylactic dosage. Most of the treatment recommendations of the ESVS Guidelines remained relevant, but the following were modified regarding COVID-19 patients with ALI: 1) CTA imaging before revascularisation should include the entire aorta and iliac arteries. 2) There should be a high index of suspicion, early testing for COVID-19 infection and protective measures are advised. 3) Preferential use of local or locoregional anaesthesia during revascularisation.

Furthermore, we aimed to explore the mechanism that m1A regulators modulate the functions of certain immune cells as well as the downstream target genes, participating in the progression of AAA. METHODS: Based on the gene expression profiles of the GSE47472 and GSE98278 datasets, differential expression analysis focusing on m1A regulators was performed on the combined dataset to identify differentially expressed m1A regulatory genes (DEMRGs). Additionally, CIBERSORT tool was utilized in the analysis of the immune infiltration landscape and its correlation with DEMRGs. Moreover, we validated the expression levels of DEMRGs in human AAA tissues by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was also applied in the validation of cellular localization of YTHDF3 in AAA tissues. Furthermore, we established LPS/IFN- induced M1 macrophages and ythdf3 knockdown macrophages in vitro, to explore the relationship between YTHDF3 and macrophage polarization. At last, RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (RIP-Seq) combined with PPI network analysis was used to predict the target genes of YTHDF3 in AAA progression. RESULTS: Eight DEMRGs were identified in our study, including YTHDC1, YTHDF1-3, RRP8, TRMT61A as up-regulated genes and FTO, ALKBH1 as down-regulated genes. The immune infiltration analysis showed these DEMRGs were positively correlated with activated mast cells, plasma cells and M1 macrophages in AAA. RT-qPCR analysis also verified the up-regulated expression levels of YTHDC1, YTHDF1, and YTHDF3 in human AAA tissues. Besides, IF staining result in AAA adventitia indicated the localization of YTHDF3 in macrophages. Moreover, our in-vitro experiments found that the knockdown of ythdf3 in M0 macrophages inhibits macrophage M1 polarization but promotes macrophage M2 polarization. Eventually, 30 key AAA-related target genes of YTHDF3 were predicted, including CD44, mTOR, ITGB1, STAT3, etc. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that m1A regulation is significantly associated with the pathogenesis of human AAA. The m1A reader, YTHDF3, may participate in the modulating of macrophage polarization that promotes aortic inflammation, and influence AAA progression by regulating the expression of its target genes.","output":"N1-Methyladenosine (m1A) Regulation Associated With the Pathogenesis of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Through YTHDF3 Modulating Macrophage Polarization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This manuscript aims to present a treatment algorithm we applied to manage COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study. The participants were recruited by the snowball sampling method, and the data were collected by means of a link sent to their smartphones through their social media accounts. This study included 211 households with at least 1 child. RESULTS: The study revealed that 21.8% households had food insecurity that was not at the hunger threshold. The monthly income of 80.6% of the households was below the poverty line and monthly income decreased in more than half of the households during the pandemic. Food insecurity increased 2.5 times when the households comprised workers or self-employed individuals (odds ratio [OR] = 2.529; P = 0.002), increased 3 times when the monthly income of the households decreased (OR = 3.131; P = 0.000), and increased 2 times when total monthly income of the household fell below poverty line during the pandemic (OR = 2.001; P = 0.049).

The goal of this present study was to develop operational prototypes of 3-dimensional (3-D) printed vitrification devices with innovative components that can provide comprehensive functionalities for practical repository development for aquatic species. The design featured an elongated loop to suspend a thin film of sperm sample in cryoprotectant, a retractable sleeve to protect the vitrified samples and allow permanent labeling, a handle to facilitate processing and storage, and a shaft with annular grooves to guide positioning of the protective retractable sleeve. To span a wide range of sample capacities and configurations, a total of 39 different configurations (3 loop lengths 13 loop heights) were fabricated by 3-D printing with the thermoplastics polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). A total of 86 devices were fabricated with ABS filament with a print failure rate of 9%, and 97 devices were fabricated with PLA filament with a failure rate of 20%. Major types of printing failures included disconnected loops, insufficient build surface adhesion, stringing, and inconsistent extrusion. The sample volume capacity ranged from 1-47 L and had linear relationships to the loop lengths and layer numbers. Vitrified samples were observed in 10-mm and 15-mm loops fabricated with PLA and ABS but not in 20-mm loops. This study demonstrated the feasibility of development of standardized low-cost ($0.05 material cost) devices fabricated by 3-D printing with practical functions including vitrification, volume control, labeling, protection, and storage within conventional systems. These prototypes can be further developed, standardized, and used to assist development of germplasm repositories to protect the genetic resources of aquatic species by user groups such as breeders, hatcheries, aquariums, and researchers.","output":"3-D Printed Customizable Vitrification Devices for Preservation of Genetic Resources of Aquatic Species"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants threatens efforts to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in India has risen steeply, and a SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.617, is believed to be responsible for many of these cases. The spike protein of B.1.617 harbors two mutations in the receptor binding domain, which interacts with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and constitutes the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, we analyze whether B.1.617 is more adept in entering cells and/or evades antibody responses. B.1.617 enters two of eight cell lines tested with roughly 50% increased efficiency and is equally inhibited by two entry inhibitors. In contrast, B.1.617 is resistant against bamlanivimab, an antibody used for COVID-19 treatment. B.1.617 evades antibodies induced by infection or vaccination, although less so than the B.1.351 variant. Collectively, our study reveals that antibody evasion of B.1.617 may contribute to the rapid spread of this variant.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.617 is resistant to bamlanivimab and evades antibodies induced by infection and vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients refrain from seeking medical help in the time of COVID-19 due to the fear of getting infected Hospitals are overloaded with limited beds, interfering with inpatients stays Awareness of first aid management of fractures among the general population has been neglected Thus, the aim of this study is to assess the knowledge of the selected population regarding fractures' first aid, and their readiness to seek medical help before and during the time of quarantine Methodology: Cross sectional vignette-Based study among Saudi population of Al-Ahasa Data processed via SPSS using two tailed tests A total of 1005 respondents were included in this study Results: Good awareness was detected among 520 (51 7%) participants Before pandemic, (83 7%) reported that they will Call the ambulance immediately, and only (15 1%) Consult a doctor without visiting the hospital (telemedicine) During the pandemic, (41 5%) told that they can call ambulance while the majority (57 3%;576) told that they Consult a doctor without visiting the hospital (telemedicine) Men had significantly good awareness level regarding fracture first aids compared to women Similarly, health care related participants had significantly good awareness level regarding fracture first aids compared to others","output":"Bipolar perception of orthopedics fractures before and during covid-19 pandemic: a local study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Studies have documented that mens voices are generally heard more than womens voices in face-to-face undergraduate biology classes, and some performance gaps have also been documented. Some of the few studies on gender equity in traditional online biology education suggest that women participate more and perform better in asynchronous online courses compared to men. While much is known about emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating existing inequities generally, studies are needed about the impact of specific emergency remote teaching practices on specific groups such as women. In this study, we performed an in-depth investigation of three life sciences classrooms that utilized synchronous online lectures during the pandemic. We observed each class throughout the semester, quantified participation behaviors, and investigated the role of student gender. We also compared final course grades by gender. On average, we found that men participated more than women both verbally and by chat. These differences were not significant for each class individually, but the differences align with the face-to-face patterns seen in this population previously. Our results also hint that mens chat comments may be more likely to be acknowledged than womens chats by peers. We found evidence of greater performance disparities favoring men than seen previously before the pandemic, but not in all classes. We discuss implications for instructors conducting emergency remote teaching as well as the need for larger studies to test the replicability of our results.","output":"Participation and Performance by Gender in Synchronous Online Lectures: Three Unique Case Studies during Emergency Remote Teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: In the absence of effective therapies at the start of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, anti-viral and antiinflammatory medications were used for management of COVID-19 without robust evidence of their benefit. The patterns of use, implementation, and de-implementation of these medications is unclear. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational study on an international cohort of adult patients hospitalized from March 2020 to November 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 infection, receiving supplemental oxygen, and enrolled in the Society of Critical Care Medicine Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness Universal Study (VIRUS) Registry. The primary outcome of interest was to describe the hospital-level variation in the most commonly used medications repurposed for empiric management of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, corticosteroids, and anti-IL-6 therapies). Secondary outcomes included geographic and temporal variation in medication use. RESULTS: Among 6,621 patients with COVID-19 across 86 hospitals (predominantly USbased [88%]), 1,373 (20.7%, hospital usage rates range 0%-96.4%) received corticosteroids, 1,302 (19.7%, range 0%-100%) received hydroxychloroquine, 602 (9.1%, range: 0%-65.7%) received remdesivir, and 405 (6.1%, range 0%-87.5%) received an anti-IL6 medication. USbased hospitals vs non-US hospitals showed differences in medication use with 9.9% vs. 0.8% use of remdesivir, 19.5% vs 33.2% use of corticosteroids, 18.7% vs 29.6% use of hydroxychloroquine and 6.3% vs. 3.9% use of anti-IL6 medications. Comparing use prior to July 2020 with use after July 2020, prescription of remdesivir increased from 6.5% to 20.5%, corticosteroid use increased from 17.5% to 35.0%, hydroxychloroquine use decreased from 23.9% to 1.1% and anti-IL6 use decreased from 7.0% to 2.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-level variation and geographic variation in use of repurposed anti-viral and anti-inflammatory medications for the management of COVID-19 infection was large. Coinciding with accrual of scientific evidence, the use of remdesivir and corticosteroids increased over time, while the use of hydroxychloroquine and anti-IL6 medications decreased over time. Further studies are needed to evaluate the drivers of hospital variation and impact on clinical outcomes.","output":"Variation in use of anti-viral and anti-inflammatory medications in patients hospitalized with COVID-19: Results from the international viral infection and respiratory illness universal study (virus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we study a novel contact tracing query (CTQ) that finds users who have been in $direct$ $contact$ with the query user or $in$ $contact$ $with$ $the$ $already$ $contacted$ $users$ in subsequent timestamps from a large spatio-temporal database. The CTQ is of paramount importance in the era of new COVID-19 pandemic world for finding possible list of potential COVID-19 exposed patients. A straightforward way to answer the CTQ is using traditional spatio-temporal indexes. However, these indexes cannot serve the purpose as each user covers a large area within the time-span of potential disease spreading and thus they can hardly use efficient pruning techniques. We propose a multi-level index, namely QR-tree, that consider both space coverage and the co-visiting patterns to group users so that users who are likely to meet the query user are grouped together. More specifically, we use a quadtree to partition user movement traces w.r.t. space and time, and then exploit these space-time mapping of user traces to group users using an R-tree. The QR-tree facilitates efficient pruning and enables accessing only potential sets of user who can be the candidate answers for the CTQ.

Although passive immunization with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) provides a safe and viable therapeutic option, the selection of optimal units for therapy in a timely fashion remains a barrier. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Since virus neutralization is a necessary characteristic of plasma that can benefit recipients, the neutralizing titers of plasma samples were measured using a retroviral-pseudotype assay. Binding antibody titers to the spike (S) protein were also determined by a clinically available serological assay (Ortho-Vitros total IG), and an in-house ELISA. The results of these assays were compared to a measurement of antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV2 S protein (Promega Lumit Dx). RESULTS: All measures of antibodies were highly variable, but correlated, to different degrees, with each other. However, the anti-RBD antibodies correlated with viral neutralizing titers to a greater extent than the other antibody assays. DISCUSSION: Our observations support the use of an anti-RBD assay such as the Lumit Dx assay, as an optimal predictor of the neutralization capability of CCP.","output":"Predicting the efficacy of COVID-19 convalescent plasma donor units with the Lumit Dx anti-receptor binding domain assay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In late December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory illness, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to study the epidemiology, clinical features and short-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. METHODS: We performed a single center, retrospective case series study in 221 patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at a university hospital, including 55 severe patients and 166 non-severe patients, from January 2, 2020 to February 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 221 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 55.0 years and 48.9% were male and only 8 (3.6%) patients had a history of exposure to the Huanan Seafood Market. Compared to the non-severe pneumonia patients, the median age of the severe patients was significantly older, and they were more likely to have chronic comorbidities. Most common symptoms in severe patients were high fever, anorexia and dyspnea. On admission, 33.0% patients showed leukopenia and 73.8% showed lymphopenia. In addition, the severe patients suffered a higher rate of co-infections with bacteria or fungus and they were more likely to developing complications. As of February 15, 2020, 19.0% patients had been discharged and 5.4% patients died. 80% of severe cases received ICU (intensive care unit) care, and 52.3% of them transferred to the general wards due to relieved symptoms, and the mortality rate of severe patients in ICU was 20.5%.

Detailed histopathological descriptions of COVID-19 chilblains have not been reported, and causality of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been established. OBJECTIVES: To describe the histopathological features of COVID-19 chilblains and to explore the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the tissue. METHODS: We examined skin biopsies from seven paediatric patients presenting with chilblains during the COVID-19 pandemic. Immunohistochemistry for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all cases and electron microscopy in one. RESULTS: Histopathology showed variable degrees of lymphocytic vasculitis ranging from endothelial swelling and endotheliitis to fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis. Purpura, superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation with perieccrine accentuation, oedema, and mild vacuolar interface damage were also seen. SARS-CoV-2 immunohistochemistry was positive in endothelial cells and epithelial cells of eccrine glands. Coronavirus particles were found in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells on electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Although the clinical and histopathological features were similar to other forms of chilblains, the presence of viral particles in the endothelium and the histological evidence of vascular damage support a causal relation of the lesions with SARS-CoV-2. Endothelial damage induced by the virus could be the key mechanism in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 chilblains and perhaps also in a group of patients severely affected by COVID-19 presenting with features of microangiopathic damage. What is already known about this topic? Despite the high number of cases of chilblains seen during the COVID-19 pandemic, a definite causative role for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been proven. Different pathogenetic hypotheses have been proposed, including coagulation anomalies, interferon release and external factors. What does this study add? The demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 in endothelial cells of skin biopsies by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy confirms that these lesions are part of the spectrum of COVID-19. Virus-induced vascular damage and secondary ischaemia could explain the pathophysiology of COVID-19 chilblains. Our findings support the hypothesis that widespread endothelial infection by SARS-CoV-2 could have a pathogenetic role in the severe forms of COVID-19. Linked Comment: Wetter.

We used random effects logistic regression models and ordinal models to estimate the odds of having a missed visit and of low PrEP adherence, respectively. Multivariable models were adjusted for variables with p\\\\value<0.10 in the univariate analysis. RESULTS: From the 271 eligible, 130 participants were enrolled in the study (PrEP uptake: 48%), out of which 111 (85.4%) were retained at 48 weeks. Multivariable model for study non\\\\attendance included study visit, age, main sexual partner and stimulant use. The odds of missing a visit increased after the week 24. Participants aged 18C24 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 8.76, 95% CI: 2.09C36.7) and 25C34 years (aOR = 6.79, 95% CI: 1.72C26.8) compared to TGW aged 35+ years had significantly higher odds of having a missed visit. The odds of a missed visit were higher among participants reporting stimulant use (aOR = 4.99, 95% CI: 1.37C18.1) compared to no stimulant use. DBS levels at week 48 showed that 42 (38.5%), 14 (12.8%) and 53 (48.6%) of 109 participants had low, moderate and high PrEP adherence. Multivariable model for low PrEP adherence included study visit, age, schooling, race/colour, housing, binge drinking, stimulant use, feminizing hormone therapy (FHT) use and received text message. Low PrEP adherence was significantly higher among participants with less years of schooling (aOR = 6.71, 95% CI: 1.30C34.5) and had a borderline association with Black colour/race (aOR = 6.72, 95% CI: 0.94C47.8).

Two hypotheses are discussed: i) with the pandemics, higher education institutions and research centers may sponsor and support the intensification of working time at home, incorporating the increasing use of digital means;ii) within this process of intense valuation of home spaces and times, young academic women might have to deal with increasing levels of time compression as a result of the complex combination of different factors that still ascribe them to family and household temporalities;as well as with decreases in academic productivity that can affect their ability to continue and persist in academia. In order to tackle these two main ideas, the authors will introduce some main points concerning the relationship between time structures in academia and the increasing capability of digital means of communication to provide new types of constraints, new time valuations and new patterns of using and perceiving time which continue to produce differences and inequalities of gender. Empirically, the paper draws on qualitative and quantitative data provided by a survey with 108 young academic women, from several scientific fields focusing on the experience of working at home with digital communications during the pandemic.

For every death by suicide, many more suicide attempts are undertaken, and this presents as a critical risk factor for suicide. Currently, there are limited treatment options with limited underpinning research for those who present to emergency departments with suicidal behaviour. The aim of this study is to assess if adding one of two structured suicide-specific psychological interventions (Attempted Suicide Short Intervention Program [ASSIP] or Brief Cognitive Behavioural Therapy [CBT] for Suicide Prevention) to a standardised clinical care approach (Suicide Prevention Pathway [SPP]) improves the outcomes for consumers presenting to a Mental Health Service with a suicide attempt. METHODS: This is a randomised controlled trial with blinding of those assessing the outcomes. People who attempt suicide or experience suicidality after a suicide attempt, present to the Gold Coast Mental Health and Specialist Services, are placed on the Suicide Prevention Pathway (SPP), and meet the eligibility criteria, are offered the opportunity to participate. A total of 411 participants will be recruited for the study, with 137 allocated to each cohort (participants are randomised to SPP, ASSIP + SPP, or CBT + SPP). The primary outcomes of this study are re-presentation to hospitals with suicide attempts. Presentations with suicidal ideation will also be examined (in a descriptive analysis) to ascertain whether a rise in suicidal ideation is commensurate with a fall in suicide attempts (which might indicate an increase in help-seeking behaviours). Death by suicide rates will also be examined to ensure that representations with a suicide attempt are not due to participants dying, but due to a potential improvement in mental health. For participants without a subsequent suicide attempt, the total number of days from enrolment to the last assessment (24 months) will be calculated. Self-reported levels of suicidality, depression, anxiety, stress, resilience, problem-solving skills, and self- and therapist-reported level of therapeutic engagement are also being examined. Psychometric data are collected at baseline, end of interventions, and 6,12, and 24 months. DISCUSSION: This project will move both ASSIP and Brief CBT from efficacy to effectiveness research, with clear aims of assessing the addition of two structured psychological interventions to treatment as usual, providing a cost-benefit analysis of the interventions, thus delivering outcomes providing a clear pathway for rapid translation of successful interventions.

More oxidized?oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) and sulfate showed the dominant enhancements, especially in large particle-mode. Meanwhile, relative humidity (RH) showed a positive promotion on the formation of sulfate and MO-OOA during the lockdown, but had no obvious correlation with less oxidized?oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) or nitrate. Organosulfurs (OS) displayed a higher contribution (~58%) than inorganic sulfate to total sulfate enhancement in the polluted episode during the lockdown. Although the total nitrate (TN) decreased during the lockdown ascribing to a larger reduction of inorganic nitrate, organic nitrate (ON) showed an obvious increase from pre-lockdown (0.5  0.6 g m-3 and 1  2% of TN) to lockdown (5.3  3.1 g m-3 and 17  9% of TN) in the polluted case (P < 0.05). In addition, RH also displayed a positive promotion on the formation of ON and OS, and the increases of both OS and ON were much efficient in the nighttime than in the daytime. These results suggest that higher RH and stagnant meteorology might facilitate the sulfate and MO-OOA enhancement, especially in the nighttime, which dominated the secondary aerosol enhancement in haze pollution during the lockdown.","output":"Measurement report of the change of PM2.5 composition during the COVID-19 lockdown in urban Xi'an: Enhanced secondary formation and oxidation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Stent-assisted coiling has expanded the treatment of complex wide-necked intracranial aneurysms. We present our experience with stent-assisted coiling, with an emphasis on procedure-related neurologic complications and the incidence of angiographic recurrence. METHODS A total of 480 patients with 501 aneurysms who were treated with stent-assisted coiling between January 2007 and December 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. Baseline characteristics, procedure-related complications, angiographic follow-up results, and clinical outcomes were statistically analyzed. RESULTS Among the 480 patients, 423 (88%) were treated electively and 57 (11%) were treated in the context of subarachnoid hemorrhage. There were 22 (4.58%) overall procedure-related complications, which caused death in 4 patients (0.83%) and morbidity in 4 patients (0.83%). In a logistic regression analysis, the complications differed significantly among the patients with hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-7.48; P = 0.03), patients with aneurysms treated with coiling before stenting (OR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.07-8.81; P = 0.04), and patients treated with multiple stents (OR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.02-24.07; P = 0.04). Angiographic follow-up was available for 396 patients (83.4%) for a mean of 13 months. The rates of recanalization and retreatment were 13.9% and 3.5%, respectively. In a logistic analysis, larger aneurysm size and initial incomplete aneurysm occlusion were predictors of recanalization. Clinical follow-up was available for 406 patients (85.6%) for a mean of 44.8 months, and 399 patients (98.3%) achieved a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 5. CONCLUSIONS Stent-assisted coiling appears to be a safe and effective option for treating complex wide-necked aneurysms. Higher complication rates are associated with coiling before stenting, use of multiple stents, and hypertension. Stent delivery before coil deployment reduces the risk of procedural complications. Larger aneurysm size and initial incomplete occlusion are associated with aneurysm recanalization.","output":"Stent-Assisted Coiling of 501 Wide-Necked Intracranial Aneurysms: A Single-Center 8-Year Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Presentation 20 year old Caucasian male presented to eye casualty 4 weeks post initial diagnosis of bilateral acute anterior uveitis (AAU), with a three-week history of a progressively worsening headache associated with nausea and vomiting.

This was to identify the extent of exposure by testing specific IgG antibodies against COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted to find the prevalence of seropositivity in Mumbai, which included 10,197 samples belonging to patients visiting public dispensaries (slum population, 6006) and private (nonslum population, 4191) laboratories of Aapli Chikitsa network for blood investigations for non-COVID illnesses. The ward-wise number of unlinked anonymous samples from 24 wards was predecided by using probability proportionate sampling. The samples were collected using quota sampling technique as per predecided sample for each ward. These samples collected from nonimmunized individuals were tested for IgG antibodies at the Molecular Biology Laboratory of Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases by chemiluminescence assay (CLIA) method. RESULTS: The overall seropositivity was found to be 36.3% (41.6% in slum and 28.59% in nonslum population). It was more in city wards (38.28%) followed by western suburb (36.47%) and then eastern suburb wards (34.86%), matching with the proportion of cases in these wards during the study period. There was no significant difference in seropositivity among males and females and in different age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Seropositivity is higher in slum areas than nonslum areas. It has reduced in slum areas and increased in nonslum areas as compared to findings of serosurveys 1 and 2. This explains the detection of a greater number of cases from nonslum areas in the second wave. The average seropositivity of 36.3% justifies the necessity of immunization on a wider scale in the city.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1(st) and February 30(th), 2020, in which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25; betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals who have previously sought treatment for a mental health disorder. METHODS: This study uses the newly developed Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII) survey. This tool was designed to assess tangible impacts of epidemics and pandemics across personal and social life domains. From November 9, 2020, to February 18, 2021, a total of 245 adults recruited from a mental health clinic completed the consent form and responded to the survey link from the Siyan Clinical Corporation and Siyan Clinical Research practices located in Santa Rosa, California, USA. RESULTS: We found that the least affected age group included individuals aged 75 years or older. This was followed closely by the 65- to 75-year-old age group. People with children under the age of 18 years also reported both more negative indicators associated with the pandemic and more positive indicators compared to those without children at home. Gender queer, nonconforming, and transgender individuals may also be at higher risk for more negative impacts associated with the pandemic. When respondents were assessed with regard to their mental health diagnosis, no differences were noted. Substance use also increased during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the data collected here may serve as foundational research in the prevention, care, and treatment of mental health disorders during pandemics such as COVID-19. Populations such as those with previously diagnosed mental health disorders are particularly at risk for negative effects of pandemic-related stressors such as social isolation, especially if they have children in the household, are part of a younger age group, or have substance use disorder. Gender may also be a factor. Further, the EPII survey may prove to be a useful tool in understanding these effects. Overall, these data may be a critical step toward understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on populations with a mental health diagnosis, which may aid mental health practitioners in understanding the consequences of pandemics on their patients' overall well-being.

Using limited proteolysis, differential scanning fluorimetry, analytical size exclusion chromatography, far-UV circular dichroism and small-angle X-ray scattering, we experimentally confirmed their overall disordered nature. In addition, using Congo red and Thioflavin T binding assays and negative-staining transmission electron microscopy, we show that the W proteins phase separate to form amyloid-like fibrils. The present study provides an additional example, among the few reported so far, of a viral protein forming amyloid-like fibrils, therefore significantly contributing to enlarge our currently limited knowledge of viral amyloids. In light of the critical role of the Henipavirus W proteins in evading the host innate immune response and of the functional role of phase separation in biology, these studies provide a conceptual asset to further investigate the functional impact of the phase separation abilities of the W proteins.","output":"Experimental Evidence of Intrinsic Disorder and Amyloid Formation by the Henipavirus W Proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that stimulates acute phase responses, hematopoiesis and specific immune reactions. Recently, it was found that the IL-6 plays a vital role in the progression of COVID-19, which is responsible for the high mortality rate. In order to facilitate the scientific community to fight against COVID-19, we have developed a method for predicting IL-6 inducing peptides/epitopes. The models were trained and tested on experimentally validated 365 IL-6 inducing and 2991 non-inducing peptides extracted from the immune epitope database. Initially, 9149 features of each peptide were computed using Pfeature, which were reduced to 186 features using the SVC-L1 technique. These features were ranked based on their classification ability, and the top 10 features were used for developing prediction models. A wide range of machine learning techniques has been deployed to develop models. Random Forest-based model achieves a maximum AUROC of 0.84 and 0.83 on training and independent validation dataset, respectively. We have also identified IL-6 inducing peptides in different proteins of SARS-CoV-2, using our best models to design vaccine against COVID-19. A web server named as IL-6Pred and a standalone package has been developed for predicting, designing and screening of IL-6 inducing peptides (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/il6pred/).","output":"Computer-aided prediction and design of IL-6 inducing peptides: IL-6 plays a crucial role in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: South Africa, and the African continent, have a shortage of ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists.

The Interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with different cellular components in the host cell may be necessary for understanding the disease mechanism and identifying crucial pharmacological targets in COVID-19. Studies have suggested that the effect of SARS-CoV-2 on other organs, including the brain, maybe critical for understanding the pathobiology of COVID-19. Symptoms in COVID-19 patients, including impaired consciousness dizziness, headache, loss of taste and smell, vision problems, and neuromuscular pain, suggest that neuronal complications comprise a crucial component of COVID-19 pathobiology. A growing body of literature indicates that SARS-CoV-2 can enter the brain, leading to neuronal defects in COVID-19 patients. Other studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may aggravate neuronal complications due to its effects on the cerebrovascular system. Emerging pieces of evidence show that stroke can be one of the leading neurological complications in COVID-19. In this review, we describe the observations about neuronal complications of COVID-19 and how SARS-CoV-2 may invade the brain.

Methods: The OncoSim-Breast model simulates the onset, growth and spread of invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ tumours. The model combines Canadian cancer incidence, mortality, screening program and cost data to project population-level outcomes. Users can change the model input to answer specific policy questions. Here we report three validation exercises. First, we compared the model's projected breast cancer incidence and stage distributions with the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry. Second, we compared OncoSim's projected breast cancer mortality with Vital Statistics. Third, we replicated the UK Age trial to compare the model's projections with the trial's observed screening effects. Results: OncoSim-Breast's projected incidence, mortality and stage distribution of breast cancer were close to the observed data in the Canadian Cancer Registry and the Vital Statistics.

In the current scenario, Coronavirus (COVID-19) infections are major challenging in the health care sector. The medical diagnosis for COVID-19 prediction is done with the support of X-ray images. Detection of COVID-19 with X-ray images is an effective method but it is critical for diagnosis, evaluation, and medication. Since the X-ray images are of low contrast, the accuracy will be low while using the traditional feature extraction in machine learning. The proposed method uses a novel technique by combining multiple CNN (Convolutional Neural network) for classification. The samples for multiple CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) are divided into n-subsets by using the bootstrap sampling method. The n-subset samples are finely tuned with Adaptive momentum technique (Adam) optimizer, the output of this layer is fed into CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model as input, still hyper-tuning at each layer with Bayesian optimizer. This technique avoids de-noising, and features are also enhanced when compared to conventional methods. Experimental results of this technique provide an accuracy of 97.35% for the prediction of COVID-19 from X-ray images.

This study explores the CPEC initiative, its direct social, cultural, economic development, and risk of environmental factors that affect residents lives and the local communitys wellbeing. CPEC is a multibillion-dollar project to uplift economic growth and free trade between Pakistan, China, and other regional stakeholders. Although CPEC is still in its initial phases with partial startups, policymakers and government officials claim this mega project as a game-changer in the region, mainly for Pakistan and China. This gigantic project offers the significant potential to generate business slews and employment opportunities with international outreach. Due to the terms newness, numerous studies have recently explored the macro and microeconomic benefits of the CPEC initiatives; still, these projects are theoretical. The existing literature insufficiently explored how helpful CPEC would be to a specific group and how residents perceive its advantages. This study fills in the literature gaps and explores the likely advantageous potential of the CPEC for the regional states. The study applied a convenient sampling technique for the data collection process. It used a mixed-method approach to gain scientific results, with a standardized questionnaire survey of 459 people (300 men and 159 women) from five major cities of Pakistan. The study results designate that residents believe that CPEC infrastructure projects will significantly improve residents life quality through more job openings and community poverty reduction. Still, they raised their concerns regarding environmental protection issues in the region. The findings specified that residents had an optimistic approach to better educational productivity by adopting environment-oriented policies. Policymakers should establish new CPEC study centers in different areas, and investors should be encouraged to participate in the industrial sector. Officials can overwhelm community worries about environmental degradation.

The learning curve of this new virus has been steep, with a global scientific community desperate to learn how the virus is transmitted, how it replicates, what cause such a wide spectrum of disease manifestations, causing none or few symptoms in some. Others are burdened by an intense immune response that resembles the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS), which leads to severe disease manifestations, often complicated by fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. Research efforts have been focusing on finding effective cures and vaccinations for this virus. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, represented by several GI manifestations, has led to its investigation as a target for the virus and as an indicator of disease severity. The response of the microbiome (which is heavily linked to immunity) to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, and its role in igniting the exaggerated immune response has therefore become a focus of interest. The objective of our study was to gather the data connecting between the microbiome, the GI tract and COVID-19 and to investigate whether these reported alterations in the gut microbiome bear any resemblance to those seen in lupus, the prototypical autoimmune disease. Confirming such changes may become the steppingstone to potential therapies that may prevent transmission, progression and immune related manifestations of COVID-19, via manipulation of the gut microbiota. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature review, utilizing the Pubmed search engine and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the microbiome in COVID-19 patients and compared results with studies evaluating the microbiome in lupus. We searched for the terms: microbiome, dysbiosis, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, gastrointestinal as well as lupus and autoimmune. While there were hundreds of articles which referred to gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19, to date only 4 studies investigated the gastrointestinal microbiome in this setting. We compared the similarities between microbiome of COVID-19 patients and lupus patients. RESULTS: We found that there are several similar processes of immune dysregulation in patients with COVID-19 and in those with lupus, with several other alterations seen in other pathological states. Some of these similarities include loss of microbiota biodiversity, increased representation of pathobionts, which are microbes associated with inflammation and disease (i.e Proteobacteria) and a relative decrease of symbionts, which are protective microbes, associated with anti-inflammatory properties (i.e Lactobacillus). Compromise to the intestinal barrier has also been reported in both. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the gastrointestinal tract contributes to the disease manifestations in COVID-19. Whether gastrointestinal dysbiosis is the cause or effect of gastrointestinal manifestations and several severe systemic manifestations, which may be the response to an increased pro-inflammatory environment, is still debatable and warrants further investigation. Given the resemblance of the microbiome in COVID-19 patients to that seen in lupus patients, it becomes clearer why several therapies used in autoimmune conditions are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, these findings should promote further investigating the utility of manipulation of the microbiome, via nutritional supplementation or even fecal transplantations, interventions that may alter the course of the disease, and potentially prevent disease transmission at low cost and low risk.","output":"Autoimmunity and COVID-19 C The microbiotal connection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity and ethnicity are known risk factors for COVID-19 outcomes, but their combination has not been extensively examined.

In six out the seven studies on SARS, the role of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) in the outbreak was indirectly proven by the spatial and temporal pattern of cases, or by airflow-dynamics models. In one report on MERS, the contamination of HVAC by viral particles was demonstrated. In four out of the six studies on SARS-CoV-2, the diffusion of viral particles through HVAC was suspected or supported by computer simulation. In conclusion, there is sufficient evidence of the airborne transmission of coronaviruses in previous Asian outbreaks, and this has been taken into account in the guidelines released by organizations and international agencies for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in indoor environments. However, the technological differences in HVAC systems prevent the generalization of the results on a worldwide basis. The few COVID-19 investigations available do not provide sufficient evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted by HVAC systems.","output":"Can Air-Conditioning Systems Contribute to the Spread of SARS/MERS/COVID-19 Infection?

Predicting both its prevalence and incidence throughout the world is crucial to help health professionals make key decisions. In this study, we aim to predict the incidence of COVID-19 within a two-week period to better manage the disease. Methods: : The COVID-19 datasets provided by Johns Hopkins University, contain information on COVID-19 cases in different geographic regions since January 22 and are updated daily. Data from 252 such regions were analyzed as of March 29, 2020, with 17,136 records and 4 variables, namely latitude, longitude, date, and records . In order to design the incidence pattern for each geographic region, the information was utilized on the region and its neighboring areas gathered two weeks prior to the designing. Then, a model was developed to predict the incidence rate for the coming two weeks via a Least-Square Boosting Classification algorithm. Results: : The model was presented for three groups based on the incidence rate: less than 200, between 200 to 1000, and above 1000. The model evaluation error rates were 4.71%, 8.54%, and 6.13%, respectively. Also, comparing the forecast results with the actual values in the period in question showed that the proposed model predicted the number of globally confirmed cases of COVID-19 with a very high accuracy of 98.45%.

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is commonly used in patients with ARDS but the best method to select the optimal PEEP level and reduce all-cause mortality is unclear. The primary objective of this network meta-analysis is to summarize the available evidence and to compare the effect of different PEEP selection strategies on all-cause mortality in adult patients with ARDS. METHODS: We will search MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBASE, and LILACS from inception onwards for randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of PEEP selection strategies in adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS. We will exclude studies that did not use a lung-protective ventilation approach as part of the comparator or intervention strategy. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality (at the longest available follow-up and up to 90 days). Secondary outcomes will include barotrauma, ventilator-free days, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and changes in oxygenation. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles, and extract study-data. We will assess the risk of bias for each of the outcomes using version 2 of the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials. If feasible, Bayesian network meta-analyses will be conducted to obtain pooled estimates of all potential head-to-head comparisons. We will report pairwise and network meta-analysis treatment effect estimates as risk ratios and risk differences, together with the associated 95% credible intervals. We will assess certainty in effect estimates using GRADE methodology. DISCUSSION: The present study will inform clinical decision-making for adult patients with ARDS and will improve our understanding of the limitations of the available literature assessing PEEP selection strategies. Finally, this information may also inform the design of future randomized trials, including the selection of interventions, comparators, and predictive enrichment strategies.

Analyzing cross-sectional survey data from a national U.S. adult sample (N = 19,420), mediation analyses were conducted. Results revealed that considering vaccine efficacy, health information seekers who assigned more value to medical professionals, medical journals, and newspaper articles were more likely to perceive a vaccine as effective, thus being more likely to receive the influenza vaccine. By contrast, individuals who placed more value in social media were less likely to perceive vaccine efficacy, and, in turn, were less likely to get the influenza vaccine. Turning to vaccine safety, the value ascribed to medical professionals was positively associated with vaccine safety, which, in turn, related to influenza vaccine uptake. By contrast, social media, family or friends, and promotions were negatively associated with vaccine safety, and then influenza vaccine uptake.","output":"Health Information Sources and the Influenza Vaccination: The Mediating Roles of Perceived Vaccine Efficacy and Safety."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a global emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Methods: In this retrospective study, data on the number of ED presentations due to neurological complaints in weeks 1-15/2020 were collected. In addition, hospital chart data of patients referred for neurological evaluation during weeks 12-15/2020 when the pandemic began impacting on public life in Germany were analysed regarding demographic information, chief complaints, modes of presentation and disposition and ED discharge diagnosis. Both data sets were compared to respective periods from 2017. Results: During the surge of COVID-19, we found a significant decrease of the total number of neurological ED patients by 47.6%. Comparing weeks 12-15 of 2017 and 2020, we found a decrease in the number of patients of < 30 years (p < 0.001) and an increase of those >= 70 years (p < 0.001). A higher proportion of patients were admitted to escalated care (p = 0.03), and fewer patients were discharged against medical advice (p<0.001).

Hydrogel materials that can embed living cells for use in 3D printing are called bioinks. However, there are only limited options of bioinks currently because they require the following features at once, such as printability, repetitive layer-by-layer stacking (stackability), structure stabilization, and biological properties. A polyurethane-gelatin double network hydrogel bioink was previously reported to own tunable modulus through changing the solid content, but cell viability at the high solid content is inevitably reduced. In the present study, the reinforcement effects of a metal-organic framework (MOF), zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), in the PUG bioink were evaluated. The printability, stackability, thermoresponsiveness, and shear-thinning behavior of the PUG-ZIF-8 composite hydrogels were examined. It was found that the PUG composite hydrogel containing 1250 g/mL ZIF-8 crystals showed significant structural stability and modulus enhancement (a2.5-fold). However, the PUG bioink containing 1250 g/mL ZIF-8 crystals may lead to cell senescence or death. The cytocompatible concentration of ZIF-8 crystals in the bioink was about 875 g/mL, and this concentration was much higher than the reported tolerable amount (a50 g/mL) of ZIF-8 for biomedical applications. The strong reinforcement effect of ZIF-8 and the drug-loading/sensing possibilities of MOFs may open new opportunities for using MOFs in 3D bioprinting applications.","output":"Development of MOF Reinforcement for Structural Stability and Toughness Enhancement of Biodegradable Bioinks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Spinal surgeries carry risks of malpractice litigation due to the random nature of their functional results, which may not meet patient expectations, and the hazards associated with these complex procedures. Claims are frequent and costly. In France, since 2002, a new law, the Patients' Rights Law of March 4, 2002, has created an alternative, out-of-court scheme, which established a simplified, rapid, free-of-charge procedure (Commission for Conciliation and Compensation [CCI]). Moreover, this law has optimized the compensation provided to patients for therapeutic hazards by use of a national solidarity fund. The authors analyzed the consequences of this alternative route in the case of claims against private neurosurgeons in France. METHODS From the data bank of the insurer Mutuelle d'Assurances du Corps de Sant Fran?ais (MACSF), the main insurance company for private neurosurgeons in France, the authors retrospectively analyzed 193 files covering the period 2015-2019. These computerized files comprised the anonymized medical records of the patients, the reports of the independent experts, and the final judgments of the CCI and the entities supporting the compensation, if any. RESULTS During the 5-year study period (2015-2019), the insurance company recorded 494 complaints involving private neurosurgeons for spinal surgery procedures, of which 126 (25.5%) were in civil court, 123 (24.9%) were under amicable procedure, and 245 (49.6%) were in the out-of-court scheme administered by the CCI. Out of these 245 cases, only 193 were closed due to delays. The conclusions of the commission were rejection/incompetence decisions in 47.2% of the cases, therapeutic hazards in 21.2%, nosocomial infections in 17.6%, and practitioner fault in 13.5%. National solidarity compensated for 48 complaints (24.8%). The final decision of the CCI is not always consistent with the conclusions of the experts mandated by it, illustrating the difficulty in defining the concept of hazards. The authors found that the therapeutic hazards retained and compensated by the national solidarity included decompensated spondylotic myelopathies (15% of the 40 cases) and cauda equina syndromes (30%). As allowed by law, 11.5% of the patients who were not satisfied triggered a classical procedure in a court. CONCLUSIONS In the French out-of-court system, trial decisions resulting in rulings of proven medical malpractice are rare, but patients can start a new procedure in the classical courts. The therapeutic hazard remains a subtle definition, which may be problematic and require further discussion between experts and magistrates. In spite of the imperfections, this out-of-court system proposes a major evolution to move patients and medical providers from legal battles to reconciliations.","output":"Litigations following spinal neurosurgery in France: \\"out-of-court system,\\" therapeutic hazard, and welfare state."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreak of the Covid-19 suggests a rather long latent phase that precludes public health officials to predict the pandemic transmission on time.

Patients and Methods. 1,497 patients were enrolled from April 6 to May 7, 2020. Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 was measured, and COVID-19 exposure routes were analyzed according to SARS-CoV-2 serological status. Results. 515 patients (34.4%) were seropositive, mainly medical students (13.2%) and assistant nurses (12.0%). A history of COVID-19 exposure in a professional and/or private setting was mentioned by 83.1% of seropositive subjects (p<0.05; odds ratio [OR]: 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-3.4).

However, there has not yet been a systematic review and synthesis of this evidence. This paper reports the results of a systematic review of qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies assessing the implementation and/or effectiveness of talk therapies for CMDs when provided by lay workers in LMICs to adults who have survived or are currently living in humanitarian situations. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, Global Health, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also hand-searched the contents pages of three academic journals, reference lists of 30 systematic reviews, and online resource directories of two mental health networks. A preliminary list of included studies was circulated to topical experts for review, and all included studies were backward and forward searched. All titles, abstracts, and full-texts were independently double-screened. Quality appraisal and data extraction were carried out by a single reviewer and checked by a second reviewer, using standardised tools. Any disagreements were discussed and referred to a third reviewer as needed. RESULTS: We identified 23 unique studies and carried out a narrative synthesis of patient and implementation outcome data. Every evaluation of the effectiveness of lay-delivered talk therapies for adults affected by humanitarian crises in LMICs showed some treatment effect for at least one CMD, and often multiple CMDs. Implementation research generally found these interventions to be acceptable, appropriate and feasible to implement, with good fidelity to manualised therapies. CONCLUSION: Although results are promising, particularly for individually-delivered talk therapies based on cognitive behavioural therapy techniques, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in this literature. We make several recommendations on how to improve the quality and generalisability of research on this topic, to facilitate further evidence synthesis.

So far, there have been approximately 14.8 million confirmed cases and 0.614 million deaths due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, and still numbers are increasing. Although, the virus has caused a global public health concern, no effective treatment has been developed. OBJECTIVE: One of the strategies to combat the COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is development of vaccines that can make humans immune to these infections. Considering this approach, in this study an attempt has been made to design epitope based vaccine for combatting COVID-19 disease by analyzing the complete proteome of the virus by using immuno-informatics tools. METHODS: The protein sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 was retrieved and the individual proteins were checked for their allergic potential. Then, from non-allergen proteins antigenic epitopes were identified that could bind with MHCII molecules. The epitopes were modeled and docked to predict the interaction with MHCII molecules. The stability of the epitopeMHCII complex was further analyzed by performing molecular dynamic simulation study. The selected vaccine candidates were also analyzed for their global population coverage and conservancy among SARS related coronavirus species. RESULTS: The study has predicted 5 peptide molecules that can act as potential candidate for epitope based vaccine development. Among the 5 selected epitopes, the peptide LRARSVSPK can be the most potent epitope because of its high geometric shape complementarity score, low ACE and very high response to it by the world population (81.81% global population coverage). Further, molecular dynamic simulation analysis indicated the formation of stable epitope-MHCII complex. The epitope LRARSVSPK was also found to be highly conserved among the SARS-CoV-2 isolated from different countries. CONCLUSION: The study has predicted T-cell epitopes that can elicit robust immune response in global human population and act as potential vaccine candidates.

Methods This study utilized a complementary mixed-methods approach to recruit independent community pharmacists to participate in an electronic survey and two virtually conducted focus groups prior to availability of the first COVID-19 vaccine. Information was gathered and compiled into five topic areas: (1) workflow; (2) resources; (3) staff and patient safety; (4) communication; and (5) documentation and training. Data collection occurred between October and December 2020. Survey data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed. A directed, content analysis was conducted to identify strategies for each topic area and supporting quotes were selected. Results Eighty-eight and 11 independent community pharmacists participated in the survey and focus groups, respectively. Because of the small size of most independent pharmacies, participants recommended working with community partners to support offsite mass vaccination clinics. Leveraging partnerships with community organizations and universities could be utilized to support staffing for vaccination efforts. Using an appointment-based immunization model was identified as one tool to optimize patient and staff safety during the pandemic. Pharmacists suggested utilizing existing scheduling tools as well as text messaging and automated phone calls for second-dose reminders. Finally, independent pharmacists recommended further training and process improvements to support vaccine documentation and transmission to Pennsylvania Statewide Immunization Information System (PA-SIIS). Conclusion Recommendations from this study were utilized to support planning and preparation for COVID-19 vaccinations across Pennsylvania.

Methods: : The method consisted in a multicentric retrospective analysis in all consecutive Covid-19 patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanically ventilated for more than 24 hours from March 1 to April 25, 2020.Admission date, age, sex, body mass index, underlying conditions, treatments, physiological values, use of vasopressors, renal replacement therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay, ICU and ventilator-free days at day 42 were collected. Primary outcome was survival. Simple and multiple time-dependent Cox regression models were used to assess the effects of factors on survival. Results: : Out of 2003 patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2, 361 were admitted to the participating ICUs, 257 were ventilated for more than 24 hours and 247 were included in the study. The length of stay in ICU was 21 (12-32) days and the mortality rate was 45%. Using multiple regression, risk factors for mortality were age, high serum creatinine value, low mean arterial pressure, low lymphocytes count on day 0 and the absence of corticosteroid therapy during the first week of mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate of the patients who received corticosteroids was 34% and 48% for patients who did not (p = 0.01).

We propose a control scheme to develop herd immunity while satisfying the following two basic requirements for a viable policy option. The first requirement is social acceptability: the overall deaths should be minimized for social acceptance. The second is feasibility: the healthcare system should not be overwhelmed to avoid various adverse effects. To exploit the fact that the disease severity increases considerably with age and comorbidities, we assume that some focused protection measures for those high-risk individuals are implemented and the disease does not spread within the high-risk population. Because the protected population has higher severity ratios than the unprotected population by definition, the protective measure can substantially reduce mortality in the whole population and also avoid the collapse of the healthcare system. Based on a simple susceptible-infected-recovered model, social acceptability and feasibility of the proposed strategy are summarized into two easily computable conditions. The proposed framework can be applied to various populations for studying the viability of herd immunity strategies against COVID-19. For Japan, herd immunity may be developed by the proposed scheme if [Formula: see text] and the severity rates of the disease are 1/10 times smaller than the previously reported value, although as high mortality as seasonal influenza is expected.","output":"Model-based analysis on social acceptability and feasibility of a focused protection strategy against the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of pre-operative immunological and nutritional status, assessed by the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) score, on post-operative infection, and the potential additive effects of low PNI and infection on prognosis after radical resection of stage II/III gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: The medical records of 2352 consecutive stage II/III GC patients who underwent radical gastrectomy were retrospectively reviewed. The independent predictors for infections were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses. Cox regression analysis was used to assess any associations between PNI, infection and OS. RESULTS: A total of 160 (6.8%) cases developed infections and low PNI (< 43.9) was confirmed as an independent predictor. Both PNI < 43.9 and infections independently predicted poor OS (hazard ratio: 1.163, 95% confidence interval: 1.007-1.343; HR: 1.347, 95%CI: 1.067-1.700), and an additive effect was confirmed as patients with both low PNI and infection had worst OS. Further stratified analyses showed that complete peri-operative adjuvant chemotherapy (PAC,  6 cycles) could significantly improve OS in patients with low PNI and/or infection, which was comparable to those with PNI  43.9 and/or infection (P = 0.160). CONCLUSIONS: Infection was the most common complication after gastrectomy and PNI < 43.9 was identified as an independent predictor. Low PNI was associated with poorer OS in stage II/III GC, independent of infections, and low PNI and infections had a synergistic effect that was associated with worst OS.

Color coding is a popular way of helping learners understand visualizations and has been found to aid in learning with detailed visualizations. However, previous research has shown that color coding must not always be an effective aid, and that it even may reduce retention when used with simple visualizations. This study assessed whether the presence of color coding in learning tests has an effect after having learned using a detailed visualization that either featured color cues or one that did not. The results indicate that color coding helps learners the most if the learning tests also feature color coding. Importantly, learning with color-coded visualizations and being tested without color cues leads to the worst results in retention and transfer tests. Regarding transfer, color coding in the testing visualization boosts performance regardless of the presence of color cues in the learning phase. The results of this study challenge popular perspectives aiming at optimizing learning by removing potential sources of difficulty.

The study used a mixed research approach whereby quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from multiple sources to address the impacts of climate variability on livestock production and livelihood of pastoral-agro-pastoral communities of Guji zone. Data about pastoralist perception on climate change were collected from 198 randomly selected households using a semi-structured questionnaire. Furthermore, climate data were obtained from the national meteorological agency, and climatic water balance was assessed. The household survey result indicated increasing patterns of temperature (82.8%)and drought intensity (84.8%). Majority of respondents perceived decreasing trends of rainfall and feed availability. Similarly, the trend analysis of rainfall showed declining trends of annual (-4.7 mm/year), autumn (-4.5 mm) and winter (-0.54 mm). Rainfall Anomaly Index identifies 13 drought years over the past 32 years, of which 53.85% occurred between 2007- 2017.

Protein kinases are key regulators of many cellular functions, and the systematic knockdown of their expression should provide a broad perspective on factors and pathways promoting or antagonizing coronavirus replication. In addition to 40 proteins that promote SARS-CoV replication, our study identified 90 factors exhibiting an antiviral effect. Pathway analysis grouped subsets of these factors in specific cellular processes, including the innate immune response and the metabolism of complex lipids, which appear to play a role in SARS-CoV infection. Several factors were selected for in-depth validation in follow-up experiments. In cells depleted for the 2 subunit of the coatomer protein complex (COPB2), the strongest proviral hit, we observed reduced SARS-CoV protein expression and a >2-log reduction in virus yield. Knockdown of the COPB2-related proteins COPB1 and Golgi-specific brefeldin A-resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) also suggested that COPI-coated vesicles and/or the early secretory pathway are important for SARS-CoV replication. Depletion of the antiviral double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) enhanced virus replication in the primary screen, and validation experiments confirmed increased SARS-CoV protein expression and virus production upon PKR depletion. In addition, cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was identified as a novel antiviral host factor in SARS-CoV replication. The inventory of pro- and antiviral host factors and pathways described here substantiates and expands our understanding of SARS-CoV replication and may contribute to the identification of novel targets for antiviral therapy. IMPORTANCE Replication of all viruses, including SARS-CoV, depends on and is influenced by cellular pathways. Although substantial progress has been made in dissecting the coronavirus replicative cycle, our understanding of the host factors that stimulate (proviral factors) or restrict (antiviral factors) infection remains far from complete. To study the role of host proteins in SARS-CoV infection, we set out to systematically identify kinase-regulated processes that influence virus replication. Protein kinases are key regulators in signal transduction, controlling a wide variety of cellular processes, and many of them are targets of approved drugs and other compounds. Our screen identified a variety of hits and will form the basis for more detailed follow-up studies that should contribute to a better understanding of SARS-CoV replication and coronavirus-host interactions in general. The identified factors could be interesting targets for the development of host-directed antiviral therapy to treat infections with SARS-CoV or other pathogenic coronaviruses.","output":"A Kinome-Wide Small Interfering RNA Screen Identifies Proviral and Antiviral Host Factors in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Replication, Including Double-Stranded RNA-Activated Protein Kinase and Early Secretory Pathway Proteins."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The impact of lockdown measures in Wuhan, China during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on child maltreatment remains unknown.

Compared to case 1 (without emission reductions), the total PM2.5 mass for case 2 (with emission reductions) decreased by more than 20 % over the entire YRD, and the reduction ratios of its components were 15 %, 16 %, 20 %, 43 %, 34 %, and 35 % in primary organic aerosol (POA), elemental carbon (EC), sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), respectively. The source apportionment results showed that PM2.5 concentrations from transportation decreased by 40 %, while PM2.5 concentrations from the residential and power sectors decreased by less than 10 % due to the lockdown. Although all sources decreased, the relative contribution changed differently. Contributions from the residential sector increased by more than 10 % to 35 %, while those in the industrial sector decreased by 33 %.

In addition to demographic and clinical characteristics, the number of hospitalized cases and deaths is an important factor for evidence-based decision-making and disease control and preparing the healthcare system to face the future challenges of COVID-19. Therefore, this cohort study was conducted to determine the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Kermanshah Province, west of Iran. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of COVID-19 hospitalized in Kermanshah Province, Iran during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demographics, clinical characteristics, outcomes and other additional information of hospitalized patients were collected from the COVID-19 database of the Medical Care Monitoring Center (MCMC) of Kermanshah Province. RESULTS: Kermanshah Province experienced three waves of COVID-19 infection considering the hospitalization and mortality rates between February 20, 2020 and February 19, 2021. A total of 27,256 patients were included in the study: 5203 (19.09%) subjects were suspected, 9136(33.52%) were probable, and 12,917 (47.39%) were confirmed COVID-19 cases. The mean age of the patients was 53.34  22.74 years and 14,648 (53.74%) were male. The median length of hospital stay among COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors patients were 4 (interquartile range [IQR] 1C6) and 4 (IQR 1C8) days, respectively. Among patients with COVID-19, 2646 (9.71%) died during hospitalization. A multivariable logistic regression revealed that odds of death among patients  85 years was significantly greater than among patients < 15 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.79, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.43C6.71, p 0.001). Patients with one (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.21C1.59, p = 0.04), two (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.27C1.92, p = 0.001) or more (aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.04C2.17, p = 0.03) comorbidities had higher odds of in-hospital death compared to those without comorbidities. The male sex (aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.07- 1.35, p = 0.002), ICU admission (aOR 4.35, 95% CI 3.80C4.97, p < 0.001), intubation (aOR 11.09, 95% CI 9.58C12.84, p < 0.001), respiratory distress (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.22C1.61, p < 0.001), loss of consciousness (aOR 1.81, 95% CI 1.45C2.25, p < 0.001), anorexia (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.09C1.70, p = 0.006) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) < 93(aOR 2.72, 95% CI 2.34C3.16, p < 0.001) on admission were associated with increased risk of death in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of the patients admitted to the general wards and ICU can be a guide for allocating resources and making appropriate plans to provide better medical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several risk factors are associated with the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19, including advanced age, male sex, ICU admission, intubation, having comorbidity, SpO2 < 93, respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, headache, anorexia, and cough.

Although the environment and lifestyle of the Korean people have recently undergone rapid changes, corresponding changes in the characteristics of AR patients have not been well documented. Therefore, we aimed to outline the changes in allergens and clinical manifestations of AR in Korean patients from the 1990s and 2010s. METHODS: We reviewed 1447 and 3388 AR patients who visited the same tertiary hospital in the 1990s and 2010s, respectively. All patients were diagnosed with AR based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, positive skin prick test results, and answered a symptom questionnaire at the time of visit. We compared differences in the allergens and results of the symptom questionnaire between the two sets of patients. RESULTS: When compared with the 1990s, the rate of sensitization to house dust mites, cockroaches, Aspergillus, Alternaria, and tree pollen significantly increased and that to cat fur significantly decreased in patients from the 2010s (all P < 0.05). Male predominance was observed with two peaks in the age distribution of patients from the 2010s.

Patients were randomly divided into ozone-autohemotherapy group (14) and control group (14). The procedure consisted in a daily double-treatment with systemic Oxygen-Ozone administration for 7 days. All patients were treated with ad interim best available therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS The primary outcome was delta in the number of patients requiring orotracheal-intubation despite treatment. Secondary outcome was the difference of mortality between the two groups. Moreover, haematological parameters were compared before and after treatment. No differences in the characteristics between groups were observed at baseline. As a preliminary report we have observed that one patient for each group needed intubation and was transferred to ITU. No deaths were observed at 7-14 days of follow up. Thirty-day mortality was 8,3% for ozone group and 10% for controls. Ozone therapy didn't significantly influence inflammation markers, haematology profile and lymphocyte subpopulations of patients treated. Ozone therapy had an impact on the need for the ventilatory support, although didn't reach statistical significance. Finally, no adverse events related to the use of ozone-autohemotherapy were reported.

The present study aimed to evaluate the rhythm disruptions of life, work, and entertainment, and their associations with the psychological impacts during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from the 10th to 17th March 2020 in China. A structured e-questionnaire containing general information, the Chinese version of Brief Social Rhythm Scale, and Zung's self-rating scales of depression and anxiety (SDS and SAS) was posted and collected online through a public media (i.e. EQxiu online questionnaire platform). Scores in sleeping, getting up, and socializing (SGS) rhythm and eating, physical practice, and entertainment (EPE) rhythm were compared among and between participants with different sociodemographic backgrounds including gender, age, education, current occupation, annual income, health status, and chronic disease status. Correlations of SDS and SAS with SGS-scale and EPE-scale were also analyzed. Results: Overall, 5854 participants were included. There were significant differences in the scores of SGS-scale and EPE-scale among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds. The scores were significantly higher in the groups with female gender, low education level, lower or higher than average income, poor health status, ages of 26-30 years or older than 61 years, nurses and subjects with divorce or widow status. There were also significant differences in SAS and SDS scores among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds (all P< 0.05). The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety was 24.3% and 12.6%, respectively, with nurses having the highest rates of depression (32.94%) and anxiety (18.98%) among the different occupational groups. SGS-scale was moderately correlated with SDS and SAS, and disruption of SGS rhythm was an independent risk factor for depression and anxiety. Conclusion: Social rhythm disruption was independently associated with depression and anxiety. Interventions should be applied to people vulnerable to the rhythm disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Adequate patient capacity, in terms of abilities and resources, is needed to effectively manage the treatment burden associated with chronic health conditions. The ability to measure different elements of capacity, as well as treatment burden, may assist to identify those at risk of poor self-management. Our aims were to: 1. Investigate correlations between established self-report tools measuring aspects of patient capacity, and treatment burden; and 2. Explore whether individual questions from the self-report tools will correlate to perceived treatment burden without loss of explanation. This may assist in the development of a clinical screening tool to identify people at risk of high treatment burden. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey in both a postal and online format. Patients reporting one or more chronic diseases completed validated self-report scales assessing social, financial, physical and emotional capacity; quality of life; and perceived treatment burden. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore relationships between different capacity variables, and perceived high treatment burden. RESULTS: Respondents (n = 183) were mostly female (78%) with a mean age of 60 years. Most participants were multimorbid (94%), with 45% reporting more than five conditions. 51% reported a high treatment burden. Following logistic regression analyses, high perceived treatment burden was correlated with younger age, material deprivation, low self-efficacy and usual activity limitation. These factors accounted for 50.7% of the variance in high perceived treatment burden. Neither disease burden nor specific diagnosis was correlated with treatment burden. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports previous observations that psychosocial factors may be more influential than specific diagnoses for multimorbid patients in managing their treatment workload. A simple capacity measure may be useful to identify those who are likely to struggle with healthcare demands.

are associated with significant resource utilization Accordingly, revisits serve as an important quality measure for emergency care In recent times, EDs have been challenged by critical resource constraints in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic When appropriate, medically stable COVID-19 patients are discharged home rather than admitted for further care However, the natural history of COVID-19 is not well understood and patients may quickly progress to requiring medical attention To our knowledge, ED revisits have not been previously characterized in the setting of COVID-19 We aim to quantify the incidence of, as well as determine risk factors for, ED revisits for COVID-19 patients Methods: We conducted retrospective study of 323 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients who presented to a single academic tertiary-care institution from March 15 to April 15 of 2020 Demographic and clinical information was abstracted from the electronic medical record Predictor variables (age, history of hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, current tobacco or marijuana use) were selected based on current knowledge of risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness All return visits to the ED within 28 days of index ED presentation were classified as revisits Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent demographic and clinical risk factors for ED revisits We also performed exploratory univariable analyses of a subset of 179 patients who had measured serum biomarkers (absolute neutrophil count (ANC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), ferritin, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) in order to identify potential biochemical risk factors for ED revisits Results: Of the 323 patients studied, 98 were discharged from the ED during their index visit and 225 were admitted to the hospital Among those discharged, 25/98 (25 5%) returned within 28 days of index ED presentation Median time to revisit was 3 days (interquartile range (IQR): 2 to 7) Among those admitted during their index visit (median hospital length of stay: 6 days), 26/225 (11 6%)

The model has been validated using published patient data recorded during acute infection. It has been adapted to the scenarios of chronic infection, clearance of infection, and flare-ups via variation of the immune response parameters. The impacts of immune response exhaustion and non-infectious subviral particles on the immune response dynamics are analysed. A comparison of different treatment options in the context of this model reveals that drugs targeting aspects of the viral life cycle are more effective than exhaustion therapy, a form of therapy mitigating immune response exhaustion. Our results suggest that antiviral treatment is best started when viral load is declining rather than in a flare-up. The model suggests that a fast antibody production rate always leads to viral clearance, highlighting the promise of antibody therapies currently in clinical trials.","output":"An age-structured model of hepatitis B viral infection highlights the potential of different therapeutic strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Artificially intelligent computer systems are used extensively in medical sciences.

The cases were divided into two groups: those who were COVID-19 positive and those negative, detected with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. The demographic, clinical, ABO blood groups, and Rh factor data of the cases were obtained from the hospital records retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean age of COVID-19 positive (+) cases was 57.7416 years and of COVID-19 negative (-) cases, 66.4115 years. The difference was significant (p&lt;0.001); there was no difference between the two groups in terms of sex (p=0.634). When age was categorically separated in COVID-19 (+) cases, &#967;2 was extremely significant. Among the ABO blood groups of COVID-19 (+) and (-) cases, &#967;2 was 4.975 (p=0.174).

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line agents in diabetics due to their nephroprotective effects but administration of these drugs leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), responsible for viral entry of severe-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome, coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data is lacking to determine what pulmonary effects ACEIs/ARBs may have in patients with diabetes, which could be relevant in the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects (ADEs) in diabetic patients taking ACEI or ARBs to help provide guidance as to how these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illness, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS 1DATA, a unique data platform resulting from collaboration across veterinary and human healthcare, utilized an intelligent medicine recommender system (1DrugAssist) developed using several national and international databases, to evaluate all ADEs reported to the FDA for patients with diabetes taking ACEIs or ARBs. RESULTS Mining of this data elucidated the proportion of a cluster of pulmonary ADEs associated with specific medications in these classes, which may aid healthcare professionals in understanding how these medications could worsen or predispose patients with diabetes to infections affecting the respiratory system specifically, COVID-19. Based on this data mining, Captopril was found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared to other ACEIs (P = 0.005) as well as ARBs (P = 0.012), though other specific drugs also had important pulmonary ADEs associated with their use. CONCLUSION These analyses suggest that pharmacists and clinicians will need to consider specific medications adverse event profile, particularly captopril, and how this profile may affect infections and other acute disease states that alter pulmonary function, such as COVID-19.","output":"Pharmacovigilance in Patients with Diabetes: A Data-Driven Analysis Identifying Specific RAS Antagonists with Adverse Pulmonary Safety Profiles That Have Implications for COVID-19 Morbidity and Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is a deadly disease spreading very fast.

METHODS: Collaborating with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), we established a prospective consecutive cohort of 5,628 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection who were admitted to 120 hospitals in Korea between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. The cohort was randomly divided using a 7:3 ratio into a development (n = 3,940) and validation (n = 1,688) set. Clinical information and complete blood count (CBC) detected at admission were investigated using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and logistic regression to construct a predictive risk score (COVID-Mortality Score). The discriminative power of the risk model was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curves. RESULTS: The incidence of mortality was 4.3% in both the development and validation set. A COVID-Mortality Score consisting of age, sex, body mass index, combined comorbidity, clinical symptoms, and CBC was developed. AUCs of the scoring system were 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.91) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93) in the development and validation set, respectively.

If third stage trial results favorable, pharmaceutical firms estimate big scale production of its vaccine candidates around the first 2021 quarter and the World Health organization fix as objective, vaccinate 20 % of the whole population at the final of 2021. However, since COVID-19 is new to our knowledge, vaccine efficacy and induced-immunity responses remain poorly understood. There are great expectations, but few think the first vaccines will be fully protective. Instead, they may reduce the severity of illness, reducing hospitalization and death cases. Further, logistic supply, economic and political implications impose a set of grand challenges to develop vaccination policies. For this reason, health decision-makers require tools to evaluate hypothetical scenarios and evaluate admissible responses. Our contribution answers questions in this direction. According to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization Working Group on COVID-19 Vaccines, we formulate an optimal controlled model to describe vaccination policies that minimize the burden of COVID-19 quantified by the number of disability-adjusted years of life lost.

We explore scenarios regarding efficacy, coverage, vaccine-induced immunity, and natural immunity via numerical simulation.

Antibiotic challenges for resistant bacteria in neonates pose challenges of unknown dosing and side effects. We report two antenatally diagnosed CP-CRE colonization scenarios with the NDM 1 gene. The case involves extreme preterm twins who had worsening respiratory distress at birth requiring ventilator support, with the first twin also having cardiovascular instability. They were screened for CP-CRE, and a polymyxin antibiotic commenced. In the delivery room, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the follow-up clinic, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary group, contact precautions and isolation procedures were instituted. None of the infants exhibited infection with CP-CRE. Consolidating knowledge with regard to CP-CRE and modifying human behavior associated with its spread can mitigate potential negative consequences. This relates to now and later, when travel and prolific human to human contact resumes, from endemic countries, after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Standardized efforts to curb the acquisition of this infection would be judicious given the challenges of treatment and continued emerging antibiotic resistance. Simple infection control measures involving contact precautions, staff education and parental cohorting can be useful and cost-effective in preventing transmission.

Our objectives were to evaluate the agreement between patients and researchers interpretation of a test for ROM using a modified FDA approved device and to evaluate patients level of difficulty interpreting the test. Study Design: A prospective cohort study of women complaining of leakage of fluid at 20 weeks gestation. Women wore sanitary pads with a modified lateral flow alpha-fetoprotein immunoassay strip to detect ROM. The strip was obtained from the FDA approved ROM Plus kit (Laborie/Clinical Innovations). Another set of pads was instilled with their urine. Patients and investigators interpreted the tests as positive (2 bars), negative (1 control bar), and other (not activated [no bars] or invalid [partial or unclear bars]). Cohens kappa was used to measure the agreement between patients and researchers. Difficulty interpreting the test was graded by patients on a scale of 1-10 (1 = least difficult, 10 = most). Results: Twenty-one women were recruited: 19 had ROM confirmed by clinical assessment, and 2 had ROM ruled out. Fifty-four pads were tested (women could wear more than 1 pad). Of the 26 worn by women with confirmed ROM, 20 (76.9%) were positive, none (0%) were negative, 3 [11.5%] were invalid and 3 [11.5%] were not activated. Of the 24 urine instilled pads from women with confirmed ROM, 4 (16.7%) were positive, 18 (75%) were negative and 2 (8.3%) were not activated. The women with ROM ruled out had non-activated tests (2 dry worn pads) and their urine instilled on 2 additional pads showed negative results. Cohens kappa was 0.85.Weighted kappa 0.88. The mean level of difficulty interpreting the test was 1.64. Conclusion: The modification of the FDA approved test did not result in false positive or negative results and 81.5% gave definitive results.

Whereas treatment delivered over telehealth was previously utilized sparingly in community settings, it quickly became the primary mode of treatment delivery for the vast majority of clinicians, many of whom had little time to prepare for this shift and limited to no experience using telehealth. Little is known about community mental health clinicians experiences using telehealth. Although telehealth may make mental health treatment more accessible for some clients, it may create additional barriers for others given the high rates of poverty among individuals seeking treatment from community mental health centers. OBJECTIVE: We examined community mental health clinicians perspectives on using telehealth to deliver trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy to youth. We sought to better understand the acceptability of using telehealth, as well as barriers and facilitators to usage. METHODS: We surveyed 45 clinicians across 15 community clinics in Philadelphia. Clinicians rated their satisfaction with telehealth using a quantitative scale and shared their perspectives on telehealth in response to open-ended questions. Therapists responses were coded using an open-coding approach wherein coders generated domains, themes, and subthemes. RESULTS: Clinicians rated telehealth relatively positively on the quantitative survey, expressing overall satisfaction with their current use of telehealth during the pandemic, and endorsing telehealth as a helpful mode of connecting with clients. Responses to open-ended questions fell into five domains. Clinicians noted that (1) telehealth affects the content (ie, what is discussed) and process (ie, how it is discussed) of therapy; (2) telehealth alters engagement, retention, and attendance; (3) technology is a crucial component of utilizing telehealth; (4) training, resources, and support are needed to facilitate telehealth usage; and (5) the barriers, facilitators, and level of acceptability of telehealth differ across individual clinicians and clients. CONCLUSIONS: First, telehealth is likely a better fit for some clients and clinicians than others, and attention should be given to better understanding who is most likely to succeed using this modality. Second, although telehealth increased convenience and accessibility of treatment, clinicians noted that across the board, it was difficult to engage clients (eg, young clients were easily distracted), and further work is needed to identify better telehealth engagement strategies. Third, for many clients, the telehealth modality may actually create an additional barrier to care, as children from families living in poverty may not have the requisite devices or quality broadband connection to make telehealth workable. Better strategies to address disparities in access to and quality of digital technologies are needed to render telehealth an equitable option for all youth seeking mental health services.","output":"Community Mental Health Clinicians Perspectives on Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The operating microscope is used in many centers for microvascular hepatic arterial reconstruction in living as well as deceased donor liver transplantation in adult and pediatric recipients. To date, a systematic review of the literature examining this topic is lacking. METHODS This systematic review of the literature was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Three different electronic databases (PubMed, Embase OVID, and Cochrane CENTRAL) were queried. RESULTS A total of 34 studies were included. The rate of hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) in noncomparative studies (28) ranged from 0% to 10%, with 8 studies reporting patient deaths resulting from HAT. Within comparative studies, the rate of HAT in patients who underwent arterial reconstruction using the operating microscope ranged from 0% to 5.3%, whereas the rate of HAT in patients who underwent arterial reconstruction using loupe magnification ranged from 0% up to 28.6%, and 2 studies reported patient deaths resulting from HAT. Two comparative studies did not find statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Our comprehensive systematic review of the literature seems to suggest that overall, rates of HAT may be lower when the operating microscope is used for hepatic arterial reconstruction in liver transplantation. However, matched comparisons are lacking and surgical teams need to be mindful of the learning curve associated with the use of the operating microscope as compared with loupe magnification, as well as the logistical and time constraints associated with setup of the operating microscope.","output":"Hepatic Artery Microvascular Anastomosis in Liver Transplantation: A Systematic Review of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Current knowledge on the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in COVID-19 remains limited to small series and registry data. In the present retrospective monocentric study, we report on our experience, our basic principles, and our results in establishing and managing ECMO in critically ill COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the ICU of the Geneva University Hospitals and supported by VV-ECMO from March 14 to May 31. The VV-ECMO implementation criteria were defined according to an institutional algorithm validated by the local crisis unit and the Swiss Society of Intensive Care Medicine. RESULTS: Out of 137 ARDS patients admitted to our ICU, 10 patients (age 57  4 years, BMI 31.5  5 kg/m2 , and SAPS II score 56  3) were put on VV-ECMO. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO and mean time under ECMO were 7  3 days and 19  11 days, respectively. The ICU and hospital length of stay were 26  11 and 35  10 days, respectively. The survival rate for patients on ECMO was 40%. The comparative analysis between survivors and non-survivors highlighted that survivors had a significantly shorter mechanical ventilation duration before ECMO (4  2 days vs. 9  2 days, p = 0.01). All the patients who had more than 150 h of mechanical ventilation before the application of ECMO ultimately died. CONCLUSION: The present results suggest that VV-ECMO can be safely utilized in appropriately selected COVID-19 patients with refractory hypoxemia.

A sample of people from the ages of 20 to 85 in the district was selected, and a total of 384 people were enrolled. A questionnaire about the COVID-19 vaccine was administered to the participants by phone. The questionnaire consisted of questions about the sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their thoughts about possible COVID-19 vaccines. RESULTS: 45.3% of the participants were hesitant about getting the COVID-19 vaccine, which was declared appropriate by the Ministry of Health. The rate of those who think that the COVID-19 vaccine will be effective in preventing and controlling the disease was 51.6%. 89.6% of the participants were hesitant about getting their children vaccinated. Those who do not consider COVID-19 disease as a risk to their health were 22.9%, and 32.8% thought that they would be protected from the disease by natural and traditional ways. The median score of the participants' risk perception was 7 (IQR: 6-8; Mean: 6.8; SD: 1.7). The median value of risk perception score of those who accept the vaccine was 6 (IQR: 4-6), while the median value for those who did not accept the vaccine was 4 (IQR: 4-6) (P < .01). Factors affecting vaccine acceptance were determined as the perception of risk (OR: 1.26% 95CI 1.03-1.55) and age (OR: 0.94% 95CI: 0.91-0.98) in logistic regression analysis.

A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from 28 May to 12 June 2020, with 896 valid responses obtained from Indonesian citizens over 18 years old. The survey questions included demographic characteristics, individual practices, risk perceptions, attitude, norm factors and ability factors related to hand hygiene during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results showed that 82.32% of female respondents and 73.37% male respondents reported handwashing practice 8 times or more per day during COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who perceived themselves at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 (OR 7.08, 2.26-22.17), had less negative perception toward the practice (OR 1.93, 1.32-2.82), perceived handwashing as an effective preventive measure (OR 1.77, 1.23-2.54), were female (OR 1.71, 1.21-2.41), perceived a more supportive norm (OR 1.68, 1.15-2.44) and noticed more barriers in access to handwashing facilities (OR 1.57, 1.05-2.36) were more likely to engage in hand hygiene practice more frequently during the pandemic.

PURPOSE AND METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of daily, enhanced terminal, and contingency-based cleaning strategies in an acute care hospital (ACH) and a long-term care facility (LTCF), using SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) assays. Daily cleaning involved light dusting and removal of visible debris while a patient is in the room. Enhanced terminal cleaning involved wet moping and surface wiping with disinfectants after a patient is permanently moved out of a room followed by ultraviolet light (UV-C), electrostatic spraying, or room fogging. Contingency-based strategies, performed only at the LTCF, involved cleaning by a commercial environmental remediation company with proprietary chemicals and room fogging. Ambient surface contamination was also assessed randomly, without regard to cleaning times. Near-patient or high-touch stationary and non-stationary environmental surfaces were sampled with pre-moistened swabs in viral transport media. RESULTS: At the ACH, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on 66% of surfaces before cleaning and on 23% of those surfaces immediately after terminal cleaning, for a 65% post-cleaning reduction (p = 0.001). UV-C enhancement resulted in an 83% reduction (p = 0.023), while enhancement with electrostatic bleach application resulted in a 50% reduction (p = 0.010). ATP levels on RNA positive surfaces were not significantly different from those of RNA negative surfaces. LTCF contamination rates differed between the dementia, rehabilitation, and residential units (p = 0.005). 67% of surfaces had RNA after room fogging without terminal-style wiping. Fogging with wiping led to a -11% change in the proportion of positive surfaces. At the LTCF, mean ATP levels were lower after terminal cleaning (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: Ambient surface contamination varied by type of unit and outbreak conditions, but not facility type. Removal of SARS-CoV-2 RNA varied according to cleaning strategy. IMPLICATIONS: Previous reports have shown time spent cleaning by hospital employed environmental services staff did not correlate with cleaning thoroughness. However, time spent cleaning by a commercial remediation company in this study was associated with cleaning effectiveness.

Even though SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in the central nervous system (CNS) or cerebrospinal fluid, evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS via the olfactory nerve. However, what happens after SARS-CoV-2 enters the CNS is poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the replication kinetics, cell tropism, and associated immune responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection in different types of neural cultures derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). SARS-CoV-2 was compared to the neurotropic and highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus. SARS-CoV-2 infected a minority of individual mature neurons, without subsequent virus replication and spread, despite angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and neuropilin-1 (NPR1) expression in all cultures. However, this sparse infection did result in the production of type III interferons and interleukin-8 (IL-8). In contrast, H5N1 virus replicated and spread very efficiently in all cell types in all cultures. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that neurological complications might result from local immune responses triggered by virus invasion, rather than abundant SARS-CoV-2 replication in the CNS. IMPORTANCE Infections with the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are often associated with neurological complications. Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 enters the brain via the olfactory nerve; however, SARS-CoV-2 is only rarely detected in the central nervous system of COVID-19 patients. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is able to infect neurons of human iPSC neural cultures but that this infection is abortive and does not result in virus spread to other cells. However, infection of neural cultures did result in the production of type III interferon and IL-8. This study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might enter the CNS and infect individual neurons, triggering local immune responses that could contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-associated CNS disease.","output":"Replication Kinetics, Cell Tropism, and Associated Immune Responses in SARS-CoV-2- and H5N1 Virus-Infected Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Neural Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Claim detection and verification are crucial for news understanding and have emerged as promising technologies for mitigating news misinformation.

BACKGROUND: Nurses play a major role in response to pandemics and epidemics in delivering patient care. The experiences of nurses who provided care have significant short and long-term consequences for individuals, communities, and the nursing profession. METHODS: Descriptive qualitative research approach was adopted in this study. We interviewed 12 nurses (22-50 years) who cared for the coronavirus disease 2019 patients in one of the clinical units of two coronavirus disease 2019 hospitals in Iraqi Kurdistan in 2020. Interviews were conducted via phone calls and were analysed using the thematic analysis method. The Consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research checklist was applied when constructing this paper. RESULTS: The nurses had to care for a number of situations during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in Kurdistan. As people in the public did not believe that there was such a virus, nurses often had to deal with this lack of knowledge and aggression from some patients and their family members. Most nurses changed their preventive behaviours since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak at hospital or in public. This was mainly to protect not only themselves but their patients, colleagues, family members and friends. They were cautious about the use of a mask at the hospital and in public. Most nurses experienced fear, stress, anxiety and isolation during this period. CONCLUSIONS: The patients had some concerns about their health and staying at hospitals, and some of them had aggressive behaviours towards nurses at corona hospitals. The public, close friends and relatives of the nurses had a fear of getting the infection by the virus through the nurses. However, the nurses attempted to protect themselves, colleagues and family members, and provide the best care to coronavirus disease 2019 patients.

In this paper, we collate a large data repository containing COVID-19 information from a range of different sources. We use this data to develop several predictors and prediction intervals for forecasting the short-term (e.g., over the next week) trajectory of COVID-19-related recorded deaths at the county-level in the United States. Specifically, using data from January 22, 2020, to May 10, 2020, we produce several different predictors and combine their forecasts using ensembling techniques, resulting in an ensemble we refer to as Combined Linear and Exponential Predictors (CLEP). Our individual predictors include county-specific exponential and linear predictors, an exponential predictor that pools data together across counties, and a demographics-based exponential predictor. In addition, we use the largest prediction errors in the past five days to assess the uncertainty of our death predictions, resulting in prediction intervals that we refer to as Maximum (absolute) Error Prediction Intervals (MEPI). We show that MEPI is an effective method in practice with a 94.5\\\\% coverage rate when averaged across counties. Our forecasts are already being used by the non-profit organization, Response4Life, to determine the medical supply need for individual hospitals and have directly contributed to the distribution of medical supplies across the country.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop a diagnostic set for the detection of respiratory viruses with sensitivity as low as 1C10 copies per reaction. Evaluation of the assay using a training clinical sample set showed that viral nucleic acids were identified in 76% of cases. To improve assay performance and facilitate the identification of novel species or emerging strains, cultures of fully differentiated human airway epithelium were used to pre-amplify infectious viruses. This additional step resulted in the detection of pathogens in all samples tested. Based on these results it can be hypothesized that the lack of an etiological agent in some clinical samples, both reported previously and observed in the present study, may result not only from the presence of unknown viral species, but also from imperfections in the detection methods used.","output":"Use of Sensitive, Broad-Spectrum Molecular Assays and Human Airway Epithelium Cultures for Detection of Respiratory Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to describe lifestyle and emotional changes individuals with compromised immune systems experienced during the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

Previous studies, using short sessions (<12 h), failed to find any effects on respiratory system compliance. In the present analysis, the effects of prolonged PP sessions (24 h) were retrospectively studied with regard to safety data, oxygenation and respiratory system compliance. METHODS: Retrospective review of 17 consecutive patients who required both VV-ECMO and prone positioning. PP under VV-ECMO was considered when the patient presented at least one unsuccessful ECMO weaning attempt after day 7 or refractory hypoxemia combined or not with persistent high plateau pressure. PP sessions had a duration of 24 h with fixed ECMO and respiratory settings. PP was not performed in patients under vasopressor treatment and in cases of recent open chest cardiac surgery. RESULTS: Despite optimized protective mechanical ventilation and other adjuvant treatment (i.e. PP, inhaled nitric oxide, recruitment maneuvers), 44 patients received VV-ECMO during the study period for refractory acute respiratory distress syndrome. Global survival rate was 66 %. Among the latter, 17 patients underwent PP during VV-ECMO for a total of 27 sessions. After 24 h in prone position, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio significantly increased from 111 (84C128) to 173 (120C203) mmHg (p < 0.0001) while respiratory system compliance increased from 18 (12C36) to 32 (15C36) ml/cmH(2)O (p < 0.0001). Twenty-four hours after the return to supine position, tidal volume was increased from 3.0 (2.2C4.0) to 3.7 (2.8C5.0) ml/kg (p < 0.005). PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio increased by over 20 % in 14/14 sessions for late sessions (7 days) and in 7/13 sessions for early sessions (<7 days) (p = 0.01). Quantitative CT scan revealed a high percentage of non-aerated or poorly-aerated lung parenchyma [52 % (41C62)] in all patients. No correlation was found between CT scan data and respiratory parameter changes. Hemodynamics did not vary and side effects were rare (one membrane thrombosis and one drop in ECMO blood flow). CONCLUSION: When used in combination with VV-ECMO, 24 h of prone positioning improves both oxygenation and respiratory system compliance.

Here, we place the emergence of cities and planetary civilizations in the context of major evolutionary transitions. With this perspective, we hypothesize that once a planetary civilization transitions into a state that can be described as one virtually connected global city, it will face an asymptotic burnout, an ultimate crisis where the singularity-interval time scale becomes smaller than the time scale of innovation. If a civilization develops the capability to understand its own trajectory, it will have a window of time to affect a fundamental change to prioritize long-term homeostasis and well-being over unyielding growtha consciously induced trajectory change or homeostatic awakening.

This is a difficult and stressful process for applicants in any given year, and it was even further complicated by restrictions mandated by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) protections. Analyzing geographical trends in successfully matched applicants provides prospective applicants and programs with helpful information about how previous trends were affected by the pandemic as we look toward future match cycles. Methods: The medical schools of 1,587 successfully matched applicants from 2017-2021 were identified and compared to the 116 otolaryngology residency programs. Successful applicants medical school state and region were then compared to the location of their matched residency program state and region. From this, we evaluated the number of applicants matching at the residency program affiliated with their medical school or at a residency program within the same state or region as their home medical school. Results: A significant increase in the percentage of applicants matching at their home program and within their home state (p < 0.001) occurred in 2021 when compared to previous years. Applicants matching within their home region was not found to increase significantly (p = 0.43) in 2021 compared to previously. The regions with the greatest increase in the percentage of applicants matching to their home programs were the Northeast and Midwest (12% increase), while the Midwest had the largest increase in percentage of applicants matching within their home state (15%). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the otolaryngology match in 2021 with applicants and programs alike choosing to stay closer to home with their residency match selections. Overall, regional location remains a major determinant of future residency location for otolaryngology applicants, and this did not change significantly during 2021, but applicants matched more frequently at their home medical school program.

AIM: We conducted a systematic review to examine the potential effect of copper treating of commonly touched surfaces in healthcare facilities. METHODS: We included controlled trials comparing the effect of copper-treated surfaces (furniture or bed linens) in hospital rooms versus standard rooms on hospital acquired infections (HAIs). Two reviewers independently screened retrieved articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was the occurrence of healthcare acquired infections. FINDINGS: We screened 638 records; 7 studies comprising 12362 patients were included. From risk of bias assessment, all included studies were judged to be at high risk in &#8805;2 of the 7 domains of bias. All 7 included studies reported the effect of various copper-treated surfaces on HAIs.

Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic, or prophylactic. As with other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 are mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third-generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in antiviral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH, and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of 5.99 g/liter, 1.08 mg/liter, 1.77 g/liter, and 5.86 mg/liter, respectively.

ARDS has been a major cause of death in the recent COVID-19 outbreak wherein asymptomatic respiratory tract infection progresses to ARDS from pneumonia have emphasized the need for a reliable therapy for the disease. The disease has a high mortality rate of approximately 30C50%. Despite the high mortality rate, a dearth of effective pharmacotherapy exists that demands extensive research in this area. The complex ARDS pathophysiology which remains to be understood completely and the multifactorial etiology of the disease has led to the poor diagnosis, impeded drug-delivery to the deeper pulmonary tissues, and delayed treatment of the ARDS patients. Besides, critically ill patients are unable to tolerate the off-target side effects.

Many of our existing ESG and impact investing frameworks focus on issues at the portfolio company level, but they do not take into account potential negative impacts from capital structures and investors influence in shaping them. In this paper, the Predistribution Initiative (PDI) explores how the growth of institutional investors (asset owners and allocators) and certain asset allocation strategies can be in conflict with ESG objectives. The conflict materializes in various interconnected ways, particularly from institutional investors role in increasing global debt levels and fund manager and corporate consolidation, which in turn can create barriers for diverse fund managers and entrepreneurs, jeopardize quality jobs, erode the quality and affordability of goods and services, increase asset class correlations, reduce diversification opportunities, and ultimately fuel economic inequality and market instability. For long-term, diversified institutional investors, or Universal Owners of the market, these dynamics eventually translate into lower financial returns. For workers and communities, these dynamics translate into greater precarity and inequality.This paper encourages such investors to consider how their activities may contribute to these issues and how they can improve their own practices to better manage systemic and systematic risks. We review the issues and then propose several preliminary paths toward solutions that we intend to workshop and fine-tune with investors and other stakeholders. Potential solutions focus on diversifying asset allocation to more regenerative investment structures and asset classes, building an enabling environment through adjustments to team incentive structures, performance reviews, benchmarking and valuation methodologies, and field-building.","output":"ESG 2.0: Measuring & Managing Investor Risks Beyond the Enterprise-level"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The introduction of immunologic techniques for rapid viral diagnosis and the availability of high quality commercial reagents have resulted in significant advances in the laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory infections.

AREAS COVERED The review provides evidence related to MR-proADM as a triaging tool in avoiding unnecessary admissions to hospital and/or inadequate discharge, and identifying patients most at risk of deterioration. It also covers the use of MR-proADM in the context of COVID- 19. Moreover, the authors provide a proposal on how to incorporate MR-proADM into patients' clinical pathways in an ED setting. EXPERT OPINION The data we have so far on the application of MR-proADM in the ED is promising. Incorporating it to clinical scoring systems may aid the clinician's decision making and recognising the \\"ill looking well\\" and the \\"well looking ill\\" sooner.

This factor is responsible for the regulation of over 400 genes known to influence processes related to inflammation, apoptosis and angiogenesis, and cellular responses to oxidative stress and hypoxia. Although high NFB activity induces hypoxia and inflammation, which are beneficial for the process of implantation, NFB level should be reduced in the later stages of physiological pregnancy to favour maternal immunosuppression and maintain gestation. It is believed that the downregulation of NFB activity by pharmacotherapy might be a promising way to treat preeclampsia. Interestingly, many of the drugs adopted for the prevention and treatment of preeclampsia have been found to regulate NFB activity. Despite this, further innovation is urgently needed to ensure treatment safety and efficacy.

Their capacity to react with thiol groups was tested by incubation with GSH to afford the hetero-Michael adducts that evolved backwards to the initial chalcone through a retro-Michael reaction, supporting that the covalent interaction with thiols could be reversible. The chalcone derivatives were evaluated in antiproliferative assays against a panel of cancer cell lines and as XPO1 inhibitors, and a good correlation was observed with the results obtained in both assays.

This study compares published outcomes between the ENT and NEU coil-assist systems and comments on the published safety and efficacy of stent-assisted coiling in general. METHODS A literature search was performed through PubMed for all published series of ENT or NEU stent-assisted coiling of cerebral aneurysms from 2004 to 2014. All studies including 10 or more published cases of stent-assisted coiling with ENT or NEU were included. RESULTS 47 studies met the inclusion criteria, containing 4238 aneurysms in 4039 patients. 2111 aneurysms were treated with NEU and 2127 were treated with ENT. Mean follow-up was 14.1 months. Overall, thromboembolic events occurred in 6.4% of aneurysms, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in 2.6%, permanent morbidity in 3.9%, and mortality in 2.3%. Initial and final 100% angiographic occlusion was seen in 53% and 69% of patients, respectively. Deployment failures (p<0.001), ICH (p=0.001), mortality among all patients (p=0.03), and recanalization (p=0.02) were more commonly reported in NEU treated aneurysms.

Thus, we aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and laboratory data of patients admitted to the western part of Denmark during the first and second waves of COVID-19 in 2020. Furthermore, we aimed to identify risk factors for critical COVID-19 disease and to describe the available information on the sources of infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of medical records from 311 consecutive hospitalized patients, 157 patients from wave 1 and 154 patients from wave 2. The period from March 7 to June 30, 2020, was considered wave 1, and the period from July 1st to December 31, 2020, was considered wave 2. Data are presented as the total study population, as a comparison between waves 1 and 2, and as a comparison between patients with and without critical COVID-19 disease (nonsurvivors and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU)). RESULTS: Patients admitted during the first COVID-19 wave experienced a more severe course of disease than patients admitted during wave 2. Admissions to the ICU and fatal disease were significantly higher among patients admitted during wave 1 compared to wave 2. The percentage of patients infected at hospital decreased in wave 2 compared to wave 1, whereas more patients were infected at home during wave 2. We found no significant differences in sociodemographics, lifestyle information, or laboratory data in the comparison of patients from waves 1 and 2. However, age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, fever, and dyspnea were identified as risk factors for critical COVID-19 disease. Furthermore, we observed significantly increased levels of C-reactive protein and creatinine, and lower hemoglobin levels among patients with critical disease. CONCLUSIONS: At admission, patients were more severely ill during wave 1 than during wave 2, and the outcomes were worse during wave 1.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of chemokines in mild COVID-19 patients and explore the correlation between chemokines and host immune response. Methods: : In this study, we used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect serum levels of chemokines in COVID-19 patients in Shiyan City. Expression of chemokine receptors and of other signaling molecules was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: : We first demonstrated that COVID-19 patients, both sever and mild cases, are characterized by higher level of chemokines. Specifically, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) is expressed at higher levels both in severe and mild cases of COVID-19. The receptor of MCP-1, C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), was expressed at higher levels in mild COVID-19 patients. Finally, we observed a significant negative correlation between expression levels of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and serum levels of MCP-1 in mild COVID-19 patients.

This study evaluates immune responses and protection following vaccination with a replication-incompetent porcine adenovirus 3 (PAV3) vector as an alternative vaccine to AdHu5 using an avian influenza H5N1 disease model. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in BALB/c mice following vaccination with different doses of the PAV3 vector expressing an optimized A/Hanoi/30408/2005 H5N1 hemagglutinin antigen (PAV3-HA) and compared with an AdHu5-HA control. PAV3-HA rapidly generated antibody responses, with significant neutralizing antibody titers on day 21, and stronger cellular immune responses detected on day 8, compared to AdHu5-HA. The PAV3-HA vaccine, administered 8 days before challenge, demonstrated improved survival and lower virus load. Evaluation of long-term vaccine efficacy at 12 months post-vaccination showed better protection with the PAV3-HA than with the AdHu5-HA vaccine. Importantly, as opposed to AdHu5, PAV3 vector was not significantly neutralized by human antibodies pooled from over 10,000 individuals. Overall, PAV3-based vector is capable of mediating swift, strong immune responses and offer a promising alternative to AdHu5.","output":"A Porcine Adenovirus with Low Human Seroprevalence Is a Promising Alternative Vaccine Vector to Human Adenovirus 5 in an H5N1 Virus Disease Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disease resulting from virus infection is a complex event depending on the close interaction of viral and cellular factors. Through the application of biochemical and genetic methods, it is now possible to gain an insight into the molecular basis of these interactions. Thus, it has been shown that the glycoproteins of enveloped viruses play a central role in the initiation of infection. They are responsible not only for the adsorption of virions to cellular receptors, but are also for the entry of the genome into the cell by the fusion of viral envelopes with cellular membranes. Evidence is growing that the fusogenic glycoproteins are frequently activated by cellular proteases. The structure of the proteins at the cleavage site and the availability of a suitable protease are critical for tissue tropism, spread of the virus in the infected organism and, thus, for pathogenicity.

These unconventional fluorescent polymers are in general composed of heteroatoms (e.g. N, O, P, and S) under different forms. Here we report our recent study on polyurea, prepared by a very simple one step precipitation polymerization of toluene diisocyanate in a binary solvent of water-acetone. This polyurea, basically consisting of phenyl ring and urea group, shows fluorescent emission in a broad concentration range, from very low (10(-5) mg/mL) to its solubility limit (50 mg/mL), and in a wide range of emission wavelength from UV to visible regions of up to 500 nm under varied excitation wavelength. The emission behaviors were fully studied under different concentrations and excitations. It was concluded that the emission in UV region was intrinsic due to the conjugation between the phenyl and the adjacent urea unit; while the emission in visible region, strongly excitation dependent, was caused by the cluster formation of the molecular chains, in accordance with the cluster-triggered-emission (CTE) mechanism. The formation of the cluster was tested through dynamic light scattering, FTIR and UV absorbance. Tested in presence of different metal ions, Fe(3+) demonstrated a quenching effect with high selectivity. Based on this study, different paper-based sensors were designed to detect Fe(3+), H(2)O(2) in bioanalysis and for data encryption.

The rapidity and highly communicable nature of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has hampered the design and execution of definitive randomized, controlled trials of therapy outside of the clinic or hospital. In the absence of clinical trial results, physicians must use what has been learned about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in determining early outpatient treatment of the illness with the aim of preventing hospitalization or death. This paper outlines key pathophysiological principles that relate to the patient with early infection treated at home. Therapeutic approaches based on these principles include: 1) reduction of reinoculation, 2) combination antiviral therapy, 3) immunomodulation, 4) antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy 5) administration of oxygen, monitoring, and telemedicine. Future randomized trials testing the principles and agents discussed in this paper will undoubtedly refine and clarify their individual roles, however we emphasize the immediate need for management guidance in the setting of widespread hospital resource consumption, morbidity, and mortality.","output":"Pathophysiological Basis and Rationale for Early Outpatient Treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to restrictions against the COVID-19 pandemic, spectators were not allowed to attend soccer matches at the end of the 2019/2020 season. Previous studies suggest that the absence of a home crowd changes the home field advantage in terms of match outcomes, offensive performance, and referee decisions. However, because of the small sample sizes, these changes may be random rather than meaningful. To test this, we created 1,000,000 randomized samples from the previous four seasons with the exact same number of matches played behind closed doors in Europe's four most elite soccer leagues at the end of the 2019/2020 season. We found that across countries (Germany, Spain, Italy, and England), performance indices and referee decisions (except red cards) indeed changed to the detriment of the home team beyond the level of chance. However, this overall pattern could be ascribed to specific countries. Most importantly, the proportion of points won by the home teams declined significantly only in Germany, which was accompanied by a meaningful increase in (1) the proportion of goals scored by the away teams and (2) the proportion of yellow cards given to the home teams. We conclude that the home field advantage may indeed be lost when spectators are absent. However, in future studies, more detailed behavioral analyses are needed to determine the robustness and the behavioral determinants of this phenomenon across leagues and countries.","output":"Losing the Home Field Advantage When Playing Behind Closed Doors During COVID-19: Change or Chance?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic affects medical care worldwide, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, we aimed to assess its impact on health care provision, fear of infection, adherence to medical treatment, and compliance with preventative instructions in children and adolescents with IBD. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephonic survey using a Likert scale-based questionnaire was conducted among all pediatric patients with IBD from a single tertiary medical center. RESULTS: A total of 244 pediatric patients with IBD were included in the study, reporting a high rate of fear of severe COVID-19 infection due to IBD or IBD medications (198, 81.1%). Most of the patients obeyed the Ministry of Health instructions (228, 93.4%), while almost 50% took additional protective measures including avoidance of school and complete lockdown. Concerns regarding the attendance of regular clinics (116, 47.5%) and emergency room in case of IBD exacerbation (178, 73%) were frequently reported. Only 7 patients (2.9%) changed or discontinued their IBD treatment due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We noted several distinct features of the COVID-19 pandemic effect on pediatric patients with IBD including a high rate of fear of severe COVID-19 infection, fear of attending necessary medical facilities, and high rate of avoidance of social activities. IMPACT: Pediatric patients with IBD have a high rate of fear of severe COVID-19 infection, fear of attending necessary medical facilities, and a high rate of avoidance of social activities. Medication adherence rate in pediatric patients with IBD during the pandemic is similar to the adherence rate among adults with IBD.

Emerging evidences indicate that MCM2-7 (MCMs) are highly expressed in tissues from various malignant tumors. However, little is known about the clinical values of MCMs in breast cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS In our study, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to investigate expression patterns, potential functions, and prognostic values of MCMs in breast cancer, through ONCOMINE, bc-GenExMiner v4.1, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, cBioPortal and GeneMANIA databases. RESULTS We found that mRNA levels of MCMs were significantly elevated in breast cancer, especially in fast-growing and spreading tumor subtypes. These over-expressed MCMs predicted worse prognosis for breast cancer patients with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival. Among these six factors, high expression of MCM2/4/5/7 significantly reduced the RFS for patients with Luminal-A or B breast cancer and elevated MCM6/7 indicated shorter RFS for patients with basal-like or HER2-positive breast cancer. We also found that genomic alteration of MCMs was frequently found in breast cancer and the most common alteration was mRNA upregulation and amplification. Furthermore, MCMs were highly correlated with CDC45, CDC7, TIMELESS, ORC6, MCM10, ORC5, ORC4 and ORC3, mainly functioning to control the DNA replication initiation and genome stability.

The aim of this study was to determine the association between acute deterioration risk, care complexity factors and unfavourable outcomes in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A multicentre cohort study was conducted from 1 to 31 March 2020 at seven hospitals in Catalonia. All adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals and with a complete minimum data set were recruited retrospectively. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of a composite unfavourable outcome (in-hospital mortality and adverse events). The main measures included risk of acute deterioration (as measured using the VIDA early warning system) and care complexity factors. All data were obtained blinded from electronic health records. Multivariate logistic analysis was performed to identify the VIDA score and complexity factors associated with unfavourable outcomes. RESULTS: Out of a total of 1176 patients with COVID-19, 506 (43%) experienced an unfavourable outcome during hospitalisation. The frequency of unfavourable outcomes rose with increasing risk of acute deterioration as measured by the VIDA score. Risk factors independently associated with unfavourable outcomes were chronic underlying disease (OR: 1.90, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.72; p<0.001), mental status impairment (OR: 2.31, 95% CI 1.45 to 23.66; p<0.001), length of hospital stay (OR: 1.16, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.21; p<0.001) and high risk of acute deterioration (OR: 4.32, 95% CI 2.83 to 6.60; p<0.001).
