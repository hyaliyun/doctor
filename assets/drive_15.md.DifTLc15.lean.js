However, studies have shown that when people are overwhelmed by too much information (referred to as 'information overload'), this leads to adverse effects. This study examined the antecedents and consequences of information overload in the context of COVID-19. A survey was conducted among 627 residents in Seoul, South Korea, one of the earliest affected countries in the global outbreak. The results showed that cognitive capacity and the frequency of online news use and interpersonal communication were significant predictors of information overload. Information overload influenced how information is processed; it was associated with the tendency toward greater heuristic processing and less systematic processing. In addition, people were more likely to enact prevention behaviors when the information was processed systematically, as opposed to heuristically.

Illnesses range in severity from mild upper respiratory tract infections to serious lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). The relationship between viral load and specific viruses to clinical diagnosis made by physicians in this setting is poorly understood. METHODS we applied a real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) panel for 13 common respiratory viruses to 195 frozen, archival nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens obtained from symptomatic children  4 months of age presenting to the emergency room. Mean total viral load and number of viruses per archival nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen were compared between LRTI (n = 70) and non-LRTI (1 or more of upper respiratory tract infection, fever, or cough) (n = 125), as were yield and concordance of qPCR results to viral culture/direct fluorescence assay (DFA). RESULTS children with LRTI had significantly increased total viral load and harbored more viruses than the non-LRTI group. Respiratory syncytial virus-A and -B were significantly associated with LRTI, and parainfluenza virus-1 with non-LRTI. Individual loads of parainfluenza virus-2 and human rhinovirus were increased in LRTI versus non-LRTI. Quantitative PCR yielded more viruses (including coinfections, where a \\"dominant virus\\" was typically identified) than viral culture/DFA and documented nucleic acid from pathogens not tested by culture/DFA including human rhinovirus; coronaviruses -OC43, -229E, and -NL63; and metapneumovirus.

These non-coding RNAs, which are called subgenomicflavivirus RNAs (sfRNAs) or Xrn1-resistant RNAs (xrRNAs), are stable decay intermediates generated from the viral genomic RNA through the stalling of the cellular exoribonuclease Xrn1 at highly structured regions. Several functions of these flavivirus long non-coding RNAs have been revealed in recent years. The generation of these sfRNAs/xrRNAs from viral transcripts results in the repression of Xrn1 and the dysregulation of cellular mRNA stability. The abundant sfRNAs also serve directly as a decoy for important cellular protein regulators of the interferon and RNA interference antiviral pathways. Thus the generation of long non-coding RNAs from flaviviruses, hepaciviruses and pestiviruses likely disrupts aspects of innate immunity and may directly contribute to viral replication, cytopathology and pathogenesis.","output":"Standing your Ground to Exoribonucleases: Function of Flavivirus Long Non-coding RNAs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay reflects on the many upheavals of the past year and their implications for critical scholarship on surveillance.

Objective: To compare chest CT features of COVID-19, influenza, and OP using a multireader design, and to assess radiologists' performance in distinguishing between these conditions. Methods: This retrospective study included 150 chest CT examinations in 150 patients (mean age 5816 years) with diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or non-infectious OP (50 randomly selected abnormal CT examinations per diagnosis). Six thoracic radiologists independently assessed CT examinations for 14 individual CT findings and Radiologic Society of North America (RSNA) COVID-19 category and recorded a favored diagnosis. CT characteristics of the three diagnoses were compared using random effects models; readers' diagnostic performance was assessed. Results: COVID-19 pneumonia was significantly different (p<.05) from influenza pneumonia for seven of 14 chest CT findings, though different (p<.05) from OP for 4 of 14 findings [central or diffuse distribution in 10% and 7% of COVID-19 vs 20% and 21% of OP; unilateral distribution in 1% of COVID-19 vs 7% of OP; non-tree-in-bud nodules in 32% of COVID-19 vs 53% of OP; tree-in-bud nodules in 6% of COVID-19 vs 14% of OP]. A total of 70% of cases of COVID-19, 33% of influenza, and 47% of OP had an RSNA COVID-19 category of typical (p<.001). Mean percentage of correct favored diagnoses compared to actual diagnoses was 44% for COVID-19, 29% for influenza, and 39% for OP. Mean diagnostic accuracy of favored diagnoses was 70% for COVID-19 pneumonia and 68% for both influenza and OP. Conclusion: CT findings of COVID-19 substantially overlap with influenza and, to a greater extent, with OP. Radiologists' diagnostic accuracy was low in a study sample containing equal proportions of these three types of pneumonia.

Early attempts to control COVID-19 altered these assumptions with daycares/schools closing and the heavy shift to remote work. This calls into question whether couples tended to fall back on familiar gendered patterns to manage work and family, or if they adopted new strategies for the unique pandemic situation. We addressed this question using a sample of 274 dual-earner couples with young children. We content coded couples' qualitative responses about their plans for managing childcare and work commitments and used these codes in a latent class analysis to identify subgroups. Seven classes were identified, with 36.6% of the sample using strategies where women did most or all childcare, 18.9% of the sample using strategies that were not clearly gendered or egalitarian, and 44.5% of the sample using unique egalitarian strategies. We also obtained data from 133 of these couples approximately 7 weeks later regarding their well-being and job performance. Results suggested that women in the Remote Wife Does It All class had the lowest well-being and performance.

Countries have responded with various levels of lockdown to save lives and stop health systems from being overwhelmed. At the same time, lockdowns entail large socioeconomic costs. One exit strategy under consideration is a mobile phone app that traces the close contacts of those infected with COVID-19. Recent research has demonstrated the theoretical effectiveness of this solution in different disease settings. However, concerns have been raised about such apps because of the potential privacy implications. This could limit the acceptability of app-based contact tracing in the general population. As the effectiveness of this approach increases strongly with app uptake, it is crucial to understand public support for this intervention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the user acceptability of a contact-tracing app in five countries hit by the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a largescale, multicountry study (N=5995) to measure public support for the digital contact tracing of COVID-19 infections. We ran anonymous online surveys in France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We measured intentions to use a contact-tracing app across different installation regimes (voluntary installation vs automatic installation by mobile phone providers) and studied how these intentions vary across individuals and countries. RESULTS: We found strong support for the app under both regimes, in all countries, across all subgroups of the population, and irrespective of regional-level COVID-19 mortality rates. We investigated the main factors that may hinder or facilitate uptake and found that concerns about cybersecurity and privacy, together with a lack of trust in the government, are the main barriers to adoption. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological evidence shows that app-based contact tracing can suppress the spread of COVID-19 if a high enough proportion of the population uses the app and that it can still reduce the number of infections if uptake is moderate. Our findings show that the willingness to install the app is very high. The available evidence suggests that app-based contact tracing may be a viable approach to control the diffusion of COVID-19.","output":"Acceptability of App-Based Contact Tracing for COVID-19: Cross-Country Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The members of the interleukin-17 (IL-17) cytokine family and their receptors were identified decades ago. Unlike IL-17 receptor A (IL-17RA), which heterodimerizes with IL-17RB, IL-17RC, and IL-17RD and mediates proinflammatory gene expression, IL-17RB plays a distinct role in promoting tumor growth and metastasis upon stimulation with IL-17B. However, the molecular basis by which IL-17RB promotes oncogenesis is unknown. Here, we report that IL-17RB forms a homodimer and recruits mixed-lineage kinase 4 (MLK4), a dual kinase, to phosphorylate it at tyrosine-447 upon treatment with IL-17B in vitro. Higher amounts of phosphorylated IL-17RB in tumor specimens obtained from patients with pancreatic cancer correlated with worse prognosis. Phosphorylated IL-17RB recruits the ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif containing 56 to add lysine-63-linked ubiquitin chains to lysine-470 of IL-17RB, which further assembles NF-B activator 1 (ACT1) and other factors to propagate downstream oncogenic signaling. Consequentially, IL-17RB mutants with substitution at either tyrosine-447 or lysine-470 lose their oncogenic activity. Treatment with a peptide consisting of amino acids 403 to 416 of IL-17RB blocks MLK4 binding, tyrosine-477 phosphorylation, and lysine-470 ubiquitination in vivo, thereby inhibiting tumorigenesis and metastasis and prolonging the life span of mice bearing pancreatic tumors.

Innate immune responses, which are critical for control of WNV infection, are initiated by signaling through pathogen recognition receptors, RIG-I and MDA5, and their downstream adaptor molecule, MAVS. Here, we show that a deficiency of MAVS in hematopoietic cells resulted in increased mortality and delayed WNV clearance from the brain. In Mavs(-/-) mice, a dysregulated immune response was detected, characterized by a massive influx of macrophages and virus-specific T cells into the infected brain. These T cells were polyfunctional and lysed peptide-pulsed target cells in vitro However, virus-specific T cells in the brains of infected Mavs(-/-) mice exhibited lower functional avidity than those in wild-type animals, and even virus-specific memory T cells generated by prior immunization could not protect Mavs(-/-) mice from WNV-induced lethal disease. Concomitant with ineffective virus clearance, macrophage numbers were increased in the Mavs(-/-) brain, and both macrophages and microglia exhibited an activated phenotype. Microarray analyses of leukocytes in the infected Mavs(-/-) brain showed a preferential expression of genes associated with activation and inflammation. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for MAVS in hematopoietic cells in augmenting the kinetics of WNV clearance and thereby preventing a dysregulated and pathogenic immune response. IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important cause of mosquito-transmitted encephalitis in the United States. The innate immune response is known to be critical for protection in infected mice. Here, we show that expression of MAVS, a key adaptor molecule in the RIG-I-like receptor RNA-sensing pathway, in hematopoietic cells is critical for protection from lethal WNV infection. In the absence of MAVS, there is a massive infiltration of myeloid cells and virus-specific T cells into the brain and overexuberant production of proinflammatory cytokines.

A comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the COVID-19 disease spread trajectories for the next 2 months. METHODS: The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. The spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents. The recent reported data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the last 3 months was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries. The advanced ARIMA model was used for predicting future data based on time series data. The ARIMA model provides a weight to past values and error values to correct the model prediction, so it is better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. RESULTS: The top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model. The identified top 15 countries with cumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 were compared. The United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, and Russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease. There was a fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil, and a slow recovery ratio in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy. There was a high death rate ratio in Italy and the United Kingdom and a lower death rate ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, and the United States. The ARIMA model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 15 countries from April 24 to July 7, 2020. Its value is represented with 95%, 80%, and 70% confidence interval values. The validation of the ARIMA model was done using the Akaike information criterion value; its values were about 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19, respectively, which represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS: The observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries will double in all the observed countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. It was also observed that the death and recovery rates were rose faster when compared to confirmed cases over the next 2 months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in the United States, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

To fill these gaps, we examined time trends in racial/ethnic disparities in COVID-19 infection and mortality. We used the Veteran Health Administrations (VHA) national database of veteran COVID-19 infections over three time periods: 3/1/2020C5/31/2020 (spring); 6/1/2020C8/31/2020 (summer); and 9/1/2020C11/25/2020 (fall). We calculated COVID-19 infection and mortality predicted probabilities from logistic regression models that included time period-by-race/ethnicity interaction terms, and controlled for age, gender, and prior diagnosis of CDC risk factors. Racial/ethnic groups at higher risk for COVID-19 infection and mortality changed over time. American Indian/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN), Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders experienced higher COVID-19 infections compared to Whites during the summertime. There were mortality disparities for Blacks in springtime, and AI/ANs, Asians, and Hispanics in summertime. Policy makers should consider the dynamic nature of racial/ethnic disparities as the pandemic evolves, and potential effects of risk mitigation and other (e.g., economic) policies on these disparities.

To reduce the burden for the patients, video consultation can be an alternative to traditional in-person hospital consultations. The aim of the current study was, from the perspectives of patients and health care providers, to investigate the perceived benefits and challenges of using video consultations in outpatient renal transplant recipient follow-up. METHODS: Patients (i.e., renal transplant recipients; n = 18) alternated between regular in-person follow-up consultations and video consultations. Patients and health care providers were then invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Patients interviewed (n = 15) were median 53 years old (range 37C64) and 53% female. The video consultation solution used in the study turned out to have major technical deficiencies. Despite the technical challenges, however, the majority of the patients reported appreciating being able to alternate between video and in-person hospital consultations. Main benefits reported included not needing to travel to the hospital and thereby saving time, less focus on being chronically ill and potential economic benefits for patients and society. The health care providers (n = 3) also valued the benefits provided by the use of video consultations, but described the reoccurring technical challenges as disruptive. The fact that patients were in a stable phase of their health condition and already had an established, trusting relationship with their nephrologist, acted as facilitators for success. Possible challenges and harms described included concerns related to security, confidentiality and interruptions, as well as the potential need for physical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Benefits from using video consultations as an alternative to in-person consultations may outweigh potential technological challenges for patients as well as health care providers. A long-lasting mutually trusting relationship between patient and provider may be an important prerequisite for the experienced benefits of using video consultation. Findings also indicate that starting such care delivery changes in a small-scale, with a few selected patients in a stable phase of their condition, may be an important factor for success.

Telemedicine use in pediatrics has increased in recent years. This has resulted in improved health care access, optimized disease management, progress in the monitoring of health conditions, and fewer exposures to patients with illnesses during pandemics (eg, the COVID-19 pandemic). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically evaluate the most recent evidence on the feasibility and accessibility of telemedicine services, patients' and care providers' satisfaction with these services, and treatment outcomes related to telemedicine service use among pediatric populations with different health conditions. METHODS: Studies were obtained from the PubMed database on May 10, 2020. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. In this review, we included randomized controlled trials from the last 10 years that used a telemedicine approach as a study intervention or assessed telemedicine as a subspecialty of pediatric care. Titles and abstracts were independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. Afterward, full texts were retrieved and independently screened based on the eligibility criteria. A standardized form was used to extract the following data: publication title, first author's name, publication year, participants' characteristics, study design, the technology-based approach that was used, intervention characteristics, study goals, and study findings. RESULTS: In total, 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All studies were categorized as randomized controlled trials (8/11, 73%) or cluster randomized trials (3/11, 27%). The number of participants in each study ranged from 22 to 400. The health conditions that were assessed included obesity (3/11, 27%), asthma (2/11, 18%), mental health conditions (1/11, 9%), otitis media (1/11, 9%), skin conditions (1/11, 9%), type 1 diabetes (1/11, 9%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (1/11, 9%), and cystic fibrosis-related pancreatic insufficiency (1/11). The telemedicine approaches that were used included patient and doctor videoconferencing visits (5/11, 45%), smartphone-based interventions (3/11, 27%), telephone counseling (2/11, 18%), and telemedicine-based screening visits (1/11, 9%). The telemedicine interventions in all included studies resulted in outcomes that were comparable to or better than the outcomes of control groups. These outcomes were related to symptom management, quality of life, satisfaction, medication adherence, visit completion rates, and disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Although more research is needed, the evidence from this review suggests that telemedicine services for the general public and pediatric care are comparable to or better than in-person services. Patients, health care professionals, and caregivers may benefit from using both telemedicine services and traditional, in-person health care services. To maximize the potential of telemedicine, future research should focus on improving patients' access to care, increasing the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine services, and eliminating barriers to telemedicine use.","output":"Telemedicine in Pediatrics: Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs), enveloped positive-sense RNA viruses, are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface, an unusually large RNA genome, and a unique replication strategy.

We focused on visits for respiratory illness (SARS-like symptoms) and different age groups. METHODS This study is a retrospective review of ED discharge diagnoses obtained from a computerized database, examining the 4-week period starting March 28 for the years 2001-2004. We obtained the discharge diagnosis, age and visit date for each ED patient during the relevant time intervals, then compared visit data from 2003 and 2004 with a baseline derived from the average number of visits during 2001 and 2002. We constructed groupings based on age and respiratory-illness symptoms. RESULTS During the SARS outbreak in 2003, ED visits declined by 21% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-24%) over the 4-week study period. The greatest reduction was for combined infant and toddler visits (69%; 95% CI, 58%-79%); these did not recover the following year. However, during the SARS outbreak there was a large increase in the number of visits for respiratory illnesses in adults (61%; 95% CI, 46%-75%) and in teenagers (132%; 95% CI, 82%-182%). CONCLUSIONS During the SARS outbreak, total ED visits fell. The relative decline was most notable for infants and toddlers. By contrast, there was an increase in respiratory illness-related visits for adults and teenagers.

The operational complexities of existing PCR-based methods, including sample transfer to advanced central laboratories with expensive equipment, limit their use in resource-limited settings. However, with the advent of the isothermal technologies, detection of SARS-CoV-2 is possible at decentralized facilities. Methods In this current study, two recombinase-based isothermal techniques, reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay (RT-RPA) and reverse transcription recombinase aided amplification assay (RT-RAA), were evaluated for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical samples. In total,76 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 cases and 100 negative controls were evaluated to determine the diagnostic performance of the isothermal methods. Results Our investigation revealed equally promising diagnostic accuracy of the methods with a sensitivity of 76.32% (95% CI: 65.18%-85.32%) when the target genes were RdRP and ORF1ab for RT-RPA and RT-RAA, respectively, while the combination of N and RdRP in RT-RPA augmenting the accuracy of the assay at a sensitivity of 85.53% (95% CI: 75.58% -92.55%). Furthermore, high specificity was observed for each of the methods ranged 94.00%-98.00%(95% CI: 87.40-9.76%).

Especially, Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ /g-C3 N4 obtained by in situ synthesis is not only more conducive to the tight junction of Zn2 GeO4 and g-C3 N4 , but also more favorable for g-C3 N4 to anchor rare-earth atoms. Under visible-light irradiation, Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ /g-C3 N4 shows more than five times enhancement in the catalytic efficiency compared to that of pure g-C3 N4 without any sacrificial agent in the photocatalytic reaction system. A series of theoretical and experimental results show that the charge density around Er, Ge, Zn, and O increases compared with Zn2 GeO4 :Er3+ , while the charge density around C decreases compared with g-C3 N4 . These results show that an efficient way of electron transfer is provided to promote charge separation, and the dual functions of CO2 molecular activation of Er3+ single atom and 4f levels as electron transport bridge are fully exploited.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 22 patients of the 156 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between March 27, 2020 and March 31, 2020 at our quaternary care academic medical center and who underwent CT imaging within 1 week of admission were included in this retrospective study. Demographics and clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Two thoracic radiologists independently categorized each CT study on the basis of RSNA/STR/ACR consensus guidelines. Disagreement in categorization was resolved by consensus discussion with a third thoracic radiologist. RESULTS At the time of imaging, 16 patients (73%) were suspected of COVID-19, and 6 patients (27%) were not. Common symptoms at presentation were fever (73%), cough (77%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (59%). An overall 63% of suspected COVID-19 patients exhibited shortness of breath, whereas 0 unsuspected COVID-19 patients did (P=0.02). On the basis of the RSNA consensus guidelines, 68%, 18%, 9%, and 5% of studies were categorized as \\"typical appearance,\\" \\"indeterminate appearance,\\" \\"atypical appearance,\\" and \\"negative for pneumonia,\\" respectively.

Ideally, software productivity could be maximized with portable programming models that are able to maintain high performance across architectures. While in many cases compiler directives have been used as an easy way to offload parallel regions of a CPU-based program to a GPU accelerator, they may also be an attractive programming model for providing portability across different GPU vendors, in which case the porting process may proceed in the reverse direction: from low-level, architecture-specific code to higher-level directive-based abstractions.

Health systems must protect persons at any age while paying particular attention to those with risk factors. However, essential freedoms must be respected and social/psychological needs met for those shielded. The example of the older population in Israel may provide interesting public health lessons. Relatively speaking, Israel is a demographically young country, with only 11.5% of its population 65 years and older as compared with the OECD average of >17%. As well, a lower proportion of older persons is in long-term institutions in Israel than in most other OECD countries.

Methods In this retrospective study, clinical records of all adult liver disease patients with clinically confirmed ARI, whose request for respiratory viral testing were received in the virology laboratory during September 2016 - March 2019 were reviewed. Respiratory viruses were identified by real time PCR on FilmArray 2.0 instrument (BioFire Diagnostics, Utah, USA) using Respiratory panel as per the manufacturer's instructions. Results Of the 603 patients of liver disease with clinically confirmed influenza like illness, over all incidence of respiratory viral infection was 24.3% (n= 147).

We show that the massive use of temporary work and the weakness of the efforts made by traditional trade unions federations prevent the emergence of a larger labor movement in the sector.

Older age (HR 2.88, 95% CI 2.09 to 3.98), presence of comorbidities (HR 2.56, 95% CI 1.84 to 3.55), history of hypertension (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.67 to 6.08), and presence of symptoms at the time of admission (HR 3.21, 95% CI 1.41 to 7.26) were associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Treatment with a combination of azithromycin with hydroxychloroquine, antiviral or steroid compared with no treatment did not alter the disease course and in-hospital mortality. The combined effect of old age and presence of comorbid conditions was more pronounced in women than men. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital patients were younger, less symptomatic with lesser need of ventilators and oxygen support as compared with many western countries.

While nightlife settings are often associated with drug use, it is unknown whether virtual events are associated with use. METHODS: Electronic dance music (EDM) partygoers who live in New York and reported recent drug use were recruited online and screened for eligibility throughout April and May 2020. Eligible adults (n = 128) were asked about virtual rave and happy hour attendance during the COVID-19 crisis. We examined prevalence and correlates of drug use during such events. RESULTS: 55.5% of participants attended virtual raves and 69.5% attended virtual happy hours. 40.9% used illegal drugs during virtual raves and the most frequently used drugs were cannabis (29.6%), ecstasy/MDMA/Molly (8.5%), LSD (7.0%), and cocaine (4.2%). 33.7% used illegal drugs during virtual happy hours and the most frequently used drugs were cannabis (29.2%), cocaine (3.4%), and ketamine (3.4%). Older participants were more likely to use illegal drugs during virtual raves, and those reporting past-year use of more drugs were more likely to use drugs during virtual raves and/or happy hours (ps<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: EDM partygoers are at risk for using drugs during virtual events.

The members of this group have a remarkable capability of infecting both animals and humans. Inimitably, the replication of the RNA genome continues through the set of viral mRNA molecules. Coronaviruses received the least attention until 2003 since they caused only minor respiratory tract illnesses. However, this changed exclusively with the introduction of zoonotic SARS-CoV in 2003. In 2012, MERS-CoV emerged and confirmed this group of viruses as the major causative agents of severe respiratory tract illness. Today, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (i.e., COVID-19) has turned out to be a chief health problem that causes a severe acute respiratory disorder in humans. Since the first identification of COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, this infection has devastatingly spread all around the globe leading to a crippling affliction for humans. The strain is known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and WHO (the World Health Organization) has termed this new pandemic disease as Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). COVID-19 is still spreading, with an estimated 136 million confirmed cases and more than 2.94 million deaths worldwide so far while the pandemic is still going on. In the current scenario, there is no particular treatment for COVID-19, however remarkable efforts for immunization and vaccine development can be observed. Therefore, the execution of precautions and proper preventive measures are indispensable to minimize and control the community transmission of the virus.

Few studies report the proportion of missing data and even fewer describe the methods used to adjust the results for missing data. The objective of this review was to determine the analytical methods used for analysis in HIV surveys with missing data. METHODS: We searched for population, demographic and cross-sectional surveys of HIV published from January 2000 to April 2018 in Pub Med/Medline, Web of Science core collection, Latin American and Caribbean Sciences Literature, Africa-Wide Information and Scopus, and by reviewing references of included articles. All potential abstracts were imported into Covidence and abstracts screened by two independent reviewers using pre-specified criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. A piloted data extraction tool was used to extract data and assess the risk of bias of the eligible studies. Data were analysed through a quantitative approach; variables were presented and summarised using figures and tables. RESULTS: A total of 3426 citations where identified, 194 duplicates removed, 3232 screened and 69 full articles were obtained. Twenty-four studies were included. The response rate for an HIV test of the included studies ranged from 32 to 96% with the major reason for the missing data being refusal to consent for an HIV test. Complete case analysis was the primary method of analysis used, multiple imputations 11(46%) was the most advanced method used, followed by the Heckman's selection model 9(38%). Single Imputation and Instrumental variables method were used in only two studies each, with 13(54%) other different methods used in several studies. Forty-two percent of the studies applied more than two methods in the analysis, with a maximum of 4 methods per study. Only 6(25%) studies conducted a sensitivity analysis, while 11(46%) studies had a significant change of estimates after adjusting for missing data. CONCLUSION: Missing data in survey studies is still a problem in disease estimation. Our review outlined a number of methods that can be used to adjust for missing data on HIV studies; however, more information and awareness are needed to allow informed choices on which method to be applied for the estimates to be more reliable and representative.","output":"Analytical methods used in estimating the prevalence of HIV/AIDS from demographic and cross-sectional surveys with missing data: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2020, Italy experienced the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) B.1.1.7 lineage.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characteristics of HAdV infections among hospitalized children with ARTI in Hebei, Northern China from June 2017 to May 2018. STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month longitudinal, retrospective study on HAdV, typed by nested polymerase chain reaction targeting the hexon genes hypervariable region (typing was merely performed by sequencing of the hexon neutralization epitope and thus genotypes could not be identified unequivocally), associated with ARTI was performed. The epidemiological and clinical data of different types of HAdV were analyzed using statistical product and service solutions (SPSS) 21.0 software. RESULTS: HAdV was detected in 330 (3.71%) of the 8906 specimens, with most (88.48%, 292/330) HAdV-positives cases detected among children < 3 years old. HAdV were detected throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring. 11 types were identified, with HAdV-2 (33.33%, 110/330) as the predominant type, followed by HAdV-3 (21.21%, 70/330) and HAdV-7 (13.94%, 46/330). Of the 330 HAdV-positive specimens, 247 (74.85%) were co-detected with other respiratory pathogens, most commonly rhinovirus (HRV) (58.7%, 145/247). Additionally, patients with HAdV-7 positive had longer duration of fever than HAdV-2 or -3 positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, HAdV-2, HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were the predominant types identified from children with ARTI in Hebei Province.

Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) is a novel beta coronavirus responsible for COVID-19. Although pulmonary parenchymal and vascular changes associated with COVID-19 are well established, pleural space abnormalities have not been the primary focus of investigations. Methods: Narrative overview of the medical literature regarding pleural space abnormalities in COVID-19. The appropriate manuscripts were identified by searching electronic medical databases and by hand searching the bibliography of the identified papers. Pleural abnormalities on transverse and ultrasound imaging are discussed. The incidence, clinical features, pathophysiology, and fluid characteristics of pleural effusion are reviewed. Studies reporting pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are examined to evaluate for pathogenesis and prognosis. A brief comparative analysis of pleural abnormalities among patients with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has been provided. Conclusions: Radiologic pleural abnormalities are common in COVID-19, but the incidence of pleural effusion appears to be low. Pneumothorax is rare and does not independently predispose the patient to worse outcomes.

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12-31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57-82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures-such as many low-income countries-the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.","output":"Age-dependent effects in the transmission and control of COVID-19 epidemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, the degradation of 4, 4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene) diphenol (bisphenol AF, BPAF) by ozone was studied and toxicity of the degradation products was evaluated. Kinetic studies showed that acidic conditions were more conducive to the ozone degradation of BPAF than alkaline conditions. In the presence of common anions, Br- and SO42- promoted the degradation of BPAF, whereas NO2-, NO3-, HSO3- inhibited the degradation, and the other anions and cations had no significant effect. The degradation products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, and were mainly manifested in hydroxylation, carboxylation and cleavage of benzene ring. The addition of NO2-, HSO3- and Br-produced the corresponding free radicals, resulting in the parent compound being attacked and affecting the degradation efficiency and pathways. The theoretical calculated results showed that the ortho-site of the BPAF phenolic hydroxyl group was more active than the meta-position, and it's more likely for free radicals to attack ortho-sites and initiate substitution reactions. Toxicity assessment of the products in the process of ozone degradation showed that toxicity of the products was reduced by benzene ring cleavage and a reduction in the F atomic number. However, the toxicity of nitro and brominated products of BPAF was increased. These findings provide some new insights into the role of common ions in ozonation process and product formation, and supplement the existing conclusions. The results of this study remind future researchers to concern that inorganic ions in real water may be converted into corresponding free radicals that affect the formation of ozone oxidation products.","output":"Influence of anions on ozonation of bisphenol AF: Kinetics, reaction pathways, and toxicity assessment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Ovarian cancer is now recognized as a number of distinct diseases primarily defined by histological subtype. Both clear cell ovarian carcinomas (CCC) and ovarian endometrioid carcinomas (EC) may arise from endometriosis and frequently harbor mutations in the ARID1A tumor suppressor gene. We studied the influence of histological subtype on protein expression with reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and assessed proteomic changes associated with ARID1A mutation/BAF250a expression in EC and CCC. METHODS Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BAF250a expression was performed on 127 chemotherapy-naive ovarian carcinomas (33 CCC, 29 EC, and 65 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSC)). Whole tumor lysates were prepared from frozen banked tumor samples and profiled by RPPA using 116 antibodies. ARID1A mutations were identified by exome sequencing, and PIK3CA mutations were characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) was performed to determine differential protein expression by histological subtype and ARID1A mutation status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the impact of ARID1A mutation status/BAF250a expression on AKT phosphorylation (pAKT). PIK3CA mutation type and PTEN expression were included in the model. BAF250a knockdown was performed in 3 clear cell lines using siRNA to ARID1A. RESULTS Marked differences in protein expression were observed that are driven by histotype. Compared to HGSC, SAM identified over 50 proteins that are differentially expressed in CCC and EC. These included PI3K/AKT pathway proteins, those regulating the cell cycle, apoptosis, transcription, and other signaling pathways including steroid hormone signaling. Multivariate models showed that tumors with loss of BAF250a expression showed significantly higher levels of AKT-Thr308 and AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation (p < 0.05). In 31 CCC cases, pAKT was similarly significantly increased in tumors with BAF250a loss on IHC. Knockdown of BAF250a by siRNA in three CCC cell lines wild type for ARID1A showed no increase in either pAKT-Thr308 or pAKT-S473 suggesting that pAKT in tumor tissues is indirectly regulated by BAF250a expression. CONCLUSIONS Proteomic assessment of CCC and EC demonstrates remarkable differences in protein expression that are dependent on histotype, thereby further characterizing these cancers. AKT phosphorylation is associated with ARID1A/BAF250a deficient tumors, however in ovarian cancers the mechanism remains to be elucidated.","output":"A functional proteogenomic analysis of endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas using reverse phase protein array and mutation analysis: protein expression is histotype-specific and loss of ARID1A/BAF250a is associated with AKT phosphorylation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We surveyed 204 MSM who were PrEP users One in four daily PrEP users stopped taking PrEP during the COVID-19 pandemic and 5% switched to on-demand PrEP Most men reduced PrEP use because they stopped having casual sex and reduced the number of casual partners during the COVID-19 pandemic","output":"Changing the use of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men during the COVID-19 pandemic in Melbourne, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El presente trabajo tuvo como objetivo determinar el impacto financiero en los rendimientos accionarios de 60 empresas farmacuticas que cotizaron en el ndice Standard & Poor's 500 en el periodo 2003-2020 ante los comunicados de prensa de la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud, relativos a las pandemias del sndrome respiratorio agudo grave, la influenza H1N1 y la COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Para contrastar la hiptesis de que dichos comunicados influyen en los precios de las cotizaciones de las acciones, se aplic la metodologa de estudios de eventos y se conform una investigacin cuantitativa con alcance correlacional Los principales hallazgos permiten afirmar que los reportes de la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud relativos a las pandemias tienen impactos medibles en el desempe?o burstil de las empresas farmacuticas que integran el ndice S&P 500 Alternate abstract:The present work aims to determine the financial impact on the stock returns of 60 pharmaceutical companies listed in the Standard & Poor's 500 index in the period 2003-2020, in response to the press releases of the World Health Organization, regarding pandemics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza H1N1, and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemics To test the hypothesis that these press releases affect the stock prices, the events study methodology was used, and quantitative research with a correlational scope was applied The main findings confirm that the World Health Organization reports regarding pandemics have measurable impacts on the stock market performance of the pharmaceutical companies members of the S&P 500 index Alternate abstract:O presente trabalho teve como objetivo determinar o impacto financeiro no rendimento das a?oes de 60 empresas farmacuticas listadas no ndice Standard & Poor's 500 no perodo 2003-2020, ? luz dos comunicados de imprensa da Organiza?ao Mundial da Sade (OMS), relativos ?s pandemias de sndrome respiratria aguda grave, influenza H1N1 e COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) Para contrastar a hiptese de que estes comunicados influenciam nos pre?os das a?oes, foi aplicada a metodologia de estudos de eventos, formando uma pesquisa quantitativa com escopo correlacional As principais descobertas permitem afirmar que os relatrios da Organiza?ao Mundial da Sade sobre as pandemias, tm impactos mensurveis no desempenho do mercado de a?oes das empresas farmacuticas que integram o ndice S&P 500","output":"Los comunicados de la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud relativos a las pandemias y su impacto en farmacuticas que integran el ndice Standard & Poor's 500"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral health organizations have canceled, rescheduled and even turned away patients, according to results of a new survey on the economic impact of COVID-19 ? an impact felt even more among smaller organizations The survey of 880 community behavioral health organizations (CBHOs) around the country served to clarify the impact of the virus on patients, employment safety and financial viability","output":"Survey: BH organizations closing programs, reducing staff amid pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Anticipated psychological responses and perceptions of risk have not been examined prior to the outbreak of an epidemic.

Biofilms were formed for 96 h on coverslips using the Amsterdam Active Attachment model, followed by 24 h treatment with nanocarriers containing different concentrations of each antifungal (78 and 156 g/mL). MCZ or FLZ (156 g/mL), and untreated biofilms were considered as controls. Anti-biofilm effects were evaluated by enumeration of colony-forming units (CFUs), composition of the extracellular matrix, lactic acid production, and structure and live/dead biofilm cells (confocal laser scanning microscopy-CLSM). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Fisher LSDs test ( = 0.05). IONPs-CS carrying MCZ or FLZ were the most effective treatments in reducing CFUs compared to either an antifungal agent alone for C. albicans and MCZ for C. glabrata. Significant reductions in mutans streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. were shown, though mainly for the MCZ nanocarrier. Antifungals and their nanocarriers also showed significantly higher proportions of dead cells compared to untreated biofilm by CLSM (p < 0.001), and promoted significant reductions in lactic acid, while simultaneously showing increases in some components of the extracellular matrix. These findings reinforce the use of nanocarriers as effective alternatives to fight oral fungal infections.","output":"Effects of Antifungal Carriers Based on Chitosan-Coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles on Microcosm Biofilms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 vaccines are currently being administrated worldwide and playing a critical role in controlling the pandemic. They have been designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against Spike protein of the original SARS-CoV-2, and hence they are less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutated Spike than the original virus. It is possible that novel variants with abilities of enhanced transmissibility and/or immunoevasion will appear in the near future and perfectly escape from vaccine-elicited immunity. Therefore, the current vaccines may need to be improved to compensate for the viral evolution. For this purpose, it may be beneficial to take advantage of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Several lines of evidence suggest the contribution of CTLs on the viral control in COVID-19, and CTLs target a wide range of proteins involving comparatively conserved non-structural proteins. Here, we identified twenty-two HLA-A*24:02-restricted CTL candidate epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a (pp1a) of SARS-CoV-2 using computational algorithms, HLA-A*24:02 transgenic mice and the peptide-encapsulated liposomes. We focused on pp1a and HLA-A*24:02 because pp1a is relatively conserved and HLA-A*24:02 is predominant in East Asians such as Japanese. The conservation analysis revealed that the amino acid sequences of 7 out of the 22 epitopes were hardly affected by a number of mutations in the Sequence Read Archive database of SARS-CoV-2 variants. The information of such conserved epitopes might be useful for designing the next-generation COVID-19 vaccine that is universally effective against any SARS-CoV-2 variants by the induction of both anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies and CTLs specific for conserved epitopes.

TLR expression/distribution is varying in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) depending on their culture environments. Here, to explore the effect of periodic thermomechanical cues on TLRs, thermally controlled shape-memory polymer sheets with programmable actuation capacity were created. The proportion of MSCs expressing SARS-CoV-2-associated TLRs was increased upon stimulation. The TLR4/7 colocalization was promoted and retained in the endoplasmic reticula. The TLR redistribution was driven by myosin-mediated F-actin assembly. These results highlight the potential of boosting the immunity for combating COVID-19 via thermomechanical preconditioning of MSCs. GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: Periodic thermal and synchronous mechanical stimuli provided by polymer sheet actuators selectively promoted the expression of SARS-CoV-2-associated TLRs 4 and 7 in adipose-derived MSCs and recruited TLR4 to Endoplasmic reticulum region where TLR7 was located via controlling myosin-mediated F-actin cytoskeleton assembly.

Infection is ubiquitous in infancy and induces inflammation, a key cardiometabolic risk factor, but the relationship between infection, inflammation, and metabolic profiles in early childhood remains unexplored. We investigated relationships between infection and plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles at age 6 and 12 months, and mediation of these associations by inflammation. METHODS: Matched infection, metabolomics, and lipidomics data were generated from 555 infants in a pre-birth longitudinal cohort. Infection data from birth to 12 months were parent-reported (total infections at age 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months), inflammation markers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]; glycoprotein acetyls [GlycA]) were quantified at 12 months. Metabolic profiles were 12-month plasma nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics (228 metabolites) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry lipidomics (776 lipids). Associations were evaluated with multivariable linear regression models. In secondary analyses, corresponding inflammation and metabolic data from birth (serum) and 6-month (plasma) time points were used. RESULTS: At 12 months, more frequent infant infections were associated with adverse metabolomic (elevated inflammation markers, triglycerides and phenylalanine, and lower high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1) and lipidomic profiles (elevated phosphatidylethanolamines and lower trihexosylceramides, dehydrocholesteryl esters, and plasmalogens). Similar, more marked, profiles were observed with higher GlycA, but not hsCRP. GlycA mediated a substantial proportion of the relationship between infection and metabolome/lipidome, with hsCRP generally mediating a lower proportion. Analogous relationships were observed between infection and 6-month inflammation, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A1. CONCLUSIONS: Infants with a greater infection burden in the first year of life had proinflammatory and proatherogenic plasma metabolomic/lipidomic profiles at 12 months of age that in adults are indicative of heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. These findings suggest potentially modifiable pathways linking early life infection and inflammation with subsequent cardiometabolic risk.

Arthroscopic capsular shift combined with Bankart repair can reduce the capsular volume and reinforce the redundant capsule; however, as the capsuloligamentous structure has viscoelastic properties, it is possible for the shifted and tensioned capsule of the glenohumeral joint to slowly stretch out again over time, resulting in an increase in capsular volume. PURPOSE To analyze changes in capsular volume of the glenohumeral joint over time after arthroscopic Bankart repair and capsular shift, the factors associated with these changes, and their relevance to outcomes. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Included in this study were 105 patients (mean age, 25.8  8.2 years) who underwent arthroscopic Bankart repair and capsular shift for anterior shoulder instability and computed tomography arthrography (CTA) at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively and whose various functional outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and at the last follow-up (>12 months). Among these patients, 27 also had preoperative CTA. These 27 patients were used to make comparisons between preoperative and 3-month postoperative CTA measurements, and all 105 patients were used for all other comparisons. Two raters measured the separate anterior and posterior capsular volume and cross-sectional area at the 5-o'clock position using 3-dimensional (3D) Slicer software. These measurements were subsequently adjusted for each glenoid size. The changes in capsular volume and cross-sectional area at the 5-o'clock position over time, the factors related to higher change in anterior capsular volume, and their correlation with outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Three months postoperatively, the total and anterior capsular volume and anterior cross-sectional area significantly decreased; however, these values increased again at 1 year postoperatively (all P < .01). The inter- and intraobserver reliabilities of the measurements were excellent (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.717-0.945). Female sex, being an elite athlete, and more dislocations before surgery were related to a higher increase in anterior capsular volume at 1 year (all P < .05). Eight patients had redislocation, and 18 exhibited positive apprehension test postoperatively, and these patients showed significantly higher increases in anterior and total capsular volume at 1 year than did those without redislocation or positive apprehension sign (all P < .01). However, with the exception of Rowe score, a higher increase in anterior capsular volume was not related to functional outcome measures. CONCLUSION Surgeons should be aware of the re-increase in anterior capsular volume or restretching trait of the anterior capsule over time, even after successful arthroscopic Bankart repair and capsular shift. In this study, women, elite athletes, and those with frequent dislocations were at high risk of capsular restretching. An increase in capsular volume was related to redislocation and positive apprehension sign as well as with Rowe score.","output":"Factors affecting capsular volume changes and association with outcomes after Bankart repair and capsular shift."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Planetary health (PH) has emerged as a leading field for raising awareness, debating, and finding solutions for the health impacts of human-caused disruptions to Earth's natural systems. PH education addresses essential questions of how humanity inhabits Earth, and how humans affect, and are affected by, natural systems. A pilot massive open online course (MOOC) in PH was created in Brazil in 2020. This MOOC capitalized on the global online pivot, to make the course accessible to a broader audience. This study describes the process of course creation and development and assesses the impact evaluation data and student outcomes of the PH MOOC. Methods: The PH MOOC pilot was launched in Brazilian Portuguese, using the TelessadeRS-UFRGS platform on 4/27/2020 and concluded on 7/19/2020 with a total load of 80 h. It was composed of 8 content modules, pre and post-test, 10 topics in a forum discussion, and an optional action plan. This study analyzes the course database, profile of participants, answers to questionnaires, forum interaction, and action plans submitted. Results: Two thousand seven hundred seventy-seven participants enrolled in the course, of which 1,237 (44.54%) gave informed consent for this study. Of the 1,237 participants who agreed to participate in the research, 614 (49.8%) completed the course, and 569 (92.67%) were accredited by TelessadeRS-UFRGS. The majority of the participants were concerned with climate change, trained in the health area, and worked in primary health care in places that lacked ongoing sustainability programs. Two hundred forty-one action plans were submitted, major topics identified were food and nutrition, infectious diseases, and garbage and recycling. Discussion: The use of the PH lens and open perspective of the course centered the need to communicate planetary health topics to individuals. The local plans reflected the motto of think global and act local. Brazil presents a context of an unprecedented social, political, and environmental crisis, with massive deforestation, extensive fires, and biomass burning altering the biomes, on top of an ongoing necropolitical infodemic and COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of these multiple challenges, this MOOC offers a timely resource for health professionals and communities, encouraging them to address planetary challenges as fundamental health determinants.","output":"Development and Assessment of a Brazilian Pilot Massive Open Online Course in Planetary Health Education: An Innovative Model for Primary Care Professionals and Community Training"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Apart from the workplace, drawing support from family and religion is critical to maintaining the well-being of high-technology employees.

We reviewed publications from January 2020 to January 2021, given that earlier documents were not relevant, to review findings on changes in substance use and overdoses during the pandemic. Additionally, this review of the literature also documents advocacy efforts, health service modification and challenges, as well as COVID-related health complications associated with substance use. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent work focused on identifying changes in the distribution and use of substances as well as the unique challenges to promoting the health of persons who use substances in the current pandemic. Although COVID-19 has triggered unprecedented innovations in the organizational and public policy, the use of certain substances (alcohol, cannabis, cigarettes, fentanyl, heroin, and opiates) is increasing internationally. Unique associations between substance use and pandemic-related adverse health outcomes were identified. In addition, the pandemic precipitated significant barriers and disruptions to care. SUMMARY: Given increased overdose rates and infections among people who use drugs, continued surveillance and vigilance are needed to assess changes and reduce use and adverse consequences during the continuing COVID-19 crisis. Changes are urgently needed to reduce adverse health outcomes because of treatment barriers and lack of adequate treatment options. Additionally, integrative approaches are necessary to promote the public health of persons who use substances.","output":"Converging public health crises: substance use during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, university teachers are coping with and adjusting to online teaching platforms.

The SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and spike proteins, as well as the human ACE2 receptor, have previously been reported as good targets for the development of new drug leads to combat COVID-19. Various ligands, including synthetic and plant-derived small molecules, can interact with the aforementioned proteins. In this study, we investigated the interaction of eight phytochemicals, from selected medicinal plants (Aegle marmelos, Azadirachta indica, and Ocimum sanctum) commonly used in Indian traditional medicine, with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDBID: 6LU7), SARS-CoV-2S spike protein (PDB ID: 6M0J) and the human ACE2 receptor (PDB ID: 6M18). All compounds were subjected to density functional theory (DFT) and frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) analysis to determine their geometry, and key electronic and energetic properties. Upon examining the interactions of the phytochemicals with the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, spike protein targets, two compounds (C-5 and C-8) were identified as the best binding ligands. These were further examined in MD simulation studies to determine the stability of the ligand-protein interactions.

We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklist for quality appraisal and the PROGRESS Plus framework to understand equity issues. Thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: We retrieved 1153 records and finally included ten studies that met eligibility criteria. All except two studies were from high-income countries. Four key themes were identified. Firstly, life jacket use was shaped through complex interactions between lived experience and cultural norms which influenced the risk-perception of life jacket utility in preventing deaths. Secondly, the high cost of life jackets was almost always a barrier for its usage. Thirdly, adoption of laws and its subsequent enforcement was perceived to be an important facilitator for life jacket use. Lastly, design issues around comfort, fashion-sense, and shelf life influenced usage. CONCLUSION: The results of this qualitative evidence synthesis should be considered for health promotion, legal and policy interventions to promote the uptake of life jackets.

Based on reviews of 115 school-district reopening plans, this Note finds that numerous schools sought to remedy these gaps through in-person priority policies designed to return students with disabilities to physical classrooms before other students. This Note evaluates the legal and policy implications of such in-person priority policies through the lenses of critical race theory and dis/ability critical race studies (DisCrit). This Note begins by identifying the structural barriers to learning that students with disabilities faced during school closures, including disparities in internet access and accessibility, removal or reduction of related services, absence of social interaction and structure, and heightened trauma and mental health concerns. While in-person priority policies are meant to mitigate these barriers, this Note argues that they ultimately segregate classrooms and exacerbate already egregious disciplinary disparities. Consequently, these policies impose disproportionate harm on students of color with disabilities. Additionally, this Note calls on policymakers to develop individualized approaches to inperson priority, adopt nonexclusionary disciplinary policies, and expand access to compensatory education and extended school year services. Beyond the current crisis, policymakers must commit to eliminating systems of stratification that categorically filter students into segregated classroom settings.

The purpose of this study was to determine if contrast enhancement is necessary for MRI surveillance of clinical T1a (cT1a) solid renal masses. MATERIALS AND METHODS. With institutional review board approval, 36 patients who underwent two or more contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI examinations (median, four examinations; range, two to 10 examinations) for surveillance of 39 cT1a solid renal masses between 2009 and 2019 (median time between scans, 2 years; range, 1-7 years) were evaluated. Two radiologists independently measured renal mass size and assessed tumor stage in two sessions for baseline and follow-up examinations using T1-weighted nephrographic phase CE-MRI and unenhanced single-shot T2-weighted MRI in mixed order with a 4-week washout period. Comparisons were performed using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test and Pearson correlation. Bland-Altman and intraclass correlation determined interobserver agreement. RESULTS. Mean size  SD of renal masses on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were 18  5 mm (range, 9-37 mm) and 18  5 mm (range, 9-37 mm) for radiologist 1 and 19  7 mm (range, 10-39 mm) and 19  6 mm (range, 10-39 mm) for radiologist 2 with near perfect correlation (for radiologist 1, ? = 0.9897; for radiologist 2, ? = 0.9317; p < .001). Interob-server agreement for measurements comparing radiologist 1 and radiologist 2 on CEMRI and T2-weighted MRI and intraobserver agreement for measurements on CE-MRI and T2-weighted MRI were excellent.

As the number of persons hospitalized with COVID-19 increased, early reports from Austria (1), Hong Kong (2), Italy (3), and California (4) suggested sharp drops in the numbers of persons seeking emergency medical care for other reasons. To quantify the effect of COVID-19 on U.S. emergency department (ED) visits, CDC compared the volume of ED visits during four weeks early in the pandemic March 29-April 25, 2020 (weeks 14 to 17; the early pandemic period) to that during March 31-April 27, 2019 (the comparison period). During the early pandemic period, the total number of U.S. ED visits was 42% lower than during the same period a year earlier, with the largest declines in visits in persons aged 14 years, females, and the Northeast region. Health messages that reinforce the importance of immediately seeking care for symptoms of serious conditions, such as myocardial infarction, are needed. To minimize SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, transmission risk and address public concerns about visiting the ED during the pandemic, CDC recommends continued use of virtual visits and triage help lines and adherence to CDC infection control guidance.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Emergency Department Visits  United States, January 1, 2019CMay 30, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM This study aim was to investigate if prelicensure baccalaureate nursing students gained more knowledge from a live or virtual disaster simulation. The study goal was to inform the use of e-learning or traditional textbooks in undergraduate nursing population health courses. BACKGROUND Weather-related disasters have increased in frequency and severity in the past ten years, with 2020 being the most active storm season ever seen (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, 2021.) Even with advances in early warning systems and mitigation efforts, educating student nurses in disaster response remains a priority. Due to the impact of Covid-19 quarantine policies, many in-person student learning labs and clinical experiences were cancelled. However, virtual simulation offers an alternative to developing nursing student skills and clinical reasoning ability (Aebersold, 2018; Fogg et al., 2020). DESIGN A randomized quasi-experimental, repeated measures 2  2 crossover design (Kim, 2018) was applied, which allowed students to participate in both the live and virtual simulations. METHODS Analysis was conducted using paired samples t-test to evaluate knowledge gains. To measure students' self-assessment of knowledge, Unver et al. (2018) 12-item survey was administered. To explore students' own perceptions about the disaster simulations, semi-structured interview questions were offered through private Wiki postings. The responses were analyzed using Salda?a's in vivo coding (2015) and thematic analysis. RESULTS Students retained more empirical knowledge following the virtual assignment as compared to the disaster simulation, except in two items addressing triage. Neither age, years of education, or GPA impacted test results. However, students' own assessment of learning did not differ between live and virtual simulations. In all but three items, students perceived a significant increase (p < .05) in their learning following the simulation, regardless whether it was live or virtual. In narrative responses, students overwhelmingly cited the benefit of an in-person simulation. However, they did not believe that they were prepared adequately for the live simulation. They also expressed that they would be more prepared if the simulation was repeated. Students expressed discomfort, even distress, regarding not being able to care adequately for everyone, even though it was a simulation (See Table 5). This highlighted that live simulations can affect students emotionally, and follow-up debriefing is essential to help in both acknowledging and processing student feelings. CONCLUSION These findings, which support the use of virtual disaster training in nursing education, are especially important in the light of Covid-19 and increasing threat of storm disasters.","output":"Responding to a simulated disaster in the virtual or live classroom: Is there a difference in BSN student learning?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute heart failure (HF) is one of the most common cardiac emergencies.

Measuring hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs), which reflect the integrated long-term cortisol levels, may elucidate the impact of COVID-19 related stress on healthcare professionals. In the current study, we investigated experienced stress in 693 healthcare workers, with hair samples for cortisol analysis collected from a subset of 67 female nurses. The HCCs in two 3 cm hair segments corresponding to periods before and during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 were compared. To evaluate the effect of working in the first line, the sample was divided into two groups based on the COVID-19 risk estimated by the nurses. Covariates in the model included perceived stress (PSS), perceived social support (MSPSS), and quality of sleep (PSQI) measured via an online questionnaire. The data showed that more than 75% of healthcare workers agreed that COVID-19 led to increased stress at their workplace. The hair cortisol analysis showed higher HCCs in the hair segments corresponding to the time of the pandemic compared to hair corresponding to an earlier period (partial (2)(90%CI) = 0.123C0.397); in the same model, higher HCCs were also found in nurses from high-risk environments compared to low-risk ones (partial (2)(90%CI) = 0.002C0.176).

We hypothesized that NAT would initially decrease during the SHO as children did not have access to mandatory reporters, and then increase as physicians offices and schools reopened. METHODS: A multicenter study evaluating patients <18 years with ICD-10 Diagnosis and/or External Cause of Injury codes meeting criteria for NAT. Historical controls from an averaged period of March-September 2016-2019 were compared to patients injured March-September 2020, after the implementation of SHO (COVID cohort). An interrupted time series analysis was utilized to evaluate the effects of SHO implementation. RESULTS: Nine Level I pediatric trauma centers contributed 2,064 patients meeting NAT criteria. During initial SHO, NAT rates dropped below what was expected based on historical trends; however, thereafter the rate increased above the expected. The COVID cohort experienced a significant increase in the proportion of NAT patients age 5 years, minority children, and least resourced as determined by social vulnerability index (SVI).

In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance.

SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the {beta}-coronaviruses characterized by the crown-shaped spike protein that protrudes out of the virus particles, giving the virus a corona shape; hence the name coronavirus. This virus is similar to the viruses that caused SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), the other two coronavirus epidemics that were recently contained within the last ten years. The technique being proposed uses a light source from a smart phone and a mobile spectrophotometer to enable detection of viral proteins in solution or paper as well as protein-protein interactions. The proof-of-concept is shown by detecting soluble preparations of spike protein subunits from SARS-CoV-2, followed by detection of the actual binding potential of the spike protein with its host receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The results are validated by showing that this method can detect antigen-antibody binding using two independent viral protein-antibody pairs. The binding could be detected optically both in solution and on a solid support such as nitrocellulose membrane. Finally, this technique is combined with DC bias to show that introduction of a current into the system can be used to disrupt the antigen-antibody reaction, suggesting that the proposed extended technique can be a potential means of not only detecting the virus, but also reducing virus transmission by disrupting virus-receptor interactions electrically.","output":"Development of an Optical Assay to Detect SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding Interactions with ACE2 and Disruption of these Interactions Using Electric Current"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic can affect the behavior of daily habits among children and adolescents.

Moral injury is a type of psychological response that may arise when one transgresses or witnesses another transgress deeply held moral values, or when one feels that an individual or institution that has a duty to provide care has failed to do so. Despite knowledge of this widespread exposure, to date, empirical data are scarce as to how to prevent and, where necessary, treat COVID-19-related moral injury in healthcare workers. Given the relation between moral injury and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), we point here to social and interpersonal factors as critical moderators of PTSD symptomology and consider how this knowledge may translate to interventions for COVID-19-related moral injury. Specifically, we first review alterations in social cognitive functioning observed among individuals with PTSD that may give rise to interpersonal difficulties. Drawing on Nietlisbach and Maercker's 2009 work on interpersonal factors relevant to survivors of trauma with PTSD, we then review the role of perceived social support, social acknowledgment and social exclusion in relation to potential areas of targeted intervention for COVID-19-related moral injury in healthcare workers. Finally, building on existing literature (e.g., Phoenix AustraliaCentre for Posttraumatic Mental Health and the Canadian Centre of ExcellencePTSD, 2020) we conclude with individual and organizational considerations to bolster against the development of moral injury in healthcare workers during the pandemic.","output":"Healthcare Workers and COVID-19-Related Moral Injury: An Interpersonally-Focused Approach Informed by PTSD"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A complete genome sequence was obtained for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain isolated from an oropharyngeal swab specimen of a Nepalese patient with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), who had returned to Nepal after traveling to Wuhan, China.","output":"Complete genome sequence of a 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) strain isolated in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pandemics and the large-scale outbreak of infectious disease can significantly impact morbidity and mortality worldwide. The impact on intensive care resources can be significant and often require modification of service delivery, a key element which includes rapid expansion of the critical care workforce. Pandemics are also unpredictable, which necessitates rapid decision-making and action which, in the lack of experience and guidance, may be extremely challenging. Recognising the potential strain on intensive care units (ICUs), particularly on staffing, a working group was formed for the purpose of developing recommendations to support decision-making during rapid service expansion. METHODS: The Critical Care Pandemic Staffing Working Party (n = 21), representing nursing, allied health, and medical disciplines, has used a modified consensus approach to provide recommendations to inform multidisciplinary workforce capacity expansion planning in critical care. RESULTS: A total of 60 recommendations have been proposed which reflect general recommendations as well as those specific to maintaining the critical care workforce, expanding the critical care workforce, rostering and allocation of the critical care workforce, nurse-specific recommendations for staffing the ICU, education support and training during ICU surge situations, workforce support, models of care, and de-escalation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a nationwide retrospective analysis using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database from April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2016. We identified patients who received CVC within 30 days from hospital admission. We compared the 30-day mortality between two groups: patients who received CVC within two days (early) after admission and those who received CVC three or more days (delayed) after admission, using marginal structural models with inverse probability treatment weighting. RESULTS: We identified 6,028 eligible patients from 911 hospitals among 27,497 patients with severe sepsis for this study; 4,544 (75.4%) received early CVC. Patients with early CVC had poor prognostic baselines and received more intense treatment than patients with delayed CVC.

The rapid pace at which this type of translational research can occur brings a variety of potential pitfalls and ethical concerns. Regulation surrounding implantable medical devices is struggling to keep up. 3D printing has opened the way for personalization which can make clinical outcomes hard to assess and risks putting the individual before the community.

The clinical presentation of this pathology includes fever, dry cough, fatigue and acute respiratory distress syndrome that can lead to death infected patients. Current studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continue to highlight the urgent need for an effective therapy. Numerous therapeutic strategies have been used until now but, to date, there is no specific effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated inflammatory cytokines have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Evidence suggests that elevated cytokine levels, reflecting a hyperinflammatory response secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, are responsible for multi-organ damage in patients with COVID-19. For these reason, numerous randomized clinical trials are currently underway to explore the effectiveness of biopharmaceutical drugs, such as, interleukin-1 blockers, interleukin-6 inhibitors, Janus kinase inhibitors, in COVID-19. The aim of the present paper is to briefly summarize the pathogenetic rationale and the state of the art of therapeutic strategy blocking hyperinflammation.","output":"Role of monoclonal antibody drugs in the treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since 2010, porcine epidemic diarrhea has re-emerged with devastating impact on the swine-raising industry in central China. To investigate the epidemic characteristics of PEDV, the complete ORF3 genes of 14 PEDV field strains from central China during 2012 to 2013 were cloned, sequenced and compared with reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete ORF3 gene showed that the PEDVs in central China and the reference strains could be divided into three groups: G1, G2, and G3. The 14 PEDV isolates were classified as G1 and showed a close relationship to some Chinese strains isolated previously in central China and differed genetically from recent isolates from southern China, Korean strains (SM98 and DB1865, 2012), the Chinese LZC strain (2007), and the vaccine strain (CV777) being used in China. Our findings suggested that the PEDVs circulating between 2012 and 2013 in central China might have evolved from earlier strains in the local region. To determine the reason for recent vaccination failures, we also studied variations in antigenicity of field strains by analyzing the three neutralizing epitope regions in the S gene. The results showed that the neutralizing epitopes at aa 245-252 were highly conserved, but most of the amino acid changes occurred in the epitope regions aa 7-146 and 271-278. We speculate that the amino acid mutations in the neutralizing epitope regions may be associated with changes in the antigenicity of PEDV and consequently result in vaccination failure. Together, these findings may be useful for understanding the epidemiology of PEDV and may be relevant for designing of new and more efficacious vaccines.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) field strains in central China based on the ORF3 gene and the main neutralization epitopes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elucidating the dynamics of the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescents is crucial in controlling the pandemic and informing vaccination strategies.

Forty-eight samples were also tested for neutralizing activities against the circulating variants using pseudotyped neutralization assay. Results showed that anti-RBD IgG and MN titres peaked at ~120 d.a.o. and subsequently declined, with significantly reduced nAb responses found in 91.67% of COVID-19 convalescents (50% decrease in current MN titres compared with the paired peak MN titres).

Although loneliness has been revealed to play an important role in psychological health and well-being, little is known about moderating and mitigating mechanisms underlying this association, especially during adverse experiences (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic). The current study purposed to explore whether subjective vitality mediated the association of loneliness with psychological adjustment and whether college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on students' adjustment in the context of loneliness. The study sample comprised 333 undergraduate students (69% female) from a public university in Turkey. They ranged in age between 19 and 41 years (M= 21.94, SD= 4.15). Findings from mediation analysis revealed that loneliness had a significant predictive effect on subjective vitality and psychological adjustment challenges. Subjective vitality also mediated the effect of loneliness on the psychological adjustment of college students. Further, college belongingness moderated the mediating effect of subjective vitality on adjustment and had a protective effect on the association between loneliness and subjective vitality in college students. These results indicate that subjective vitality and college belongingness are important mechanisms that may help develop prevention and intervention strategies to foster students' psychological health and well-being in university settings. ? 2021 Institute of Image Electronics Engineers of Japan.

Nanomaterial-based vaccines have shown the ability to generate antibody and cellular immune responses of increased breadth and neutralization potency. Thus, we have developed supramolecular nanofiber-based immunogens bearing the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein. These immunogens generated antibody responses that had increased magnitude and binding breadth compared to soluble gp120. By varying gp120 density on nanofibers, we determined that increased antigen valency was associated with increased antibody magnitude and germinal center responses.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative care has received unprecedented levels of societal attention. Unfortunately, this has not been enough to prevent patients dying alone, relatives not being able to say goodbye and palliative care being used instead of intensive care due to resource limitations. Yet global guidance was available. In 2018, the WHO released a guide on 'Integrating palliative care and symptom relief into the response to humanitarian emergencies and crises'-the first guidance on the topic by an international body. AIMS: This paper argues that while a landmark document, the WHO guide took a narrowly clinical bioethics perspective and missed crucial moral dilemmas. We argue for adding a population-level bioethics lens, which draws forth complex moral dilemmas arising from the fact that groups having differential innate and acquired resources in the context of social and historical determinants of health. We discuss dilemmas concerning: limitations of material and human resources; patient prioritisation; euthanasia; and legacy inequalities, discrimination and power imbalances. IMPLICATIONS: In parts of the world where opportunity for preparation still exists, and as countries emerge from COVID-19, planners must consider care for the dying. Immediate steps to support better resolutions to ethical dilemmas of the provision of palliative care in humanitarian and emergency contexts will require honest debate; concerted research effort; and international, national and local ethical guidance.","output":"Dying individuals and suffering populations: applying a population-level bioethics lens to palliative care in humanitarian contexts: before, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper responds to Joo et al.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For this study, we selected San Francisco, one of the regions affected by the wildfires allied pollution in California, USA. The data on the COVID-19 pandemic in San Francisco, including daily new cases and new deaths were recorded from Worldometer Web. The daily environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM-2.5 m) and carbon monoxide (CO) were recorded from the metrological web \\"BAAQMD\\". The daily cases, deaths, particulate matter (PM-2.5 m) and carbon monoxide were documented from the date of the occurrence of the first case of (SARS-CoV-2) in San Francisco, CA, USA, from March 20, 2020 to Sept 16, 2020. RESULTS: The results revealed a significant positive correlation between the environmental pollutants particulate matter (PM2.5 m) and the number of daily cases (r=0.203, p=0.007), cumulative cases (r=0.567, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.562, p<0.001); whereas the PM2.5 m and daily deaths had no relationship (r=-0.015, p=0.842). In addition, CO was also positively correlated with cumulative cases (r=0.423, p<0.001) and cumulative deaths (r=0.315, p<0.001), however, CO had no correlation with the number of daily cases (r=0.134, p=0.075) and daily deaths (r=0.030, p=0.693). In San Francisco, one micrometer (g/m3) increase in PM2.5 caused an increase in the daily cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths of SARS-COV-2 by 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.6%, respectively. Moreover, with a 1 part per million (ppm) increase in carbon monoxide level, the daily number of cases, cumulative cases and cumulative deaths increased by 5%, 9.3% and 5.3%, respectively.

METHODS: In this multi-center, case-control study, a total of 220 male and female adults presenting with none to mild symptoms were screened for COVID-19 (n = 138 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive and 82 negative controls). Medical history was noted. Anthropometrics were measured and non-fasting blood samples were collected for the assessment of glucose, lipids, inflammatory markers and serum 25(OH)D concentrations. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group compared to the negative group after adjustment for age and BMI (52.8 nmol/l  11.0 versus 64.5 nmol/l  11.1; p = 0.009).

We present an overview of these approaches in fixed and live cells and their input in understanding the key steps of mRNA journey: transport across the nucleoplasm, export through the nuclear pores and delivery to its final cytoplasmic location. This review puts a particular emphasis on the coupling of mRNA transport with translation, such as localization-dependent translational regulation and translation-dependent mRNA localization. We also highlight the recently discovered translation factories, and how cellular and viral RNAs can hijack membrane transport systems to travel in the cytoplasm.","output":"RNA transport from transcription to localized translation: a single molecule perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The healthcare sector is rapidly being transformed to one that operates in new computing environments. With researchers increasingly committed to finding and expanding healthcare solutions to include the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, there is a need to monitor more closely than ever the data being collected, shared, processed, and stored. The advent of cloud, IoT, and edge computing paradigms poses huge risks towards the privacy of data, especially, in the healthcare environment. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research focused on seeking efficient and effective solutions that ensure data privacy in the healthcare domain. The data being collected and processed by healthcare applications is sensitive, and its manipulation by malicious actors can have catastrophic repercussions. This paper discusses the current landscape of privacy-preservation solutions in IoT and edge healthcare applications. It describes the common techniques adopted by researchers to integrate privacy in their healthcare solutions. Furthermore, the paper discusses the limitations of these solutions in terms of their technical complexity, effectiveness, and sustainability.

The most general description of the practice is that it combines guided mental imagery with a specific yoga posture called Shavasana (or corpse pose). The goal of yoga nidra is to promote a profound state of relaxation, which differs from sleep inasmuch as there is still an awareness of ones surroundings. While several components of the practice have been known since ancient times, it was not until the 1960s that an updated and systematized system of practice was introduced to the public through the writings of Swami Satyananda Saraswati. Unlike other schools of yoga, which emphasize concentration or contemplation, yoga nidras goal is complete relaxation. As such, its advocates claim that it is suitable for all individuals, from beginners to advanced practitioners of yoga. The calm inner stillness induced by yoga nidra is claimed by practitioners to be an effective stress management tool as well as a means for attaining greater receptivity to personal resolutions. These resolutions can range from the goal of achieving self-transformation, enhancing creativity, or improving ones learning ability. Additionally, yoga nidra is claimed to promote beneficial changes in physiological and mental health. The following narrative review summarizes the basic steps used to achieve the final state of yoga nidra relaxation as well as some recent experimental findings regarding its physiological and psychological effects. Standard research databases were searched for relevant articles. Clinical studies have shown that yoga nidra meditation is associated with positive physiological changes, including improvements in several hematological variables, red blood cell counts, blood glucose levels, and hormonal status. Two neuroimaging studies have shown that yoga nidra produces changes in endogenous dopamine release and cerebral blood flow, a further confirmation that its effects on the CNS are objectively measurable. The practice has also been shown to reduce psychometrically measured indices of mild depression and anxiety, although these benefits were not shown in an experimental study to extend to severe depression or severe anxiety.","output":"The Origin and Clinical Relevance of Yoga Nidra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: It is estimated that the COVID-19 pandemic will drastically increase all forms of malnutrition. Of particular concern, yet understated, is the potential to increase the double burden of malnutrition (DBM) epidemic. This coexistence of undernutrition together with overweight and obesity, or diet-related non-communicable disease (NCD), within low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) is increasing rapidly. Although multiple factors contribute to the DBM, food insecurity (FI) and gut microbiota dysbiosis play a crucial role. Both under- and overnutrition have been shown to be a consequence of food insecurity. The gut microbiota has also been recently implicated in playing a role in under- and overnutrition, with altered community structure and function common to both. The pandemic has already caused significant shifts in food availability which has immediate effects on the gut microbiome. In this opinion paper, we discuss how COVID-19 may indirectly exacerbate the DBM through food insecurity and the gut microbiome. MAIN TEXT: The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that 265 million people in LMICs will experience acute hunger in 2020 due to the pandemic, nearly doubling the original projection of 135 million. Global border closures to food trade, loss of food production, and stark decline in household income will exacerbate starvation while simultaneously necessitating that families resort to calorie-dense, nutrient-poor foods, thereby increasing obesity. While food insecurity, which is the persistent lack of consistent access to adequate and nutrient-rich foods, will primarily drive nutrition behavior, the gut microbiome is perhaps a key biological mechanism. Numerous human and animal studies describe low diversity and an increase in inflammatory species as characteristic features of the undernourished and overnourished gut microbiota. Indeed, fecal transplant studies show that microbiota transfer from undernourished and overnourished humans to germ-free mice lacking a microbiome transfers the physical and metabolic phenotype, suggesting a causal role for the microbiota in under- and overnutrition. The observed microbiome dysbiosis within severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coupled with the DBM presents a viscous cycle. CONCLUSION: Low- to mid-income countries will likely see an increase in the DBM epidemic. Providing access to nutritious foods and protecting individuals gut microbiome to flatten the curve of the DBM trajectory should be prioritized.","output":"When a pandemic and an epidemic collide: COVID-19, gut microbiota, and the double burden of malnutrition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES Based on its well-documented anti-inflammatory and restorative properties we propose trials with the natural hormone oxytocin for treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients. METHODS We searched for, retrieved, and commented on specific literature regarding multiple functions of oxytocin with a special focus on its modulation of inflammatory, immune, and restorative functions. RESULTS Available data gathered in animals and humans support the anti-inflammatory properties of oxytocin. The multiple anti-inflammatory effects of oxytocin have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in various animal models and also in humans in response to intravenous infusion of oxytocin. Furthermore, oxytocin has been documented to activate several types of protective and restorative mechanisms and to exert positive effects on the immune system. CONCLUSIONS In addition, to being anti-inflammatory, it may be hypothesised, that oxytocin may be less suppressive on adaptive immune systems, as compared with glucocorticoids. Finally, by its restorative effects coupled with its anti-stress and healing properties, oxytocin may shorten the recovery period of the Covid-19 patients.","output":"Can intravenous oxytocin infusion counteract hyperinflammation in COVID-19 infected patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The potential impact of COVID-19 restrictions on worker well-being is currently unknown.

This study examines the awareness of Mainland China vs. Malaysian employees, and evaluates the relationship among self-efficacy, job security, market orientation, knowledge sharing intention, and knowledge sharing behavior from the theory of planned behavior. In this study, a total of 627 Mainland China and 434 Malaysian participants were collected to compare both groups in the development of employees knowledge sharing behavior. In this study, a variance-based partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to test the proposed hypothesis and conduct comparative analysis. The results in both the samples show that self-efficacy, job security, and market orientation have positive and significant effects on knowledge sharing intention; self-efficacy has positive and significant effects on job security; knowledge sharing intention has positive and significant effects on knowledge sharing behavior.

There is an opportunity to learn from the experience of previous re-openings to better plan the future one. Our objectives are to systematically review the evidence on (1) the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission; and (2) the effects of strategies for preventing COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. METHODS: We conducted a rapid systematic review. We searched in the LOVE (Living OVerview of Evidence) platform for COVID-19. The searches covered the period from the inception date of each database until April 19, 2021. We included non-randomized studies for the review on association of COVID-19 transmission and swimming-related activities. We included guidance documents reporting on the strategies for prevention of COVID-19 transmission during swimming-related activities. We also included studies on the efficacy and safety of the strategies. Teams of two reviewers independently assessed article eligibility. For the guidance documents, a single reviewer assessed the eligibility and a second reviewer verified the judgement. Teams of two reviewers extracted data independently. We summarized the findings of included studies narratively. We synthesized information from guidance documents according to the identified topics and subtopics, and presented them in tabular and narrative formats. RESULTS: We identified three studies providing very low certainty evidence for the association between engaging in swimming-related activities and COVID-19 transmission. The analysis of 50 eligible guidance documents identified 11 topics: ensuring social distancing, ensuring personal hygiene, using personal protective equipment, eating and drinking, maintaining the pool, managing frequently touched surfaces, ventilation of indoor spaces, screening and management of sickness, delivering first aid, raising awareness, and vaccination. One study assessing the efficacy of strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission did not find an association between compliance with precautionary restrictions and COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: There are major gaps in the research evidence of relevance to swimming-related activities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the synthesis of the identified strategies from guidance documents can inform public health management strategies for swimming-related activities, particularly in future re-opening plans.

However, it suggested, local solutions should be sought in order to protect the delivery of cancer services. We aimed to compare surgeons practice for the provision of colorectal (CR) cancer surgery across the United Kingdom (UK), against updated Joint Royal Colleges & ACPGBI guidelines and highlight differences in practice, if any. METHOD: An online survey was conducted. It examined surgical practice across the UK against current protocols for CR cancer surgeries, during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 29 individual responses were received from 23 NHS Trusts across the UK. 23/29 (79%) surgeons ceased or experienced delays in their CR cancer surgeries during the pandemic, with 3/29 (10%) yet to reintroduce these services. 19/26 (73%) surgeons instructed their patients to self-isolate prior to surgery, of which 5/19 (26%) correctly enforced a duration of 14 days. 10/19 (53%) participants adhered to guidelines of performing a CT chest within 24 h of surgery. 10/26 (38%) participants believe their patients are experiencing longer hospital admissions in the COVID-19 setting. CONCLUSION: This snap shot survey highlights the dramatic variations in CR cancer surgery practice within the UK and inconsistent adherence to protocols. Guidelines will no doubt change as our knowledge of COVID-19 increases both nationally and internationally. It is essential CR surgeons keep up to date with changes in guidance, so uniformity in practice can be maintained.","output":"Variations in colorectal cancer surgery practice across the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic C Every land has its own law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The cheetah population in Namibia is the largest free-ranging population in the world and a key population for research regarding the health status of this species. We used serological methods and quantitative real-time PCR to test free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs for the presence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be highly aggressive in populations with low genetic diversity, such as cheetahs. We also assessed the presence of antibodies to other gammaretroviruses and the responses to a FeLV vaccine developed for domestic cats. Up to 19% of the free-ranging cheetahs, 27% of the captive nonvaccinated cheetahs, and 86% of the captive vaccinated cheetahs tested positive for FeLV antibodies. FeLV-antibody-positive free-ranging cheetahs also tested positive for Rauscher murine leukemia virus antibodies. Nevertheless, FeLV was not detectable by quantitative real-time PCR and no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay in the plasma of cheetahs or the supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of antibodies to gammaretroviruses in clinically healthy specimens may be caused either by infection with a low-pathogenic retrovirus or by the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences. The strong humoral immune responses to FeLV vaccination demonstrate that cheetahs can respond to the vaccine and that vaccination against FeLV infection may be beneficial should FeLV infection ever become a threat, as was seen in Iberian lynx and Florida panthers.","output":"Gammaretrovirus-specific antibodies in free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Arginine (Arg) and methionine (Met) can elicit antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects in animals. Unlike Met, however, it is unknown if the supply of Arg can impact key aspects of adipose tissue (AT) function in dairy cows. Since Met and Arg metabolism are linked through the synthesis of polyamines, it is also possible that they have a complementary effect on aspects of AT function during a stress challenge. In this experiment, subcutaneous AT (SAT) was harvested from 4 lactating multiparous Holstein cows (~27.0 kg milk per day, body condition score 3.38  0.23) and used for incubations (4 h) with the following: control medium with an \\"ideal\\" profile of essential AA (IPAA) (CTR; Lys:Met 2.9:1), IPAA plus 100 M H2O2 (HP), H2O2 plus greater Arg supply (HPARG; Lys:Arg 1:1), or H2O2 plus greater Arg and methionine (Met) supply (HPARGMET; Lys: Met 2.5:1 and Lys: Arg 1:1). Western blotting was used to measure abundance of 18 protein targets associated with insulin and AA signaling, nutrient transport, inflammation, and antioxidant response. RT-PCR was used to assess effects on genes associated with Arg metabolism. Among the protein targets measured, although abundance of phosphorylated (p) AKT serine/threonine kinase (p-AKT) (P = 0.05) and p-mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-MTOR) (P = 0.04) were lowest in HP explants, this effect was attenuated in HPARG and especially HPARGMET compared with CTR. Compared with HP, incubation with HPARG led to upregulation of the AA transporter solute carrier family 1 member 3 (SLC1A3; L-glutamate transporter) (P= 0.03), the reactive oxygen species detoxification-related enzyme glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) (P = 0.03), and fatty acid synthase (FASN) (P = 0.05). Those effects were accompanied by greater abundance of solute carrier family 2 member 4 (SLC2A4; insulin-induced glucose transporter) in explants incubated with HPARG and also HPARGMET (P = 0.04). In addition, compared with other treatments, the peak response in abundance of the intracellular energy sensor 5'-prime-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was detected with HPARGMET (P = 0.003). There was no effect of Arg or Arg plus Met on the mRNA abundance of genes associated with Arg metabolism (ARG1, NOS2, AMD1, SMS, SRM). Overall, supplementation of Arg alone or with Met partially alleviated the negative effects induced by H2O2.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to describe COVID-19 patients undergoing inpatient rehabilitation and their rehabilitation outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective observational cohort study of all inpatients from a rehabilitation hospital between March 1 and September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria are: &#8805;18 years of age and admission and discharge within the study time frame. The initial search yielded 920 patients; 896 met the inclusion criteria. Data was derived from the eRehabData database. Subjects were stratified by COVID-19 status and rehabilitation impairment. Data included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), length of stay (LOS), discharge location, and functional ability measures for self-care and mobility (FA-SC, FA-Mob). Descriptive statistics included age, BMI, gender, LOS, and discharge location. One-sample t-tests were used to assess the difference of age, BMI, LOS, FA-SC, FA-Mob, and FA efficiency between COVID-19+ and COVID-19- patients. RESULTS: COVID-19+ patients were younger (594 years vs 629 years; t(894)= -205, p=004) with a higher mean BMI (32 vs 28; t(894)= 351, p<001) than COVID-19- patients.

Clinical suspicion is the key to diagnosis. A detailed social history is superior to serum and radiological investigation to prevent mortality. CASE PRESENTATION: A 41-year-old man presented to the hospital with diffuse muscle pain and chills for 3-weeks. He worked as a waste-water worker in New York City. On arrival, he had a temperature of 100.8 F, heart rate 94/min, blood pressure 102/67 mmHg, respiratory rate 21/min. Initial blood tests showed platelet count of 90,000 k/ul, serum creatinine 3.7 mg/dl, BUN 67 mg/dl, ALT 78 u/l, AST 101 u/l and total bilirubin of 6.9 mg/dl. Chest X-ray showed mild diffuse interstitial infiltrates. He was admitted to the medical floor for management of presumed bacterial pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime was initiated. One week into inpatient stay, his clinical condition deteriorated with worsening hypoxemia along with worsening renal and liver function tests. Blood cultures, sputum cultures, and COVID-19 PCR tests were negative. CT Chest was performed which showed extensive ground-glass opacities with interstitial thickening in both lungs. He had worsening hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation and septic shock requiring vasopressors. Bronchoscopy was performed that showed diffuse endobronchial and alveolar hemorrhage. Based on his social history, empiric treatment with doxycycline was begun and serology for leptospirosis was ordered which resulted in positive. After 9-days of mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy, he recovered and was discharged home. DISCUSSION: Leptospirosis disease is caused by Leptospira interrogans which is transmitted from the urine of wild animals and it can cause multi-organ involvement by initiating a cytokine storm.(1) Severe pulmonary hemorrhage syndrome (SPHS) can present as cough, massive hemoptysis, and is associated with circulatory collapse.(2) Chest radiography can show a wide variety of nodular infiltrates, ground glass opacifications, or multifocal consolidations which make the diagnosis difficult.(3) In non-endemic areas, clinical suspicion and social history play a pivotal role in the diagnosis. Suspected cases should be confirmed with serology (microscopic agglutination test). Mild disease is treated with tetracycline, while IV penicillin or ceftriaxone are preferred for severe disease, however beneficial effects are limited once organ dysfunction is progressed.(1) CONCLUSIONS: Due to the severity of Leptospirosis, the diagnosis should be made based on social history and a disproportionate rise of bilirubin. The mortality rate is significantly high in cases of pulmonary hemorrhage. Early treatment with antimicrobials is needed while serology testing is being performed. REFERENCE #1: Haake DA, Levett PN.

RECENT FINDINGS Analytical methods to refine cytogenetic and molecular assessment of MDS have been proposed, improving prognostic stratification obtained from integration of clinical and genomic data. Novel agents with very different mode of action, as single drugs or added to HMA backbone, show promising clinical results in LR-MDS and HR-MDS. Luspatercept has obtained approval given the fact that in transfusion-dependent erythropoietic-stimulating agent resistant/relapsed LR-MDS induced nearly 50% of transfusion independence. Another investigational agent showing efficacy and possibly disease modifying activity in the same setting is the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat. Results from phase II study with azacytidine and pevonedistat indicate the concrete possibility to enhance durable responses compared with azacitidine single drug. In the same direction are the preliminary results of other agents with different mode of action: magrolimab, venetoclax, sabatolimab, as well as the targeted therapy with enasidenib and ivosidenib.

The open science study was co-designed by an international consortium of researchers to investigate how psychological responses differ across countries and cultures, and how this has impacted behaviour, coping and trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Starting in March 2020, COVIDiSTRESS leveraged the convenience of unpaid online recruitment to generate public data. The objective of the present analysis is to understand relationships between psychological responses in the early months of global coronavirus restrictions and help understand how different government measures succeed or fail in changing public behaviour. There were variations between and within countries. Although Western Europeans registered as more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed, and having slightly more trust in the governments' efforts, there was no clear geographical pattern in compliance with behavioural measures. Detailed plots illustrating between-countries differences are provided. Using both traditional and Bayesian analyses, we found that individuals who worried about getting sick worked harder to protect themselves and others. However, concern about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variances in experienced stress during the early months of COVID-19 restrictions. More alarmingly, such stress was associated with less compliance. Further, those most concerned over the coronavirus trusted in government measures primarily where policies were strict. While concern over a disease is a source of mental distress, other factors including strictness of protective measures, social support and personal lockdown conditions must also be taken into consideration to fully appreciate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to understand why some people fail to follow behavioural guidelines intended to protect themselves and others from infection.

In many diseasessuch as metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and also canceractivation of AMPK is beneficial. Therefore, there is growing interest in AMPK activators that act either by direct action on the enzyme itself or by indirect activation of upstream regulators. Many natural compounds have been described that activate AMPK indirectly. These compounds are usually contained in mixtures with a variety of structurally different other compounds, which in turn can also alter the activity of AMPK via one or more pathways. For these compounds, experiments are complicated, since the required pure substances are often not yet isolated and/or therefore not sufficiently available. Therefore, our goal was to develop a screening tool that could handle the profound heterogeneity in activation pathways of the AMPK. Since machine learning algorithms can model complex (unknown) relationships and patterns, some of these methods (random forest, support vector machines, stochastic gradient boosting, logistic regression, and deep neural network) were applied and validated using a database, comprising of 904 activating and 799 neutral or inhibiting compounds identified by extensive PubMed literature search and PubChem Bioassay database. All models showed unexpectedly high classification accuracy in training, but more importantly in predicting the unseen test data.

Manometry tracings were retrieved and re-reported according the Chicago classification. Outcome was assessed by a postal questionnaire, and designated a success if the modified Eckardt score was 3 or less, and the patient had not undergone subsequent surgery or pneumatic dilatation. Difference in outcome after cardiomyotomy was analysed with a mixed-effects logistic regression model. RESULTS Sixty, 111 and 24 patients had type I, II and II achalasia respectively. Patients with type III achalasia were more likely to be older than those with type I or II (mean age 63 versus 50 and 49 years respectively; P = 0001). Some 176 of 195 patients returned questionnaires after surgery. Type III achalasia was less likely to have a successful outcome than type II (odds ratio (OR) 038, 95 per cent c.i. 015 to 094; P = 0035). There was no significant difference in outcome between types I and II achalasia (II versus I: OR 087, 047 to 160; P 0663). The success rate at 3-year follow-up was 69 per cent (22 of 32) for type I, 66 per cent (33 of 50) for type II and 31 per cent (4 of 13) for type III. CONCLUSION Type III achalasia is a predictor of poor outcome after cardiomyotomy.

Therefore, we conducted a web\\\\based interview of hospital employees to assess depression prevalence and factors. METHODS: This observational cohort study was conducted from July to August, 2020, as part of a mandatory health checkup of Juntendo University Hospital employees (Tokyo, Japan). A total of 4239 participants completed a web\\\\based questionnaire on medical history and current health status. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES\\\\D) was used for self\\\\assessment, with a score of 16 considered to indicate depression. RESULTS: Among all employees, the proportion of depression was 31.3% in 2020, the highest measured in the last 10 years and substantially greater than the pre\\\\pandemic value in 2019 (27.5%). The proportion of depression for 2020 was significantly higher in new recruits than in employees with more than 2 years of experience (47.0% vs 29.9%, respectively, P < .0001) and in new recruits in 2019 (26.4%, P < .0001). When subdivided by occupation, nurses demonstrated the highest depression rate (43.2%), followed by paramedics (35.1%) and clerks (31.6%), whereas residents (22.9%), doctors (20.4%), teaching staff (18.0%), and part\\\\time staff (15.3%) reported lower depression rates. The positive CES\\\\D score significantly correlated with age (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Younger and newer employees demonstrated the highest rates of depression independent of occupation. Therefore, mental healthcare programs focusing on these vulnerable groups need to be established.","output":"Elevated depressive symptoms among newer and younger healthcare workers in Japan during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS: To investigate the association of nutritional risk at admission with the length of hospital stay (LOS) and mortality in older patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective monocentric study in an acute geriatric hospital.

Obesity induces cognitive and behavioral impairment. Low plasma vitamin D levels are associated with increased body mass index (BMI). Therefore, vitamin D supplementation has shown benefits in BMI, glucose homeostasis and cognitive/behavioral function;however, contradictory data exists in animal models and remains poorly studied. Obesity in males increases 5.7-fold the risk for severe complications and death due to SARSCoV-2. Brain RAS activity, especially activation of the Angiotensin II receptor (AT1R), has been implicated in cognitive impairment and may participate in persistent neurological symptoms seen in 1 in 3 severe COVID-19 cases, i.e., disorientation, inattention and ataxia. Supplementation with Vitamin D (VitD), known to ameliorate respiratory infections and thromboembolism, may protect against COVID symptoms by increasing ACE2 and Masr expression. To generate a diet-induced obesity (DIO) model, C57Bl6/J male mice (7 wks of age) were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n=10/group) and were fed ad libitum with a) chow diet (CD), b) lard-based high-fat diet (HFD, 60% fat;D12492;Research diet, New Brunswick, NJ), or c) HFD supplemented with vitamin D (60% fat plus 15,000 IU/kg diet, HVitD). Behavioral and metabolic endpoints were measured starting at 7 wks on diet. The HFD diet was effective in generating DIO vs CD despite equivalent food intake consumption on a kcal-basis. Body composition analysis (EchoMRI) showed increased fat mass in HFD and HVitD when compared to CD. Contrary to our hypothesis, ip glucose (0.25 mg/kg) caused greater glucose intolerance in HVitD relative to HFD at 15 (P&lt;0.05) and 30 min (P&lt;0.01) post injection. HFD and HVitD groups showed insulin resistance relative to CD while having an equal glucose clearance post insulin bolus (3.75 U/kg;ip). Cognitive ability was assessed using novel object recognition (NORT), passive avoidance (PAT) and transfer latency (TL) on the elevated plus maze (EPM) tests. There was no effect of DIO on NORT. Surprisingly, in the PAT, VitD supplementation reduced conditioned anxiety as seen by a decreased step-through latency to aversive chamber (3 d retention), suggesting poorer fear-based learning relative to HFD (P&lt;0.01). No effect was seen on TL. Increased anxiety was observed on EPM in HFD (P&lt;0.04), as indicated by decreased time in the open arm relative to that in CD. Reduced locomotor activity was observed on the open field test (OF) in HFD and HVitD groups in the last 4 min of a 10 min test duration. Molecular analysis of RAS genes in the brain using RNAscope is currently underway. In conclusion, Vitamin D supplementation (15,000 IU/kg diet) was not effective in protecting against DIO and glucose intolerance.

Seasonal influenza vaccines can reduce influenza-associated morbidity in healthcare settings, but despite mandatory influenza vaccination in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the vaccination uptake rate among HCPs is below expectations. This study investigated vaccination trends from 2017 to 2020 to identify factors affecting vaccination among HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic flu and subsequent seasons. METHODS: Cross-sectional study among HCPs was conducted in January 2021. A structured questionnaire was shared via social media. Vaccine uptake predictors were identified using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models (p-value 0.05). RESULTS: A total of 424 HCPs (118 physicians and 306 nurses) completed the questionnaire. Vaccine uptake increased from 2017 to 2019 (45% to 52% to 62%) but fell (to 59%) during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic flu season. Multivariable analysis indicated participants >40 years old (AOR 3.09, 95% CI 1.64C5.83), female (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.13C2.67), non-Saudi (AOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.72C4.01), nurses (AOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.75C4.17), and who possessed accurate knowledge of the flu vaccine efficacy duration (AOR 3.04, 95% CI 1.87C4.94) were more likely to have received the vaccine. However, 79% of HCPs declared their intention to be vaccinated in the 2021 flu season, with participants >40 years old, female (AOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.38C3.68), non-Saudi (AOR 3.79, 95% CI 2.34C6.16), or nurses (AOR 2.94, 95% CI 1.82C4.76) more likely to do so. CONCLUSION: Influenza vaccination uptake declined among HCPs during the 2020 flu season compared with the previous season but is expected to increase in the upcoming 2021 season. Nevertheless, the findings are encouraging and indicate increased willingness of HCPs to become vaccinated in the upcoming 2021 season, but coverage could be further increased by policymakers via a comprehensive plan focusing particularly on younger HCPs, Saudis, males, and physicians.","output":"Trends, Uptake, and Predictors of Influenza Vaccination Among Healthcare Practitioners During the COVID-19 Pandemic Flu Season (2020) and the Following Season (2021) in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SESSION TITLE: Medical Students/Residents' COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Med Student/Res Case Report PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: An outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus started in China in 2019 The disease was termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) The clinical course involved respiratory symptoms including dyspnea, cough, fatigue and complications related to pneumonia (1) While predominantly involving the respiratory tract, it has been shown to effect multiple other organs including the cardiovascular system (2) We present a case of COVID-19 associated focal myocarditis mimicking acute coronary syndrome CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old man with presented to the emergency department with chest pain and dyspnea for one week He also had for fatigue, non-productive cough and myalgia He was hypoxic on presentation, requiring 3L of oxygen via nasal cannula Physical exam was unremarkable Chest x-ray was suggestive of increased interstitial prominence A 12-lead-ECG was notable for normal sinus rhythm with ST elevations in the antero-lateral distribution (Figure 1) Initial Troponin I level was elevated at 8 6 ng/mL His C-reative protein (CRP) was elevated at 160 mg/L and CBC showed mild absolute lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0 6 bil/L) Rapid COVID-19 testing was obtained and the patient was treated appropriately for acute coronary syndrome with aspirin, unfractionated heparin and nitroglycerin infusion He was taken to the catheterization lab for emergent coronary angiography which revealed no significant coronary disease (Figure 2) COVID-19 PCR returned positive and he was given supportive treatment in addition to azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine as part of COVID-19 regimen He had marked improvement in symptoms over the next few days DISCUSSION: Cardiac injury has been shown to occur in 8-12% of the patients affected by COVID-19 (3) and is associated with worse prognosis (1) The proposed mechanisms of injury include direct myocardial injury by the virus, systemic inflammation, demand ischemia and coronary thrombosis Myocarditis associated with COVID-19 has been limited to few case reports Our case highlights an atypical presentation of COVID-19 associated myocarditis The focal ST segment elevations noted on the ECG along with clinical symptoms were suggestive of a concomitant acute coronary syndrome despite other clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 ECG only has about 47% sensitivity for myocarditis and is characterized usually by non-specific ST-T changes Echocardiographic findings are variable and non-specific Segmental wall motion abnormalities mimicking myocardial infarction can be observed as seen in our patient Although the gold standard for diagnosis is myocardial biopsy, cardiac MR is being increasingly utilized as a non-invasive test Due to high clinical suspicion and rapid improvement in symptoms, these tests were not pursued and a clinical diagnosis was made CONCLUSIONS: We report an atypical presentation of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 Reference #1: Huang C, Wang Y, Li X, Ren L, Zhao J, Hu Y, et al Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China Lancet 2020;395(10223):497-506 Reference #2: Akhmerov A, Marban E COVID-19 and the Heart Circulation research 2020;126(10):1443-55 Reference #3: Lippi G, Plebani M Laboratory abnormalities in patients with COVID-2019 infection Clinical chemistry and laboratory medici ne 2020 DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by NIKHIL AGRAWAL, source=Web Response no disclosure on file for Nawfal Al-khafaji;No relevant relationships by Syed Mustafa, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Amir Shahbaz, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Meer Zafar, source=Web Response","output":"Covid-19-associated Myocarditis Mimicking St Elevation Myocardial Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cryopreservation of reproductive cells and tissues represents an essential aspect of ART practices that might be particularly strategic and helpful during SARS-CoV-2 emergency.

This trend has been driven by procedural innovations as well as access to Internet and social media. Consequently, patients have been seeking cosmetic surgical procedures at younger ages. In this narrative review, studies assessing attitudes towards cosmetic surgical procedures among college-aged young adults were evaluated. METHODS: A search identified 20 studies published from 2002 to 2021 that focused on cosmetic surgical procedures among young adults. Each study used survey-based data to determine attitudes, acceptance, interests, perceptions, and beliefs about cosmetic surgical procedures among college-aged students in the United States. RESULTS: The proportion of college-aged participants who had undergone cosmetic surgical procedures ranged from 1.3% to 6.4% with surveys reporting that between 21 and 43% were interested in procedures in the future. In general, young women were more likely to express interest in cosmetic surgical procedures than young men. Studies consistently demonstrated an inverse relationship between body satisfaction and use of aesthetic procedures among this patient population. Other factors associated with acceptance and approval of cosmetic surgical procedures included importance of appearance to self-worth, concern with social standing and attractiveness, investment in appearance, media influence on body image, and positive attitudes towards celebrities. Exposure to cosmetic surgery advertising was correlated with increased approval of cosmetic surgical procedures, especially the perception that advertising influences others more than survey respondents themselves.

The adjusted absolute increase in survival to hospital discharge without organ support with therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was 4.6% (95% credible interval 0.7 to 8.1). In the primary adaptive stopping groups, the final probabilities of superiority for therapeutic anticoagulation were 97.3% in the high D-dimer group and 92.9% in the low D-dimer group. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% and 0.9% of participants randomized to therapeutic anticoagulation and thromboprophylaxis, respectively. Conclusions In non-critically ill patients with Covid-19, an initial strategy of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin increases the probability of survival to hospital discharge with reduced use of organ support.","output":"Therapeutic Anticoagulation in Non-Critically Ill Patients with Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus causing overwhelming death and infection worldwide, has emerged as a pandemic. Compared to its predecessor SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is more infective for being highly contagious and exhibiting tighter binding with host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). The entry of the virus into host cells is mediated by the interaction of its spike protein with hACE-2. Thus, a peptide that has a resemblance to hACE-2 but can overpower the spike protein-hACE-2 interaction will be a potential therapeutic to contain this virus. The non-interacting residues in the receptor-binding domain of hACE-2 have been mutated to generate a library of 136 new peptides. Out of this library, docking and virtual screening discover seven peptides that can exert a stronger interaction with the spike protein than hACE-2. A peptide derived from simultaneous mutation of all the non-interacting residues of hACE-2 yields almost three-fold stronger interaction than hACE-2 and thus turns out here to be the best peptide inhibitor of the novel coronavirus. The binding of the best peptide inhibitor with the spike protein is explored further by molecular dynamics, free energy, and principal component analysis, which demonstrate its efficacy compared to hACE-2. The delivery of the screened inhibitors with nanocarriers like metal-organic frameworks will be worthy of further consideration to boost their efficacy.","output":"ACE-2-Derived Biomimetic Peptides for the Inhibition of Spike Protein of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explain losses of bees that could occur after the winter season, we studied the effects of the insecticide imidacloprid, the herbicide glyphosate and the fungicide difenoconazole, alone and in binary and ternary mixtures, on winter honey bees orally exposed to food containing these pesticides at concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 g/L. Attention was focused on bee survival, food consumption and oxidative stress. The effects on oxidative stress were assessed by determining the activity of enzymes involved in antioxidant defenses (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) in the head, abdomen and midgut; oxidative damage reflected by both lipid peroxidation and protein carbonylation was also evaluated. In general, no significant effect on food consumption was observed. Pesticide mixtures were more toxic than individual substances, and the highest mortalities were induced at intermediate doses of 0.1 and 1 g/L. The toxicity was not always linked to the exposure level and the number of substances in the mixtures. Mixtures did not systematically induce synergistic effects, as antagonism, subadditivity and additivity were also observed. The tested pesticides, alone and in mixtures, triggered important, systemic oxidative stress that could largely explain pesticide toxicity to honey bees.","output":"Toxicity of the Pesticides Imidacloprid, Difenoconazole and Glyphosate Alone and in Binary and Ternary Mixtures to Winter Honey Bees: Effects on Survival and Antioxidative Defenses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immigration changes the daily dynamics of migrant individuals and communities, as individuals confront new cultures and environments, including new foods and eating styles.

London, UK, has been severely affected throughout the pandemic, and the resulting impact on the NHS has been profound. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on theatre productivity across Londons four major trauma centres (MTCs), and to assess how the changes to normal protocols and working patterns impacted trauma theatre efficiency. METHODS: This was a collaborative study across Londons MTCs. A two-month period was selected from 5 March to 5 May 2020. The same two-month period in 2019 was used to provide baseline data for comparison. Demographic information was collected, as well as surgical speciality, procedure, time to surgery, type of anaesthesia, and various time points throughout the patient journey to theatre. RESULTS: In total, 1,243 theatre visits were analyzed as part of the study. Of these, 834 patients presented in 2019 and 409 in 2020. Fewer open reduction and internal fixations were performed in 2020 (33.5% vs 38.2%), and there was an increase in the number of orthoplastic cases in 2020 (8.3% vs 2.2%), both statistically significant results (p < 0.000). There was a statistically significant increase in median time from 2019 to 2020, between sending for a patient and their arrival to the anaesthetic room (29 vs 35 minutes; p = 0.000). Median time between arrival in the anaesthetic room and commencement of anaesthetic increased (7 to 9 minutes; p = 0.104).

We hypothesized that the severity of illness and survival of patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation would differ for those with H1N1 influenza A compared with other subtypes of influenza A. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: Retrospective study of extracorporeal membrane oxygenationCsupported adults (> 18 yr) with influenza A viral infection reported to the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry between 2009 and 2019. We describe the frequency and compare characteristics and factors associated with in-hospital survival using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Of 2,461 patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for influenza A, 445 had H1N1, and 2,004 had other subtypes of influenza A. H1N1 was the predominant subtype between 2009 and 2011. H1N1 patients were younger, with more severe illness at extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation and higher reported extracorporeal membrane oxygenation complications than those with other influenza A subtypes. Patient characteristics including younger age and higher weight and patient management characteristics including longer ventilation duration before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were associated with worse survival. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation complications were associated with reduced survival. There was no difference in survival to hospital discharge according to influenza subtype after adjusting for other characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Patients supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for H1N1 were younger, with more severe illness than those supported for other influenza A subtypes. Survival to hospital discharge was associated with patient characteristics, management characteristics, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation complications but was not impacted by the specific influenza A subtype.","output":"Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support for Influenza A: Retrospective Review of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry Comparing H1N1 With Other Subtypes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1159/000499239.].","output":"Erratum: Evaluation of Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate Learning Curves with and without a Structured Training Programme: Erratum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread over the world rapidly creating one of the largest pandemics ever. The absence of immunity, presymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious discrete-time model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France as a test case, through the publicly available time series of nationwide hospital mortality and ICU activity, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters and the impact of lock-down implementation delay. This work shows that including memory-effects in the modelling of COVID-19 spreading greatly improves the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data. We estimate that the epidemic wave in France started on Jan 20 [Jan 12, Jan 28] (95% likelihood interval) with a reproduction number initially equal to 2.99 [2.59, 3.39], which was reduced by the national lock-down started on Mar 17 to 24 [21, 27] of its value. We also estimate that the implementation of the latter a week earlier or later would have lead to a difference of about respectively -13k and +50k hospital deaths by the end of lock-down.

The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture when smart solutions and technologies have become ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this review, we examine how smart city solutions and technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities. For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and technologies during the pandemic. The results were synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition, the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus, provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful attention to important issues and challenges related to privacy and security, access to open-source data, technological affordance, legal barriers, technological feasibility, and citizen engagement.

This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with sickness presenteeism in NSW registered veterinarians suffering from ILI, both before and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Veterinarians registered in NSW were invited to complete an anonymous online mixed-methods survey between 31 March 2021 and 31 June 2021, regarding sickness presenteeism and absenteeism associated with ILI. The questionnaire was distributed through online and print newsletters of the Australian Veterinary Association NSW Branch and the NSW Veterinary Practitioners Board. RESULTS: From a total of 122 participants, 81 veterinarians (66.4%) reported that they would attend work despite displaying symptoms of ILI. Most veterinarians would stay at home with a fever alone (n = 108, 88.5%), however, many would still attend work with a sore throat (n = 121, 99.2%) or a dry cough (n = 91, 74.6%). Sickness presenteeism was significantly associated with lack of staff to cover workers. Although sickness presenteeism remained common, participants reported that they were less likely to attend work with symptoms of ILI since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viral infection is thought to be the cause in most cases. We have investigated the incidence, aetiology, and outcome of this condition. METHODS Previously well adults from a stable suburban population consulting over one year with a lower respiratory tract illness were studied. For the first six months detailed investigations identified predetermined direct and indirect markers of infection. Evidence of infection was assessed in relation to presenting clinical features, indirect markers of infection, antibiotic use, and outcome. RESULTS Consultations were very common, particularly in younger women (70/1000 per year in previously well women aged 16-39 years), mainly in the winter months; 638 patients consulted, of whom 316 were investigated. Pathogens were identified in 173 (55%) cases: bacteria in 82 (Streptococcus pneumoniae 54, Haemophilus influenzae 31, Moraxella catarrhalis 7), atypical organisms in 75 (Chlamydia pneumoniae 55, Mycoplasma pneumoniae 23), and viruses in 61 (influenza 23).

Here, we applied adjunct ibuprofen and n-3 LCPUFA therapy, respectively, with standard anti-TB treatment, in a C3HeB/FeJ murine model of TB. Bacterial loads, lung pathology, lung cytokines/chemokines and lung lipid mediators were measured as outcomes. Lung bacterial load on day 14 post-treatment (PT) was lower in the n-3 LCPUFA, compared to the ibuprofen group (p = 0.039), but was higher in the ibuprofen group than the treated control group (p = 0.0315). Treated control and ibuprofen groups had more free alveolar space initially as compared to the n-3 LCPUFA group (4 days PT, p= 0.0114 and p= 0.002, respectively); however, significantly more alveolar space was present in the n-3 LCPUFA group as compared to the ibuprofen group by end of treatment (14 days PT, p = 0.035). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) was lower in the ibuprofen group as compared to the treated control, EPA/DHA and untreated control groups at 4 days PT (p = 0.019, p = 0.019 and p = 0.002, respectively). Importantly, pro-resolving EPA derived 9-HEPE, 11-HEPE, 12-HEPE and 18-HEPE lipid mediators (LMs) were significantly higher in the EPA/DHA group as compared to the ibuprofen and treated control groups. This suggests that n-3 LCPUFAs do improve pro-resolving and anti-inflammatory properties in TB, and it may be safe and effective to co-administer as adjunct therapy with standard TB treatment, particularly longer-term. Also, our results show host benefits upon short-term co-administration of ibuprofen, but not throughout the entire TB treatment course.","output":"Longer-Term Omega-3 LCPUFA More Effective Adjunct Therapy for Tuberculosis Than Ibuprofen in a C3HeB/FeJ Tuberculosis Mouse Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Elimination of cancer cells by T cells is a critical mechanism of antitumor immunity and cancer immunotherapy response. T cells recognize cancer cells via engagement of T cell receptors with peptide epitopes presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the cancer cell surface. Peptide epitopes can be derived from antigen proteins coded for by multiple genomic sources. Bioinformatics tools used to identify tumor-specific epitopes via analysis of DNA and RNA sequencing data have largely focused on epitopes derived from somatic variants, though a smaller number have evaluated potential antigens from other genomic sources. We report here an open-source workflow utilizing the Nextflow DSL2 workflow manager, Landscape of Effective Neoantigen Software (LENS), which predicts tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens from single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions (InDels), fusion events, splice variants, cancer testis antigens (CTAs), overexpressed self-antigens, viruses, and human endogenous retroviruses (hERVs). The main advantage of LENS is that it extends the breadth of genomic sources of tumor antigens that may be discovered using genomics data. Other advantages include modularity, extensibility, ease of use, incorporation of phasing and germline variant information in epitope identification, and harmonization of relative expression level and immunogenicity prediction across multiple genomic sources. Current limitations include lack of support for class II MHC epitope predictions and advanced visualization features. To demonstrate the utility of LENS, we present an analysis of predicted antigen landscape in 115 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. We expect that LENS will be a valuable platform and resource for T cell epitope discovery bioinformatics, especially in cancers with few somatic variants and increased importance of tumor-specific epitopes from alternative genomic sources.","output":"LENS - Landscape of Effective Neoantigens Software"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In order to keep subscribers up\\\\to\\\\date with the latest developments in their field, John Wiley & Sons are providing a current awareness service in each issue of the journal.

The occurrence of several deleterious events, such as hyperactivation of the reninCangiotensin system (RAS), and oxidative and inflammatory stress, contributes to the development of small vessel disease in PAH. Small resistance arteries are found at various points through the arterial tree, act as the major site of vascular resistance, and actively regulate local tissue perfusion. Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that alterations in small resistance artery properties are important features of PAH pathophysiology. Diseased small vessels in PAH show decreased lumens, thicker walls, endothelial dysfunction, and oxidative stress and inflammation. These events may lead to altered blood flow supply to tissues and organs, and can increase the risk of thrombosis. Notably, PAH is prevalent among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, in whom evidence of small vessel disease leading to cardiovascular pathology is reported. The SARS-Cov2 virus, responsible for COVID-19, achieves cell entry through an S (spike) high-affinity protein binding to the catalytic domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the relationship between small resistance artery disease, ACE2, and PAH, to understand COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The scope of the present review is to briefly summarize available knowledge on the role of small resistance artery disease and ACE2 in PAH, and critically discuss their clinical relevance in the context of cardiovascular pathology associated to COVID-19.","output":"Small Resistance Artery Disease and ACE2 in Hypertension: A New Paradigm in the Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has been suggested that pets play a critical role in the maintenance of methicillin-resistant (MR) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus spp. in the household. We examined risk factors for carriage of antimicrobial-resistant coagulase-positive staphylococci, with particular attention to Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolated from pets living in households of people diagnosed with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) skin or soft-tissue infection. We analyzed data collected cross-sectionally from a study conducted in 2012 that evaluated the transmission of MRSA and other staphylococci from humans, their pets and the environment (Pets and Environmental Transmission of Staphylococci [PETS] study). We used unadjusted and adjusted stratified logistic regression analyses with household-clustered standard errors to evaluate the association between demographic, healthcare-related, contact-related and environmental risk factors and MDR Staphylococcus spp. isolated from dogs and cats. Staphylococcal isolates obtained from dogs (n = 63) and cats (n = 47) were included in these analyses.

To help inform state policies and initiatives aimed at physician deployment during COVID-19, we used predictions of peak patient volume for hospitals and intensive care units (ICU) and regional physician workforce estimates to measure patient to physician ratios at the peak of the pandemic for each state. METHODS: We estimated the number of potentially available physicians based on Medicare Part B billings for the care of hospitalized and critically ill patients in 2017, adjusted for attrition due to exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and relevant experience. We used estimates from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation to determine the number of hospitalized and ICU patients expected at the peak of the pandemic in each state. We then determined the expected ratio of patients per physician for each state at the peak of the pandemic. RESULTS: The median number of hospitalized patients per physician was 13 (low estimate) to 18 (high estimate). At the high estimate of hospitalized patients, 35 states would have a patient to physician ratio of more than 15:1 (patient to physician ratios above 15:1 have been associated with poor outcomes). For ICU patients, the median number of patients each physician would treat across states would be 8-11 patients. Nine states would experience patient to physician ratios above 15:1 at the higher end of estimates. Patient-physician ratios decreased if the available physician pool was broadened to include physicians without recent experience treating hospitalized patients, and physicians in surgical specialties with experience treating acutely hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: We estimate that most states will have sufficient physician capacity to manage hospitalized patients at the peak of the pandemic. However, at the high estimates of hospitalized patients, some Midwestern states will experience high patient to provider ratios that may adversely affect patient outcomes.

We report a unique case of the DA type 2A with mixed clinical features and the unusual presentation of bilateral congenital dislocation of the knee but had unassisted stiff knee gait. CASE REPORT: A 5-year-old female child presented to the clinic with the complaint of inability to bend both knees since birth. She had an unassisted bipedal gait, but could not squat, cross-leg sit, run, and climb stairs without assistance. Her youngest brother had a similar presentation but succumbed to death at the age of 5 months due to respiratory distress. Clinical features were in the favor of FSS. Her serum creatinine kinase level was normal and the electromyography of bilateral tibialis anterior and abductor pollicis brevis was not suggestive of the myotonia. Radiograph of the skull showed cooper beaten skull appearance whereas bilateral pelvis with the hip showed following changes in the right hip; decrease femoral epiphysis height, horizontal proximal femoral physis, and the coxa brevia. She was initially managed conservatively by weekly stretching, manipulation, and casting. As a result, she could flex her knee up to 20. Although the quadricepsplasty might be helpful for the persistent extension deformity, there was marked quadriceps weakness which could make it harder for the child to stand and walk. In addition, the abnormal muscle physiology in FSS may result in unfavorable outcomes after the surgery. Moreover, a consideration of the surgical aspect is not free of risks which include difficult endotracheal intubation, vein access, and malignant hyperthermia. CONCLUSION: FSS is a rare congenital anomaly that should be differentiated from another syndrome of the close resemblance, Sheldon Hall syndrome and Schwartz Jampel syndrome which are other rare autosomal recessive disorders characterized by myotonia and the chondrodysplasia.

In this study, we provide a coherent overview of the duration of viral detection and viral RNA load in COVID-19 patients, stratified by specimen type, clinical severity, and age. METHOD: We systematically searched PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane review database for studies published between 1.11.2019 and 23.04.2020. We pooled the data of selected studies (22/7226 (650 patients) for meta-analysis) to estimate duration of viral detection and visualized viral load over time. FINDINGS: Our analysis showed consistent viral detection from specimen from the upper respiratory tract (URT), the lower respiratory tract (LRT), and faeces, irrespective of the clinical severity of COVID-19. Our analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 persists for a longer duration in the LRT compared to the URT in adult patients (5a?7 days in mild; 5a?9 days in moderate-severe patients). The differences in the duration of viral detection between mild and moderate-severe patients is limited in the LRT, but an indication of longer duration of viral detection for moderate-severe patients was observed in feces (15 days in mild vs. 21 days in moderate-severe patients) and the URT (12 days in mild vs. 16 days in moderate-severe patients). Further, viral load was demonstrated to peak in earlier stages of infection in the URT compared to LRT.

We sequenced full genomes of Vero cellCexpanded SARS-CoV-2 inoculum and viruses recovered from cats (n = 6), dogs (n = 3), hamsters (n = 3), and a ferret (n = 1) following experimental exposure. Five nonsynonymous changes relative to the USA-WA1/2020 prototype strain were near fixation in the stock used for inoculation but had reverted to wild-type sequences at these sites in dogs, cats, and hamsters within 1- to 3-d postexposure. A total of 14 emergent variants (six in nonstructural genes, six in spike, and one each in orf8 and nucleocapsid) were detected in viruses recovered from animals. This included substitutions in spike residues H69, N501, and D614, which also vary in human lineages of concern. Even though a live virus was not cultured from dogs, substitutions in replicase genes were detected in amplified sequences. The rapid selection of SARS-CoV-2 variants in vitro and in vivo reveals residues with functional significance during host switching. These observations also illustrate the potential for spillback from animal hosts to accelerate the evolution of new viral lineages, findings of particular concern for dogs and cats living in households with COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: The retrospective TBF test results and contact information of 684 patients aged over 18 years who underwent TBF testing between March 11th, 2019, and March 10th, 2020, were obtained. Of the 684 patients contacted by phone, 365 agreed to participate in the study and were enrolled. The patients were divided into three groups (TBF test positive, negative, and indeterminate). The data obtained from the questionnaire were compared statistically. RESULTS: According to the TBF test results, positive (n = 51, 14%), negative (n = 286, 78.3%), and indeterminate (n = 28, 7.7%) groups were compared.

In federated learning, since local data are collected by clients, it is hardly guaranteed that the data are correctly annotated. Although a lot of studies have been conducted to train the networks robust to these noisy data in a centralized setting, these algorithms still suffer from noisy labels in federated learning. Compared to the centralized setting, clients' data can have different noise distributions due to variations in their labeling systems or background knowledge of users. As a result, local models form inconsistent decision boundaries and their weights severely diverge from each other, which are serious problems in federated learning. To solve these problems, we introduce a novel federated learning scheme that the server cooperates with local models to maintain consistent decision boundaries by interchanging class-wise centroids. These centroids are central features of local data on each device, which are aligned by the server every communication round. Updating local models with the aligned centroids helps to form consistent decision boundaries among local models, although the noise distributions in clients' data are different from each other. To improve local model performance, we introduce a novel approach to select confident samples that are used for updating the model with given labels. Furthermore, we propose a global-guided pseudo-labeling method to update labels of unconfident samples by exploiting the global model.

Impaired lysosomal degradation causes cell dysfunction leading to progressive multiorgan involvement, disabling consequences and poor life expectancy. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is now available for most MPS types, offering beneficial effects on disease progression and improving quality of life of patients. The landscape of MPS in Europe is not completely described and studies on availability of treatment show that ERT is not adequately implemented, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe. In this study we performed a survey analysis in main specialist centers in Southern and Eastern European countries, to outline the picture of disease management in the region and understand ERT implementation. Since the considerable number of MPS IVA patients in the region, particularly adults, the study mainly focused on MPS IVA management and treatment. RESULTS: 19 experts from 14 Southern and Eastern European countries in total responded to the survey. Results outlined a picture of MPS management in the region, with a high number of MPS patients managed in the centers and a high level of care. MPS II was the most prevalent followed by MPS IVA, with a particular high number of adult patients. The study particularly focused on management and treatment of MPS IVA patients. Adherence to current European Guidelines for follow-up of MPS IVA patients is generally adequate, although some important assessments are reported as difficult due to the lack of MPS skilled specialists. Availability of ERT in Southern and Eastern European countries is generally in line with other European regions, even though regulatory, organizational and reimbursement constrains are demanding. CONCLUSIONS: The landscape of MPS in Southern and Eastern European countries is generally comparable to that of other European regions, regarding epidemiology, treatment accessibility and follow up difficulties. However, issues limiting ERT availability and reimbursement should be simplified, to start treatment as early as possible and make it available for more patients. Besides, educational programs dedicated to specialists should be implemented, particularly for pediatricians, clinical geneticists, surgeons, anesthesiologists and neurologists.","output":"The landscape of Mucopolysaccharidosis in Southern and Eastern European countries: a survey from 19 specialistic centers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental consequences of financial aspects, policy uncertainties and rapid globalization is the topic of intense debate in present years.

PURPOSE The purpose of this article is to establish and evaluate a method for measuring the utility of biosurveillance data. METHOD The authors derive an expected utility model in which the value of data may be determined by trading data relevance for time delay in receiving data. In a sample of 23 disease surveillance practitioners, the authors test if such tradeoffs are sensitive to the types of data elements involved (chief complaint v. emergency department [ED] log of visit) and proportional changes to the time horizon needed for receiving data (24 v. 48 h). In addition, they evaluate the logical error rate: the proportion of responses that scored less relevant data as having higher utility. RESULTS Utilities of chief complaints were significantly higher than ED log of visit, F(1, 21)= 5.60, P < 0.05, suggesting the method is sensitive. Further utilities did not depend on time horizon used in the exercise, F(1, 21) = 0.00, P = ns. Of 92 time tradeoffs elicited, there were 5 logical errors (i.e., 5% logical error rate).

SETTING: The Wisconsin Veterans Home, a skilled nursing facility for veterans and their spouses. RESULTS: Influenza A isolates were encountered in greater numbers than non\\\\influenza A isolates during three seasons. Seasonal variability is striking. In December 1992, we identified a large outbreak of respiratory illness. Influenza type B was cultured from 102 residents. In December 1995, influenza A was cultured from 285 people in Wisconsin. At that time, we identified outbreaks of respiratory illness in two of our four buildings. Based on statewide data, we suspected an influenza outbreak; however, 26 isolates of parainfluenza virus type 1 were cultured with no influenza. The potential importance of culturing at the end of the season was demonstrated in 1991C1992 when an outbreak of respiratory syn\\\\cytial virus (RSV) overlapped and extended beyond influenza A activity.

SUMMARY: Revefenacin 175 g is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with moderate to very severe COPD. Preclinical studies showed that revefenacin is a potent and selective antagonist with similar affinity for the different subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1-M5). Furthermore, prevention of methacholine- and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstrictive effects was dose dependent and lasted longer than 24 hours, demonstrating a long duration of action. In phase 2 and 3 trials, treatment with revefenacin was demonstrated to result in statistical improvements in pulmonary function (&#8805;100 mL, P < 0.05) vs placebo, including among patients with markers of more severe disease and those who received concomitant long-acting ?-agonists or long-acting ?-agonists together with inhaled corticosteroids. Revefenacin was also demonstrated to have efficacy similar to that of tiotropium. The clinical trial findings indicated no significant difference between revefenacin and tiotropium with regard to rates of adverse events. Overall, revefenacin was well tolerated, with COPD worsening/exacerbation, dyspnea, headache, and cough among the most common adverse events noted in the clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Revefenacin treatment delivered via nebulization led to improvements in lung function in patients with COPD. It was also generally well tolerated, with no major safety concerns. Revefenacin provides a viable treatment option for patients with COPD and may be a suitable alternative for those with conditions that may impair proper use of traditional handheld inhalers.","output":"Revefenacin, a once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, for nebulized maintenance therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The management of limb-length discrepancy secondary to traumatic femoral bone loss poses a unique challenge for surgeons. The Ilizarov technique is popular, but is associated with long external fixator time and many complications. This retrospective study assessed outcomes of post-traumatic femoral defects managed by monorail external fixation over an intramedullary nail. METHODS: Eight patients were included from October 2015 to May 2019 with post-traumatic femoral defects that underwent treatment with monorail fixator-assisted intramedullary nailing. Primary outcome was time to bone union and bone results according to ASAMI classification. Secondary outcomes were lengthening index, consolidation time and index, external fixator index (EFI), time to partial weight bearing(PWB) and full weight bearing (FWB), and complications. Patient reported outcome measures including EQ-5D-5L, SF-36, Oxford knee scores (OKS), and Oxford hip scores (OHS) were recorded after recovery. RESULTS: Mean follow-up time was 227 weeks. Average bone defect size was 9.69 cm. Average consolidation time and index were 11.35 months and 1.24 months/cm, respectively. Mean lengthening and external fixator index were 20.2 days/cm and 23.88 days/cm, respectively. On average, patients achieved FWB and bone union 56.25 weeks and 68.83 weeks after bone transport initiation, respectively. Two patients had docking site non-union, five patients had pin site infections, and two patients had osteomyelitis. EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS scores were compared to UK population norms (p = 0.104, p = 0.238, respectively). Average OKS was 32.17 and OHS was 34.00.

There is a gap in the understanding of the risk factors associated with the development of pediatric PTS preventing the early identification of those patients at greatest risk, and the development of risk-stratified interventions. OBJECTIVES To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on prognostic factors for PTS development in pediatric patients. METHODS A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 1960 to December 2018 was performed. Eligible studies reported at least one prognostic factor for PTS development in patients <21 years of age with a radiographically confirmed DVT. To be included in the meta-analysis, prognostic factors had to be reported in at least three published studies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Twelve studies (n= 1,160 patients) met criteria for inclusion. Ninety-three percent of patients with an extremity DVT(n=1076) were assessed for PTS. PTS developed in 40% (n=434) of these patients. Central venous catheter-associated DVT (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.08-2.98), complete veno-occlusion (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.04-3.46), and incomplete DVT resolution (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.4-3.07) were identified as candidate prognostic factors for pediatric PTS. These findings should be interpreted in the context of the heterogeneity of the included studies and the limitations of current pediatric PTS assessment tools. Further, the predictive value of these prognostic factors will need to be validated in future collaborative prospective multicenter studies that maximize the homogeneity of pediatric DVT patients.","output":"Predictors of Post-Thrombotic Syndrome in Pediatric Thrombosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Procalcitonin is a biomarker of systemic inflammation and may have importance in the immune response.

BACKGROUND: Midwives provide care to childbearing women across the continuum and are key members of the maternity workforce in Australia. AIM: To explore and describe midwives' experiences of providing maternity care during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A two-phased cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. Data were collected through an online survey and semi-structured interviews between May-June 2020. FINDINGS: Six hundred and twenty midwives responded to the online survey. Many reported a move to telehealth appointments. For labour care, 70% of midwives reported women had limited support; 77% indicated postnatal visiting was impacted. Five main themes were derived from the qualitative data including: coping with rapid and radical changes, challenges to woman-centred care, managing professional resilience, addressing personal and professional challenges, and looking ahead. DISCUSSION: Restrictions applied to women's choices, impacted midwives' ability to provide woman-centred care, which resulted in stress and anxiety for midwives. Professional resilience was supported through collaborative relationships and working in continuity models. Midwives revealed 'silver linings' experienced in providing care during the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Findings provide valuable evidence to understand the impact on midwives who have provided care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over 6 weeks, the patient's conditions worsened. For fear of contracting COVID-19, he refused to attend to the Emergency Room. Conditions did not improve despite medical therapy adjustments, and he was admitted to hospital following a syncope. Computed tomography scan revealed pneumonia, and he was placed in a grey ward while waiting for nose-swab results for COVID-19. A rapid escalation of treatment was necessary as conditions did not improve with low-dose inotropes, and he required invasive ventilation. An Impella 5.0 was implanted as support prior to surgery, was maintained during the procedure and as a means of weaning off extracorporeal circulation. Surgery was successful and Impella 5.0 was removed on postoperative Day 5.

We profiled the maternal and fetal response using a combination of viral RNA from naso-pharyngeal swabs and serological assessment of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: This multicentre prospective observational study was conducted between March 24th and August 31st 2020. Two independent cohorts were established, a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cohort and a cohort of asymptomatic pregnant women attending two of the largest maternity hospitals in Europe. Symptomatic women were invited to provide a serum sample to assess antibody responses. Asymptomatic pregnant women provided a nasopharyngeal swab and serum sample. RT-PCR for viral RNA was performed using the Cobas SARS-CoV-2 6800 platform (Roche). Umbilical cord bloods were obtained at delivery. Maternal and fetal serological response was measured using both the Elecsys? Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay (Roche), Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG Assay and the IgM Architect assay. Informed written consent was obtained from all participants. RESULTS: Ten of twenty three symptomatic women had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected on nasopharyngeal swabs. Five (5/23, 21.7%) demonstrated serological evidence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies and seven (30.4%, 7/23) were positive for IgM antibodies. In the asymptomatic cohort, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in RNA was 0.16% (1/608). IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 167% (10/598, 95% CI 08%-31%) and IgM in 351% (21/598, 95% CI 23C55%). Nine women had repeat testing post the baseline test. Four (4/9, 44%) remained IgM positive and one remained IgG positive. 3 IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detectable in cord bloods from babies born to five seropositive women who delivered during the study. The mean gestation at serological test was 34 weeks. The mean time between maternal serologic positivity and detection in umbilical cord samples was 28 days. CONCLUSION: Using two independent serological assays, we present a comprehensive illustration of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, and show a low prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2.

Following a drug repurposing methodology, and taking advantage of a singular staphylococcal strain that lacks the whole TCS machinery but the target one, we screened 1.280 off-patent FDA-approved drug for GraXRS inhibition. Reinforcing the connection between this signaling pathway and redox sensing, we found that antioxidant and redox-active molecules were capable of reducing the expression of the GraXRS regulon. Among all the compounds, verteporfin (VER) was really efficient in enhancing PMN-mediated bacterial killing, while topical administration of such drug in a murine model of surgical wound infection significantly reduced the bacterial load. Experiments relying on the chemical mimicry existing between VER and heme group suggest that redox active residue C227 of GraS participates in the inhibition exerted by this FDA-approved drug.

The results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated a superior fit for the seven-factor hybrid model (x(2) = 1425.445 (df = 149), CFI = 0.950, TLI = 0.937, SRMR = 0.033, RMSEA = 0.077) consisting of re-experiencing, negative affect, anxious arousal, dysphoric arousal, avoidance, anhedonia, and externalizing behaviors. Furthermore, the K-COVID-related-PTSD showed a satisfactory level of internal consistency ( = 0.793 to  = 0.939) with good convergent and discriminant validity. Finally, concurrent validity was confirmed by the significant correlations with all the negative mental health outcomes, such as PTSD symptoms, somatization, depression, anxiety, anger, negative affect, job burnout, and suicidal ideation. Overall, the current results demonstrate the K-COVID-related-PTSD is a valid scale and therefore has important implications for future pandemic-related studies.","output":"South Korean validation of the COVID-related-PTSD scale in a non-clinical sample exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2019, USCChina relations that had been characterized by a pattern of ups and downs over the past quarter century took a clear and possibly irreversible turn for the worse. This change has provoked debate about whether China and the US have already become rivals, perhaps adversaries, in a new cold war. I examine five underlying influences shaping the newly intensifying rivalry. These influences reflect key features of the international context within which the US and China find themselves (systemic or structural constraints) and the fact that the two rivals happen to be the US and China (national or unit-level attributes). Chief among the international constraints are the structural conditions of anarchy and the distribution of power that defines the systems polarity. The national attributes most relevant to understanding the evolution of USCChina relations are the geography of the theater where the two countries vital interests intersect and two aspects of their militarily relevant technological capabilities. Examining these five influences draws attention to reasons for some important similarities but also differences between the current rivalry and the SovietCAmerican rivalry of the Cold War. It makes clear that a Cold War II, if that is what is emerging, will not simply replicate the rivalry of Cold War I. Unfortunately, this examination also directs attention to some troubling new concerns about the distinctiveness of the new rivalry and the challenges they may present in the coming decades.","output":"USCChina Rivalry in the twenty-first century: Dj vu and Cold War II"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Despite exclusion from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, these individuals were identified as high-risk and prioritized for vaccination in public health guidelines. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated humoral and cellular immune responses to two doses of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine, BNT162b2, in 56 SOT recipients and 26 healthy controls (HCs). Blood specimens collected from participants prior to each dose and following the second dose were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. RESULTS: SOT recipients demonstrated lower mean anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels compared to HCs after each dose, and only 21.6% achieved an antibody response after the second dose within the range of HC responses. Similarly, the percentage of responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in SOT recipients was lower than in HCs. While most HCs showed notable humoral and cellular responses, responses were less concordant in SOT recipients, with some showing evidence of either humoral or cellular response, but not both. CONCLUSION: Humoral and cellular immune responses to the BNT162b2 vaccine are markedly reduced in SOT recipients as compared to HCs, suggesting that SOT recipients may benefit from more tailored regimens such as higher dose and/or additional vaccinations.","output":"Humoral and cellular immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 vaccine among a cohort of solid organ transplant recipients and healthy controls"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks remains a medical and economic challenge, due to the lack of a suitable drug or vaccine The glycan in some proteins plays an important role in protein folding, sorting, transport, and oligomerization, so the hindering of N-linked glycosylation of glycoproteins will prevent assembly of the virion Tunicamycin anticancer drug inhibits the N-linked glycan AIM: This study aimed to find out the mechanism action of tunicamycin on the viral glycoproteins RESULTS: The growth of the virus in the presence of tunicamycin conducted in the production of non-infectious and absence of spike protein (spikeless virions) Tunicamycin inhibits E2, S, and M glycoproteins of coronaviruses Tunicamycin has also diminished glycosylation of PTMs such as HE, and 8ab of SARS-CoV Finally, CONCLUSION: This study recommends using this drug to treat the SARS-CoV-2 ? 2020 Ali Adel Dawood, Haitham Abdul-Malik Alnori","output":"Tunicamycin anticancer drug may reliable to treat coronavirus disease-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Evidence for the use of lung ultrasound scan (LUS) examinations in coronavirus 2019 pneumonia is rapidly growing.

Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom thus far have underlying conditions. Models have not incorporated information on high-risk conditions or their longer-term baseline (pre-COVID-19) mortality. We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence scenarios based on varying levels of transmission suppression and differing mortality impacts based on different relative risks for the disease. METHODS: In this population-based cohort study, we used linked primary and secondary care electronic health records from England (Health Data Research UK-CALIBER). We report prevalence of underlying conditions defined by Public Health England guidelines (from March 16, 2020) in individuals aged 30 years or older registered with a practice between 1997 and 2017, using validated, openly available phenotypes for each condition. We estimated 1-year mortality in each condition, developing simple models (and a tool for calculation) of excess COVID-19-related deaths, assuming relative impact (as relative risks [RRs]) of the COVID-19 pandemic (compared with background mortality) of 15, 20, and 30 at differing infection rate scenarios, including full suppression (0001%), partial suppression (1%), mitigation (10%), and do nothing (80%). We also developed an online, public, prototype risk calculator for excess death estimation. FINDINGS: We included 3a??862a??012 individuals (1a??957a??935 [507%] women and 1a??904a??077 [493%] men). We estimated that more than 20% of the study population are in the high-risk category, of whom 137% were older than 70 years and 63% were aged 70 years or younger with at least one underlying condition. 1-year mortality in the high-risk population was estimated to be 446% (95% CI 441-451). Age and underlying conditions combined to influence background risk, varying markedly across conditions. In a full suppression scenario in the UK population, we estimated that there would be two excess deaths (vs baseline deaths) with an RR of 15, four with an RR of 20, and seven with an RR of 30. In a mitigation scenario, we estimated 18a??374 excess deaths with an RR of 15, 36a??749 with an RR of 20, and 73a??498 with an RR of 30. In a do nothing scenario, we estimated 146a??996 excess deaths with an RR of 15, 293a??991 with an RR of 20, and 587a??982 with an RR of 30. INTERPRETATION: We provide policy makers, researchers, and the public a simple model and an online tool for understanding excess mortality over 1 year from the COVID-19 pandemic, based on age, sex, and underlying condition-specific estimates. These results signal the need for sustained stringent suppression measures as well as sustained efforts to target those at highest risk because of underlying conditions with a range of preventive interventions. Countries should assess the overall (direct and indirect) effects of the pandemic on excess mortality.

A consistent increased mortality compared to non-cancer patients was observed across studies. In this study we aimed to estimate survival in COVID-19 HM patients by type of malignancy, to describe acute and post-acute clinical outcomes, and to compare outcomes in early and later pandemic periods. Methods: In this population-based registry study sponsored by the Madrid Society of Hematology (Asociacin Madrile?a de Hematologa y Hemoterapia), we collected de-identified data on clinical characteristics, treatment and acute and post-acute outcomes in adult patients with hematologic malignancies and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the Madrid region of Spain. Our case series included all eligible patients admitted to 26 regional health service hospitals and 5 private healthcare centers between February 28, 2020 and February 18, 2021 with a coverage of 98% on a population of 6.6 million inhabitants. The study outcomes were all-cause mortality, severity of disease (WHO), oxygen support, ICU admission, and follow-up symptoms and signs and complications. Survival probabilities were estimated with the actuarial method and reported overall and stratified by type of malignancy and for two study periods (early cohort,-COVID-19 diagnosis from February 28 to 31 May, 2020, and later cohort, up to February 18, 2021). Results: Of the 1408 patients reported to the HEMATO-MADRID COVID-19 registry, 1166 were included in the present analyses; 839 (72%) had a lymphoid malignancy, including 325 (28%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 50 (4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma and 263 (23%) with multiple myeloma; and 327 (28%) had a myeloid malignancy, including 115 (10%) with myelodysplastic syndrome, 92 (8%) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 87 (7%) with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Overall COVID-19 clinical severity was classified as critical in 19% of patients, severe in 36%, moderate in 22%, and mild in 22%; 10% were admitted to an ICU; 8% were on mechanical ventilation and 19% on noninvasive ventilation. Mild disease increased between early and later period from 15% to 38% of patients; severe disease decreased from 42% to 24%, p<0.001. COVID-19 treatment with steroids increased from 38% to 59%, p<0.001. At follow-up, 22% reported persistent symptoms related to COVID-19 at 2 months, 16% at 4 months and 14% at 6 months. 381 of 1166 (33%) patients died. Overall 30-day survival was 68%; 2 and 3-month overall survival probabilities were 56% and 53%, respectively. Survival was more favorable for patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (82%, 69% and 65% at 30-days, 2 and 3 months, respectively) than for those with lymphoid malignancies (68%, 56% and 54%) or myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (61%, 51%, 46%), p=001. 285 (37%) patients died in the early period vs 96 (24%) in the later, p<0.001, but median (interquartile range) follow-up time was much higher in the early vs later, 45 (20-116) days vs. 26 (11-86), respectively. Overall survival was not different between periods, p=0.5 (hazard ratio [95%C], 0.93 [0.73-1.17]). In the later cohort, 30 and 60-day survival probabilities were 71% and 56% vs. 67% and 56% in the early cohort Conclusions. A population-based registry in Spain provided strong evidence that although COVID-19 severity decreased over year 1 of the pandemic, mortality remained high, and survival was stable over time in the group of patients with hematological malignancy infected by SARS-Coc-2. A relevant proportion of the infected patients (1 in 6) referred persistent symptoms attributable to COVID-19. The improved clinical management of severe COVID-19 in non-cancer patients that followed the dissemination of evidence-based recommendations did not translate in more favorable survival in patients with hematological malignancies. Research is needed to address the specific characteristics and improve the clinical management of this vulnerable population.

Approximately 5% of our hospital beds are used as isolation facilities. AIM: To study the impact of an MRSA control bundle that was implemented via gradual geographic extension across hospital wards. METHODS: The bundle included active surveillance on admission and transfer/discharge to identify ward-based acquisition of MRSA, isolation and cohorting of MRSA-infected patients, enhanced hand hygiene initiatives, and publicly displayed feedback of MRSA acquisition and hand hygiene compliance rates. Implementation was between October 2006 and June 2010 in order to provide lead-time for the incremental development of infrastructural capacity, and to develop an ethic of infection prevention among staff. Results were analysed via interrupted time-series analysis. FINDINGS: MRSA infections fell midway through the implementation, with MRSA bacteraemia declining from 0.26 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18C0.34] cases per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2004 to 0.11 (95% CI: 0.07C0.19) cases per 1000 inpatient-days in the first quarter of 2012. MRSA acquisition rates fell a year after the programme had been fully implemented, whereas hand hygiene compliance rose significantly from 47% (95% CI: 44C49) in the first quarter of 2009 to 69% (95% CI: 68C71) in the first quarter of 2012.

This systematic review aimed to summarize evidence on the risk of infection, severe illness and death from COVID-19 in people with asthma. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A comprehensive search of electronic databases including preprint repositories and WHO COVID-19 database was conducted (until 26 May 2020). Studies reporting COVID-19 in people with asthma were included. For binary outcomes, we performed Sidik-Jonkman random effects meta-analysis. We explored quantitative heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, meta regression and evaluating the I2 statistic. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies with an overall sample size of 587 280 were included. The prevalence of asthma among those infected with COVID-19 was 7.46% (95% CI = 6.25-8.67). Non-severe asthma was more common than severe asthma (9.61% vs. 4.13%). Pooled analysis showed a 14% risk ratio reduction in acquiring COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.80-0.94; p < 0.0001) and 13% reduction in hospitalization with COVID-19 (95% CI = 0.77-0.99, p = 0.03) for people with asthma compared with those without.

This article presents a comprehensive review of the evidence on transmission of this virus. Although several experimental studies have cultured live virus from aerosols and surfaces hours after inoculation, the real-world studies that detect viral RNA in the environment report very low levels, and few have isolated viable virus. Strong evidence from case and cluster reports indicates that respiratory transmission is dominant, with proximity and ventilation being key determinants of transmission risk. In the few cases where direct contact or fomite transmission is presumed, respiratory transmission has not been completely excluded. Infectiousness peaks around a day before symptom onset and declines within a week of symptom onset, and no late linked transmissions (after a patient has had symptoms for about a week) have been documented. The virus has heterogeneous transmission dynamics: Most persons do not transmit virus, whereas some cause many secondary cases in transmission clusters called \\"superspreading events.\\" Evidence-based policies and practices should incorporate the accumulating knowledge about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to help educate the public and slow the spread of this virus.","output":"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: A Review of Viral, Host, and Environmental Factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this interview, conducted by Andrea Cr?mer and Sebastian Oppitz in November 2021, Prof. Jin Zhao  talks about his medical background and his particular relationship to the different schools of thought in Chinese Medicine (gejia xueshuo ѧ˵) and how he puts this knowledge into clinical practice.

The proposed model performs multiclass classification to meet the purpose. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The proposed model is built on top of VGG16 architecture with pretrained ImageNet weights. The model was fine-tuned using additional custom layers to deliver better performance specific to the target. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 15,153 samples are used in this work. These samples include chest X-ray images of COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal cases. The entire dataset was split into train and test sets, with a ratio of 80:20 before training the model. To enhance important image features, image preprocessing and augmentation were applied before feeding the image batches to the model. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Performance of the model is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score performance metrics. The results produced by the model are also compared with other recent leading studies. RESULTS: The proposed model has achieved a classification accuracy of 98% with 98% precision, 96% recall, and 97% F1 score on the test dataset for multiclass classification. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve score was 0.99 for all three cases of multiclass classification. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed classification model may be highly useful for the preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia cases, especially during heavy workloads and large quantities.","output":"Classifying COVID-19 and Viral Pneumonia Lung Infections through Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model using Chest X-Ray Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected healthcare and in particular surgical volume. However, no data surrounding lost hospital revenue due to decreased cardiac surgical volume have been reported. The National Inpatient Sample database was used with decreases in cardiac surgery at a single center to generate a national estimate of decreased cardiac operative volume. Hospital charges and provided charge to cost ratios were used to create estimates of lost hospital revenue, adjusted for 2020 dollars. The COVID period was defined as January to May of 2020. A Gompertz function was used to model cardiac volume growth to pre-COVID levels. Single center cardiac case demographics were internally compared during January to May for 2019 and 2020 to create an estimate of volume reduction due to COVID. The maximum decrease in cardiac surgical volume was 28.3%. Cumulative case volume and hospital revenue loss during the COVID months as well as the recovery period totaled over 35 thousand cases and 2.5 billion dollars. Institutionally, patients during COVID months were younger, more frequently undergoing a CABG procedure, and had a longer length of stay.

This review is an update on the latest developments in this field. RECENT FINDINGS: In recurrent acute pericarditis, autoinflammation has been included among causative mechanisms restricting the vague diagnoses of idiopathic pericarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance that detects ongoing pericardial inflammation may guide treatment in difficult-to-treat patients. Development of risk scores may assist identification of patients at high risk for complicated pericarditis, who should be closely monitored and aggressively treated. Treatment with IL-1 inhibitors has been proven efficacious in recurrent forms with a good safety profile. Finally, acute pericarditis has recently attracted great interest as it has been reported among side effects post COVID-19 vaccination and may also complicate SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: Subjects with a PED were treated with ST266 eye drops 4 times daily for 28 days, then followed for 1 week. Safety was assessed by monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). Efficacy was assessed by measuring the area of the PED by slit lamp biomicroscopy. Tolerability of ST266, percentage of eyes with complete healing, reduction in area of the epithelial defect, and maintenance of a reduction in the area of the epithelial defect 7 days after treatment were recorded. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled into the trial at one of eight sites. The first patient withdrew after 5 days. The remaining 12 patients with PEDs with median duration of 39 days (range = 12 to 393 days) completed treatment. Ten of the 12 eyes had been refractory to treatment with various conventional therapies prior to enrollment. After 28 days of treatment, there was a significant decrease in mean PED area compared with baseline (66.4%  35.3%, P = 0.001). At follow-up, 1 week after completion of treatment, on day 35, the PED area was further reduced by 78.8%  37.5% (P = 0.01) compared with baseline. During 28 days of treatment, 5 eyes (41.7%) had complete wound closure. There were no AEs of concern thought to be related to the drug, and no SAEs were noted. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, we found ST266 eye drops might promote corneal epithelization, thereby reducing the PED area, including in refractory cases in a wide range of etiologies.

The purpose of this study is to detail the international impact of COVID-19 among otolaryngologists, and to identify instructional cases. METHODS Country representatives of the Young Otolaryngologists - International Federation of Otolaryngologic Societies (YO-IFOS) surveyed otolaryngologists through various channels. Nationwide surveys were distributed in 19 countries. The grey literature and social media channels were searched to identify reported deaths of otolaryngologists from COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 361 otolaryngologists were identified to have had COVID-19, and data for 325 surgeons was available for analysis. The age range was 25 to 84, with half under the age of 44. There were 24 deaths in the study period, with 83% over age 55. Source of infection was likely clinical activity in 175 (54%) cases. Prolonged exposure to a colleague was the source for 37 (11%) surgeons. Six instructional cases were identified where infections occurred during the performance of aerosol-generating operations (tracheostomy, mastoidectomy, epistaxis control, dacryocystorhinostomy and translabyrinthine resection). In three of these cases, multiple operating room attendees were infected, and in two, the surgeon succumbed to complications of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS The etiology of reported cases within the otolaryngology community appear to stem equally from clinical activity and community spread. Multiple procedures performed by otolaryngologists are aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) and great care should be taken to protect the surgical team before, during, and after these operations.

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial damage is common in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, with evidence of myocardial infarction and myocarditis demonstrated on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Post-mortem studies have also implicated microvascular thrombosis, which may cause persistent microvascular disease. PURPOSE: To determine the long-term coronary sequelae in recovered COVID-19 using multiparametric CMR including state-of-the-art inline quantitative stress myocardial blood flow (sMBF) mapping to assess global and regional sMBF. METHODS: Prospective, multicentre observational study of recovered COVID-19 patients scanned at three London CMR units. Results were compared to a propensity-matched, pre-COVID chest pain cohort (104 patients referred for perfusion CMR, with subsequently demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries) and 27 healthy volunteers (HV). Perfusion image analysis was performed using a novel artificial intelligence approach deriving global and regional stress and rest MBF with a cut-off of >2.25mL/g/min signifying normal sMBF and <1.82mL/g/min abnormal sMBF (Kotecha JCVI 2019). RESULTS: 104 recovered, post-COVID patients (median age 62 years, 76% male; 89[87%] hospitalised, 41/89[46%] requiring ICU) underwent adenosine-stress perfusion CMR at a median 131(IQR 43-179) days from COVID-19 diagnosis. Median LVEF was 67% (IQR 60-71%; 12 (11.5%) with impaired LVEF), 51 patients (49%) had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE); 18% infarct-pattern and 33% non-ischaemic LGE. Global stress MBF in post-COVID patients was no different to age-, sex- and co-morbidities-matched controls (2.57  0.77 vs. 2.40  0.75 ml/g/min, p = 0.11, Figure 1), though lower than HV (3.00  0.76 ml/g/min, p = 0.001). Post-COVID, multivariate predictors of low sMBF were male sex (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.80, p = 0.001) and hypertension (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.51-0.88, p = 0.004), but not COVID-19 disease severity (ICU admission) or presence of scar (ischemic/non-ischemic). 21/42 with reduced sMBF (<2.25mL/g/min) had regional perfusion defects consistent with epicardial coronary disease. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 survivors do not demonstrate evidence of reduced global MBF by CMR compared to risk factor matched controls.

However, these epoxides are quickly metabolized into less active diols by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH).

This study investigates the preventive effects of t-TUCB (T) alone or combined with 19,20-EDP (T + EDP) or 17,18-EEQ (T + EEQ) on BAT activation in the development of diet-induced obesity and metabolic disorders via osmotic minipump delivery in mice. Both T + EDP and T + EEQ groups showed significant improvement in fasting glucose, serum triglycerides, and higher core body temperature, whereas heat production was only significantly increased in the T + EEQ group. Moreover, both the T + EDP and T + EEQ groups showed less lipid accumulation in the BAT. Although UCP1 expression was not changed, PGC1 expression was increased in all three treated groups. In contrast, the expression of CPT1A and CPT1B, which are responsible for the rate-limiting step for fatty acid oxidation, was only increased in the T + EDP and T + EEQ groups. Interestingly, as a fatty acid transporter, CD36 expression was only increased in the T + EEQ group. Furthermore, both the T + EDP and T + EEQ groups showed decreased inflammatory NFB signaling in the BAT.

Bats are highly unusual among mammals in other ways as well. Not only are they the only mammals capable of powered flight, they have extraordinarily long life spans, with little detectable increases in mortality or senescence until high ages. Their physiology likely impacted their history of pathogen exposure and necessitated adaptations that may have also affected immune signaling pathways.

Initial onset of the disease in the upper gastrointestinal tract is reported in the literature as just second to primary plasmacytomas of the head and neck system. The presenting symptoms are related to the organ involved and systemic symptoms can be weight loss, pain, bleeding and even fever. As this is a rare disease, there is no standard treatment and patients undergo endoscopic resection or chemotherapy with or without additional radiation. The prognosis of the disease depends on the possible future diagnosis of multiple myeloma which can be up to 50% within only a few years. We hereby report a case of a male patient with a past locally advanced breast cancer who was on prolonged adjuvant hormonal treatment. He developed a new symptom of melena and underwent a thorough evaluation including imaging and repeated biopsies from a large gastric lesion. The results were inconclusive mainly because of the differential diagnosis between breast cancer metastases and a new second primary malignancy. In view of a clinical deterioration and lack of diagnosis, an operation of radical gastrectomy was eventually performed only to surprisingly diagnose a rare hematologic disease of the stomach - gastric plasmacytoma. This diagnosis is rare in itself, especially having his previous male breast cancer and maternal multiple myeloma. The diagnostic procedure in this case had also provided the full treatment for his illness.","output":"[primary Gastric Plasmacytoma in a Breast Cancer Male Patient]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In March 2020, the world was shocked by the COVID-19 pandemic;this situation challenged the education system across the world.

A large volume of research findings from observational studies about disease interactions with COVID-19 is being produced almost daily, making it difficult for physicians to keep track of the latest information on COVID-19s effect on patients with certain pre-existing conditions. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we describe the creation of a clinical decision support tool, the SMART COVID Navigator, a web application to assist clinicians in treating patients with COVID-19. Our application allows clinicians to access a patients electronic health records and identify disease interactions from a large set of observational research studies that affect the severity and fatality due to COVID-19. METHODS: The SMART COVID Navigator takes a 2-pronged approach to clinical decision support. The first part is a connection to electronic health record servers, allowing the application to access a patients medical conditions. The second is accessing data sets with information from various observational studies to determine the latest research findings about COVID-19 outcomes for patients with certain medical conditions. By connecting these 2 data sources, users can see how a patients medical history will affect their COVID-19 outcomes. RESULTS: The SMART COVID Navigator aggregates patient health information from multiple Fast Healthcare Interoperability ResourcesCenabled electronic health record systems. This allows physicians to see a comprehensive view of patient health records. The application accesses 2 data sets of over 1100 research studies to provide information on the fatality and severity of COVID-19 for several pre-existing conditions. We also analyzed the results of the collected studies to determine which medical conditions result in an increased chance of severity and fatality of COVID-19 progression. We found that certain conditions result in a higher likelihood of severity and fatality probabilities. We also analyze various cancer tissues and find that the probabilities for fatality vary greatly depending on the tissue being examined. CONCLUSIONS: The SMART COVID Navigator allows physicians to predict the fatality and severity of COVID-19 progression given a particular patients medical conditions. This can allow physicians to determine how aggressively to treat patients infected with COVID-19 and to prioritize different patients for treatment considering their prior medical conditions.","output":"SMART COVID Navigator, a Clinical Decision Support Tool for COVID-19 Treatment: Design and Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Whole blood viscoelastic testing (VET) devices are routinely used in a variety of clinical settings to assess hemostasis. The Quantra QStat System is a cartridge-based point of care VET device that measures changes in clot stiffness during coagulation and fibrinolysis using ultrasound detection of resonance. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of the Quantra QStat System to detect coagulopathies in trauma patients. METHODS: A multicenter observational study was conducted on adult subjects at two level 1 trauma centers. For each subject, whole blood samples were drawn upon arrival to the emergency department and again, in some cases, after administration of blood products and/or antifibrinolytics. Samples were analyzed on the Quantra in parallel to ROTEM delta. The QStat cartridge provides measures of Clot Time (CT), Clot Stiffness (CS), Fibrinogen and Platelet Contributions to clot stiffness (FCS and PCS), and Clot Stability to Lysis (CSL). Data analyses included linear regression of Quantra and ROTEM parameters and an assessment of the concordance of the two devices for the assessment of hyperfibrinolysis. RESULTS: A total of 56 patients were analyzed. 42% of samples had a low QStat CS value suggestive of an hypocoagulable state. The low stiffness values could be attributed to either low PCS, FCS or combination. Additionally, 13% of samples showed evidence of hyperfibrinolysis based on the QStat CSL parameter. Samples analyzed with ROTEM assays showed a lower prevalence of low CS and hyperfibrinolysis based on EXTEM and FIBTEM results. The correlation of CS, FCS and CT versus equivalent ROTEM parameters was strong with r-values of 0.83, 0.79 and 0.79, respectively. DISCUSSION: This first clinical experience with the Quantra in trauma patients showed that the QStat Cartridge was strongly correlated with ROTEM parameters and that it could detect coagulopathies associated with critical bleeding.

CASE REPORT A 60-year-old woman underwent laparoscopic repair of a recurrent incisional hernia that was complicated by iatrogenic cecal injury necessitating a limited ileocecal resection and onlay prosthetic mesh repair of the hernia. Postoperatively, sloughing of the overlying skin led to mesh exposure. An attempted rotational flap coverage was complicated by small bowel injury, which was recognized and repaired. However, an entero-atmospheric fistula developed after the removal of contaminated mesh. The fistula was initially treated by vacuum-assisted closure dressing and later was converted to a 'stoma'. Six months later, the small bowel segment bearing the fistula was excised and bowel continuity was restored.

The study was focused on changes in two types of motivation: autonomous motivation- finding importance in the task of staying at home, and controlled motivation- staying at home because of felt pressure or choicelessness, as autonomous motivation predicts effective behavior change better than controlled motivation, especially long-term. Predictions grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) tested whether three motivating aspects of messages to stay at home from governmental and public health agencies, physicians, the news, and family and friends predicted changes in these motivations across time. Perceiving messages to stay at home as controlling predicted increases in controlled motivation and decreases in autonomous motivation over two months. Conversely, perceiving messages to stay at home as autonomy supportive predicted increases in autonomous motivation over two months. Results for mandated orders to stay at home were intriguing: they related to increases in both controlled and autonomous motivations over time. Exploratory analyses revealed that increases in autonomous motivation over time predicted actual time spent at home reported at Wave 2, whereas increases in controlled motivation did not relate.

Data were collected from FETP graduates and FETP technical advisers on the practices of FETP graduates, their engagement in key areas of field epidemiology, and their perceived skills and capacity to perform such activities. A total of 166 FETP graduates responded to the online survey. Almost two-thirds of FETP graduates reported that they are often engaged in managing public health surveillance systems (n = 119, 71.7%), analyzing the surveillance data (n = 116, 69.9%), training public health professionals (n = 113, 68.1%), investigations on and response to outbreaks (n = 109, 65.7%), and managing staff and resources (n = 106, 63.9%).

However, a crescent wave of anti-vaccine groups has grown in Western countries, especially in Italy, in the last two decades. Our aim was to evaluate adult's hesitancy and knowledge about vaccines and related diseases in Trentino-Alto Adige -the Italian region with the lowest vaccination coverages. METHODS We administered self-answered structured questionnaires in three malls in the Trentino province in June 2019. We collected demographic data and information on knowledge about vaccines, infectious diseases and attitude in seeking health information. We utilized a descriptive and multivariate analysis to investigate factors associated with vaccine hesitancy. RESULTS We collected 567 questionnaires, 18% of the people interviewed were hesitant toward vaccination and 16% were against mandatory vaccination. In the multivariate analysis a poor level of information, being younger than 60 years and being against compulsory vaccination were associated with vaccine hesitancy. Regarding information about vaccines, 76.5% of the people relied on physicians, and/or 49% navigated the internet, while social media are used by 16% of the study population.

These transporters provide fetal protection against circulating xenobiotics and environmental toxins present in maternal blood. We hypothesized that lipopolysaccharide (LPS-bacterial mimic) alters the yolk sac morphology and expression of key ABC transporters in a gestational-age dependent manner. Yolk sac samples from C57BL/6 mice were obtained at gestational ages (GD) 15.5 and GD18.5, 4 or 24 hours after LPS exposure (150ug/kg; n = 8/group). Samples underwent morphometrical, qPCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. The volumetric proportions of the histological components of the yolk sac did not change in response to LPS. LPS increased Abcg2 expression at GD15.5, after 4 h of treatment (p < 0.05). No changes in Abca1, Abcb1a/b, Abcg1, Glut1, Snat1, Il-1?, Ccl2 and Mif were observed. Il-6 and Cxcl1 were undetectable in the yolk sac throughout pregnancy. Abca1, breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp, encoded by Abcg2) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ Abcb1a/b) were localized in the endodermal (uterine-facing) epithelium and to a lesser extent in the mesothelium (amnion-facing), whereas Abca1 was also localized to the endothelium of the yolk sac blood vessels. LPS increased the labeling area and intensity of Bcrp in the yolk sac's mesothelial cells at GD15.5 (4 h), whereas at GD18.5, the area of Bcrp labeling in the mesothelium (4 and 24 h) was decreased (p < 0.05).

A distal, medium vessel has a tortuous course and thinner wall compared to large arteries, making it more susceptible to damage. Here, we review the treatment strategies for arterial perforation during mechanical thrombectomy, and we report the case of a patient treated with gelfoam embolization. CASE SUMMARY A 63-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with sudden neurologic symptoms of right hemiparesis and global aphasia. The initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 15. Computed tomography (CT) and CT angiography revealed hyperacute infarction and emergent arterial occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery M2-3 portion. During endovascular mechanical thrombectomy, arterial rupture occurred. The patient's vital signs were stable, but delayed angiography showed persistent active bleeding. Therefore, selective embolization of the injured artery was performed using gelfoam. Subsequent left vertebral and internal carotid angiography was performed to confirm hemostasis. A localized subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was confirmed on a follow-up CT scan. A repeated CT scan after 12 d showed resolution of the SAH, and rebleeding did not occur.

The UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish community has been severely affected by the pandemic. This group shares characteristics with other ethnic minorities including larger family sizes, higher rates of household crowding and relative socioeconomic deprivation. We studied a UK strictly-Orthodox Jewish population to understand transmission of COVID-19 within this community. METHODS: We performed a household-focused cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey between late-October and early December 2020 prior to the third national lockdown. Randomly-selected households completed a standardised questionnaire and underwent serological testing with a multiplex assay for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We report clinical illness and testing before the serosurvey, seroprevalence stratified by age and sex. We used random-effects models to identify factors associated with infection and antibody titres. FINDINGS: A total of 343 households, consisting of 1,759 individuals, were recruited. Serum was available for 1,242 participants. The overall seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 was 64.3% (95% CI 61.6-67.0%). The lowest seroprevalence was 27.6% in children under 5 years and rose to 73.8% in secondary school children and 74% in adults. Antibody titres were higher in symptomatic individuals and declined over time since reported COVID-19 symptoms, with the decline more marked for nucleocapsid titres. INTERPRETATION: In this tight-knit religious minority population in the UK, we report one of the highest SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence levels in the world to date, which was markedly higher than the reported 10% seroprevalence in London at the time of the study. In the context of this high force of infection, all age groups experienced a high burden of infection.

Interestingly, 50 mmHg mechanical stressing induced the nuclear localization of NFAT1; but conversely decreased C-Jun and inhibited the expression of CD69 in lymphocytes under lipopolysaccharide or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin stimulation. Additionally, we observed similar changes trends when comparing RNA-seq data of hypertensive and normotensive COVID-19 patients.

The first set of actions, so-called short-term measures, are expected to be implemented by 2023 and result in a reduction of emission intensity by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 2008 levels. Compliance may be achieved through a reduction in sailing speeds, but certain countries have raised concerns on the ramifications of longer transit times on their exports, particularly for perishable products. In this paper, we present a methodology to assess the impacts of various short-term measures on perishable products. We use an extension of a nested modal split model to examine shifts towards other modes of transport. We demonstrate our methodology with a transpacific case study carrying perishable products from South America to China. We compare the short-term measures currently under discussion, in one of the first academic studies to explore these issues. These include a speed limit approach, a power limit, and a goal-based measure. Our results show that a power limit or a goal-based measure would offer some advantages to liner shipping operators using more efficient vessels, unlike a speed limit. Using 2008 as the benchmark year has resulted in small speed reductions required by the liner shipping sector to reach its targets. For perishable cargoes, small speed reductions can be tolerated by the shippers without significant modal shift. Choosing the right short-term strategy is of utmost importance to promote clean shipping practices in the following years.","output":"Impacts of short-term measures to decarbonize maritime transport on perishable cargoes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lobectomy has long been considered the standard procedure for early-stage lung cancer, and minimally invasive techniques have been demonstrated to be associated with superior outcomes compared with lobectomy by thoracotomy.

METHODS: An online survey exploring physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels of pregnant women with gestational diabetes during COVID-19 was distributed through social media platforms. Women who had been pregnant during the COVID-19 outbreak and had gestational diabetes, were resident in the UK, were 18 years old or over and could understand written English were invited to take part. RESULTS: A total of 724 women accessed the survey, 553 of these met the eligibility criteria and took part in the survey. Sedentary time increased for 79% of the women during the pandemic. Almost half of the women (47%) were meeting the physical activity guidelines pre COVID-19 during their pregnancy, this dropped to 23% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fear of leaving the house due to COVID-19 was the most commonly reported reason for the decline. Significant associations were found between meeting the physical activity guidelines during COVID-19 and educational attainment, fitness equipment ownership and knowledge of how to exercise safely in pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results show the impact of COVID-19 on physical activity and sedentary behaviour levels and highlight the need for targeted public health initiatives as the pandemic continues and for future lockdowns. Women with gestational diabetes need to know how it is safe and beneficial to them to engage in physical activity and ways to do this from their homes if fear of leaving the house due to COVID-19 is a barrier for them.

We use the recently developed susceptible-unidentified infected-confirmed (SUC) epidemic model. The unidentified infected population is defined as the infected people who are not yet identified and isolated and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals. It is important to quickly identify and isolate infected people among the unidentified infected population to prevent the infectious disease from spreading. Considering financial incentives as a strategy to control the spread of disease, we predict the effect of the strategy through a mathematical model. Although incentive costs are required, the duration of the disease can be shortened. First, we estimate the unidentified infected cases of COVID-19 in South Korea using the SUC model, and compute two parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the inverse of the average time for confirming infected individuals. We assume that when financial incentives are provided, there are changes in the proportion of confirmed patients out of unidentified infected people in the SUC model. We evaluate the numbers of confirmed and unidentified infected cases with respect to one parameter while fixing the other estimated parameters. We investigate the effect of the incentives on the termination time of the spread of the disease. The larger the incentive budget is, the faster the epidemic will end. Therefore, financial incentives can have the advantage of reducing the total cost required to prevent the spread of the disease, treat confirmed patients, and recover overall economic losses.","output":"Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks with Financial Incentives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SUMMARY: There is broad consensus that COVID-19 has had a pernicious impact on social work, in general, and among social work practitioners, more specifically. However, at present, very few, if any, empirical examinations of this impact exist. This exploratory study examined peritraumatic distress among a sample of social workers (N = 3920) in one southeastern state in the United States. FINDINGS: Analysis suggests that distress is impacted by several variables. In general, participants identifying as male, married, reporting good physical and mental health, working in microcontexts, and who were finically secure tended to experience less COVID-19 associated distress. In addition, social workers identifying as LGBTQ* and who had been working mostly remotely experienced higher levels of distress. APPLICATIONS: Overall, findings indicate the need to provide adept support to social workers practicing during the pandemic. Data suggest the need for targeted support initiatives, typically for those who are from underrepresented groups (e.g., LGBTQ*) or experiencing financial or mental/physical health issues. Certainly, researchers should continue to examine the impact of COVID-19 on social work practitioners and service delivery.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Social Workers: An Assessment of Peritraumatic Distress"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The MedTech Europe Code of Ethical Business Practice came into effect on 1 January 2018.

The data were statistically analyzed using STATA version 15.0. RESULTS: In total, 22 studiescomprising 5154 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 caseswere included in the analyses. Patients with less severe COVID-19 illness (i.e. those clinically classified as mild or common-type) seemed to exhibit recurrent PCR positivity more commonly than patients with more severe illness (i.e. those classified as severe or critical). There were also significant differences between the two groups in terms of the rates of headaches and dizziness, in addition to the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, C reactive protein, interleukin-6, and lactate dehydrogenase. Further, there were variations in the ratio of CD4+ T cells/CD8+ T cells on admission to the hospital.

Scientific literature suggests that patients living with mental health problems or illnesses (MHPIs) who interact with Peer Support Workers (PSWs) will not only feel the empathy and connectedness that comes from similar life experiences, but that this interaction also fosters hope in the possibility of a recovery. However, it is the effect of mental health teams or programs where there are PSWs that has been evaluated. Data will be collected for a future Randomized Controlled Trial by determining an effect size that would be specifically attributable to PSWs. OBJECTIVE: The five principal research questions are whether this online intervention will have an impact in terms of (Q1) personal-civic recovery and (Q2) clinical recovery , (Q3) how these recovery potentials can be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, (Q4) how the lived experience of persons in recovery can be mobilized to cope with such a situation, and (Q5) how sex and gender considerations can be taken into account for the pairing of PSWs with service users, beyond considerations based solely on psychiatric diagnoses or specific MHPIs. METHODS: Intervention: During the transitional and controlled online peer support groups, PSWs will simulate a typical unformal peer support group. They will have a personal-civic recovery focus, and they will be scripted with a fixed, predetermined duration (a series of 10 weekly 90-minute online workshops). There will be two experimental sub-groups: patients diagnosed with (1) psychotic disorders (n=10), and (2) anxiety or mood disorders (n=10), compared to a control group (n=10). Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment Allocation: Randomized Ratio: 2:1. RESULTS: Measures: Several instruments have been developed by clinicians and academics to assess clinical recovery. Based on their life narratives and to assess personal-civic recovery, measurement tools have also been developed through community-based participatory research; for instance the Recovery Assessment Scale and the Citizenship Measure questionnaires (personal-civic recovery). This pre-post research feasibility study of a trial is proposed to evaluate the outcomes on personal-civic recovery (primary outcome); and to assess its effects in terms of clinical recovery and stress- or anxiety-related responses to the COVID-19 (secondary outcomes). The COVID Stress Scales and the measures of personal-civic recovery will be repeated, along with the following measures of clinical recovery: (i) Anxiety State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y6, (ii) Depression Patient Health Questionnaire, (iii) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, (iv) Drug Abuse Screening Test, (v) Psychosis Screening Questionnaire, and (vi) World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Change will be compared between groups from baseline to intervention vs. control group in the study outcome measures using the Student paired sample t test. Results are expected for December 2020.

However, the impact of frailty on mortality with (non-COVID-19) pneumonia in critical illness is unknown. We examined the triage utility of the CFS in patients with pneumonia requiring ICU. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted with pneumonia to 170 ICUs in Australia and New Zealand from January 1, 2018 to September 31, 2019. We classified patients as: non-frail (CFS 1C4) frail (CFS 5C8), mild/moderately frail (CFS 5C6),and severe/very severely frail (CFS 7C8). We evaluated mortality (primary outcome) adjusting for site, age, sex, mechanical ventilation, pneumonia type and illness severity. We also compared the proportion of ICU bed-days occupied between frailty categories. RESULTS: 1852/5607 (33%) patients were classified as frail, including1291/3056 (42%) of patients aged >65 yr, who would potentially be excluded from ICU admission under UK-based COVID-19 triage guidelines. Only severe/very severe frailty scores were associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for CFS=7: 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3C7.8; CFS=8 [aOR: 7.2; 95% CI: 2.6C20.0]).

PURPOSE: The current evidence regarding iodine-containing compounds and iodine allergy cross-reactivity is reviewed. SUMMARY: Iodine is an essential human nutrient found in the thyroid gland. It is used in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyroxine. Patients who report having adverse reactions to iodine-containing substances are often labelled as having an iodine allergy, which can result in delays in care or patients being denied essential ICM or other iodine-containing drugs. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the evidence regarding iodine allergy and iodine-containing drugs. Of 435 articles considered potentially appropriate for full review (plus 12 additional articles included on the basis of references from the eligible articles), 113 could not be obtained. After exclusion of 353 articles that did not meet all inclusion criteria, the remaining 81 articles were included in the review. The results of the literature review indicated that iodine has not been shown to be the allergen responsible for allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media, amiodarone, povidone-iodine, and other iodine-containing compounds.

In particular, in recent years, through modification with immunopotentiators and targeting molecules, and in combination with innovative immunization devices, liposomes are rapidly developed as a multifunctional vaccine adjuvant-delivery system (VADS) that has a high capability in inducing desired immunoresponses, as they can target immune cells and even cellular organelles, engender lysosome escape, and promote Ag cross-presentation, thus enormously enhancing vaccination efficacy. Moreover, after decades of development, several products developed on liposome VADS have already been authorized for clinical immunization and are showing great advantages over conventional vaccines. This article describes in depth some critical issues relevant to the development of liposomes as a VADS, including principles underlying immunization, physicochemical properties of liposomes as the immunity-influencing factors, functional material modification to enhance immunostimulatory functions, the state-of-the-art liposome VADSs, as well as the marketed vaccines based on a liposome VADS.

The present study aims to investigate the perceived risk and protective behaviors regarding COVID-19 among Iranian pregnant women. Results: 93.8% of pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, 97.3% had high performance in protective behaviors, and 72.9% had a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19. The highest mean score of knowledge was observed in women who had a history of influenza in their previous pregnancies (90.975.94). The mean score of protective behaviors was significantly higher in women with a high economic level (97.785.11), and the highest level of risk perception was observed in nulliparous women (59.979.80). Risk perception was an independent predictor of protective behaviors related to COVID-19 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Pregnant women had a high level of knowledge, high performance in protective behaviors, and a moderate level of risk perception related to COVID-19.

Repeated infections occur throughout life, but its immune evasion mechanisms are largely unknown. We recently found that hMPV M2-2 protein elicits immune evasion by targeting mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), an antiviral signaling molecule. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such inhibition are not known. Our mutagenesis studies revealed that PDZ-binding motifs, 29-DEMI-32 and 39-KEALSDGI-46, located in an immune inhibitory region of M2-2, are responsible for M2-2-mediated immune evasion. We also found both motifs prevent TRAF5 and TRAF6, the MAVS downstream adaptors, to be recruited to MAVS, while the motif 39-KEALSDGI-46 also blocks TRAF3 migrating to MAVS. In parallel, these TRAFs are important in activating transcription factors NF-kB and/or IRF-3 by hMPV. Our findings collectively demonstrate that M2-2 uses its PDZ motifs to launch the hMPV immune evasion through blocking the interaction of MAVS and its downstream TRAFs.","output":"Functional Motifs Responsible for Human Metapneumovirus M2-2-mediated Innate Immune Evasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 related disease (COVID-19) is now responsible for one of the most challenging and concerning pandemics.

Little information is known about nosocomial infections of healthcare workers in the initial period. We analysed data from healthcare workers with nosocomial infections in Wuhan Union Hospital (Wuhan, China) and their family members. METHODS: We collected and analysed data on exposure history, illness timelines and epidemiological characteristics from 25 healthcare workers with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and two healthcare workers in whom COVID-19 was highly suspected, as well as 10 of their family members with COVID-19, between 5 January and 12 February 2020. The demographics and clinical features of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases were investigated and viral RNA of 12 cases was sequenced and analysed. RESULTS: Nine clusters were found among the patients. All patients showed mild to moderate clinical manifestation and recovered without deterioration. The mean period of incubation was 4.5a? days, the meansd clinical onset serial interval (COSI) was 5.23.2a? days, and the median virus shedding time was 18.5a? days. Complete genomic sequences of 12 different coronavirus strains demonstrated that the viral structure, with small irrelevant mutations, was stable in the transmission chains and showed remarkable traits of infectious traceability. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 can be rapidly transmitted from person to person, regardless of whether they have symptoms, in both hospital settings and social activities, based on the short period of incubation and COSI. The public health service should take practical measures to curb the spread, including isolation of cases, tracing close contacts, and containment of severe epidemic areas.

Obtaining the stress index (SI), however, requires quantitatively analyzing the shape of pressure-time curve with dedicated instruments or a specific ventilator, which may encumber its clinical implementation. We hypothesized that the SI could be qualitatively determined through a visual inspection of ventilator waveforms. METHODS Thirty-six adult subjects undergoing volume controlled ventilation without spontaneous breathing were enrolled. For each subject, 2 trained clinicians visually inspected the pressure-time curve directly from the ventilator screen. They then qualitatively categorized the shape of pressure-time curve as linear, a downward concavity, or an upward concavity at the bedside. We simultaneously recorded airway pressure and flow signals using a dedicated instrument. A quantitative off-line analysis was performed to calculate the SI using specific research software. This quantitative analysis of the SI served as the reference method for classifying the shape of the pressure-time curve (ie, linear, a downward concavity, or an upward concavity). We compared the SI categorized by visual inspection with that by the reference. RESULTS We obtained 200 SI assessments of pressure-time curves, among which 125 (63%) were linear, 55 (27%) were a downward concavity, and 20 (10%) were an upward concavity as determined by the reference method. The overall accuracy of visual inspection and weighted kappa statistic (95% CI) was 93% (88-96%) and 0.88 (0.82-0.94), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity to distinguish a downward concavity from a linear shape were 91% and 98%, respectively. The respective sensitivity and specificity to distinguish an upward concavity from a linear shape were 95% and 95%.

However, hyperthermia during critical illness among ventilated COVID-19 patients in the ICU has not yet been studied. We sought to determine mortality predictors among ventilated COVID-19 ICU patients and we hypothesized that fever in the ICU is predictive of mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 103 ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between March 14 and May 27, 2020. Final follow-up was June 5, 2020. Patients discharged from the ICU or who died were included. Patients still admitted to the ICU at final follow-up were excluded. RESULTS: 103 patients were included, 40 survived and 63(61.1%) died. Deceased patients were older {66 years[IQR18] vs 62.5[IQR10], (p = 0.0237)}, more often male {48(68%) vs 22(55%), (p = 0.0247)}, had lower initial oxygen saturation {86.0%[IQR18] vs 91.5%[IQR11.5], (p = 0.0060)}, and had lower pH nadir than survivors {7.10[IQR0.2] vs 7.30[IQR0.2] (p < 0.0001)}. Patients had higher peak temperatures during ICU stay as compared to hospital presentation {103.3F[IQR1.7] vs 100.0F[IQR3.5], (p < 0.0001)}. Deceased patients had higher peak ICU temperatures than survivors {103.6F[IQR2.0] vs 102.9F[IQR1.4], (p = 0.0008)}. Increasing peak temperatures were linearly associated with mortality. Febrile patients who underwent targeted temperature management to achieve normothermia did not have different outcomes than those not actively cooled. Multivariable analysis revealed 60% and 75% higher risk of mortality with peak temperature greater than 103F and 104F respectively; it also confirmed hyperthermia, age, male sex, and acidosis to be predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to identify ICU hyperthermia as predictive of mortality in ventilated COVID-19 patients. Additional predictors included male sex, age, and acidosis.

We also discuss the decision to treat COVID-19 patients with coinfection by PJP. METHODS: A literature search was performed through the Pubmed and Web of Science databases from inception to March 10, 2021. RESULTS: We identified 12 COVID-19 patients suspected to have PJP coinfection. All patients were critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. Many were immunosuppressed from HIV or long-term corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. In both the HIV and non-HIV groups, severe lymphocytopenia was encountered with absolute lymphocyte and CD4+T cell count less than 900 and 200 cells/mm, respectively. The time to PJP diagnosis from the initial presentation was 7.8 (range 2-21) days. Serum lactate dehydrogenase and beta-D-glucan were elevated in those coinfected with PJP. All patients were treated with anti-PJP therapy, predominantly sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with corticosteroids. The overall mortality rate was 41.6%, and comparable for both HIV and non-HIV groups. CONCLUSION: As the current evidence is restricted to case reports, the true incidence, risk factors, and prognosis of COVID-19 patients with PJP coinfections cannot be accurately determined.

The following factors were related to in-hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis: comorbidities (OR a??= a??2.919; 95%CI a??= a??1.515-16.705; p<0.001), days from the onset of symptoms and the hospital admission (OR a??= a??1.404; 95%CI a??= a??1.069-12.492; p a??= a??0.011), PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratio (OR a??= a??3.111; 95%CI a??= a??2.334-16.991; p a??= a??0.009) and eHDM treatment (OR a??= a??0.741; 95%CI a??= a??0.129-0.917; p a??= a??0.007). CONCLUSION: The eHDM is an interesting and promising approach in the ARDS related to COVID-19 pneumonia, which reduces mortality, length of hospitalization and the need for mechanical ventilation.","output":"Role of the early short-course corticosteroids treatment in ARDS caused by COVID-19: A single-center, retrospective analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new coronavirus has many of us stuck at home The result could fundamentally reshape how we use the internet, writes Annalee Newitz","output":"Apps for a crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The activation of water by non-thermal plasma creates a liquid with active constituents referred to as plasma-activated water (PAW).

In the present article we consider that the tests applied to groups of items returns a \\\\emph{load}, measuring how defective the most defective item of the group is. In this setting, we propose a simple non-adaptative algorithm allowing the detection of all defective items of the collection. This method improves on classical group testing algorithms using only the binary response of the test.

These tests return the viral load of the sample and the viral load varies greatly among individuals. Therefore our model presents some of the key features of this problem. We aim at using the extra piece of information that represents the viral load to construct a one-stage pool testing algorithm on this idealized version.

METHODS: We designed a retrospective cohort study and enroled a sample of post-AS-COVID and post-MS-COVID patients, whose INF were treated at a German level 1 trauma centre. The primary predictor variable was COVID severity presurgery (AS-COVD vs. MS-COVID). The main outcome variable was PVS detected in ES/IP. Other study variables were separated into demographic, clinical, and operative. Descriptive, bi- and multivariate statistics were computed, and statistical significance was set at P 0.05. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 15 INF patients (53.3% females; 46.7% post-AS-COVID) with a mean age of 42.2  22.7 years (range, 18C85). 13.3% ES and 53.3% IP were contaminated with SARS-CoV-2.

Multiple linear regression models refuted the associations between PVS and the other parameters (i.e. age, gender, time to treatment, length of hospital stay, lengths of ES/IP placement). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a relative low sample size, our findings suggest PVS via endonasal materials removed from cured COVID-19 patients, especially those healed from MS-COVID.

The magnitude of care variability in shock resuscitation, the confounding effects of disease severity and comorbidity, and the relative impact on sepsis survival are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate usual care variability and determine the differential effect of observed and predicted fluid resuscitation volumes on risk-adjusted hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients in shock. METHODS: We performed a retrospective outcome analysis of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to intensive care units using the 2013 Premier Hospital Database (Premier, Inc.). Observed and predicted hospital mortality were evaluated by observed and predicted day 1 fluid administration, using the difference in predicted and observed outcomes to adjust for disease severity between groups. Both predictive models were validated using a second large administrative database (Truven Health Analytics Inc.). Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay, and cost. RESULTS: Among 33,831 patients, observed hospital mortality was incrementally higher than predicted for each additional liter of day 1 fluid beginning at 7 L (40.9% vs. 37.2%, p = 0.008). Compared to patients that received expected ( 1.5 L predicted) day 1 fluid volumes, greater-than-expected fluid resuscitation was associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality (52.3% vs. 45.0%, p < 0.0001) among all patients with shock and among a subgroup of shock patients with comorbid conditions predictive of lower fluid volume administration (47.1% vs. 41.5%, p < 0.0001). However, in patients with shock but without such conditions, both greater-than-expected (57.5% vs. 49.2%, p < 0.0001) and less-than-expected (52.1% vs. 49.2%, p = 0.037) day 1 fluid resuscitation were associated with increased risk-adjusted hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Highly variable day 1 fluid resuscitation was associated with a non-uniform impact on risk-adjusted hospital mortality among distinct subgroups of mechanically ventilated patients with shock.

The delta variant is associated with increased transmissibility compared with the alpha variant, which was the dominant variant in the UK between December, 2020, and May, 2021. To understand transmission and the effectiveness of interventions, we aimed to investigate whether the delta variant generation time (the interval between infections in infectorCinfectee pairs) is shorterie, transmissions are happening more quicklythan that of the alpha variant. METHODS: In this epidemiological analysis, we analysed transmission data from an ongoing UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) prospective household study. Households were recruited to the study after an index case had a positive PCR test and genomic sequencing was used to determine the variant responsible. By fitting a mathematical transmission model to the data, we estimated the intrinsic generation time (which assumes a constant supply of susceptible individuals throughout infection) and the household generation time (which reflects realised transmission in the study households, accounting for susceptible depletion) for the alpha and delta variants. FINDINGS: Between February and August, 2021, 227 households consisting of 559 participants were recruited to the UKHSA study. The alpha variant was detected or assumed to be responsible for infections in 131 households (243 infections in 334 participants) recruited in FebruaryCMay, and the delta variant in 96 households (174 infections in 225 participants) in MayCAugust. The mean intrinsic generation time was shorter for the delta variant (47 days, 95% credible interval [CI] 41C56) than the alpha variant (55 days, 47C65), with 92% posterior probability. The mean household generation time was 28% (95% CI 0C48%) shorter for the delta variant (32 days, 95% CI 25C42) than the alpha variant (45 days, 37C54), with 975% posterior probability. INTERPRETATION: The delta variant transmits more quickly in households than the alpha variant, which can be attributed to faster depletion of susceptible individuals in households and a possible decrease in the intrinsic generation time. Interventions such as contact tracing, testing, and isolation might be less effective if transmission of the virus occurs quickly.

Many countries and research groups have launched or announced mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users' phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users. In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items.

An experiment was conducted in which participants were asked to read a letter and write a letter as separate activities on A4- and A5-sized papers. The fingermarks on the letters were visualized, and the resulting images were transformed into grid representations. A binary classification model was used to classify the letters into the activities of reading and writing based on the location of the fingermarks in the grid representations. Furthermore, the limitations of the model were studied by testing the influence of the length of the letter, the right- or left-handedness of the donor and the size of the paper with an additional activity of folding the paper.

Therefore, this study aimed to describe the setting and regional differences in the occurrence of COVID-19 among nursing staff, analysing symptoms, testing, and their respective results. METHODS: We used an online survey to conduct this cross-sectional study among Austrian nursing staff in different settings between May 12 and July 13, 2020. This article follows the STROBE statement. The survey includes demographic data, including age, professional qualification, e.g., nurse, nurse aid, and in which federal state and setting the participants work. In addition, we asked for COVID-19 symptoms and (result of the) testing. We used descriptive statistics as well as bivariate analysis to calculate the differences. RESULTS: Nearly every sixth nurse reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. We found statistically significant differences between the settings and the federal provinces for the reported COVID-19 symptoms, but not the test results. In total, 1.6% of the participating nurses were tested for COVID-19, of which all were positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the future during a pandemic, health care staff should be comprehensively tested in all settings. Our results showed that shifting the perspectives from critical/acute settings to other settings, such as nursing homes, is needed.","output":"COVID-19 among Nursing Staff: Settings and Regional Differences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. The disease has killed more than 3.8 million people worldwide. While cells in the respiratory system are the initial target for SARS-CoV-2, clinical studies suggest that COVID-19 can become a multi-organ disease in the most severe cases. Still, the direct affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for cells in other organs such as the kidneys, which are often affected in severe COVID-19, remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived model to investigate the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for kidney glomerular podocytes. Global gene expression and qPCR analyses revealed that human iPS cell-derived podocytes express many host factor genes (including ACE2, BSG/CD147, PLS3, ACTR3, DOCK7, TMPRSS2, CTSL CD209, and CD33) associated with SARS-CoV-2 binding and viral processing. Infection of podocytes with live SARS-CoV-2 or spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles revealed viral uptake by the cells at low Multiplicity of Infection (MOI of 0.01) as confirmed by RNA quantification and immunofluorescence studies. Our results also indicate that direct infection of human iPS cell-derived podocytes by SARS-CoV-2 virus can cause cell death and podocyte foot process retraction, a hallmark of podocytopathies and progressive glomerular diseases including collapsing glomerulopathy observed in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. Additionally, antibody blocking experiments identified BSG/CD147 and ACE2 receptors as key mediators of spike binding activity in human iPS cell-derived podocytes. These results show that SARS-CoV-2 can infect kidney glomerular podocytes in vitro, making this model potentially useful for kidney-specific antiviral drug screening and mechanistic studies of COVID-19 organotropism.Funding Information: S.M. is a recipient of the Whitehead Scholarship in Biomedical Research, a Chairs Research Award from the Department of Medicine at Duke University, a MEDx Pilot Grant on Biomechanics in Injury or injury repair, a Burroughs Wellcome Fund PDEP Career Transition Ad Hoc Award, a Duke Incubation Fund from the Duke Innovation & Entrepreneurship Initiative, and a George OBrien Kidney Center Pilot Grant (P30DK081943).

Objective: This study aims to find the correlation between frailty and mortality in adult, hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Clinical records of 201 patients who suffered from COVID-19 and were hospitalized between October 2020 and February 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected. Patients were assessed using Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) and were divided into three groups: CFS 1C3 fit; CFS 4C6 vulnerable and with mild to moderate frailty; CSF 7C9, severe frailty. The association between frailty and in-hospital mortality was the primary outcome. Results: Severe frailty or terminal illness was observed in 26 patients (12.94%) from a cohort of 201 patients. Those patients were older (median age 80.73, p < 0.001) and had more comorbidities. Frailty was also associated with higher requirement for oxygen supplementation, greater risk of in-hospital complications and worse biochemical laboratory results. An increase in CFS score also correlated with higher mortality (OR = 1.89, p < 0.001).

Anlotinib, as a multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which can inhibit the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), has been confirmed to have significant therapeutic effects on non-small cell lung cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and soft tissue sarcoma, but the therapeutic effect on gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear. Methods: Anlotinib was screened out of 880 drugs through Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8) technology. TCGA was used to detect the expression of VEGFR in GC, and Kaplan-Meier Plotter was used to analyze the correlation between the expression of VEGFR and the survival rate of GC patients. The impacts exerted by anlotinib to GC cell proliferating, migrating and invading processes were assessed through wound healing assay, transwell assay, and proliferation assay in vitro. In vivo experiments of GC were performed in C57/B6 mouse model to evaluate the function of anlotinib and PD-1 antibody. Results: It was found from more than compunds that anlotinib has a significant inhibitory effect on GC cells. In vitro experiments show that anlotinib can significantly inhibit the proliferation, invasion and proliferation of GC cells. The expression level of VEGFR is related to the prognosis and survival of GC. GC patients with low expression of VEGFR have better survival. Anlotinib can inhibit the expression of PD-L1, and achieve better therapeutic effects after combined with PD-1 antibody. Conclusion: The present study reveals that anlotinib down regulates PD-L1.

RESULTS: Using data from the websites of official funding agencies and the Brazilian government, we found that, in the first four months since the first case in Wuhan, China (December 31, 2019), around US$ 38.3 million were directed to public funding for scientific investigations against the COVID-19 pandemic. However, only 11 out of 27 federal units provided funding during the initial stages of the outbreak, and those that did provide financing were not necessarily the units having the most inhabitants, highest GDP, or the greatest number of cases.

A quantitative, cross-sectional research design was used, the study included a sample of 169 health-care workers. Data was gathered through the Moral Injury Symptom Scale for Health Professionals (MISS-HP), Light Triad Scale (LTS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD-7), and the Patient-Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results suggest that almost 9 out of 10 respondents experienced at least one potentially morally injurious event, 45.6% were at significant risk of impairment related to Moral Injury. Working with limited staff and resources, and the implications of it, were among the most common potentially morally injurious situations reported by the respondents. Results suggest that MISS-HP Mistrust subscale has significant negative correlations with Light Triad traits. A hierarchical regression model determined that Moral Injury, but not Light Triad traits, significantly affected depression symptoms. The overall model accounted for 42.6% of the variance in depression scores. On the other hand, anxiety symptoms were significantly predicted by Moral Injury, as did LTS-Humanism.

In March, it introduced further measures to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), placing the country in a state of almost complete lockdown. We report the impact of these restrictions on glucose control among people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). METHODS Data were collected on 33 individuals with T1D who were monitoring their glucose levels using a flash glucose monitoring device and remotely connected to the diabetes clinic on a cloud platform. We retrieved information on average glucose, standard deviation and percentage time in hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl), glucose range (70-180 mg/dl) and hyperglycaemia (> 180 mg/dl). We compared glycaemic measures collected during lockdown to those collected before the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and to the periods immediately before lockdown. RESULTS In 20 patients who had stopped working and were at home as a result of the lockdown, overall glycaemic control improved during the first 7 days of the lockdown as compared to the weeks before the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Average glucose declined from 177  45 mg/dl (week before lockdown) to 160  40 mg/dl (lockdown; p = 0.005) and the standard deviation improved significantly. Time in range increased from 54.4 to 65.2% (p = 0.010), and time in hyperglycaemia decreased from 42.3 to 31.6% (p = 0.016). The number of scans per day remained unchanged. In 13 patients who continued working, none of the measures of glycaemic control changed during lockdown. CONCLUSION Despite the limited possibility to exercise and the incumbent psychologic stress, glycaemic control improved in patients with T1D who stopped working during the lockdown, suggesting that slowing down routine daily activities can have beneficial effects on T1D management, at least in the short term.","output":"Glycaemic Control Among People with Type 1 Diabetes During Lockdown for the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients with cancer experience a higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, disease severity, complications, and mortality, than the general population.

Given the saturation of health structures, patients are quarantined, in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Therefore, it is highly desirable to have a dedicated monitoring system to adequately improve their independent living and significantly reduce assistance costs. A fall event is considered as a specific and brutal change of pose. Thus, human poses should be first identified in order to detect abnormal events. Prompted by the great results achieved by the deep neural networks, we proposed a new architecture for image classification based on local binary pattern (LBP) histograms for feature extraction. These features were then saved, instead of saving the whole image in the series of identified poses. We aimed to preserve privacy, which is highly recommended in health informatics. The novelty of this study lies in the recognition of individuals' positions in video images avoiding the convolution neural networks (CNNs) exorbitant computational cost and Minimizing the number of necessary inputs when learning a recognition model.

The fast growth is not without its challenge. In 2016, due to low concentrations of memberships and far distance from the depot, certain minority neighborhoods were excluded from receiving Amazon's SDD service, raising concerns about fairness. In this paper, we study the problem of offering fair SDD-service to customers. The service area is partitioned into different regions. Over the course of a day, customers request for SDD service, and the timing of requests and delivery locations are not known in advance. The dispatcher dynamically assigns vehicles to make deliveries to accepted customers before their delivery deadline. In addition to the overall service rate (utility), we maximize the minimal regional service rate across all regions (fairness). We model the problem as a multi-objective Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-learning solution approach. We introduce a novel transformation of learning from rates to actual services, which creates a stable and efficient learning process. Computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in alleviating unfairness both spatially and temporally in different customer geographies. We also show this effectiveness is valid with different depot locations, providing businesses with an opportunity to achieve better fairness from any location.

We describe our experience with transitioning to the pre-ablation cardiac computed tomography (CT) approach for the assessment of LAA thrombus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We studied consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation at our center. The study cohort was divided into pre- vs. post-COVID groups. The pre-COVID cohort included ablations performed during 1 year before the COVID-19 pandemic;pre-ablation TEE was used routinely to evaluate LAA thrombus in high-risk patients. Post-COVID cohort included ablations performed during the 1 year after the COVID-19 pandemic;pre-ablation CT was performed in all patients, with TEE performed only in patients with LAA thrombus by CT imaging. The demographics, clinical history, imaging, and ablation characteristics, and peri-procedural cerebrovascular events (CVE) were recorded. Results A total of 637 patients (pre-COVID n=424, post-COVID n=213) were studied. The mean age was 65.6 ? 10.1 years in the total cohort, and the majority were men. There was a significant increase in pre-ablation CT imaging from pre to post-COVID cohort (74.8 vs. 93.9%, p=<0.01), with a significant reduction in TEEs (34.6 vs. 3.7%, p=<0.01).

This paper aims to provide a literature review on risk assessment in order to put together a comprehensive typology of diverse risks biobanks could potentially face. Methodologically set as a typology, the conceptual approach used in this paper is based on the interdisciplinary analysis of scientific literature, the relevant ethical and legal instruments and practices in biobanking to identify how risks are assessed, considered and mitigated. Through an interdisciplinary mapping exercise, we have produced a typology of potential risks in biobanking, taking into consideration the perspectives of different stakeholders, such as institutional actors and publics, including participants and representative organizations. With this approach, we have identified the following risk types: economic, infrastructural, institutional, research community risks and participants risks. The paper concludes by highlighting the necessity of an adaptive risk governance as an integral part of good governance in biobanking. In this regard, it contributes to sustainability in biobanking by assisting in the design of relevant risk management practices, where they are not already in place or require an update.

Here we determined how dissolvable microneedle patches (DMN) for skin immunization can overcome this issue, using a clinically-relevant adenovirus-based Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine, AdHu5-PfRH5, in mice. Incorporation of vaccine into patches significantly enhanced its thermostability compared to the liquid form. Conventional high dose repeated immunization by the intramuscular (IM) route induced low antigen-specific IgG titres and high anti-vector immunity. A low priming dose of vaccine, by the IM route, but more so using DMN patches, induced the most efficacious immune responses, assessed by parasite growth inhibitory activity (GIA) assays. Administration of low dose AdHu5-PfRH5 using patches to the skin, boosted by high dose IM, induced the highest antigen-specific serum IgG response after boosting, the greatest skewing of the antibody response towards the antigen and away from the vector, and the highest efficacy. This study therefore demonstrates that repeated use of the same adenovirus vaccine can be highly immunogenic towards the transgene if a low dose is used to prime the response. It also provides a method of stabilizing adenovirus vaccine, in easy-to-administer dissolvable microneedle patches, permitting storage and distribution out of cold chain.","output":"Low Adenovirus Vaccine Doses Administered to Skin Using Microneedle Patches Induce Better Functional Antibody Immunogenicity as Compared to Systemic Injection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Similarly to other countries, the first wave of the COVID pandemic induced a collapse of mobility in Hungary during the spring of 2020 From the environmental perspective, the obtained road traffic reduction of 20C50% could be regarded as an undesired traffic regulation experiment Air quality impacts within Hungary were evaluated based on data from 52 monitoring sites measuring concentrations of pollutants NOx, O3, and PM10 Air pollution during the lockdown was compared to the same period (FebruaryCJune) in the reference years 2014C2019 The large spatial heterogeneity of the air quality response was explored The emission reduction coincided with the extreme weather of 2020, characterized by unusually warm pre-lockdown February and spring drought The anomalously low pre-lockdown air pollution was further reduced (NOx) or increased (PM10) during the restrictions Compared to the previous years, NOx concentrations during the curfew were found to differ between ?4 1 and +0 2 standard deviations (median ?1 55 SD), or ?45% and +3% (median ?18%) among different monitoring locations Ozone concentrations were unusually high due to both weather and chemical reasons (median +11% or +0 8 SD), while the PM10 response was modest and largely weather-driven (median +7% or +0 4 SD)","output":"Effects of COVID-Induced Mobility Restrictions and Weather Conditions on Air Quality in Hungary"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep-related disorder with breathing difficulties. Previous studies revealed that epicardial fat thickness (EFT) correlates with OSA severity. Interestingly, female patients display a stronger EFT-OSA correlation than males. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between EFT and different clinical characteristics in pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with OSA. METHODS Patients diagnosed with OSA were divided into pre/early peri-menopausal (Group 1) and post/late peri-menopausal (Group 2) according to the menopause status. EFT was obtained from parasternal long-axis echocardiographic images. We also collected general clinical characteristics of patients involved in this study, and performed spearman correlation analysis to explore the correlations between EFT and the general clinical characteristics. We further applied Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis to explore the predictors for EFT in both groups. RESULTS A total number of 23 and 59 patients were enrolled in Group 1 and Group 2 respectively. EFT in Group 2 was significantly higher than that of Group 1. In both groups, EFT was positively correlated with apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), percentage of total sleep time when blood oxygen saturation was less than 90% (T90), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and glucose; while EFT was negatively correlated with mean and lowest SaO2 (oxygen saturation) levels. However, EFT was positively correlated with total cholesterol (TC) only in Group 1 and body mass index (BMI) only in Group2, respectively. Multiple stepwise linear regression analysis showed that AHI was independently associated with EFT in Group 1. However, both AHI and BMI were independent predictors of EFT in Group 2. CONCLUSION EFT was notably correlated with menopausal status in women with OSA. AHI was the independent predictor of EFT in women with OSA. BMI was the independent predictor of EFT in post/late peri-menopausal women with OSA.","output":"Different clinical parameters inform epicardial fat thickness in pre- and post-menopausal women with obstructive sleep apnea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the accelerated activity in e-commerce especially since the COVID-19 outbreak, the congestion in the transportation systems is continually increasing, which affects on-time delivery of regular parcels and groceries. An important constraint is the fact that a given number of delivery drivers have a limited amount of time and daily capacity, leading to the need for effective capacity planning. In this paper, we employ a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach to predict the daily delivery capacity of a fleet starting their routes from a cross-dock depot and for a specific time slot. Each prediction specifies how many deliveries in total the drivers in a given cross-dock can make for a certain time-slot of the day. Our results show that the GPR model outperforms other state-of-the-art regression methods. We also improve our model by updating it daily using shipments delivered within the day, in response to unexpected events during the day, as well as accounting for special occasions like Black Friday or Christmas. ? 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"A Machine Learning Approach to Daily Capacity Planning in E-Commerce Logistics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: With rapid urbanisation in low-income and middle-income countries, health systems are struggling to meet the needs of their growing populations. Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) in Ghana have been effective in improving maternal and child health in rural areas; however, implementation in urban areas has proven challenging. This study aims to engage key stakeholders in urban communities to understand how the CHPS model can be adapted to reach poor urban communities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A Participatory Action Research (PAR) will be used to develop an urban CHPS model with stakeholders in three selected CHPS zones: (a) Old Fadama (Yam and Onion Market community), (b) Adedenkpo and (c) Adotrom 2, representing three categories of poor urban neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana. Two phases will be implemented: phase 1 (reconnaissance phase) will engage and establish PAR research groups in the selected zones, conduct focus groups and individual interviews with urban residents, households vulnerable to ill-health and CHPS staff and key stakeholders. A desk review of preceding efforts to implement CHPS will be conducted to understand what worked (or not), how and why. Findings from phase 1 will be used to inform and co-create an urban CHPS model in phase 2, where PAR groups will be involved in multiple recurrent stages (cycles) of community-based planning, observation, action and reflection to develop and refine the urban CHPS model. Data will be managed using NVivo software and coded using the domains of community engagement as a framework to understand community assets and potential for engagement. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the University of Yorks Health Sciences Research Governance Committee and the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review Committee. The results of this study will guide the scale-up of CHPS across urban areas in Ghana, which will be disseminated through journal publications, community and government stakeholder workshops, policy briefs and social media content.

Relevant and robust scientific knowledge is critical for providing decision-makers with the actionable evidence needed to inform conservation decisions. In the Anthropocene, science that leads to meaningful improvements in biodiversity conservation, restoration and management is desperately needed. Conservation Physiology has emerged as a discipline that is well-positioned to identify the mechanisms underpinning population declines, predict responses to environmental change and test different in situ and ex situ conservation interventions for diverse taxa and ecosystems. Here we present a consensus list of 10 priority research themes. Within each theme we identify specific research questions (100 in total), answers to which will address conservation problems and should improve the management of biological resources. The themes frame a set of research questions related to the following: (i) adaptation and phenotypic plasticity; (ii) humanCinduced environmental change; (iii) humanCwildlife interactions; (iv) invasive species; (v) methods, biomarkers and monitoring; (vi) policy, engagement and communication; (vii) pollution; (viii) restoration actions; (ix) threatened species; and (x) urban systems. The themes and questions will hopefully guide and inspire researchers while also helping to demonstrate to practitioners and policy makers the many ways in which physiology can help to support their decisions.","output":"One hundred research questions in conservation physiology for generating actionable evidence to inform conservation policy and practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pulvertaft weave has been the standard tendon junction technique used both in tendon transfers and tendon grafts.

Ovine deep flexor and extensor tendons were used to simulate Pulvertaft or loop weaves (n = 11) for tensile testing. The Pulvertaft weaves failed at the stabilizing sutures, whereas the loop weaves repairs failed by longitudinal splitting of the motor tendon. The loop weave demonstrated significantly higher mean initial failure and ultimate strengths. Tensile loads required to elongate the loop weave by 4, 6, and 8 mm were significantly higher, while more displacement was associated with the Pulvertaft repair under the application of 50, 75, and 100 N tensile loads.

Detected based on an overnight sleep study called polysomnography (PSG), OSA still remains undiagnosed in majority of the population mainly attributed to lack of awareness. To overcome the limitations posed by PSG such as patient discomfort and overnight hospitalization, newer technologies are being explored. In addition, challenges associated with current management of OSA using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), etc. presents several pitfalls. AREAS COVERED Conventional and modern detection/management techniques including PSG, CPAP, smart wearable/pillows, bio-motion sensors etc. have both pros and cons. To fulfill the limitations in OSA diagnostics, there is an imperative need for new technology for screening of symptomatic and more importantly asymptomatic OSA patients to reduce the risk of several associated life-threatening comorbidities. In this line molecular marker-based diagnostics have shown great promises. EXPERT OPINION A detailed overview is presented on the OSA management and diagnostic approaches and recent advances in the molecular screening methods. The potentials of biomarker-based detection and its limitations are also portrayed and a comparison between the standard, current modern approaches and promising futuristic technologies for OSA diagnostics and management is set forth.","output":"Current and Future Strategies for Diagnostic and Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Neutropenia is commonly encountered in cancer patients. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim), a cytokine that initiates proliferation and differentiation of mature granulocytes, is widely given to oncology patients to counteract neutropenia, reducing susceptibility to infection. However, the clinical impact of neutropenia and G-CSF use in cancer patients with COVID-19 remains unknown. METHODS: An observational cohort of 379 actively treated cancer patients with COVID-19 was assembled to investigate links between concurrent neutropenia and G-CSF administration on COVID-19-associated respiratory failure and death. These factors were encoded as time-dependent predictors in an extended Cox model, controlling for age and underlying cancer diagnosis. To determine whether the degree of granulocyte response to G-CSF affected outcomes, the degree of response to G-CSF, based on rise in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 24 hours after growth factor administration, was also incorporated into a similar Cox model. RESULTS: In the setting of active COVID-19 infection, outpatient receipt of G-CSF led to an increased number of hospitalizations (HR: 3.54, 95% CI: 1.25-10.0, P value: 0.017). Furthermore, among inpatients, G-CSF administration was associated with increased need for high levels of oxygen supplementation and death (HR: 3.56, 95% CI: 1.19-10.2, P value: 0.024). This effect was predominantly seen in patients that exhibited a high response to G-CSF based on their ANC increase post-G-CSF administration (HR: 7.78, 95% CI: 2.05-27.9, P value: 0.004). CONCLUSION: The potential risks versus benefits of G-CSF administration should be considered in neutropenic cancer patients with COVID-19, since G-CSF administration may lead to worsening clinical and respiratory status.","output":"The Effect of Neutropenia and Filgrastim (G-CSF) in Cancer Patients With COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Results from a cohort study of seriously injured adults (0103) Alcohol and Substance Abuse Methamphetamine Exposures Reported to United States Poison Control Centers, 2000-2019 (0028) Ridesharing Trips and Alcohol-Involved Motor Vehicle Crashes (0031) Overdose deaths involving alcohol in US Veterans (0046) Within-person predictors of same day alcohol and prescription opioid use among youth presenting to an urban emergency department (0049) Descriptive network analysis of co-occurring drug use disorders and associated predictors among adolescents and emerging adults presenting to an urban emergency department (0050) An Analysis of Drug Overdose Deaths by Intent in Ohio from 2016-2018 (0053) Child Maltreatment Pattern of Adverse Family Experiences from Early Childhood to Adolescence: A Latent Class Analysis (0025) Community-Level Prevention for Child Abuse and Neglect (0013) Text- and Chat-Based Hotlines: A Novel Approach to Provide Child Maltreatment-Related Support (0076) Understanding Implementation of Child Death Reviews in the United States Understanding Implementation of Child Death Reviews in the United States (0078) Abusive Head Trauma: Needs More Attention (0090) Child Passenger Safety The Impact of Focused Child Passenger Safety (CPS) Education on Pediatric Nurses Knowledge of CPS (0020) Domestic & Intimate Partner Violence Multidisciplinary Data-Sharing for Community Violence Prevention: Shifting Power to the Community (0023) Social support, marginalization, and teen dating violence among New Mexico youth (0060) In the midst of COVID-19: Challenges and creative solutions to conduct a randomized trial with immigrant religious leaders to prevent intimate partner violence (0062) Teen Dating Violence Policies within States, Summary of Policy Element Variation (0067) Do Traditional Masculinity Attitudes Moderate Relationships between Cumulative Violence Experiences and Marijuana/Alcohol Use among Black Young Men in Baltimore, Maryland?

Telemedicine and tele-health based interventions have emerged as reasonably practical solutions to these impediments in the delivery of care to cancer patients. Technological advancements have resolved the issue of connectivity for telemedicine even to the remotest places. Teleconsultation is becoming an acceptable alternative for patients and health care providers in this era of information technology. Albeit the challenges that we are facing are diverse and therefore cannot have a singular full proof answer, telemedicine and tele-health based interventions seem to offer promise in effectively complementing our efforts in that direction.

In this study, we analyzed three hospitals in Japan where large-scale NI outbreaks occurred for hints on how to prevent NI outbreaks. We reviewed openly available information from each hospital and analyzed it applying a three domain framework: operation management; identification of infection status; and infection control measures. We learned that despite having authorized infection control teams and using existing standardized IPC measures, SARS-CoV-2 may still enter hospitals. Early detection of suspected cases and confirmation by PCR test, carefully dealing with staff-to-staff transmission were the most essential factors to prevent NI outbreaks. It was also suggested that ordinary training on IPC for staff does not always provide enough practical knowledge and skills; in such cases external technical and operational supports are crucial. It is expected that our results will provide insights into preventing NI outbreaks of COVID-19, and contribute to mitigate the damage to health care delivery systems in various countries.","output":"Overcoming Current and Preventing Future Nosocomial Outbreaks during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned at Three Hospitals in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Currently, only dexamethasone, tocilizumab and sarilumab have conclusively been shown to reduce mortality of COVID-19. No drug for prevention or treatment in earlier stages of COVID-19 are yet found, with previously promising drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir have been shown to be ineffective. Several new candidates are now being studied in clinical trials. Safe and effective treatments will need to be both affordable and widely available. We therefore revised our original 2020 analysis to reflect recent developments. In this update we analysed the cost of production, current national list prices, and API availability for oral and IV dexamethasone, ivermectin, colchicine, dutasteride, budesonide, baricitinib and monoclonal antibodies tocilizumab and sarilumab. METHODS: Costs of production for new and potential COVID-19 drugs (dexamethasone, ivermectin, dutasteride, budesonide, baricitinib, tocilizumab, sarilumab and colchicine) were estimated using an established and published methodology based on costs of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), extracted from the global shipping records database Panjiva. This was compared with national pricing data from low, medium, and high-income countries. Annual API export volumes from India were used to estimate the current availability of each drug. RESULTS: Repurposed therapies can be generically manufactured at very low per-course costs: ranging from &2.58 for IV dexamethasone (or &0.19 orally) to &0.12 for ivermectin. No export price data was available for baricitinib, tocilizumab or sarilumab. When compared against international list prices, we found wide variations between countries. Drug API availability was generally good, with colchicine being the most available with sufficient annual API exported for 59.8 million treatment courses. A summary is shown in Table 1. Table 1.

The influence in standard energies, like crude oil, and renewable energies markets has been twofold: from one side, the predictability of volatility has strongly decreased;secondly, the linkages of the price time series have been modified. In this paper, by using DCC-GARCH and Price Leadership Share methodology, we can investigate the changes in the influences between standard energies and renewable energies markets by analyzing one-minute time series of West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures contract (WTI), the Brent crude oil futures contract (BRENT), the STOXX Europe 600 oil &amp;gas index (SXEV), and the European renewable energy index (ERIX). Our results confirm volatility spillover between the time series. However, when assessing the accuracy of the predictability of the DCC-GARCH model, the results show that the model fails its prediction in the period of higher instability. Besides, we found that price leadership has been strongly influenced by the virus spreading stages.

We found that even lymphopenia was the most common lab finding in adults; it infrequently occurred in children (9.8%). Moreover, elevated creatine kinase MB isoenzyme was much more commonly observed in children (27.0%) than that in adults, suggesting that heart injury would be more likely to occur in pediatric patients.

In a nationwide vaccination campaign since March in China, better understanding of concerns and preferences of COVID-19 vaccines remain crucial for improving vaccination uptake.Methods: ICU clinicians throughout Chinas mainland were contacted to participate in an online survey during March 24-April 10, 2021. We compared concerns by vaccination outcome, and through a discrete choice experiment (DCE) assessed preferences for vaccines in terms of effectiveness (95% vs 80%), risk of adverse reactions (5% vs 10%), duration of immunity (6 vs 12 months), and whether or not coworkers have been vaccinated.Findings: Among 11,951 ICU respondents from 252 prefecture-level cities, vaccination coverage of COVID-19 vaccines was 754%, with an additional 92% not vaccinated but planning to, and 161% not vaccinated and not intending to. Among women not pregnant, vaccination coverage was 826%, with lower coverage in those pregnant (114%) or breastfeeding (197%). ICU clinicians not intending to be vaccinated significantly expressed more concerns about the speed of vaccine development (301%) and adverse reactions (659%), compared to those already vaccinated. In the DCE, by COVID-19 vaccination status, the only significant difference in preferences of a COVID-19 vaccine was for safety, with those not vaccinated having a stronger preference for a vaccine with fewer adverse reactions (OR=449) compared to those already vaccinated (OR=290) or those intending to vaccinate (OR=346) (P<00001).Interpretation: Increasing vaccination coverage among Chinese ICU clinicians will require strong norms surrounding vaccination and transparency about safety information.

In order to re-invigorate immunization service delivery, sufficient financing must be made available from all sources, and particularly from government resources. This study utilizes the most recent data available to provide an updated comparison of available data sources on government spending on immunization. METHODS: We examined data from WHO/UNICEF's Joint Reporting Form (JRF), country Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (cMYP), country co-financing data for Gavi, and WHO National Health Accounts (NHA) on government spending on immunization for consistency by comparing routine and vaccine spending where both values were reported. We also examined spending trends across time, quantified underreporting and utilized concordance analyses to assess the magnitude of difference between the data sources. RESULTS: Routine immunization spending reported through the cMYP was nearly double that reported through the JRF (rho = 0.64, 95% 0.53 to 0.77) and almost four times higher than that reported through the NHA on average (rho = 3.71, 95% 1.00 to 13.87). Routine immunization spending from the JRF was comparable to spending reported in the NHA (rho = 1.30, 95% 0.97 to 1.75) and vaccine spending from the JRF was comparable to that from the cMYP data (rho = 0.97, 95% 0.84 to 1.12). Vaccine spending from both the JRF and cMYP was higher than Gavi co-financing by a at least two (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.45 to 2.89) and (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.15 to 3.30), respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Overall, our comparative analysis provides a degree of confidence in the validity of existing reporting mechanisms for immunization spending while highlighting areas for potential improvements. Users of these data sources should factor these into consideration when utilizing the data. Additionally, partners should work with governments to encourage more reliable, comprehensive, and accurate reporting of vaccine and immunization spending.","output":"Tracking government spending on immunization: The joint reporting forms, national health accounts, comprehensive multi-year plans and co-financing data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in a group of pregnant women, and to explore potential factors associated with this condition in this population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive cross-sectional study in pregnant women 15 years of age and older, sexually active during gestation, receiving prenatal care at the San Juan de Dios Hospital in Rionegro between January and March, 2021. The exclusion criteria were patients with disabilities or cognitive impairment, or classified as having a mental disorder according to the World Health Organization (WHO); pregnant women with chronic, placental, ovulation, hemorrhagic or infectious conditions; and patients whose pregnancy was the result of sexual assault. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire was applied, and sociodemographic and sexual and reproductive health variables were measured. Results are expressed as absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative variables, and as medians and interquartile ranges for quantitative variables. RESULTS: The mean age in years was 27.5 (IQR: 21.331.0) and the mean gestational age was 28.5 weeks (IQR: 21.3-34.8). After administering the FSFI, it was found that 37 women (37.7%) had sexual dysfunction (score < 26.5). The median scores for the participants without sexual dysfunction and those with sexual dysfunction were 29.4 (IQR 26.8-32) and 22.3 (IQR 20-24), respectively. The mean scores for each domain were: desire 3.6 (IQR: 3.0-4.2); arousal 4.5 (IQR: 3.65.1); lubrication 4.8 (IQR: 3.9-5.4); orgasm 4.4 (IQR: 3.6-5.2); pain 4.4 (IQR: 3.6-6.0); and satisfaction 5.4 (IQR: 4.8-6.0). The total score (p<0.05) was better in older women and those with one or more children. CONCLUSION: Sexual dysfunction occurs at least in one-third of pregnant women, especially during the third trimester.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is performed in the presence of inflammation and aneurysms of the coronary arteries. The objectives of our study were to assess which CABG strategy provides better graft patency and early and long-term outcomes. METHODS: A systematic review using Medline, Cochrane, and Scopus databases was performed in February 2020, incorporating a network meta-analysis, performed by random-effect model within a Bayesian framework, and pooled prevalence of adverse outcomes. Hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% credible intervals (CI) were calculated by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. RESULTS: Among 581 published reports, 32 studies were selected, including 1,191 patients undergoing CABG for KD. Graft patency of internal thoracic arteries (ITAs), saphenous veins (SV), and other arteries (gastroepiploic artery and radial artery) was compared. ITAs demonstrated the best patency rates at long-term follow-up (HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17C0.66). Pooled prevalence of early mortality after CABG was 0.28% (95% CI: 0.00C0.73%, I (2) = 0%, tau(2) = 0), with 63/1,108 and 56/1,108 patients, undergoing interventional procedures and surgical re-interventions during follow-up, respectively. Pooled prevalence was 3.97% (95% CI: 1.91C6.02%, I (2) = 60%, tau(2) = 0.0008) for interventional procedures and 3.47% (95% CI: 2.26C4.68%, I (2) = 5%, tau(2) <0.0001) for surgical re-interventions. Patients treated with arterial, venous, and mixed (arterial plus second venous graft) CABG were compared to assess long-term mortality. Mixed CABG (HR 0.03, 95% CI: 0.00C0.30) and arterial CABG (HR 0.13, 95% CI: 0.00C1.78) showed reduced long-term mortality compared with venous CABG. CONCLUSIONS: CABG in KD is a safe procedure.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the etiological agents that can be found during this complication. Spain started to vaccine its population at the beginning of 2021. We noticed an important increase in Staphylococcus aureus infections and bacteremia during this period of time, leading us to study the relationship with previous vaccination. Methods In this case series we present a cohort of twenty patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) during the study period (January 1, 2021 through May 31, 2021), attended in our Institution (Hospital Nuestra Se?ora de Sonsoles, vila, Spain). We tried to establish or at least create the debate of a possible relationship with a previous COVID-19 vaccine. Results From January 1, 2021 through May 31, 2021, 20 SAB were identified in our Institution. 13/20 patients were vaccinated (all of them with the mRNA vaccine type). 5/13 (38%) were male and 8/13 (62%) female. 10 of them (77%) received at least one dose of the vaccine before hospital admission, and 3 of them (23%) after admission. From the 10 previously COVID-19-vaccinated patients treated for SAB (CVPSAB), 4 died - 40% (2 deaths directly related to the SAB). Conclusion Although SAB may be a rare side effect after intramuscular injections or vaccines, it always implies an outstanding risk due to potential complications. Even if our study is not able to directly establish a link between SAB and previous vaccination, it implies a possible association between the vaccine injection and a threating disease (SAB). We should be aware of this probable relationship, so that we can maximize preventive measures.

Initial screening for human respiratory viral pathogens was performed in Hanoi, Vietnam at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) or the Military Institute of Preventative Medicine (MIPM), and an aliquot was shipped to Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore for validation. Patient demographics were recorded and used to epidemiologically describe the infections. Among military and civilian cases of SARI, 184 (52.9%) tested positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Influenza A virus was the most prevalent virus detected (64.7%), followed by influenza B virus (29.3%), enterovirus (3.8%), adenovirus (1.1%), and coronavirus (1.1%). Risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.2), and an increased risk of influenza B virus detection among patients enrolled in year 2017 (adjusted OR, 7.9; 95% CI, 2.7-22.9).

Previous studies have shown that there are drug-to-drug interactions between antiretroviral drugs and antidepressants. Therefore, an effective and safe treatment method was needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line psychological therapy in clinical treatment. Computerized CBT (cCBT) was proven to be an effective alternative to CBT and does not require face-to-face therapy between a therapist and the patient, which suited the COVID-19 pandemic response. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the cCBT program we developed in improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We customized a cCBT program focused on improving depressive and anxiety symptoms among patients with COVID-19, and then, we assessed its effectiveness. Screening was based on symptoms of depression or anxiety for patients who scored &#8805;7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD17) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). A total of 252 patients with COVID-19 at five sites were randomized into two groups: cCBT + treatment as usual (TAU; n=126) and TAU without cCBT (n=126). The cCBT + TAU group received the cCBT intervention program for 1 week. The primary efficacy measures were the HAMD17 and HAMA scores. The secondary outcome measures were the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Assessments were carried out pre- and postintervention. The patients' symptoms of anxiety and depression in one of the centers were assessed again within 1 month after the postintervention assessment. RESULTS: The cCBT + TAU group displayed a significantly decreased score on the HAMD17, HAMA, SDS, SAS, and AIS after the intervention compared to the TAU group (all P<.001). A mixed-effects repeated measures model revealed significant improvement in symptoms of depression (HAMD17 and SDS scores, both P<.001), anxiety (HAMA and SAS scores, both P<.001), and insomnia (AIS score, P=.002) during the postintervention and follow-up periods in the cCBT + TAU group. Additionally, the improvement of insomnia among females (P=.14) and those with middle school education (P=.48) in the cCBT + TAU group showed no significant differences when compared to the TAU group. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the cCBT program we developed was an effective nonpharmacological treatment for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia among patients with COVID-19. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term effects of cCBT for symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in patients with COVID-19.

To explore the issue in retrospect, let's look at death and suicide at different scales. If we were to compare suicide to one of the cell deaths, perhaps we would compare it to apoptosis as performed by the cell itself. At the animal level, survival follows the law of the strongest or the most intelligent. On an anthropological scale, civilizations survive in the illusion of their immortality. It is certain that suicide is a most intimate act and can, in this respect, be considered an act of freedom since it relieves the body's perception of any physical law, perception being abolished by death. The fascination for suicide is based on an intellectual exploration, a search for an absolute answer in opposition to all relativism, which paradoxically will take shape in annihilation. In times of pandemic and confinement, humanity experiences its finiteness. Confinement has re-installed a sense of loneliness in a society that lives on constant hyper-communication. In this text, the author demonstrates that suicide must be avoided because it is nonsense for both the individual and the community. Thus, living with disability as well as old age should be valued more highly, and public health policies against the causes leading to suicide should become state priorities. Finally, far from pathologizing suicide, the question of legally recognizing the right to (unassisted) suicide for those who commit it must be asked.","output":"Le suicide assist : quand le lgislatif ne peut se substituer  lexistentiel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a relatively novel infectious process, atypical presentations like acute pancreatitis (AP) are still being studied and a clear association between pancreatic injury and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has yet to be estab-lished.

To quantify the association between daily As intake from both food (rice, wheat and potatoes) and drinking water (Aswater) along with total exposure (Astotal) and hypertension risks in a study population in Bihar, India, we conducted an individual level cross-sectional analysis between 2017 and 2019 involving 150 participants. Arsenic intake variables and three indicators of hypertension risks (general hypertension, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) were derived, and any relationship was quantified using a series of crude and multivariable log-linear or logistic regression models. The prevalence of general hypertension was 40% for the studied population. The median level of HDL was 45 mg/dL while median value of LDL was 114 mg/dL. Apart from a marginally significant positive relationship between As intake from rice and the changes of LDL (p-value = 0.032), no significant positive association between As intake and hypertension risks could be ascertained. In fact, Astotal was found to be associated with lower risks of general hypertension and higher levels of HDL (p-value = 0.020 and 0.010 respectively) whilst general hypertension was marginally associated with lower Aswater (p-value = 0.043).

During first lockdown in fact, by hospital decision, all ambulatorial activity was closed, including nephrological one. This did not happen during second lockdown period. How the different choices about hospital activity affected nephrological patients is the aim of this study. METHOD: we evaluated all nephrological advices requested by first aid units of our 3 hospitals, all located in Lombardy, to our Nephrology Unit, splitting out data in 3 periods (I lockdown, summer and II lockdown) and comparing with 2019. Data collected were: number of advices requested by day, age, sex, previous regular nephrological follow-up, Covid-19 diagnosis, nephrological diagnosis after nephrological advice and outcome. RESULTS: as shown in table 1, during I lockdown period, with hospital decision of suspending our nephrological ambulatorial activity, we suffered an incremented rate of patients approaching local first aid units compared to 2019 same period with an increased rate of acute kidney injury, mostly for dehydration, and with a higher rate of patients requiring hospitalization. All these differences resulted statistically significant vs 2019 same period (figure 1). On the other side, no statically significant difference was found during the other two examined periods, including the II lockdown, while all our ambulatories were fully operating. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 pandemic affected also the nephrological population with an increased rate of first aid units accesses, acute kidney injury events and hospitalization comparing to 2019. However, these differences were detectable only during the I lockdown period characterized by the suspension of all ambulatorial activity, including our Unit. The absence of statistically significant differences during summer and primarily during II lockdown period demonstrates the importance of nephrological ambulatorial activity in management of renal diseases and in prevention of acute events.","output":"MO377 HOW THE ITALIAN COVID-19 LOCKDOWN AFFECTED NEFROLOGICAL ACTIVITY IN A LOMBARD CENTER"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads, sleep problems are expected to increase among healthcare workers.

We have previously established that over-expression of I-kappa-B-kinase-epsilon (IKK also named IKKi or IBK) in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines induces IL-6 secretion. We have also reported that prostate cancer cell lines lacking androgen receptor expression exhibit high constitutive IKK expression and IL-6 secretion.

Here, we summarise details of the SARS-CoV-2 genome to assist understanding of the emergence, evolution and diagnosis of this deadly new virus. Recent Findings: Based on high similarities in the genome sequences, the virus is thought to have arisen from SARS-like CoVs in bats but the lack of an intermediate species containing a CoV with even greater similarity has so far eluded discovery. The critical determinant of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is the spike (S) gene encoding the viral structural protein that interacts with the host cell entry receptor ACE2. The S protein is sufficiently adapted to bind human ACE2 much more readily than SARS-CoV, the most closely related human CoV. Summary: Although the SARS-CoV-2 genome is undergoing subtle evolution in humans through mutation that may enhance transmission, there is limited evidence for attenuation that might weaken the virus. It is also still unclear as to the events that led to the virus' emergence from bats. Importantly, current diagnosis requires specific recognition and amplification of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome by qPCR, despite these ongoing viral genome changes. Alternative diagnostic procedures relying on immunoassay are becoming more prevalent.","output":"Decoding Covid-19 with the SARS-CoV-2 Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 lockdown implemented globally to prevent the spread of the virus has led to the closure of schools. However, insight into the impact of the lockdown on private schools and the responses it has elicited is limited, especially across the African continent. This article examines the impact of the lockdown on private basic schools in Ghana and how they responded to the closure. Following organizational ambidexterity and qualitative interviews with nine proprietors of private schools in Ghana, the study found that the schools closure had a negative impact on private basic schools in five crucial ways: disruption to teaching and learning, difficulty in retrieving unpaid teaching fees, inability to pay staff salaries and statutory payments, underutilization of existing assets, and the cost of storing unused stock.

The infection of target cells by the SARS CoV is mediated through the interaction of the viral Spike (S) protein (1255 amino acids) and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The SARS CoV receptor-binding domain (amino acids N318CT509 of S protein) harbors an extended excursion along its periphery that contacts ACE2 and is designated the receptor-binding motif (RBM, amino acids S432CT486). In addition, the RBM is a major antigenic determinant, able to elicit production of neutralizing antibodies. Hence, the role of the RBM is a bi-functional bioactive surface that can be demonstrated by antibodies such as the neutralizing human anti-SARS monoclonal antibody (mAb) 80R which targets the RBM and competes with the ACE2 receptor for binding. Here, we employ phage-display peptide-libraries to reconstitute a functional RBM. This is achieved by generating a vast collection of candidate RBM peptides that present a diversity of conformations. Screening such Conformer Libraries with corresponding ligands has produced short RBM constructs (ca. 40 amino acids) that can bind both the ACE2 receptor and the neutralizing mAb 80R.","output":"Reconstitution of the receptor-binding motif of the SARS coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CO3 -a? and O2 -a? are known to be strong oxidizing reagents in biological systems. CO3 -a? in particular can cause serious damage to DNA and proteins by Ha? abstraction reactions. However, Ha? abstraction of CO3 -a? in the gas phase has not yet been reported. In this work we report on gas-phase ion/molecule reactions of CO3 -a? and O2 -a? with various molecules. CO3 -a? was generated by the corona discharge of an O2 reagent gas using a cylindrical tube ion source. O2 -a? was generated by the application of a 15 kHz high frequency voltage to a sharp needle in ambient air at the threshold voltage for the appearance of an ion signal. In the reactions of CO3 -a?, a decrease in signal intensities of CO3 -a? accompanied by the simultaneous increase of that of HCO3 - was observed when organic compounds with H-C bond energies lower than a??100 kcal mol-1 such as n-hexane, cyclohexane, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and toluene were introduced into the ion source.

Using data on cases and tests in France for the period between the first and second lock-downs-May 13 to October 25, 2020-our acceleration index shows that the pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration was stronger than national average for the [59-68] and especially the 69 and older age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19-28] age group was the lowest and is about half that of the [69-78]. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French \\"dpartements\\" (roughly counties), based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based.

This modeling study simulated the comparative and joint impact of COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on total infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. METHODS: An agent-based simulation model was employed to estimate incident SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations and deaths over 18 months for the State of North Carolina, a population of roughly 10.5 million. Vaccine efficacy of 50% and 90% and vaccine coverage of 25%, 50%, and 75% (at the end of a 6-month distribution period) were evaluated. Six vaccination scenarios were simulated with NPIs (i.e., reduced mobility, school closings, face mask usage) maintained and removed during the period of vaccine distribution. RESULTS: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy and 25% coverage), 2,231,134 new SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred with NPIs removed and 799,949 infections with NPIs maintained. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy and 75% coverage), there were 450,575 new infections with NPIs maintained and 527,409 with NPIs removed. When NPIs were removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared to the worst-case scenario (absolute risk reduction 13% and 8%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Simulation results suggest that premature lifting of NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. Our findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many pre-pandemic activities can be resumed.","output":"The Joint Impact of COVID-19 Vaccination and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions on Infections, Hospitalizations, and Mortality: An Agent-Based Simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is characterised by quite diverse prognosis.

Hence, profound knowledge regarding factors motivating and hindering (long-term) nutrition app use is crucial for developing design guidelines aimed at supporting uptake and prolonged use of nutrition apps. OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we synthesized the literature on barriers to and facilitators for nutrition app use across disciplines including empirical qualitative and quantitative studies with current users, ex-users, and nonusers of nutrition apps. METHODS: A systematic literature search including 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, PsychINFO, PSYNDEX, PsycArticles, and SPORTDiscus) as well as backward and forward citation search was conducted. Search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the planned data extraction process were preregistered. All empirical qualitative and quantitative studies published in German or English were eligible for inclusion if they examined adolescents (aged 13-18) or adults who were either current users, ex-users, and nonusers of nutrition apps. Based on qualitative content analysis, extracted individual barriers and facilitators were grouped into categories. RESULTS: A total of 28 publications were identified as eligible. A framework with a 3-level hierarchy was designed which grouped 328 individual barriers and facilitators into 23 subcategories, 12 categories, and 4 clusters that focus on either the individual user (goal setting and goal striving, motivation, routines, lack of awareness of knowledge), different aspects of the app and the smartphone (features, usability of the app or food database, technical issues, data security, accuracy/trustworthiness, costs), positive and negative outcomes of nutrition app use, or interactions between the user and their social environment. CONCLUSIONS: The resulting conceptual framework underlines a pronounced diversity of reasons for (not) using nutrition apps, indicating that there is no one-size-fits-all approach for uptake and prolonged use of nutrition apps.

Pitch scaling demonstrated that use of the apically placed electrode as a ground lowered the perceived pitch of electric stimulation relative to monopolar stimulation. Speech understanding was improved compared with preoperative scores. CONCLUSIONS The new surgical approach and clinical fitting are feasible. A lower pitch is perceived when using the apically placed electrode as a ground relative to stimulation using an extracochlear ground (i.e., monopolar mode), suggesting that stimulation can be provided more apically without the use of a longer electrode array.

Research on early psychological programmes that aim to prevent or reduce mental health symptoms and that have been tested in frontline responders may assist service providers with choosing a suitable intervention for rapid dissemination in healthcare settings. DESIGN AND OUTCOME MEASURES: First, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Google Scholar were searched through a systematic literature review of early psychological interventions administered to frontline responders in the last 15 years. Interventions were included if they were designed to prevent or reduce psychological impact and had outcome measures of psychological distress (eg, general psychopathology, post-traumatic stress disorder and stress) and/or positive mental health domains (eg, resilience, self-efficacy and life satisfaction). Second, the suitability of these programmes for the healthcare workforce was evaluated according to the criteria of effectiveness, content applicability and feasibility. RESULTS: Of 320 articles retrieved, 12 relevant studies were included that described six early psychological interventions. Although the evidence base is limited, psychological first aid, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, and trauma risk management showed effectiveness across at least two studies each with frontline workers. Resilience and coping for the healthcare community; anticipate, plan, and deter; and resilience at work programmes found promising results in single studies. Concerning other suitability criteria, all programmes appear applicable to healthcare settings and have acceptable feasibility for rapid implementation.

However, basic epidemiological characteristics have not been well established. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to determine the incidence and mortality of CAPA in critically ill patients with COVID-19 to improve guidance on surveillance and prognostication. Observational studies reporting COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis were searched with PubMed and Embase databases, followed by an additional manual search in April 2021. We performed a one-group meta-analysis on the incidence and mortality of CAPA using a random-effect model. We identified 28 observational studies with a total of 3148 patients to be included in the meta-analysis. Among the 28 studies, 23 were conducted in Europe, two in Mexico and one each in China, Pakistan and the United States. Routine screening for secondary fungal infection was employed in 13 studies. The modified AspICU algorithm was utilised in 15 studies and was the most commonly used case definition and diagnostic algorithm for pulmonary aspergillosis. The incidence and mortality of CAPA in the ICU were estimated to be 10.2% (95% CI, 8.0-12.5; I2 = 82.0%) and 54.9% (95% CI, 45.6-64.2; I2 = 62.7%), respectively. In conclusion, our estimates may be utilised as a basis for surveillance of CAPA and prognostication in the ICU. Large, prospective cohort studies based on the new case definitions of CAPA are warranted to validate our estimates.","output":"Incidence and mortality of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Mechanical ventilation is a mainstay of intensive care but contributes to the mortality of patients through ventilator induced lung injury. Extracellular Cyclophilin A is an emerging inflammatory mediator and metalloproteinase inducer, and the gene responsible for its expression has recently been linked to COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES: Here we explore the involvement of extracellular Cyclophilin A in the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury. METHODS: Mice were ventilated with low or high tidal volume for up to 3 hours, with or without blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling, and lung injury and inflammation were evaluated. Human primary alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to in vitro stretch to explore the cellular source of extracellular Cyclophilin A, and Cyclophilin A levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, to evaluate clinical relevance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High tidal volume ventilation in mice provoked a rapid increase in soluble Cyclophilin A levels in the alveolar space, but not plasma. In vivo ventilation and in vitro stretch experiments indicated alveolar epithelium as the likely major source. In vivo blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling substantially attenuated physiological dysfunction, macrophage activation and matrix metalloproteinases. Finally, we found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome showed markedly elevated levels of extracellular Cyclophilin A within bronchoalveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophilin A is upregulated within the lungs of injuriously ventilated mice (and critically ill patients), where it plays a significant role in lung injury. Extracellular Cyclophilin A represents an exciting novel target for pharmacological intervention.","output":"Secreted Extracellular Cyclophilin A is a Novel Mediator of Ventilator Induced Lung Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent work has shown the potential of the use of audio data in screening for COVID-19. However, very little exploration has been done of monitoring disease progression, especially recovery in COVID-19 through audio. Tracking disease progression characteristics and patterns of recovery could lead to tremendous insights and more timely treatment or treatment adjustment, as well as better resources management in health care systems. The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of longitudinal audio dynamics for COVID-19 monitoring using sequential deep learning techniques, focusing on prediction of disease progression and, especially, recovery trend prediction. We analysed crowdsourced respiratory audio data from 212 individuals over 5 days to 385 days, alongside their self-reported COVID-19 test results. We first explore the benefits of capturing longitudinal dynamics of audio biomarkers for COVID-19 detection. The strong performance, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity of 0.70, supports the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods that do not leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examine the predicted disease progression trajectory, which displays high consistency with the longitudinal test results with a correlation of 0.76 in the test cohort, and 0.86 in a subset of the test cohort with 12 participants who report disease recovery.

It follows that the UVI forecasting models are useful tools for such decision-making. In this study, a model for computationally-efficient data-driven forecasting of diffuse and global very short-term reactive (VSTR) (10-min lead-time) UVI, enhanced by drawing on the solar zenith angle (s) data, was developed using an extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. An ELM algorithm typically serves to address complex and ill-defined forecasting problems. UV spectroradiometer situated in Toowoomba, Australia measured daily cycles (0500-1700h) of UVI over the austral summer period. After trialling activations functions based on sine, hard limit, logarithmic and tangent sigmoid and triangular and radial basis networks for best results, an optimal ELM architecture utilising logarithmic sigmoid equation in hidden layer, with lagged combinations of s as the predictor data was developed. ELM's performance was evaluated using statistical metrics: correlation coefficient (r), Willmott's Index (WI), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (ENS), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) between observed and forecasted UVI. Using these metrics, the ELM model's performance was compared to that of existing methods: multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), M5 Model Tree, and a semi-empirical (Pro6UV) clear sky model. Based on RMSE and MAE values, the ELM model (0.255, 0.346, respectively) outperformed the MARS (0.310, 0.438) and M5 Model Tree (0.346, 0.466) models. Concurring with these metrics, the Willmott's Index for the ELM, MARS and M5 Model Tree models were 0.966, 0.942 and 0.934, respectively. About 57% of the ELM model's absolute errors were small in magnitude (0.25), whereas the MARS and M5 Model Tree models generated 53% and 48% of such errors, respectively, indicating the latter models' errors to be distributed in larger magnitude error range. In terms of peak global UVI forecasting, with half the level of error, the ELM model outperformed MARS and M5 Model Tree. A comparison of the magnitude of hourly-cumulated errors of 10-min lead time forecasts for diffuse and global UVI highlighted ELM model's greater accuracy compared to MARS, M5 Model Tree or Pro6UV models. This confirmed the versatility of an ELM model drawing on sdata for VSTR forecasting of UVI at near real-time horizon. When applied to the goal of enhancing expert systems, ELM-based accurate forecasts capable of reacting quickly to measured conditions can enhance real-time exposure advice for the public, mitigating the potential for solar UV-exposure-related disease.","output":"Very short-term reactive forecasting of the solar ultraviolet index using an extreme learning machine integrated with the solar zenith angle."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: to assess the changes in prevalence, incidence and hospitalisation rates during the first four months of 2020, compared to the same period of 2019, in Friuli Venezia Giulia Mental Health Departments (MHDs); to analyse the features of MHDs patients tested for Sars-Cov-2, and to monitor whether MHDs applied and adhered to regional recommendations. Methods: Observational study using MHDs' administrative data and individual data on suspected and positive cases of Sars-Cov-2. Adherence to recommentations was assessed using 21 indicators. Changes in rates were calculated by Poisson regression analysis, while the Fisher exact test was used for assessing differences between suspected and positive cases. Results: The decrease in voluntary admission rates on 100,000 inhabitants in hospital services was significantly larger from January to April 2020, compared to the same period of 2019 (P<0.001), while no other data showed a significant decrease.

The MHDs mostly complied with the indicators in the month after the publication of recommendations. Conclusions: Outpatient services continued to work normally during the emergency, while hospital services decreased their activities. A low number of positive cases was found among MHDs' users, which might be linked to a rapid reconversion of services, with an extensive use of home visits and telepsychiatry.

This retrospective study included patients with NSCLC treated with a minimum of one dose of ICIs at the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital and Shanxi Bethune Hospital from 2016 to 2020. Baseline characteristics, treatment details, and adverse events were evaluated. The Student's t-test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression were used to identify risk factors for irAEs to establish a prediction model. A total of 667 patients were included; the median age was 62.47 (range, 27-85) years. Most patients were men (74.5%) with stage IV cancer (93.1%). The incidence of any grade and grade 3 or higher irAEs was 21.74% (145/667) and 5.25% (35/667), respectively. A total of 145 patients experienced 220 irAEs; the incidence of endocrinopathies (35.91%, 79/220) was highest in all grade irAEs, while that of pneumonitis (7.73%, 17/220) was the highest in grade 3 or higher irAEs.

Within the United States, metropolitan areas that were hit earliest with the pandemic and reacted with scientifically based health policy were able to contain the virus by late spring. For other areas that kept businesses open, the first wave in the United States hit in mid-summer. As the weather turns colder, universities resume classes, and people tire of lockdowns, a second wave is ascending in both metropolitan and rural areas. It becomes more obvious that additional SARS-CoV-2 surveillance is needed at the local level to track recent shifts in the pandemic, rates of increase, and persistence. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to provide advanced surveillance metrics for COVID-19 transmission that account for speed, acceleration, jerk and persistence, and weekly shifts, to better understand and manage risk in metropolitan areas. Existing surveillance measures coupled with our dynamic metrics of transmission will inform health policy to control the COVID-19 pandemic until, and after, an effective vaccine is developed. Here, we provide values for novel indicators to measure COVID-19 transmission at the metropolitan area level. METHODS: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 260 days of COVID-19 data from public health registries. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in the 25 largest US metropolitan areas as a function of the prior number of cases and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel data model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. RESULTS: Minneapolis and Chicago have the greatest average number of daily new positive results per standardized 100,000 population (which we refer to as speed). Extreme behavior in Minneapolis showed an increase in speed from 17 to 30 (67%) in 1 week. The jerk and acceleration calculated for these areas also showed extreme behavior. The dynamic panel data model shows that Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit have the largest persistence effects, meaning that new cases pertaining to a specific week are statistically attributable to new cases from the prior week. CONCLUSIONS: Three of the metropolitan areas with historically early and harsh winters have the highest persistence effects out of the top 25 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States at the beginning of their cold weather season. With these persistence effects, and with indoor activities becoming more popular as the weather gets colder, stringent COVID-19 regulations will be more important than ever to flatten the second wave of the pandemic. As colder weather grips more of the nation, southern metropolitan areas may also see large spikes in the number of cases.","output":"Dynamic Panel Data Modeling and Surveillance of COVID-19 in Metropolitan Areas in the United States: Longitudinal Trend Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe two previously healthy children who were hospitalized in the same period in different departments of our University with clinical signs of Kawasaki syndrome, which were treated with intravenous immunoglobulins and acetylsalicylic acid: in both cases, Coxsackie virus infection was concurrently demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and complement fixation test identified antibodies to serotype B3.

The study aimed to investigate the influence of home quarantine on axial length in myopic children with OK treatment. METHODS: Axial length measurements during and before COVID-19 home confinement were retrospectively collected from the myopic children treated with OK, and the children were prospectively followed up after finishing the quarantine.

Influencing factors for monthly axial length growth during confinement were analysed. RESULTS: Ninety-two myopic children with OK treatment were enrolled in this study. In the full dataset, covariates adjusted (gender, time interval, baseline axial length and age) monthly axial length growth during confinement was not significantly different from that before (P = 0.213) or after the home confinement (P = 1.000). Multiple linear regression showed that the monthly axial length growth during confinement was negatively correlated with age (P = 0.002). Subgroup analysis based on age demonstrated that the adjusted monthly axial length growth was not significantly different among three periods (P > 0.05) for younger children. For children older than 12-year-old, the adjusted monthly axial length growth during home confinement was significantly slower than before the confinement (P = 0.011), but not the monthly axial length growth after the confinement (P = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 home confinement does not increase the myopic axial length elongation in children with OK treatment.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 home confinement on axial length in myopic children undergoing orthokeratology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We suggested a unified system with core components of data augmentation, ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-50, cost-sensitive loss, deep ensemble learning, and uncertainty estimation to quickly and consistently detect COVID-19 using acoustic evidence.

We analyze job descriptions from vacancy postings on the largest Austrian job board to classify whether employers offer the option to telework to new hires. Our results show that the crisis has substantially increased the scope for remote work. About one year after the onset of the crisis, employers were 2-3 times as likely to explicitly offer such an option relative to levels before the pandemic. This effect is particularly strong for jobs that require at least a degree from a higher secondary school. Accounting for changes in vacancies by occupations and firms, we find that the impact is neither driven by an increase in the demand for teleworkable occupations nor by an increase in vacancies at teleworking-friendly firms. Although many social distancing restrictions were relaxed again during the summer of 2020, the effect persists throughout the first year of the crisis, suggesting that the pandemic may have long-lasting effects on remote working arrangements. To test the robustness of our results, we merge two external occupation-level teleworking measures to our sample. Both measures are highly correlated with our measure and yield comparable estimates for the impact of the pandemic on vacancies for teleworkable occupations.","output":"Are Remote Work Options the New Standard?

METHODS This was a retrospective case-control study of patients with RC operated between 12/2013 and 12/2017 in Ruijin Hospital North, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. In total, 177 patients who underwent CLS and 51 who underwent SILS met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching method (PSM). RESULTS Compared with the CLS group, the SILS group showed shorter operation time [105 (40) vs. 125 (55) min, P = 0.045], shorter total incision length [4 (1) vs. 6.5 (1.5) cm, P < 0.001], lower VAS score on POD2 [1 (1) vs. 2 (1), P < 0.001], shorter time to soft diet [7 (1) vs. 8 (2) days, P = 0.048], and shorter length of hospital stay [9 (2) vs. 11 (3) days, P < 0.001]. The postoperative complications were similar between two groups [1(2%) vs. 5 (9.8%), P = 0.205]. No readmissions or mortality in either group occurred within 30 days of surgery. All 102 specimens met the requirements of TME. No significant differences were observed in the pathologic outcomes between the two groups. The median follow-up period was 32.6 months in the SILS group and 36.8 months in the CLS group (P = 0.053).

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) began mitigation measures before the first case appeared on March 2, 2020, disrupting daily life in a culture that is centered on family life. We sought to assess the psychological impacts of the pandemic on this culturally unique region to see if it affected as many as other reported places in the world. Methods A self-reporting online questionnaire in Arabic was distributed through social media applications and a convenience sample of 942 participants 18 years of age living in the Jazan region was selected. The questionnaire included socio-demographics, economic status, chronic medical conditions, focus on and knowledge of COVID-19, and the patient health questionnaire-9 scale (PHQ-9) for depression metrics. The data in this study were analyzed using descriptive analysis of participant characteristics, followed by Chi-square testing to compare reported depression related to each variable. Finally, to control for confounding factors, we applied multivariate logistic regression to find an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% CI. Results In the Jazan region, the rate of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic was nearly 26%. There are several significant determinants associated with higher rates of depression in descending order: those with chronic diseases were 160% higher than those without; those with a history of mental illness were 150% higher; participants who focused excessively on the pandemic 3 hours daily were 130% higher; participants who were divorced or widowed were 120% higher than singles; females were 87% higher; those under age 40 were 57% higher; students were 50% higher; those reporting low incomes were 40% higher than those with moderate incomes and 60% higher than those with high incomes. Conclusions Strategies need to be devised to protect vulnerable groups of participants from mental health effects, including depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. This will require the collaboration of various institutions, such as schools and others, to provide support for education and mental health. Future research should be aimed at determining the reasons for this higher vulnerability of some groups.","output":"The Prevalence of Depression and Related Factors During the COVID-19 Pandemic Among the General Population of the Jazan Region of Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work is motivated by the recent worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). When an epidemiological disease is prevalent, estimating the case fatality rate, the proportion of deaths out of the total cases, accurately and quickly is important as the case fatality rate is one of the crucial indicators of the risk of a disease. In this work, we propose an alternative estimator of the case fatality rate that provides more accurate estimate during an outbreak by reducing the downward bias (underestimation) of the naive CFR, the proportion of deaths out of confirmed cases at each time point, which is the most commonly used estimator due to the simplicity. The proposed estimator is designed to achieve the availability of real-time update by using the commonly reported quantities, the numbers of confirmed, cured, deceased cases, in the computation. To enhance the accuracy, the proposed estimator adapts a stratification, which allows the estimator to use information from heterogeneous strata separately. By the COVID-19 cases of China, South Korea and the United States, we numerically show the proposed stratification-based estimator plays a role of providing an early warning about the severity of a epidemiological disease that estimates the final case fatality rate accurately and shows faster convergence to the final case fatality rate.","output":"Estimation of the case fatality rate based on stratification for the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research paper revolves around Cybersecurity and supports why it is important for an organization to invest in Cybersecurity.

Herein, we report a method that may be useful for prescreening the general population in a minimally invasive way using a swallowable, re-expandable, ultra-absorbable, and retrievable nanofiber cuboid and sphere produced by electrospinning, gas-foaming, coating, and crosslinking.

In contrast, unexpanded semicircular and square nanofiber membranes showed <500% of their dry mass. Moreover, the swallowable sphere and cuboid were able to collect and release more bacteria, viruses, and cells/tissues from solutions as compared with unexpanded scaffolds. In addition to that, an expanded sphere shows higher cell collection capacity from the esophagus inner wall as compared with the unexpanded nanofiber membrane. Taken together, the nanofiber capsules developed in this study could provide a minimally invasive method of collecting biological samples from the duodenal, gastric, esophagus, and oropharyngeal sites, potentially leading to timely and accurate diagnosis of many diseases.

OBJECTIVES: To understand how resilience, access to personal care attendants (PCAs) and medical supplies, and concerns about medical rationing, finances, and social isolation are related to overall and mental health in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: Community dwelling adults (N = 187) with SCI. METHODS: Data were collected online between May 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020. Outcomes were overall and mental health, depression and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life (QoL). Predictors were resilience, access to PCAs and medical supplies, and concerns about medical rationing, finances, and social isolation. RESULTS: Incomplete injury, concern about medical rationing, medical supply disruption, and social isolation predicted a greater perceived impact of the pandemic on overall heath. Younger age, decreased resilience, and concern about medical rationing and social isolation predicted greater perceived impact of the pandemic on mental health. Decreased resilience and concern about medical rationing and finances predicted increased anxiety symptoms. Incomplete injury, believing that medical rationing was occurring, decreased resilience, and concern about finances and social isolation predicted increased depressive symptoms. Decreased resilience and concern about finances, medical rationing, and social isolation predicted lower QoL. CONCLUSIONS: The negative effects of the pandemic on the overall and mental health of individuals with SCI may be ameliorated by resilience.

DATA SOURCE: PubMed, searched through October 19, 2020. Search terms included SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission. STUDY SELECTION: All articles with original data for estimating household secondary attack rate were included. Case reports focusing on individual households and studies of close contacts that did not report secondary attack rates for household members were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Meta-analyses were done using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model to yield a point estimate and 95% CI for secondary attack rate for each subgroup analyzed, with a random effect for each study. To make comparisons across exposure types, study was treated as a random effect, and exposure type was a fixed moderator. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by covariates (ie, household or family contact, index case symptom status, adult or child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, adult or child index cases, index case sex, number of contacts in household) and for other coronaviruses.

Two anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 80R and 362 are known to bind to epitopes on the spike protein receptor\\\\binding domain (RBD) and neutralize the virus. To investigate this further and hypothesize structures for potentially more effective antibodies, undergraduate students cooperated in teams as part of the CREST (Connecting Researchers, Educators, and STudents) Program with the Center for Biological Modeling. Working collaboratively, students from eight universities nationwide applied their knowledge to build 3\\\\D printed models to explain a particular protein\\\\based molecular story using crystal structures of proteins described in the literature. The Nova Southeastern University (NSU) CREST team modeled and compared the 80R antibody that binds to SARS\\\\CoV\\\\1 and the MAb362 antibody that can bind to both SARS\\\\CoV\\\\1 and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2. Students developed skills with protein visualization software including Pymol and Jmol to design models which showed the 80R and 362 antibodies binding to the RBD of the corresponding proteins. By studying the point mutation differences between the two antibodies (80R and 362), a potentially more universal antibody (named NSU1 in this study) was modeled. This hypothesized antibody was expected to bind more effectively to future mutations in the SARS spike protein. At the binding interface between these antibodies and the SARS spike protein, MAb362 mutations trend smaller and less polar including: Arg149Ser, Asn151Ser, Asp170Gly, and Trp213Ser. Due to the trend of smaller amino acids appearing in the MAb362 binding interface, it was hypothesized that more space in this area could allow antibodies to be more resistant to future SARS\\\\CoV spike protein structure variations. NSU1 was modeled based on MAb362 with the following four additional mutations: Asp103Gly, Trp104Leu, Gly170Ser, and Arg211Val. All of these except for Gly170 are mutations that decreased size and polarity of amino acid residues within the binding interface. Position 170 is Asp on the 80R structure and thus a mutation to Ser is still expected to maintain this trend of smaller residues in the antibody. Due to the additional space created due to these amino acid substitutions in the binding region between the antibody and RBD of the spike protein, NSU1 was predicted to be more resistant to spike protein mutations. These models allowed for deeper understanding of the impact that mutations in antibodies can have on binding interactions with viral proteins.

Mothers as caregivers have to put in more effort to care for children during the pandemic so that stress levels also increase. This study aimed to see a picture of social support, stress and attachment to mothers with children with autism in a pandemic meeting. Participants in this study were 4 mothers who have children with autism. Sampling was done by convenience sampling. The method used is a qualitative method with a phenomenological design. The results shows that during the pandemic, the stress experienced by mothers with autism children who were received at a secondary assessment, understood their resources for coping and elicited emotional reactions such as anxiety that would develop rapidly. The attachment style of mothers with autism children is secure attachment based on the results of interviews, such as conducting joint interactions (meeting, playing, doing assignments, being responsive to needs and doing activities together) making necessary contact and adaptation to the pandemic. The description of social support during the pandemic of mothers with autistic children is a significant other, such as psychologists, baby sitters, and therapists. The main social support are direct assistance and information about the daily routine schedule that will be given to children with autism so that mothers with autistic children remain can carry out activities in a pandemic situation optimally.

We identified and characterized EVs from Entamoeba histolytica, a protozoan parasite and a human pathogen. Conditioned medium from amebic parasites contained particles consistent with the expected size and morphology of EVs. Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the EV proteome and showed that it was enriched in common exosome marker proteins including proteins associated with vesicle formation, cell-signaling, metabolism, and cytoskeletal proteins. Additionally, the EVs were found to selectively package small RNAs (sRNA), which were protected within the vesicles against RNase treatment. Sequencing analysis of the sRNA contained in EVs revealed that the majority were 27nt in size and represented a subset of the cellular antisense small RNA population that has previously been characterized in Entamoeba RNAi pathway proteins, including Argonaute were also present in amebic EVs. Interestingly, we found that the amebic EVs impact inter-cellular communication between parasites and altered encystation efficiency. EVs isolated from encysting parasites promoted encystation in other parasites whereas EVs from metabolically active trophozoites impeded encystation. Overall, the data reveals that Entamoeba secrete EVs that are similar in size and shape to previously characterized exosomes from other organisms and that these EVs contain a defined protein and small RNA cargo and have roles in intercellular communication amongst parasites and influence growth kinetics.","output":"Characterization of extracellular vesicles from Entamoeba histolytica identifies roles in intercellular communication that regulates parasite growth and development."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The outbreak of a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndromeCcoronavirus 2) has caused a global COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, resulting in millions of infections and thousands of deaths around the world. There is currently no drug or vaccine for COVID-19, but it has been revealed that some commercially available drugs are promising, at least for treating symptoms. Among them, remdesivir, which can block the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in old SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses, has been prescribed to COVID-19 patients in many countries. A recent experiment showed that remdesivir binds to SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibition constant of M, but the exact target has not been reported. In this work, combining molecular docking, steered molecular dynamics, and umbrella sampling, we examined its binding affinity to two targets including the main protease (Mpro), also known as 3C-like protease, and RdRp. We showed that remdesivir binds to Mpro slightly weaker than to RdRp, and the corresponding inhibition constants, consistent with the experiment, fall to the M range. The binding mechanisms of remdesivir to two targets differ in that the electrostatic interaction is the main force in stabilizing the RdRpCremdesivir complex, while the van der Waals interaction dominates in the MproCremdesivir case. Our result indicates that remdesivir can target not only RdRp but also Mpro, which can be invoked to explain why this drug is effective in treating COVID-19.

However, we still struggle to engage medical students in understanding the social and environmental determinants of health, the value population level data and public health interventions. Our approach: Third year medical students carried out a community diagnosis project where they evaluated quantitative, qualitative and observational data for the community in which they were living. They examined Public Health England fingertips data to choose a topic, gathered and evaluated further information, considered potential solutions, and created a 5-min presentation for their small group tutorial. The students were supported by GP tutors from East London, allowing a novel role for GP tutors to teach on this topic. EVALUATION GP tutors and students gave positive feedback on both the design and delivery of the module. Students frequently made the link between their previous theoretical teaching in public health and the application of it in the GPCD module, appreciated the value of investigating their local area and commented upon the opportunity to consider the wider determinants of health. The GP tutors felt the project gave the students an insight into the lived realities of others. CONCLUSIONS This module was an effective cross-collaborative approach between primary care and public health.

Patient characteristics, inserted tube size, risk of additional tube, and complications were evaluated. Eighty-six chest tubes were placed in 64 patients. Sixty-seven tubes were placed initially, and 19 additionally, which was significantly smaller than the initial tube. Initial tube size was 28 Fr in 38 and <28 Fr in 28 patients. Indications were pneumothorax (n=24), hemothorax (n=7), and hemopneumothorax (n=36). Initial tube size was not related to sex, BMI, BSA, indication, ISS, RTS, chest AIS, or respiratory status. An additional tube was placed in the same thoracic cavity for residual pneumothorax (n=13), hemothorax (n=1), hemopneumothorax (n=1), and inappropriate extrapleural placement (n=3). Risk of additional tube placement was not significantly different depending on tube size. No additional tube was placed for tube occlusion or surgical intervention for residual clotted hemothorax. Emergency physicians did not choose tube size depending on patient sex, body size, or situation.

With the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic substantially interrupting control programmes worldwide, there are now mounting fears that decades of progress in controlling global parasitic infections will be undone. With Covid-19 moreover exposing deep vulnerabilities in the global health system, the current moment presents a watershed opportunity to plan future efforts to reduce the global morbidity and mortality associated with human parasitic infections. In this chapter, we first provide a brief epidemiologic overview of the progress that has been made towards the control of parasitic diseases between 1990 and 2019, contrasting these fragile gains with the anticipated losses as a result of Covid-19. We then argue that the complementary aspirations of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the World Health Organization (WHO)s 2030 targets for parasitic disease control may be achieved by aligning programme objectives within the One Health paradigm, recognizing the interdependence between humans, animals, and the environment. In so doing, we note that while the WHO remains the preeminent international institution to address some of these transdisciplinary concerns, its underlying challenges with funding, authority, and capacity are likely to reverberate if left unaddressed. To this end, we conclude by reimagining how models of multisectoral global health governancecombining the WHO's normative and technical leadership with greater support in allied policy-making areascan help sustain future malaria and NTD elimination efforts.","output":"Towards global control of parasitic diseases in the Covid-19 era: One Health and the future of multisectoral global health governance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged at the end of 2019 and by mid-June 2020, the virus has spread to at least 215 countries, caused more than 8,000,000 confirmed infections and over 450,000 deaths, and overwhelmed healthcare systems worldwide. Like SARS-CoV, which emerged in 2002 and caused a similar disease, SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus. Both viruses use human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as a receptor to enter cells. However, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein has a novel insertion that generates a putative furin cleavage signal and this has been postulated to expand the host range. Two low passage (P) strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Wash1: P4 and Munich: P1) were cultured twice in Vero-E6 cells and characterized virologically. Sanger and MinION sequencing demonstrated significant deletions in the furin cleavage signal of Wash1: P6 and minor variants in the Munich: P3 strain. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero-E6 cell lysates was inefficient even when an intact furin cleavage signal was present. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated the S glycoprotein reached the cell surface. Since the S protein is a major antigenic target for the development of neutralizing antibodies we investigated the development of neutralizing antibody titers in serial serum samples obtained from COVID-19 human patients. These were comparable regardless of the presence of an intact or deleted furin cleavage signal. These studies illustrate the need to characterize virus stocks meticulously prior to performing either in vitro or in vivo pathogenesis studies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 growth, furin-cleavage-site adaptation and neutralization using serum from acutely infected, hospitalized COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study explored patterns of abuse, self-harm and thoughts of suicide/self-harm in the UK during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from the COVID-19 Social Study (n=44 775), a non-probability sample weighted to population proportions.

Opo is an interaction sensor that captures sensor-to-sensor interactions through ultrasonic frequencies, which correspond to face-to-face contacts between study participants. Opos were additionally used to measure hand hygiene events by affixing sensors to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers. Bluetooth beacons were used in conjunction with a smartphone application and recorded proximity contacts between study participants. Participants in two office sites were followed for one-week in their workplace in March 2018. Contact patterns varied by time of day and day of the week. Face-to-face contacts were of shorter mean duration than proximity contacts. Supervisors had fewer proximity contacts but more face-to-face contacts than non-supervisors. Self-reported hand hygiene was substantively higher than sensor-collected hand hygiene events and duration of hand washing events was short (median: 9 seconds, range: 2.5-33 seconds). Given that office settings are key environments in which working age populations spend a large proportion of their time and interactions, a better characterization of empirical social networks and hand hygiene behaviors for workplace interactions are needed to mitigate outbreaks and prepare for pandemics. Our study demonstrates that implementing sensor technologies for tracking interactions and behaviors in offices is feasible and can provide new insights into real-world social networks and hygiene practices. We identified key social interactions, variability in hand hygiene, and differences in interactions by workplace roles.

Health-seeking behaviour is influenced by adequate knowledge of the condition. However, current data on pregnant womens knowledge of the condition and health-seeking behaviour are relatively scant in Ghana and has not been previously studied in the Central Region where hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was the leading cause of maternal mortality from 2016 to 2018. The study sought to generate data to fill this knowledge gap. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 404 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital from 1 April to 30 September 2020. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, including age, level of education and parity, and knowledge of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including its risk factors, clinical presentations and complications, were collected using structured questionnaires. The outcome variable, knowledge of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, was a composite variable categorized as adequate and inadequate knowledge. Descriptive statistics were generated and association between independent and outcome variables were explored using chi-square and Fishers exact tests and logistic regression methods. RESULTS: Sixty-two participants (15.4%) showed adequate knowledge of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. About 62% (251/404) of respondents had heard about hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Of those who had heard of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, 29.4% (72/245) correctly indicated the condition was underlined by hypertension in pregnancy ? 20 weeks gestation. Women with tertiary education were six times more likely to have adequate hypertensive disorders of pregnancy knowledge than those with basic education. Women with parity 1C4 were 52% less likely to have adequate knowledge compared to nulliparous women. CONCLUSION: The remarkably low proportion of pregnant women with adequate knowledge of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the study is worrisome because of its potential adverse implication for the health of mothers and their babies.

Fewer PwO (58%) than HCPs (85%) perceived obesity as a chronic disease. Most PwO (81%) thought that weight loss was their own responsibility, and waited a considerable time before seeking support from their HCP (mean 6 years). Most PwO (64%) had made one or more serious weight loss attempt in the past. In contrast, a serious attempt at losing weight was reported by HCPs for just 21% of their patients.

To tackle the above issues, in this paper, we consider modeling the user-item interactions and social relations simultaneously and propose a novel metric learning-based model called RML-DGATs. Specifically, relations in two domains are modeled as two types of relation vectors, with which each user can be regarded as being translated to both multiple item-aware and social-aware representations. Then we model the relation vectors by neighborhood interactions with two carefully designed dual GATs to fully encode the neighborhood information. Finally, the two parts are jointly trained under a dual metric learning framework. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline by 1.91% to 4.74% on three metrics for top-N recommendation and the performance gains are more significant under the cold-start scenarios.","output":"Relational Metric Learning with Dual Graph Attention Networks for Social Recommendation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a seasonal disease that has an enormous burden on health systems across the world. RSV disease manifestations in children range from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. In South Africa, the seasonality of RSV disease causing both upper and lower respiratory tract illness is well documented. OBJECTIVES: To describe the incidence of RSV bronchiolitis among patients 24 months of age who presented to a tertiary institution with a diagnosed viral bronchiolitis over a 4-year period. Secondary aims included determining: (i) the risk factors for the development of RSV bronchiolitis; (ii) the fatality rates and risk factors associated with mortality; (iii) the correlation with c-reactive protein values and risk of comorbid bacterial infection; and (iv) the impact of seasonality on RSV incidence. METHODS: A retrospective chart-based analysis of laboratory-confirmed RSV cases in children 24 months, presenting to Steve Biko Academic Hospital from January 2013 to December 2016, was undertaken. Epidemiology, risk factors and local weather data were collected as part of the analysis. RESULTS: During the 4-year period, a total of 1 127 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) was collected. RSV was isolated from 162 NPAs by either immunofluorescence (84%) or polymerase chain reaction (16%). Of the 162 patients with RSV bronchiolitis, 131 (80.9%) had a known HIV status. Only 2 (1.5%) of the patients whose status was known were HIV-infected; 26 (19.8%) were HIV-exposed and confirmed negative; and 103 (78.6%) HIV-unexposed. Forty-nine patients (30.2%) with RSV required intensive care unit (ICU, either paediatric or neonatal) admission. Thirty-four (69.4%) of these were <6 months old. Prematurity (27.8%) and cardiac lesions (13%) were the most common risk factors for acquiring the disease identified in patients with RSV bronchiolitis. CONCLUSION: RSV is still a commonly detected virus among infants who are admitted for bronchiolitis. Significant risk factors associated with admission due to RSV bronchiolitis were prematurity, being <6 months of age and congenital cardiac disease. Male gender and HIV status did not appear to increase the risk of RSV bronchiolitis. In fact, HIV seems to have a protective effect against specifically RSV bronchiolitis in children <2 years of age. Young babies, especially premature infants with RSV bronchiolitis, are at considerable risk of requiring ICU admission, which leads to a significant increase in admission costs.","output":"The epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus: A retrospective review from Steve Biko Academic Hospital 2013 - 2016"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To qualify as a JAIS AE, an individual must be an associate-level (or the equivalent) faculty member and must have published at least two publications in such Journals as JAIS, MIS Quarterly, Information Systems Research, and the Journal of Management Information Systems The second research article-\\"Reinforcing Effects of Formal Control Enactment in Complex IT Projects\\" by Gloria Liu and Cecil Chua-is a case study of a large manufacturing organization that designs and manufactures wireless communication products embedding software and hardware to enable new product functionality In the third research article in this issue-\\"Predicting Intention to Participate in Socially Responsible Collection Action in a Social Networking Website Group\\" by Victor Chen, Timothy Hiele, Adam Kryszak, and William Ross-the authors discuss the notion of \\"we-intention,\\" which highlights individuals' commitment to group activities Drawing on several theoretical concepts from the belief-desire-intention model and social influence theory and data from a sample of Polish soccer fans, the authors hypothesize and test the relationships of various social influence processes and perceived corporate social responsibility on desire and on we-intention to use social networking systems for collection action","output":"Editorial Reflections: Lockdowns, Slow Downs, and Some Introductions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The objectives of this review were to map and summarize evidence regarding advanced practice nursing roles in Arab countries located in the Eastern Mediterranean region. INTRODUCTION Many countries have reported an increase in the number and types of advanced practice nursing roles as research demonstrating their positive impact on patient and health system outcomes continues to accumulate. There is international evidence that the achievement of these outcomes depends on the effective implementation of advanced practice nursing roles at the organizational and country levels. A comprehensive review of the status of advanced practice nursing role implementation in Arab countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region has not been conducted. INCLUSION CRITERIA Eligible studies included advanced practice nursing roles (including, but not limited to, nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists) in Arab countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Studies were considered if they focused on role development, titles, entry-level education, regulation and scope of practice, and facilitators and barriers to role implementation. METHODS A comprehensive systematic search was completed for both published and non-published literature. The databases searched included CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Nursing and Allied Health Database, and Scopus. Gray literature was searched using websites such as Google Scholar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, International Council of Nurses, World Health Organization regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean region, and websites of nursing associations and Ministries of Health in Arab countries. The search included literature published in Arabic and English from the inception of the databases to August 2020. RESULTS A total of 35 articles were included, the majority (n = 24) of which were published from 2010 onward. Ten of the included studies were empirical research papers that used qualitative and quantitative research designs. Advanced practice nursing role development is still in its infancy in most of the Arab countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region and can be described as slowly and steadily evolving. The main driving forces for the implementation of the roles in this region included a shortage of physicians both in number and specialties, the emergence of chronic diseases due to lifestyle changes, the desire to have more cost-effective primary care, and to advance nursing as a profession. Clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners are the most common titles for the advanced nursing roles practiced in the region. Some advanced practice nursing roles stipulated a master's degree as a minimum requirement, while others required a 12-month in-house training program. Oman is the only Arab country that authorizes nurse practitioners to prescribe pre-set medications. The common barriers to advanced practice nursing role implementation included a lack of recognition of roles at national levels, role ambiguity, lack of clear scope of practice, resistance from male physicians, low involvement of nurses in policy-making, and low status of nursing as a profession. CONCLUSION The successful implementation and sustainment of advanced practice nursing roles in Arab countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region requires foundational work, including development of definitions, educational standards, regulations, and a clear scope of practice.

The complex virology of COVID-19 may provide multiple potential target points for antiviral therapy, and vaccines; extensive global research is underway to exploit these potential opportunities. The complex pathophysiology, pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, and immune mediated effects such as cytokine storm, make medical management more challenging than many viral illnesses. Non medication based interventions including hyperbaric oxygen (HBOT), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), aggressive dialysis, and other interventions, all with various degrees of clinical success, and will be discussed in this section. Several antivirals approved for other clinical indications were studied for repurposing against COVID-19, which we highlight, again with varying results. In addition to therapeutics, concern was raised over potential risks associated with ACE inhibitors and ARB use, which is presented. Often the timing of the medication determined its clinical benefit as will be discussed with dexamethasone and other medications. As such, this Therapeutics Review will present prominent and/or promising medications and therapeutic approaches with the caveats that 1. To date, none are FDA approved beyond emergency use authorization (EUA), and 2. Although a comprehensive look at various classes of interventions, it is by no means a complete list of every compound trialed against COVID-19. Recognizing the knowledge basis upon which we treat COVID-19 patients, develop therapeutics, and vaccines continues to evolve as new information is presented, every effort nevertheless has been made to provide as timely information as possible. It is hoped that the information shared can help guide the clinician in terms of potential options to treat this complex group of patients.","output":"COVID-19: Therapeutics and interventions currently under consideration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is a commonly used antigen for serology assays critical to determining the extent of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the population. Different versions of the RBD protein have been developed and utilized in assays, with higher sensitivity attributed to particular forms of the protein. To improve the yield of these high-sensitivity forms of RBD and support the increased demand for this antigen in serology assays, we investigated several protein expression variables including DNA elements such as promoters and signal peptides, cell culture expression parameters, and purification processes. Through this investigation, we developed a simplified and robust purification strategy that consistently resulted in high levels of the high-sensitivity form of RBD and demonstrated that a carboxyterminal tag is responsible for the increased sensitivity in the ELISA. These improved reagents and processes produce high-quality proteins which are functional in serology assays and can be used to investigate seropositivity to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Improved production of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) for serology assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prescription of physical activity (PA) in clinical care has been advocated worldwide. This \\"exercise is medicine\\" (E=M) concept can be used to prevent, manage, and cure various lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Due to several challenges, E=M is not yet routinely implemented in clinical care. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the rationale and design of the Physicians Implement Exercise = Medicine (PIE=M) study, which aims to facilitate the implementation of E=M in hospital care. METHODS: PIE=M consists of 3 interrelated work packages. First, levels and determinants of PA in different patient and healthy populations will be investigated using existing cohort data. The current implementation status, facilitators, and barriers of E=M will also be investigated using a mixed-methods approach among clinicians of participating departments from 2 diverse university medical centers (both located in a city, but one serving an urban population and one serving a more rural population). Implementation strategies will be connected to these barriers and facilitators using a systematic implementation mapping approach. Second, a generic E=M tool will be developed that will provide tailored PA prescription and referral. Requirements for this tool will be investigated among clinicians and department managers. The tool will be developed using an iterative design process in which all stakeholders reflect on the design of the E=M tool. Third, we will pilot-implement the set of implementation strategies, including the E=M tool, to test its feasibility in routine care of clinicians in these 2 university medical centers. An extensive learning process evaluation will be performed among clinicians, department managers, lifestyle coaches, and patients using a mixed-methods design based on the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: This project was approved and funded by the Dutch grant provider ZonMW in April 2018. The project started in September 2018 and continues until December 2020 (depending on the course of the COVID-19 crisis). All data from the first work package have been collected and analyzed and are expected to be published in 2021. Results of the second work package are described. The manuscript is expected to be published in 2021. The third work package is currently being conducted in clinical practice in 4 departments of 2 university medical hospitals among clinicians, lifestyle coaches, hospital managers, and patients. Results are expected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The PIE=M project addresses the potential of providing patients with PA advice to prevent and manage chronic disease, improve recovery, and enable healthy ageing by developing E=M implementation strategies, including an E=M tool, in routine clinical care. The PIE=M project will result in a blueprint of implementation strategies, including an E=M screening and referral tool, which aims to improve E=M referral by clinicians to improve patients' health, while minimizing the burden on clinicians.","output":"Implementing Individually Tailored Prescription of Physical Activity in Routine Clinical Care: Protocol of the Physicians Implement Exercise = Medicine (PIE=M) Development and Implementation Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a pathology often found in patients with end-stage lung disease.

Hence this study sought to explore multisectoral dynamics in providing CAMH care in one resource-constrained South African district as a case study, towards informing the development of a model for district mental health plan and generating lessons for mental health systems strengthening to support CAMH services using the Health Systems Dynamics (HSD) framework. HSD provides a suitable structure for analysing interactions between different elements within the health system and other sectors. METHODS: Purposive sampling of 60 key informants was conducted to obtain an in-depth understanding of various stakeholders' experiences and perceptions of the available CAMH services in the district. The participants include stakeholders from the Departments of Health (DoH), Basic Education (DBE), community-based/non-governmental organizations and caregivers of children receiving CAMH care. The data was categorized according to the elements of the HSD framework. RESULTS: The HSD framework helped in identifying the components of the health systems that are necessary for CAMH service delivery. At a district level, the shortage of human resources, un-coordinated CAMH management system, lack of intersectoral collaboration and the low priority given to the CAMH system negatively impacts on the service providers' experiences of providing CAMH services. Services users' experiences of access to available CAMH services was negatively impacted by financial restrictions, low mental health literacy and stigmatization. Nevertheless, the study participants perceived the available CAMH specialists to be competent and dedicated to delivering quality services but will benefit from systems strengthening initiatives that can expand the workforce and equip non-specialists with the required skills, resources and adequate coordination. CONCLUSIONS: The need to develop the capacity of all the involved stakeholders in relation to CAMH services was imperative in the district. The need to create a mental health outreach team and equip teachers and caregivers with skills required to promote mental wellbeing, promptly identify CAMH conditions, refer appropriately and adhere to a management regimen was emphasized.","output":"Stakeholders' perceptions of child and adolescent mental health services in a South African district: a qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) originated in December 2019 and has now infected almost 5 million people in the United States In the spring of 2020, private laboratories and some hospitals began antibody testing despite limited evidence-based guidance METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who received SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing from May 14, 2020, to June 15, 2020, at a large academic medical center, 1 of the first in the United States to provide antibody testing capability to individual clinicians in order to identify clinician-described indications for antibody testing compared with current expert-based guidance from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) RESULTS: Of 444 individual antibody test results, the 2 most commonly described testing indications, apart from public health epidemiology studies (n = 223), were for patients with a now resolved COVID-19-compatible illness (n = 105) with no previous molecular testing and for asymptomatic patients believed to have had a past exposure to a person with COVID-19-compatible illness (n = 60) The rate of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing among those indications consistent with current IDSA and CDC guidance was 17% compared with 5% (P &lt; 0001) among those indications inconsistent with such guidance Testing inconsistent with current expert-based guidance accounted for almost half of testing costs CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a dissociation between clinician-described indications for testing and expert-based guidance and a significantly different rate of positive testing between these 2 groups Clinical curiosity and patient preference appear to have played a significant role in testing decisions and substantially contributed to testing costs","output":"Clinical Ordering Practices of the SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test at a Large Academic Medical Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Globalization and the openness of the world in case of emergencies can lead to a collapse in many areas and, as a result, to an imbalance of economic systems.

In the authors opinion, the most effective tool to manage reactively the learning process as a complex system is a feedback. In order that teachers have a real opportunity to control the quality of this process, it is necessary to identify objective criteria for the assessment of quality in the context of the differentiation of motivational attributes. In addition, this way provides for teaching staff a possibility to evaluate the effectiveness of a particular method to influence on the motivational criteria.

Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan-exported cases who left Wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events---Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)---and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that about 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop symptoms within 2 days of infection.","output":"BETS: The dangers of selection bias in early analyses of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practice(KAP) regarding the COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers (F-HCWs) working at different hospitals in Nepal and to identify the factors significantly associated with KAP. Methods: We used a web-based survey, and a convenience sampling method was adopted to collect data from 603 F-HCWs working at different hospitals in Nepal during the first week of June 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was utilized to assess the KAP perceived by the F-HCWs. It was divided into 4-parts consisting of 30-items, demographic characteristics (10-items), knowledge (10-items), attitude (5-items), and practice (5-items). It consisted of both multiple-choice questions and Likert scale items questionnaire. Results: Among the participants, 76% reported adequate knowledge, 54.7% reported positive attitude, and 78.9% reported appropriate practice. Statistically significant differences regarding the perceived level of knowledge among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, marital status, profession, work experience, source of information, infection prevention and control (IPC) training, and online course(p<0.05). Similarly, statistically significant differences regarding the attitude among F-HCWs were observed among independent variables, including age, gender, level of education, profession, and online course(p<0.05). Moreover, only 2-independent variables, including the profession and online course, showed statistically significant differences with practice(p<0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant association between knowledge, attitude and practice at the level of p=0.01. The factors significantly associated with adequate knowledge were male gender, nurse and doctor, websites and IPC training. Similarly, factors significantly associated with positive attitude were online course related to COVID-19 only. Moreover, factors significantly associated with appropriate practice were masters degree or above and online course related to COVID-19. Conclusions: F-HCWs reported adequate overall knowledge with a positive attitude and adopted the appropriate practice. The experienced F-HCWs with higher education and who received IPC training and online course regarding COVID-19 had better KAP. So, the stakeholders must arrange the educational programs and training for F-HCWs for better preparedness tackling with COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19: A National Survey on Perceived Level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practice among Frontline Healthcare Workers in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bu ?al??ma, 2020 ve 2021 y?llar?nda Scopus, ESCI ve/veya SSCI indekslerinde taranan ?nde gelen ?e?itli ara?t?rma dergilerinde yay?nlanan COVD-19 ile ilgili nicel, nitel ve karma ampirik tketici davran ara?t?rmalar?na y?nelik bibliyometrik analizleri g?rsel olarak sunmay? ama?lamaktad?r.

The forecast models were built by two different algorithms and their results have been compared. The relationship between epidemiological and environmental variables was particular to each of the three cities studied. Low solar radiation periods predicted in Manaus can guide managers to likely increase deaths due to COVID-19. In S?o Paulo, an increase in the mortality rate can be indicated by drought periods.

As part of a process to assess research priorities, we surveyed professionals in these settings to assess the impact of the pandemic and related research needs. Design Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey results. Setting and Participants 30 clinical and administrative staff working in post-acute and long-term care. Methods From June 24 through July 10, 2020, we used professional connections to disseminate an electronic survey to a convenience sample of clinical and administrative staff. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis of the data. Results We identified four themes, related to (1) rapid changes in care delivery, (2) negative impact on patients motivation and physical function, (3) new access barriers and increased costs, and (4) uncertainty about sustaining changes in delivery and payment. Rapid changes: Respondents described how infection control policies and practices shifted rehabilitation from group sessions and communal gyms to the bedside and telehealth. Negative impact: Respondents felt that patients isolation, particularly in residential care settings, affected their motivation for rehabilitation and their physical function. Access and costs: Respondents expressed concerns about increased costs (e.g., for personal protective equipment) and decreased patient volume, as well as access issues. Uncertainty: At the same time, respondents described how telehealth and Medicare waivers enabled new ways to connect with patients and wondered whether waivers would be extended after the public health emergency. Conclusions and Implications Survey results highlight rapid changes to rehabilitation in post-acute and long-term care during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because staff vaccine coverage remains low and patients vulnerable in residential care settings, changes such as infection precautions are likely to persist.

The National Institutes of General Medical Science sepsis research working group recommendations call for application of new research approaches in extant clinical data sets to improve efficiency of early trials of new sepsis therapies. Our objective is to apply machine learning approaches to derive computable 24-h sepsis phenotypes to facilitate personalized enrollment in early anti-inflammatory trials targeting these conditions. METHODS: We applied consensus, k-means clustering analysis to our extant PHENOtyping sepsis-induced Multiple organ failure Study (PHENOMS) dataset of 404 children. 24-hour computable phenotypes are derived using 25 available bedside variables including C-reactive protein and ferritin. RESULTS: Four computable phenotypes (PedSep-A, B, C, and D) are derived. Compared to all other phenotypes, PedSep-A patients (n = 135; 2% mortality) were younger and previously healthy, with the lowest C-reactive protein and ferritin levels, the highest lymphocyte and platelet counts, highest heart rate, and lowest creatinine (p < 0.05); PedSep-B patients (n = 102; 12% mortality) were most likely to be intubated and had the lowest Glasgow Coma Scale Score (p < 0.05); PedSep-C patients (n = 110; mortality 10%) had the highest temperature and Glasgow Coma Scale Score, least pulmonary failure, and lowest lymphocyte counts (p < 0.05); and PedSep-D patients (n = 56, 34% mortality) had the highest creatinine and number of organ failures, including renal, hepatic, and hematologic organ failure, with the lowest platelet counts (p < 0.05). PedSep-D had the highest likelihood of developing thrombocytopenia-associated multiple organ failure (Adj OR 47.51 95% CI [18.83C136.83], p < 0.0001) and macrophage activation syndrome (Adj OR 38.63 95% CI [13.26C137.75], p < 0.0001).

METHODS: Participants with MS(N=15) were randomly assigned into intervention(n=8) or waitlist control(n=7) conditions. The physical activity intervention was delivered over a 16-week period and outcomes were assessed at baseline and immediately following the 16-week period in both conditions. RESULTS: There was a significant, positive effect of the intervention on overall RLS severity (p=.01;?&#961;2=.43), severity during the night(p=.03,?&#961;2=.35), severity during the day while resting(p=.01,?&#961;2=.44), and severity during the day while active(p<.01,?&#961;2=.61), and non-significant improvements in RLS severity while falling asleep (p=.33,?&#961;2=.09). There were significant positive effects on sleep satisfaction(p<.01,?&#961;2=.49) and non-significant improvements in self-reported global sleep quality(p=.35,?&#961;2=.08). There was a significant intervention effect on self-reported time in bed(p=.03,?&#961;2=.37) and total sleep time(p=.03,?&#961;2=.36), and non-significant improvements in self-reported sleep latency (p=.08,?&#961;2=.25), sleep efficiency(p=.27,?&#961;2=.11), and daytime sleepiness (p=.52,?&#961;2=.04;p=.35,?&#961;2=.08;p=.51,?&#961;2=.04).

The aim was to assess the short- and mid-term results of robot-assisted thoracoscopic oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer. METHODS Between October 2003 and May 2007, 47 patients with resectable oesophageal cancer underwent robot-assisted thoracoscopic oesophagectomy. Clinical data were collected prospectively. RESULTS Conversion to thoracotomy was necessary in seven patients. Median operating time was 450 min and median blood loss 625 ml. Median postoperative ventilation time was 1 day, intensive care stay 3 days and hospital stay 18 days. Twenty-one of 47 patients had pulmonary complications. Three patients died in hospital. A median of 29 (range 8-68) lymph nodes was dissected and R0 resection was achieved in 36 patients. Twenty-three patients had stage IVa disease. After a median follow-up of 35 months, median disease-free survival was 15 (95 per cent confidence interval 12 to 18) months.

We also analyze and correlate the collected data with past statistics. A crowdsourcing mobile application known as Disease Outbreak Tracker (DOT) was implemented and made public. A real-time disease surveillance system using the Early Aberration Reporting System algorithm (EARS) for analysis of the collected data was also implemented. The collected data were correlated to historical data for 2017. Data were successfully collected and plotted on a daily basis. The results show that a few cases of Flu and Scabies were reported in some districts. The EARS methods C1, C2 and C3 also depicted spikes above the set threshold on some days. The study covers data collected over a period of one month. Once symptoms data were collected using DOT, probabilistic methods were used to find the disease or diseases that the user was suffering from. The data were further processed to find the extent of the disease outbreak district-wise, per disease. These data were represented graphically for a rapid understanding of the situation in each district.

Other essays explore the pandemic from historical, sociological, and economic perspectives, particularly how triage policies have been found to be largely blind to structural healthcare disparities, while simultaneously unable to appropriately address those disparities. Central issues that need to be addressed in triage are not just whether a utilitarian response is the most just response, but what exactly is the greatest good for the greatest number? Together, the essays in this special issue of HEC Forum create a call for a more anthropological approach to understanding health and healthcare.

The study objective was to develop a framework that provides a common language and methodology for defining and planning child and youth healthcare services across the province. METHODS: The framework was developed in two phases. In Phase 1, a literature and jurisdictional review was completed using the following inclusion criteria: (i) description of a framework focusing on organizing service delivery systems (ii) that supports health service planning, (iii) includes specialty or subspecialty services and (iv) has been published since 2008. In Phase 2, a series of meetings with key provincial stakeholders were held to receive feedback on the developed Tiers of Service framework versions that were based on the literature and jurisdictional review and adjusted to the British Columbian health care context. The final version was endorsed by the Child Health BC Steering Committee. RESULTS: Ten medical articles and thirteen jurisdictional papers met the established selection criteria and were included in this study. Most frameworks were developed by the Australian national or state jurisdictions and published in jurisdictional papers (n = 8). Frameworks identified in the medical literature were mainly developed in Canada (n = 3) and the US (n = 3) and focused on maternity, neonatal, critical care and oncology services. Based on feedback received from the expert group, the framework was expanded to include community-based services, prevention and health determinants. The final version of the Tiers of Service framework describes the specific services to be delivered at each tier, which are categorized as Tier 1 (community services) through Tier 6 (sub-specialized services). Two consecutive steps were identified to effectively use the framework for operational and system planning: (i) development of a module outlining the responsibilities and requirements to be delivered at each tier; and (ii) assessment of services provided at the health care facility against those described in the module, alignment to a specific tier, identification of gaps at the local, regional and provincial level, and implementation of quality improvement initiatives to effectively address the gaps. CONCLUSIONS: The benefits of the Tiers of Service framework and accompanying modules for health service planning are being increasingly recognized. Planning and coordinating pediatric health services across the province will help to optimize flow and improve access to high-quality services for children living in British Columbia.

ISG15 has antiviral activity against a number of viruses; therefore, we examined the effect of ISG15 conjugation (ISGylation) in a model of acute viral hepatitis induced by the murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) coronavirus. Mice deficient in the ISG15 deconjugating enzyme, ubiquitin-specific peptidase-18 (USP18), accumulate high levels of ISG15-conjugated proteins and are hypersensitive to type I IFN. Infecting USP18(-/-) mice with MHV-3 resulted in extended survival (8  1.2 versus 4 days) and in improved liver histology, a decreased inflammatory response, and viral titers 1 to 2 logs lower than in USP18(+/+) mice. The suppression of viral replication was not due to increased IFN since infected USP18(-/-) mice had neither increased hepatic IFN-, -, or - mRNA nor circulating protein. Instead, delayed MHV-3 replication coincided with high levels of cellular ISGylation. Decreasing ISGylation by knockdown of the ISG15 E1 enzyme, Ube1L, in primary USP18(+/+) and USP18(-/-) hepatocytes led to increased MHV-3 replication. Both in vitro and in vivo, increasing MHV-3 titers were coincident with increased PLP2 mRNA and decreased ISGylation over the course of infection. The pharmacologic inhibition of the PLP2 enzyme in vitro led to decreased MHV-3 replication. Overall, these results demonstrate the antiviral effect of ISGylation in an in vivo model of coronavirus-induced mouse hepatitis and illustrate that PLP2 manipulates the host innate immune response through the ISG15/USP18 pathway. IMPORTANCE There have been a number of serious worldwide pandemics due to widespread infections by coronavirus. This virus (in its many forms) is difficult to treat, in part because it is very good at finding \\"holes\\" in the way that the host (the infected individual) tries to control and eliminate the virus. In this study, we demonstrate that an important host viral defense-the ISG15 pathway-is only partially effective in controlling severe coronavirus infection. Activation of the pathway is very good at suppressing viral production, but over time the virus overwhelms the host response and the effects of the ISG15 pathway. These data provide insight into host-virus interactions during coronavirus infection and suggest that the ISG15 pathway is a reasonable target for controlling severe coronavirus infection although the best treatment will likely involve multiple pathways and targets.","output":"Protein interferon-stimulated gene 15 conjugation delays but does not overcome coronavirus proliferation in a model of fulminant hepatitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite over 4 million cases of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States, limited data exist including socioeconomic background and post-discharge outcomes for patients hospitalized with this disease. METHODS: In this case series, we identified patients with COVID-19 admitted to 3 Partners Healthcare hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts between March 7th, 2020, and March 30th, 2020. Patient characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes were determined. FINDINGS: A total of 247 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified; the median age was 61 (interquartile range [IQR]: 50C76 years), 58% were men, 30% of Hispanic ethnicity, 21% enrolled in Medicaid, and 12% dual-enrolled Medicare/Medicaid. The median estimated household income was $66,701 [IQR: $50,336-$86,601]. Most patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine (72%), and statins (76%; newly initiated in 34%). During their admission, 103 patients (42%) required intensive care. At the end of the data collection period (June 24, 2020), 213 patients (86.2%) were discharged alive, 2 patients (0.8%) remain admitted, and 32 patients (13%) have died.

The world has thoroughly been affected by COVID-19, while there has been little progress towards understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Patients with a severe phenotype of disease and those who died from the disease have shown hyperinflammation and were more likely to develop neurological manifestations, linking the clinical disease with neuroimmunological features. Anosmia frequently occurs early in the course of COVID-19. The prevalence of anosmia would be influenced by self-diagnosis as well as self-misdiagnosis in patients with COVID-19. Despite this, the association between anosmia and COVID-19 has been a hope for research, aiming to understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Studies have suggested differently probable mechanisms for the development of anosmia in COVID-19, including olfactory cleft syndrome, postviral anosmia syndrome, cytokine storm, direct damage of olfactory sensory neurons, and impairment of the olfactory perception center in the brain. Thus, the observation of anosmia would direct us to find the pathogenesis of COVID-19 in the central nervous system, and this is consistent with numerous neurological manifestations related to COVID-19. Like other neurotropic viruses, SARS-CoV-2 might be able to enter the central nervous system via the olfactory epithelium and induce innate immune responses at the site of entry. Viral replication in the nonneural olfactory cells indirectly causes damage to the olfactory receptor nerves, and as a consequence, anosmia occurs.

In this paper, we have elaborated on the therapeutic strategies that have been hypothesized or trialed to-date, the mechanism of action of each therapeutic, the clinical trials finished or in-process that support the use of each therapeutic, and the adverse effects associated with each therapeutic. Currently, there is no treatment that has been proven to provide significant benefit in reducing morbidity and mortality. There are many clinical trials for numerous different therapeutic agents currently underway. By looking back and measuring successful strategies from previous pandemics in addition to carrying out ongoing research, we provide ourselves with the greatest opportunity to find treatments that are beneficial.","output":"Emerging therapeutics in the management of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The rapid global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains the international public health concern of the decade. Early clinical data suggest that patients (pts) with hematologic malignancies are vulnerable to severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 and have higher mortality rates than the general population. Greater understanding of risk factors and outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 in pts with hematologic malignancies is crucial in order to develop individualized risk-benefit analyses to guide care. Herein, we report a cohort study from a Comprehensive Cancer Center evaluating outcomes in pts with hematologic malignancies who developed SARS-CoV-2. Methods: Adult pts at Northwestern Memorial Hospital with a current/prior hematologic malignancy and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs between March-July, 2020 were identified using electronic health records. Data were collected and analyzed based on epidemiologic, laboratory, and clinical characteristics. Severity of illness was defined by level of care (ambulatory, inpatient), need for advanced respiratory support (high flow nasal cannula, BiPAP, mechanical ventilation), incidence of thrombotic events, incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), and/or death. Statistical analyses of risk factors, severity, and outcomes were performed. Subgroup analyses based on antineoplastic treatment status and receipt of SARS-CoV-2 -directed therapy were made. Active cancer treatment was defined as antineoplastic therapy within 12 months of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Results: Demographic (Table 1) and clinical (Table 2) data were recorded from 73 SARS-CoV-2 infected pts. Sixty (80%) pts had lymphoid and 15 (20%) had myeloid neoplasms, 2 with concurrent lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms. Thirty-seven (51%) pts were undergoing active treatment for their malignancy. Twenty-one pts (29%) were managed in the ambulatory setting while 52 (71%) required hospital admission. Twenty-five (34%) pts required advanced respiratory support including 14 (19%) who required mechanical ventilation. Four pts (6%) had thrombotic events and 31 (42%) received SARS-CoV-2-directed therapies. Sixteen pts (22%) died during the study period. Pts on active cancer treatment had higher rates of hospital admission (81% v 60%; p=0.05) and AKI (51% v 29%; p=0.04) but similar rates of death compared with pts not on active treatment (24% v 20%; p=0.66) (Table 3). Comparing pts who received SARS-CoV-2 -directed therapy versus no therapy: pts on therapy had longer median lengths of stay (11 v 7 days; p=0.04) and higher rates of hospital admission (94% v 55%; p=0.0003) but similar rates of death (23% v 21%; p=0.91); pts in the ICU on SARS-COV-2 -directed therapy had lower rates of death (38% v 88% p=0.02) than pts who did not receive such therapy (Table 4). Twenty-six pts (36%) were tested for viral clearance, defined as two serial negative swabs 24 hours apart. Of these, 17 (65%) achieved clearance with a median time of 51 days (range 15-119 days). Thirteen pts (18%) had antibody (Ab) testing. Ten (77%) had detectable Abs: 8 were positive for IgG, 1 for IgG and IgM, and 1 had unspecified positivity. Notably, all 3 pts with undetectable Abs were on active cancer treatment. Conclusion: We demonstrate that pts with hematologic malignancies are exceptionally vulnerable to severe forms of SARS-CoV-2 with high mortality rates. The incidence of thrombotic events was low, an unexpected finding in the setting of a hyperinflammatory syndrome. Prolonged time to viral clearance was observed, a finding which may cause potential delays in the resumption of cancer-directed therapies. Notably, the majority of pts who received antibody testing had detectable antibodies suggesting that pts with hematologic malignancies may be able to mount an immune response to early vaccination. Accordingly, close monitoring, aggressive therapy, and early vaccination, when available, may be warranted for this population. Larger studies are needed to confirm our findings and help guide management of pts with hematologic malignancies during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Hypoxia has been proposed to increase both RDW and mortality. However, experimental evidence, especially in animal models, is lacking. Here, we show that chronic hypobaric hypoxia (~10% O2) increases erythrocyte numbers, hemoglobin and RDW, while reducing longevity in male mice. Compound heterozygous knockout (chKO) mutations in succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh; mitochondrial complex II) genes Sdhb, Sdhc and Sdhd reduce high RDW and immature reticulocyte fraction, and increase healthy lifespan in chronic hypoxia.

Increasing intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or decreasing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) as well as cardiopulmonary alterations are common complications of an IHTs, which can lead to secondary brain injury. This study was performed to assess several serum biomarkers concerning their potential to improve safety of IHTs in mechanically ventilated NICU patients. METHODS All IHTs of mechanically ventilated and sedated NICU patients from 03/2017 to 01/2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Intracranial pressure and CPP measurements were performed in all patients. Serum hemoglobin, hematocrit, and serum sodium were defined as serum biomarkers. Demographic data, computed tomography scan on admission, Simplified Acute Physiology Score and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, modified Rankin Scale, indication and consequence of IHTs were analyzed. Alteration of ICP/CPP, hemodynamic and pulmonary events were defined as complications. The study population was stratified into patients with the occurrence of a complication and absence of a complication. RESULTS We analyzed a total number of 184 IHTs in 70 NICU patients with an overall complication rate of 57.6%. Of all, 32.1% IHTs had no direct therapeutic consequence. In patients with higher hemoglobin values prior to IHT less complications occurred, concerning ICP (P = .001), CPP (P = .001), hemodynamic (P = .005), and pulmonary (P < .0001) events. In addition, complications concerning ICP (P = .001), CPP (P = .001), hemodynamic (P = .005), and pulmonary problems (P = .002) were significantly lower in patients with higher hematocrit values before IHT. CONCLUSION Intrahospital transports of mechanically ventilated NICU patients carry a high risk of increased ICP and hemodynamic complications and should be performed restrictively. Higher values of hemoglobin and hematocrit prior to IHT were associated with less complications with regard to ICP, CPP as well as hemodynamic and pulmonary events and could be helpful to assess the potential risk of complications prior to IHTs.","output":"Serum Biomarkers for Risk Assessment of Intrahospital Transports in Mechanically Ventilated Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Not available.","output":"Prolonged viral replication in patients with hematologic malignancies hospitalized with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the inhibition features of the natural product juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) against the three key enzymes from Helicobacter pylori (cystathionine -synthase [HpCGS], malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase [HpFabD], and -hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase [HpFabZ]). METHODS: An enzyme inhibition assay against HpCGS was carried out by using a continuous coupled spectrophotometric assay approach. The inhibition assay of HpFabD was performed based on the -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-coupled system, while the inhibition assay for HpFabZ was monitored by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm with crotonoyl-CoA conversion to -hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The juglone/FabZ complex crystal was obtained by soaking juglone into the HpFabZ crystal, and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex was analyzed by molecular replacement approach. RESULTS: Juglone was shown to potently inhibit HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ with the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC(50) values of 7.00.7, 201, and 304 mol/L, respectively. An inhibition-type study indicated that juglone was a non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS against O-succinyl-L-homoserine (K(i)=K(i)=24 mol/L), an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD against malonyl-CoA (K(i)=7.4 mol/L), and a competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ against crotonoyl-CoA (K(i)=6.8 mol/L). Moreover, the crystal structure of the HpFabZ/juglone complex further revealed the essential binding pattern of juglone against HpFabZ at the atomic level.

The role of chemokines and their receptors in viral infections including HIV-1 was predicted from the early studies of HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 and its ligands and a divergent role of C-C chemokines in HIV-1 pathogenesis has been established. For example, CCL3 (MIP-1), CCL4 (MIP-1) and CCL5 (RANTES) have been shown to possess antiviral effects by binding to the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5, whereas CCL2, a pro-inflammatory chemokine, supports HIV-1 replication despite being a member of same chemokine family. Furthermore, the well-established role of CCL2 in driving the Th2 immune response supports its potential role in HIV-1/AIDS. Recent reports suggest multiple pathways of CCL2 affect HIV-1 infection.

There has been limited systematic analysis of PET findings after COVID-19 vaccination. Objective: To evaluate the frequency and characteristics of abnormal FDG and 11C-choline uptake on PET imaging performed after COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: This retrospective study included 67 patients (mean age 75.69.2 years; 43 men, 24 women) who underwent PET examination (PET/CT in 66, PET/MRI in 1; FDG in 54, 11C-choline in 13) between December 14th 2020 and March 10th 2021 following COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 52, Moderna vaccine in 15) and who had undergone pre-vaccination PET without visible axillary node uptake. PET was performed a median of 13 and 10 days after vaccination in patients who had received one (n = 44) and two (n = 23) doses, respectively. Two nuclear medicine physicians independently reviewed images, blinded to injection laterality and days since vaccination. Lymph node or deltoid SUVmax greater than blood pool SUVmax was considered positive. Interreader agreement was assessed, and the more experienced physician's measurements were used for subsequent analysis. Results: Positive axillary lymph node uptake was observed in 10.4% (7/67) of patients [7.4% (4/54) of FDG examinations, 23.1% (3/13) of 11C-choline examinations]; four and three patients with positive axillary lymph nodes had received Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, respectively. Injection laterality was documented in five of seven patients with positive axillary lymph nodes and was ipsilateral to the positive node in all five patients. PET was performed within 24 days of vaccination in all patients with a positive node. One patient exhibited extra-axillary lymph node uptake (ipsilateral supraclavicular uptake on FDG PET). Ipsilateral deltoid uptake was present in 14.5% (8/55) of patients with documented injection laterality, including in 42.9% (3/7) of patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. Interreader agreement for SUV measurements ranged from intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.600 to 0.988. Conclusion: Increased axillary lymph node or ipsilateral deltoid uptake is occasionally observed on FDG or 11C-choline PET performed after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination.

This hyperinflammatory response has been described primarily in the blood. Elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-1Ra and IL-18 in circulation have been associated with disease severity and mortality. However, there has been limited evaluation of the inflammatory milieu at the site of infection, within the airspaces. As a result, the causal relationship between inflammation at the site of infection and circulating cytokine levels is unclear. In this study we evaluate longitudinal cytokine profiles in paired BAL and plasma samples to describe the dynamics of inflammation over the course of COVID-19 induced ARDS. Methods: Patients with ARDS secondary to confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection were recruited from critical care units of three major hospitals within 24 hours of intubation. Control samples were collected from intubated patients with ARDS secondary to other causes. Nonbronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage, or mini-BAL, was performed at three time points to represent early, intermediate and late ARDS. Peripheral blood samples were obtained concurrently. A broad panel of immunomodulatory molecules were measured using electrochemiluminescence (Mesoscale Diagnostics) in cellfree BAL and plasma. Normally and non-normally distributed data were analyzed with independent group t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests respectively. Pearson product-moment analysis and linear regression modeling were used to compare blood cytokine levels with BAL. Results: Samples from 15 intubated patients with ARDS were evaluated. We detected 71 cytokines across 38 paired BAL and plasma samples from days 1-24 of mechanical ventilation. Evaluation of BAL and plasma cytokines demonstrated unique inflammatory profiles at early, intermediate, and late time points (days 1-3, 4-7, and 8-24 of ventilation). These included inflammatory cytokines and chemokines previously implicated in severe COVID-19 disease, the majority of which are expressed at high levels by myeloid cells. Direct comparison of inflammatory molecules between compartments revealed a distinct pro-inflammatory pattern within BAL fluid, that was only partially recapitulated in plasma over time. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the inflammatory environment within the plasma does not accurately depict the immune response within the lungs over the course of COVID-19 induced ARDS. These results suggest that direct sampling of the lung via BAL fluid more accurately reflects the local immune response to COVID-19 and may provide a promising tool for pathologic, prognostic and therapeutic studies of COVID-19 ARDS.","output":"Direct comparison of inflammatory profiles between the airspace and circulation in COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?

We identified one incident case of SARS-COV-2 infection out of 130 seronegative participants (0.8%, 95% CI 0.02C4.2%). In 131 vaccinated participants (125 BNT162b2, 6 mRNA-1273), 131 tested positive for anti-spike antibodies. We identified predictors of anti-spike antibody levels: time since vaccination, prior COVID-19 infection, age, and vaccine type. Each additional week since vaccination was associated with an 11.1% decrease in anti-spike antibody levels. (95% CI 6.2C15.8%). CONCLUSION: ED workers experienced a low incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and developed antibodies in response to vaccines and prior infection. Antibody levels decreased markedly with time since infection or vaccination.","output":"SARS COV-2 anti-nucleocapsid and anti-spike antibodies in an emergency department healthcare worker cohort: September 2020 C April 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of viruses with pandemic potential such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causing COVID-19 poses a global health challenge.

In the context of viral infection, a growing body of evidence shows that ?3? T cells are particularly equipped for early virus detection, which triggers their subsequent activation, expansion and the fast deployment of antiviral functions such as direct cytotoxic pathways, secretion of cytokines, recruitment and activation of other immune cells and mobilization of a trained immunity memory program. As such, ?3? T cells represent an attractive target to stimulate for a rapid and effective resolution of viral infections. Here, we review the known aspects of ?3?

METHODS: Authors collected regional recommendations to re-organize the healthcare system during the initial weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, 2020. The specific protocols implemented in an orthopaedic hospital, selected as a regional hub for minor trauma, are analyzed and described in this article. RESULTS: Two referral centres were identified as the hubs for minor trauma to reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals. These two centres have specific features: an emergency room, specialized orthopaedic surgeons for joint diseases and trauma surgeons on-call 24/7. Patients with trauma without the need for a multi-disciplinary approach or needing non-deferrable elective orthopaedic surgery were moved to these hospitals. Authors report the internal protocols of one of these centres. All elective surgery was stopped, outpatient clinics limited to emergencies and specific pathways, ward and operating theatre dedicated to COVID-19-positive patients were implemented. An oropharyngeal swab was performed in the emergency room for all patients needing to be admitted, and patients were moved to a specific ward with single rooms to wait for the results. Specific courses were organized to demonstrate the correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: The structure of the orthopaedic hubs, and the internal protocols proposed, could help to improve the quality of assistance for patients with musculoskeletal disorders and reduce the risk of overload in general hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Management of orthopaedic and traumatology patients during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in northern Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines differences between patients with and without cancer in patient demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 mortality and discusses the implications of these differences in relation to existing cancer disparities and COVID-19 vulnerabilities. Data was collected as a part of a retrospective study on a cohort of COVID-19 positive patients across Mount Sinai Health System from March 28, 2020 to April 26, 2020. Descriptive, comparative, and regression analyses were applied to examine differences between patients with and without cancer in demographic and clinical characteristics and COVID-19 mortality and whether cancer status predicts COVID-19 mortality controlling for these covariates using SAS 9.4. Results showed that, of 4641 patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 5.1% (N=236) had cancer. The median age of the total sample was 58 years (Q1-Q3: 41C71); 55.3% were male, 19.2% were current/former smokers, 6.1% were obese. The most commonly reported comorbidities were hypertension (22.6%) and diabetes (16.0%). Overall, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 8.3%. Examining differences between COVID-19 patients with and without cancer revealed significant differences (p<0.05) in COVID-19 mortality, hospitalization rates, age, gender, race, smoking status, obesity, and comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes) with cancer patients more likely to be older, male, black, obese, smokers, and with existing comorbidities. Controlling for these clinical, demographic, and behavioral characteristics, results of logistic regression analyses showed significant effects of older age and male gender on COVID-19 mortality (p<0.05). While cancer patients with COVID-19 were more likely to experience worse COVID-19 outcomes, these associations might be related to common cancer and COVID-19 vulnerability factors such as older age and gender. The coexistence of these vulnerability age and gender factors in both cancer and COVID-19 populations emphasizes the need for better understanding of their implications for cancer and COVID-19 disparities, both diseases prevention efforts, policies, and clinical management.","output":"COVID-19 in patients with and without cancer: Examining differences in patient characteristics and outcomes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique challenge for Medical systems worldwide.

We conducted a search using PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE to include all COVID-19 studies published between January 1st, 2020 to July 24th, 2020 reporting comorbidities with severity or mortality. We included studies reporting the confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 on human patients that also provided information on comorbidities or disease outcomes. We used DerSimonian and Laird random effects method for calculating estimates. Of 120 studies with 125,446 patients, the most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (32%), obesity (25%), diabetes (18%), and cardiovascular disease (16%) while chronic kidney or other renal diseases (51%, 44%), cerebrovascular accident (43%, 44%), and cardiovascular disease (44%, 40%) patients had more COVID-19 severity and mortality respectively. Considerable variation in the prevalence of comorbidities and associated disease severity and mortality in different geographic regions was observed. The highest mortality was observed in studies with Latin American and European patients with any medical condition, mostly older adults (&#8805; 65 years), and predominantly male patients. Although the US studies observed the highest prevalence of comorbidities in COVID-19 patients, the severity of COVID-19 among each comorbid condition was highest in Asian studies whereas the mortality was highest in the European and Latin American countries.

From March 10 through May 1, 2020, 103 lung ultrasound exams were performed by our Forward Intensive Care Team (FICT) on 26 patients (18 males and 8 females), aged 62 (54 - 76) and with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30.9 (28.7 - 31.5), a median 6 (5 - 9) days after admission to the COVID-19 medical unit of the University Hospital of Parma, Italy. All patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) the day of admission. The initial LUS was 16 (11 - 21), which did not significantly correlate with initial CT scans, probably due to rapid progression of the disease and time between CT scan on admission and first FICT evaluation; conversely, LUS was significantly correlated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio throughout patient follow-up [R = - 4.82 (- 6.84 to - 2.80; p < 0.001)]. The area under the receiving operating characteristics curve of LUS for the diagnosis of moderate-severe disease (PaO2/FiO2 ratio &#8804; 200 mmHg) was 0.73, with an optimal cutoff value of 11 (positive predictive value: 0.98; negative predictive value: 0.29).

The major concern regarding robotic hysterectomy stems from its high cost. AIM To evaluate the clinical utility and effectiveness of one-arm reduced robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy as a cost-effective surgical option for total robotic hysterectomy. MATERIAL AND METHODS A sample population of 54 women who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery for benign gynecologic indications was evaluated, and two groups were identified: (1) the two-armed robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery group (n = 38 patients), and (2) the three-armed robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery group (n = 16 patients). RESULTS An increased cost was observed when three-armed robotic surgery was employed for benign gynecologic surgery (p < 0.001). The cost reduction observed in the study group was primarily derived from one robotic arm reduction and vaginal closure of the cuff. This cost reduction was achieved without an increase in complication rates or undesirable postoperative outcomes. An estimated profit between $399.5 and $421.5 was made for each patient depending on the suture material chosen for cuff closure. Two-armed surgery resulted in an 18.6% reduction in procedure-specific costs for robotic hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS Two-armed robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy appears to be a cost-effective solution for robotic gynecologic surgery. This surgical solution can be performed as effectively as classical three-armed robotic hysterectomies for benign indications without the risk of increased surgical-related morbidities. This approach has the potential to be a widely preferred surgical approach in medical communities where cost reduction is one of the primary determinants of surgery type.","output":"Arm reduced robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy with transvaginal cuff closure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Detection of early metabolic changes in critically-ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) at the intensive care unit (ICU) could predict recovery patterns and help in disease management. Methods: Targeted metabolomics of serum samples from 39 COVID-19 patients under IMV in ICU was performed within 48 h of intubation and a week later. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to identify, at both time points, metabolites and clinical traits that predict the length of stay (LOS) at ICU (short  14 days/long >14 days) as well as the duration under IMV. All models were initially trained on a set of randomly selected individuals and validated on the remaining individuals in the cohort. Further validation in recently published metabolomics data of COVID-19 severity was performed. Results: A model based on hypoxanthine and betaine measured at first time point was best at predicting whether a patient is likely to experience a short or long stay at ICU [area under curve (AUC) = 0.92]. A further model based on kynurenine, 3-methylhistidine, ornithine, p-cresol sulfate, and C24.0 sphingomyelin, measured 1 week later, accurately predicted the duration of IMV (Pearson correlation = 0.94). Both predictive models outperformed Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores and differentiated COVID-19 severity in published data.

The molecular changes suggest that immunosuppression and tight junction impairment occur in the early stage of COVID-19 infection. Further subgrouping of COVID-19 patients into moderate and severe types shows that an activated immune response emerges in severely affected patients.

OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the presence and specialty of usual clinicians and the association with preventive care receipt and spending. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used repeated cross-sectional analyses of Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data from 2010, 2013, and 2016. Participants were community-dwelling Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare members with at least 2 chronic conditions. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2020, to February 5, 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Trends and factors associated with self-reported usual clinician presence and specialty. Multivariable regression was used to examine associations between usual clinician presence and specialty with preventive care receipt and spending, controlling for respondent sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 25 490 unweighted respondent-years were examined, representing 90 324 639 respondent-years across the United States. Overall, 58.4% of respondent-years belonged to women, and the mean (SD) age of respondents was 77.5 (7.5) years. From 2010 to 2016, those reporting usual clinicians dropped from 94.2% to 91.0% (P < .001). Across study years, respondents were more likely to report a usual clinician if they were women (adjusted marginal difference [AMD], 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.5-3.5 percentage points) or had higher income ($50 000 vs <$15 000: AMD, 2.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4 percentage points) and less likely if they were Black beneficiaries (vs White: AMD, ?2.8 percentage points; 95% CI, ?4.3 to ?1.3 percentage points) or had traditional Medicare (vs Medicare Advantage: AMD, ?3.2 percentage points; 95% CI. ?4.1 to ?2.3 percentage points). Among 23 279 respondents with usual clinicians, those reporting specialists as their usual clinicians decreased from 5.3% to 4.1% (P < .001). Across the study period, respondents were more likely to report specialists as their usual clinicians if they had traditional Medicare (vs Medicare Advantage: AMD, 2.3 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.6 to 2.9 percentage points), were Black or non-White Hispanic (Black vs White: AMD, 1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.2 to 2.8 percentage points; non-White Hispanic vs White: AMD, 3.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.9 to 5.7 percentage points), or lived in the Northeast (vs Midwest: AMD, 3.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.1 to 5.2 percentage points). Compared with those without usual clinicians, respondents with usual clinicians were more likely to receive all examined preventive services, such as cholesterol screening (AMD, 6.7 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.4 to 8.1 percentage points) and influenza vaccines (AMD, 11.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.2 to 14.0 percentage points). Among respondents with usual clinicians, those reporting specialist usual clinicians (vs primary care) were less likely to receive influenza vaccines (AMD, ?5.6 percentage points; 95% CI, ?9.2 to ?2.1). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, older adults with multimorbidity were less likely to have a usual clinician over the study period, with potential implications for preventive care receipt.

MATERIALS & METHODS: A literature search was conducted on April 21, 2020 and updated on July 24, 2020 using PubMed, Embase, World Health Organization, and Google Scholar databases. Only studies which described chest CT findings of COVID-19 in pregnant patients were included for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 67 articles and 427 pregnant patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were analyzed. The most frequently encountered pulmonary findings on chest CT were ground-glass opacities (77.2%, 250/324), posterior lung involvement (72.5%, 50/69), multilobar involvement (71.8%, 239/333), bilateral lung involvement (69.4%, 231/333), peripheral distribution (68.1%, 98/144), and consolidation (40.9%, 94/230). Pregnant patients were also found to present more frequently with consolidation (40.9% vs. 21.0-31.8%) and pleural effusion (30.0% vs. 5.0%) in comparison to the general population. Associated clinical features included antepartum fever (198 cases), lymphopenia (128 cases), and neutrophilia (97 cases). Of the 251 neonates delivered, 96.8% had negative RT-PCR and/or IgG antibody testing for COVID-19. In the eight cases (3.2%) of reported neonatal infection, tests were either conducted on samples collected up to 72 h after birth or were found negative on all subsequent RT-PCR tests. CONCLUSION: Pregnant patients appear to present more commonly with more advanced COVID-19 CT findings compared to the general adult population. Furthermore, characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in pregnant patients tended to mirror those found in the general patient population. Lastly, results from neonatal testing suggest a low risk of vertical transmission.","output":"COVID-19 in pregnancy: a systematic review of chest CT findings and associated clinical features in 427 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic a mass casualty incident of ambulatory patients occurred at the COVID-19 rapid response infrastructure (CRRI) facility at the University Hospital of Cologne (UHC). We report the development of a patient-centred mobile-device solution to support efficient management of the facility, triage of patients and rapid delivery of test results. METHODS: The UHC-Corona Web Tool (CWT) was developed as a web-based software useable on each patient's smartphone. It provides, among others, a self-reported medical history including type and duration of symptoms and potential risk contacts and links all retrieved information to the digital patient chart via a QR code. It provides scheduling of outpatient appointments and automated transmission of SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: The UHC-CWT was launched on 9 April 2020. It was used by 28,652 patients until 31 August 2020. Of those, 15,245 (53,2%) consulted the CRRI, representing 43,1% of all CRRI patients during the observed period. There were 8304 (29,0%) specifications concerning travel history and 17,145 (59,8%) indications of &#8805;1 symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The most frequently indicated symptoms were sore throat (60,0%), headache (50,7%), common cold (45,1%) and cough (42,6%) while 11,057 (40,2%) patients did not report any symptoms. After implementation of the UHC-CWT, the amount of patient contacts per physician rose from 38 to 98,7 per day. The personnel for communication of test results were reduced from four on seven days to one on five days.

In autocracies centralization of power allows for decisive action, but their ability to maintain secrecy means that they can also suppress information and ignore a problem. In a democracy greater transparency makes it hard to cover up a threat, but the decentralization of power that is inherent to a democracy can lead to a slow and potentially ineffective response. Using both current and historical comparisons between China and western countries, I show that these different patterns have deep roots, dating back a thousand years or more. I then consider three alternative proposals for democracies to be able to act more decisively: allowing for rule by decree, devolving responsibility to localities, and investing in preventative state capacity. History shows that the latter of these three is the safest and most effective strategy, but for it to work voters must reward politicians for investing in prevention.

METHODS: This was a retrospective observational case series of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed secondary S. aureus bacteremia across 2 New York City hospitals. The primary end point was to describe 14-day and 30-day hospital mortality rates of patients with COVID-19 and S. aureus bacteremia. Secondary end points included predictors of 14-day and 30-day hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 and S. aureus bacteremia. RESULTS: A total of 42 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 with secondary S. aureus bacteremia were identified. Of these patients, 23 (54.8%) and 28 (66.7%) died at 14 days and 30 days, respectively, from their first positive blood culture.

We draw on 18 semi-structured interviews conducted in May and June 2020. All interviews are thematically coded and analyzed. Our analysis reveals that many of the migrants faced several challenges, including accessing information in a language understandable to them and navigating constant streams of official news flows issuing instructions about which actions to take. However, we also note that the participating migrants found numerous creative ways to address some of these challenges, often aided by digital tools, helping them access crucial health and risk information.

PURPOSE: Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of levothyroxine, a 3-day hold guideline for adult patients ordered for intravenous (IV) levothyroxine was implemented at a tertiary academic medical center. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. METHODS: This single-center, retrospective analysis identified patients ordered for IV levothyroxine during a thirteen-week period before and after implementation of the guideline. The primary outcome was guideline adherence, defined as full implementation of the three-day hold. Secondary outcomes included the number of IV levothyroxine administrations avoided in the post-guideline group, extrapolated yearly cost avoidance (EYCA) post-guideline implementation, reasons for guideline non-adherence, and number of safety reports involving IV levothyroxine. RESULTS: A total of 166 and 134 patients met inclusion criteria for the pre and post-guideline groups, respectively. Guideline adherence was observed in 94 (70.1%) patients, resulting in 276 vials saved in the thirteen-week post-guideline period which translated to an EYCA of $139,877. Forty orders (29.9%) were non-adherent to the guideline with the most common reason stated as nil per os (NPO). No difference in safety outcomes was seen between the pre- and post-guideline groups as evidenced by one safety report in each group. CONCLUSION: We observed a high rate of adherence to an IV levothyroxine hold guideline. This was associated with a substantial cost savings over the study period with no increase in reported safety events.

Results A total of 319 patients were seen at the palliative care department from March to June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic (119 inpatient, 200 outpatient), compared to 346 patients seen during the corresponding months in 2019 (97 inpatient, 249 outpatient). Our main findings included more patients being discharged home, lesser transfers, shorter hospital length of stay, lesser imminent death protocols, and a higher palliative performance score (PPS) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there were more cancelations by the hospital for the outpatient department, a virtual clinic was started, and 84 patients were effectively seen. Around 87% of patients were fully satisfied (5/5) with the services provided by the virtual clinic. There were no positive COVID-19 cases in our healthcare workers in the palliative care department due to the high standard precautions applied at KFMC.

Herein, we studied the earliest patients admitted to our centre in order to clarify the typical radiological findings, particularly computed tomography (CT) findings, associated with COVID-19. METHODS From 22 January 2020 to 29 February 2020, 19 patients with confirmed COVID-19 underwent high-resolution or conventional CT scans of the thorax in our centre. The CT imaging findings of these patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Hong Kong were reviewed in this study. RESULTS Ground-glass opacities (GGO) with peripheral subpleural distribution were found in all patients (100%). No specific zonal predominance was observed. All lobes were involved in 16 (84.2%) patients, focal subsegmental consolidations were observed in 14 (73.7%) patients, and interlobular septal thickening was present in 12 (63.2%) patients. No mediastinal lymph node enlargement, centrilobular nodule, or pleural effusion was detected in any of the patients. Other imaging features present in several patients include bronchial dilatation, bronchial wall thickening, and crazy-paving patterns. CONCLUSION Peripheral subpleural GGO without zonal predominance in the absence of centrilobular nodule, pleural effusion, and lymph node enlargement were consistent findings in patients with confirmed COVID-19. The observed radiological patterns on CT scans can help identify COVID-19 and assess affected patients in the context of the ongoing outbreak.","output":"Patterns of COVID-19 on computed tomography imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, a stock price model is proposed by A. Mahata et al. [Physica A, 574, 126008 (2021)] to understand the effect of COVID-19 on stock market. It describes V- and L-shaped recovery of the stocks and indices, but fails to simulate the U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery that arises due to sharp crisis and prolong drop followed by quick recovery (U-shaped) or slow recovery for longer period (Swoosh-shaped recovery). We propose a modified model by introducing a new variable $$ that quantifies the sentiment of the investors. $=+1,~0,~-1$ for positive, neutral and negative sentiment, respectively. The model explains the movement of sectoral indices with positive $$ showing U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery. The simulation using synthetic fund-flow ($_{st}$) with different shock lengths ($T_S$), $$, negative sentiment period ($T_N$) and portion of fund-flow ($$) during recovery period show U- and Swoosh-shaped recovery. The results show that the recovery of the indices with positive $$ becomes very weak with the extended $T_S$ and $T_N$. The stocks with higher $$ and $$ recover quickly. The simulation of the Nifty Bank, Nifty Financial and Nifty Realty show U-shaped recovery and Nifty IT shows Swoosh-shaped recovery. The simulation result is consistent with the real stock price movement. The time-scale ($$) of the shock and recovery of these indices during the COVID-19 are consistent with the time duration of the change of negative sentiment from the onset of the COVID-19.

Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury. Methods: Nineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups. Results: Compared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO (2)/FiO (2)) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO (2)/FiO (2) ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury. Conclusions: These novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans.","output":"Cardiorespiratory physiological perturbations after acute smoke-induced lung injury and during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support in sheep"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 counts 46 million people infected and killed more than 1.2 million. Hypoxaemia is one of the main clinical manifestations, especially in severe cases. HIF1&#945; is a master transcription factor involved in the cellular response to oxygen levels. The immunopathogenesis of this severe form of COVID-19 is poorly understood. METHODS: We performed scRNAseq from leukocytes from five critically ill COVID-19 patients and characterized the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor1&#945; and its transcriptionally regulated genes. Also performed metanalysis from the publicly available RNAseq data from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar cells. RESULTS: Critically-ill COVID-19 patients show a shift towards an immature myeloid profile in peripheral blood cells, including band neutrophils, immature monocytes, metamyelocytes, monocyte-macrophages, monocytoid precursors, and promyelocytes-myelocytes, together with mature monocytes and segmented neutrophils. May be the result of a physiological response known as emergency myelopoiesis. These cellular subsets and bronchoalveolar cells express HIF1&#945; and their transcriptional targets related to inflammation (CXCL8, CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4); virus sensing, (TLR2 and TLR4); and metabolism (SLC2A3, PFKFB3, PGK1, GAPDH and SOD2). CONCLUSIONS: The up-regulation and participation of HIF1&#945; in events such as inflammation, immunometabolism, and TLR make it a potential molecular marker for COVID-19 severity and, interestingly, could represent a potential target for molecular therapy.

However, performing brain CT registration accurately and rapidly remains greatly challenging due to the large intersubject anatomical variations, low resolution of soft tissues, and heavy computation costs. To this end, the HSCN-Net, a hybrid supervised convolutional neural network, was developed for precise and fast brain CT registration. METHOD: HSCN-Net generated synthetic deformation fields using a simulator as one supervision for one referenceCmoving image pair to address the problem of lack of gold standards. Furthermore, the simulator was designed to generate multiscale affine and elastic deformation fields to overcome the registration challenge posed by large intersubject anatomical deformation. Finally, HSCN-Net adopted a hybrid loss function constituted by deformation field and image similarity to improve registration accuracy and generalization capability. In this work, 101 CT images of patients were collected for model construction (57), evaluation (14), and testing (30). HSCN-Net was compared with the classical Demons and VoxelMorph models. Qualitative analysis through the visual evaluation of critical brain tissues and quantitative analysis by determining the endpoint error (EPE) between the predicted sparse deformation vectors and gold-standard sparse deformation vectors, image normalized mutual information (NMI), and the Dice coefficient of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood supply area were carried out to assess model performance comprehensively. RESULTS: HSCN-Net and Demons had a better visual spatial matching performance than VoxelMorph, and HSCN-Net was more competent for smooth and large intersubject deformations than Demons. The mean EPE of HSCN-Net (3.29 mm) was less than that of Demons (3.47 mm) and VoxelMorph (5.12 mm); the mean Dice of HSCN-Net was 0.96, which was higher than that of Demons (0.90) and VoxelMorph (0.87); and the mean NMI of HSCN-Net (0.83) was slightly lower than that of Demons (0.84), but higher than that of VoxelMorph (0.81). Moreover, the mean registration time of HSCN-Net (17.86 s) was shorter than that of VoxelMorph (18.53 s) and Demons (147.21 s). CONCLUSION: The proposed HSCN-Net could achieve accurate and rapid intersubject brain CT registration.","output":"Brain CT registration using hybrid supervised convolutional neural network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During 2018-19, an increase of vanB vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) was observed in the Capital Region of Denmark. vanA/vanB PCR performed directly on rectal swabs is accurate in detection of vanA; however, the positive predictive value for vanB-positive samples is low because of the presence of vanB in non-enterococcal gut commensals. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the epidemiology and clonal relatedness of vanB VREfm from the period 2015-19 and describe the application of a clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay for rapid and accurate detection of vanB VREfm in rectal screening samples. METHODS: vanB VREfm were investigated using epidemiological data and WGS data. The SeqSphere+ software was used to analyse MLST and cgMLST, and de novo assemblies were annotated to determine insertion sites for the vanB transposon (Tn1549). A clone-specific vanB VREfm PCR assay was designed to detect the sequence bridging Tn1549 and the E. faecium chromosome (araA2) in the dominant cluster. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy-five vanB VREfm isolates were identified, of which 76% were identified in 2019. A dominant cluster (Cluster 1, na??=a??204, 74%), six minor clusters and 15 singletons were identified. All Cluster 1 isolates and six non-Cluster 1 isolates had Tn1549 integrated into araA2. In 2019, the PCR assay would have detected 92% of all rectal screening samples containing vanB VREfm.

We analyzed several patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to develop a practical toolkit to facilitate shared physician-patient decision-making. HrQoL subdomains, actionable in the clinical setting and measurable as PROMs, were selected. PROMs were collated through systematic literature searches, scored by the authors on usability, validation, and availability, after which practical recommendations were made. Nine subdomains were selected across physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains; 46 validated PROMs were identified. After pre-screening, from 39 evaluated PROMs, we recommended PROMs in the following subdomains: fatigue/energy loss, frailty/resilience, sleep disturbance, substance use, anxiety/depression, cognition, sexual function and desire, and stigma. Using this toolkit, healthcare professionals and PLHIV can collaborate and mutually agree on individual care objectives.

Thus, researchers have attempted to understand factors predicting math performance in order to identify ways of supporting math development. Work examining individual differences in math performance typically focuses on either cognitive predictors, including inhibitory control and the approximate number system (ANS; a nonsymbolic numerical comparison system), or affective predictors, like math anxiety. Studies with children suggest that these factors are interrelated, warranting examination of whether and how each uniquely and independently contributes to math performance in adulthood. Here, we examined how inhibitory control, the ANS, and math anxiety predicted college students' math performance (n = 122, mean age = 19.70 years). Using structural equation modeling, we find that although inhibitory control and the ANS were closely related to each other, they did not predict math performance above and beyond the effects of the other while also controlling for math anxiety. Instead, math anxiety was the only unique predictor of math performance. These findings contradict previous results in children and reinforce the need to consider affective factors in our discussions and interventions for supporting math performance in college students.","output":"Teasing apart the unique contributions of cognitive and affective predictors of math performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We documented 4 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reinfection by non-variant of concern strains among healthcare workers in Campinas, Brazil.

METHODS: The results are based on the analysis of surveys that were distributed among members of 26 random Facebook groups in April-May, 2020. Perceived COVID-19 pandemic related stress and health concerns were examined by using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. RESULTS: Among 315 respondents, 64% have experienced COVID-19 related stress and identified anxiety, headache, insomnia, and weight gain as their primary health concerns. The ANOVA test revealed that females are more impacted by the COVID-19 stress than males. Around 40% of respondents believed that the COVID-19 would lead to an increase in the cost of health services, and 20% of respondents anticipated that the COVID-19 pandemic would increase their need for health services.

Cancer networks in many countries have committed to involving people living with and beyond cancer (PLC) at multiple levels. However, PLC participation in network governance remains highly variable for reasons that are poorly understood. This study aims to share lessons learned regarding mechanisms that enable PLC participation in cancer network governance. METHODS: This multiple case study, using a qualitative approach in a natural setting, was conducted over six years in three local cancer networks within the larger national cancer network in Quebec (Canada), where PLC participation is prescribed by the Cancer Directorate. Data were collected from multiple sources, including individual and focus group interviews (n = 89) with policymakers, managers, clinicians and PLC involved in national and local cancer governance committees. These data were triangulated and iteratively analysed according to a framework based on functions of collaborative governance in the network context. RESULTS: We identify three main mechanisms that enable PLC participation in cancer network governance: (1) consistent emphasis on patient-centred care as a network objective; (2) flexibility, time and support to translate mandated PLC representation into meaningful participation; and (3) recognition of the distinct knowledge of PLC in decision-making. The shared vision of person-centred care facilitates PLC participation. The quality of participation improves through changes in how committee meetings are conducted, and through the establishment of a national committee where PLC can pool their experience, develop skills and establish a common voice on priority issues. PLC knowledge is especially valued around particular challenges such as designing integrated care trajectories and overcoming barriers to accessing care. These three mechanisms interact to enable PLC participation in governance and are activated to varying extents in each local network. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that mandating PLC representation on governance structures is a powerful context element enabling participation, but that it also delineates which governance functions are open to influence from PLC participation. While the activation of mechanisms is context dependent, the insights from this study in Quebec are transferable to cancer networks in other jurisdictions seeking to embed PLC participation in decision-making.

In the meantime, there are several proposals for regulations and draft laws that pursue different concepts of a possible future regulation of assisted suicide. However, from the perspective of criminal law, the search for a new regulation should always be preceded by the question of the necessity of a new regulation. A new regulation must not be limited to certain groups of persons, such as persons with incurable, terminal illnesses, because otherwise the suicide motive would be assessed. This brings with it the particular challenge of finding a regulation that covers the different problem and need situations without assessing the suicide motive and also takes into account that the autonomy of the individual can be endangered in different ways.

We aimed to describe the changes of lung function and identify risk factors for impaired diffusion capacity. METHODS: Non-critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital, China, were enrolled from March to June 2020. Subjects were prospectively followed up with pulmonary function tests at discharge, three and six months after discharge. FINDINGS: Eighty-six patients completed diffusion capacity tests at three timepoints. The mean diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (D(LCO))% pred was 79.8% at discharge and significantly improved to 84.9% at Month-3. The transfer coefficient of the lung for carbon monoxide (K(CO))% pred significantly increased from 91.7% at discharge to 95.7% at Month-3. Both of them showed no further improvement at Month-6. The change rates of D(LCO)% pred and K(CO)% pred were significantly higher in 0C3 months than in 3C6 months. The alveolar ventilation (V(A)) improved continuously during the follow-ups. At Month-6, impaired D(LCO)% pred was associated with being female (OR 5.2 [1.7C15.8]; p = 0.004) and peak total lesion score (TLS) of chest CT > 8.5 (OR 6.6 [1.7C26.5]; p = 0.007). D(LCO)% pred and K(CO)% pred were worse in females at discharge. And in patients with impaired diffusion capacity, females D(LCO)% pred recovered slower than males.

The results are compared with available experimental data from solution high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The experimental 1H chemical shifts exhibit highly diagnostic resonances due to the olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds. The \\"inside\\" olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds are deshielded than those of the \\"outside\\" protons. Furthermore, in the cis/trans isomers, the signals of the cis bonds are more deshielded than those of the trans bonds. These regularities of the experimental 1H chemical shifts of the olefinic protons of the conjugated double bonds are reproduced very accurately for the lowest energy DFT optimized single conformer, for all functionals and basis sets used. The other low energy conformers have negligible effects on the computational 1H-NMR chemical shifts. We conclude that proton NMR chemical shifts are more discriminating than carbon, and DFT calculations can provide a valuable tool for (i) the accurate prediction of 1H-NMR chemical shifts even with less demanding functionals and basis sets; (ii) the unequivocal identification of geometric isomerism of CLAs that occur in nature, and (iii) to derive high resolution structures in solution.","output":"DFT Calculations of 1H- and 13C-NMR Chemical Shifts of Geometric Isomers of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (18:2 -7) and Model Compounds in Solution."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a focus of acute medical care on the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and pneumonia with consequences for all other medical specialties Between March and May 2020 a decline in the number of admissions for elective cardiac procedures as well as for cardiac emergencies was observed The number of patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction decreased, especially those with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), while time intervals between symptom onset and admission sometimes increased In some studies an increase in infarct-related mortality was reported There are multiple possible reasons for these findings, which include fear of patients to become infected with SARS-CoV?2 in hospital, misinterpretation of symptoms and focusing of the healthcare system on the pandemic In addition, SARS-CoV?2 can lead to a higher proneness to thrombosis and therefore induce more severe courses of myocardial infarction","output":"[COVID-19 pandemic : Effects on clinical care of cardiovascular patients in spring 2020]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fourteen months into the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, we identify key lessons in the global and national responses to the pandemic.

It has been used in a variety of procedures such as in general surgery and gynecology procedures including diagnostic laparoscopy. There has been increasing evidence of the utility of gasless laparoscopy in resource limited settings where diagnostic imaging is not available. In addition, it may help save costs for hospitals. The aim of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the available evidence surrounding the safety and efficiency of gasless laparoscopy compared to conventional laparoscopy and open techniques and to analyze the benefits that gasless laparoscopy has for low resource setting hospitals. METHODS: This protocol is developed by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis-Protocols (PRISMA-P). The PRISMA statement guidelines and flowchart will be used to conduct the study itself.

The framework includes seven complementary strategies. Delivering all seven strategies is a challenge in resource-limited contexts. Consequently, governments are requesting additional evidence to inform which accelerator provisions can simultaneously reduce multiple types of violence against children. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We pooled data from two prospective South African adolescent cohorts including Young Carers (2010C2012) and Mzantsi Wakho (2014C2017). The combined sample size was 5,034 adolescents. Each cohort measured six self-reported violence outcomes (sexual abuse, transactional sexual exploitation, physical abuse, emotional abuse, community violence victimisation, and youth lawbreaking) and seven self-reported INSPIRE-aligned protective factors (positive parenting, parental monitoring and supervision, food security at home, basic economic security at home, free schooling, free school meals, and abuse response services). Associations between hypothesised protective factors and violence outcomes were estimated jointly in a sex-stratified multivariate path model, controlling for baseline outcomes and socio-demographics and correcting for multiple-hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We calculated adjusted probability estimates conditional on the presence of no, one, or all protective factors significantly associated with reduced odds of at least three forms of violence in the path model. Adjusted risk differences (ARDs) and adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were also calculated. The sample mean age was 13.54 years, and 56.62% were female. There was 4% loss to follow-up. Positive parenting, parental monitoring and supervision, and food security at home were each associated with lower odds of three or more violence outcomes (p < 0.05). For girls, the adjusted probability of violence outcomes was estimated to be lower if all three of these factors were present, as compared to none of them: sexual abuse, 5.38% and 1.64% (ARD: ?3.74% points, 95% CI ?5.31 to ?2.16, p < 0.001); transactional sexual exploitation, 10.07% and 4.84% (ARD: ?5.23% points, 95% CI ?7.26 to ?3.20, p < 0.001); physical abuse, 38.58% and 23.85% (ARD: ?14.72% points, 95% CI ?19.11 to ?10.33, p < 0.001); emotional abuse, 25.39% and 12.98% (ARD: ?12.41% points, 95% CI ?16.00 to ?8.83, p < 0.001); community violence victimisation, 36.25% and 28.37% (ARD: ?7.87% points, 95% CI ?11.98 to ?3.76, p < 0.001); and youth lawbreaking, 18.90% and 11.61% (ARD: ?7.30% points, 95% CI ?10.50 to ?4.09, p < 0.001). For boys, the adjusted probability of violence outcomes was also estimated to be lower if all three factors were present, as compared to none of them: sexual abuse, 2.39% to 1.80% (ARD: ?0.59% points, 95% CI ?2.24 to 1.05, p = 0.482); transactional sexual exploitation, 6.97% to 4.55% (ARD: ?2.42% points, 95% CI ?4.77 to ?0.08, p = 0.043); physical abuse from 37.19% to 25.44% (ARD: ?11.74% points, 95% CI ?16.91 to ?6.58, p < 0.001); emotional abuse from 23.72% to 10.72% (ARD: ?13.00% points, 95% CI ?17.04 to ?8.95, p < 0.001); community violence victimisation from 41.28% to 35.41% (ARD: ?5.87% points, 95% CI ?10.98 to ?0.75, p = 0.025); and youth lawbreaking from 22.44% to 14.98% (ARD ?7.46% points, 95% CI ?11.57 to ?3.35, p < 0.001). Key limitations were risk of residual confounding and not having information on protective factors related to all seven INSPIRE strategies. CONCLUSION: In this cohort study, we found that positive and supervisory caregiving and food security at home are associated with reduced risk of multiple forms of violence against children. The presence of all three of these factors may be linked to greater risk reduction as compared to the presence of one or none of these factors. Policies promoting action on positive and supervisory caregiving and food security at home are likely to support further efficiencies in the delivery of INSPIRE.","output":"Violence prevention accelerators for children and adolescents in South Africa: A path analysis using two pooled cohorts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant B.1.1.529 is a Variant of Concern (VOC) announced by the World Health Organization (WHO). It's becoming increasingly difficult to keep these variants from spreading over the planet. The fifth wave has begun in several countries because of Omicron variant, and it is posing a threat to human civilization. As a result, we need effective vaccination that can tackle Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants that are bound to emerge. Therefore, the current study is an initiative to design a peptide-based chimeric vaccine that may potentially battle SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. As a result, the most relevant epitopes present in the mutagenic areas of Omicron spike protein were identified using a set of computational tools and immunoinformatic techniques to uncover common MHC-1, MHC-II, and B cell epitopes that may have the ability to influence the host immune mechanism. A final of three epitopes from CD8+ T-cell, CD4+ T-cell epitopes, and B-cell were shortlisted from spike protein, and that are highly antigenic, IFN- inducer, as well as overlapping for the construction of twelve vaccine models. As a result, the antigenic epitopes were coupled with a flexible and stable peptide linker, and the adjuvant was added at the N-terminal end to create a unique vaccine candidate. The structure of a 3D vaccine candidate was refined, and its quality was assessed by using web servers. However, the applied immunoinformatic study along with the molecular docking and simulation of 12 modeled vaccines constructs against six distinct HLAs, and TLRs (TLR2, and TLR4) complexes revealed that the V1 construct was non-allergenic, non-toxic, highly immunogenic, antigenic, and most stable. The vaccine candidate's stability was confirmed by molecular dynamics investigations. Finally, we studied the expression of the suggested vaccination using codon optimization and in-silico cloning. The current study proposed V1 Multi-Epitope Vaccine (MEV) as a significant vaccine candidate that may help the scientific community to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections.","output":"Immunoinformatic approach for the construction of multi-epitopes vaccine against omicron COVID-19 variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The state of Kuwait is facing a substantial challenge in responding to the spread of the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The government's decision to repatriate stranded citizens back to Kuwait from various COVID-19 epicenters has generated a great concern. It has heightened the need for prediction models to estimate the epidemic size. Mathematical modeling plays a pivotal role in predicting the spread of infectious diseases to enable policymakers to implement various health and safety measures to contain the spread. This research presents a forecast of the COVID-19 epidemic size in Kuwait based on the confirmed data. Deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches were used to estimate the size of COVID-19 spread in Kuwait and determine its ending phase. In addition, various simulation scenarios were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical intervention measures, particularly with time-varying infection rates and individual contact numbers. Results indicate that, with data until 19 April 2020 and before the repatriation plan, the estimated reproduction number in Kuwait is 2.2. It also confirms the efficiency of the containment measures of the state of Kuwait to control the spread even after the repatriation plan. The results show that a high contact rate among the population implies that the epidemic peak value is yet to be reached and that more strict intervention measures must be incorporated.","output":"Forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in kuwait using compartmental and logistic regression models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Myositis is a rare, underdiagnosed disease that presents in variable ways. Presentation is usually vague and non-specific. Physicians often attribute symptoms to deconditioning given the lack of objective findings at the first glance. DESCRIPTION: A 56-year-old African American woman who was diagnosed late with antisynthetase syndrome after progressing to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient initially presented to the hospital complaining of progressive symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue. She is a lifelong non-smoker and worked as a cook for 30 years with no significant occupational or environmental exposures. Initial vital signs were normal except for low oxygen saturation of 86% requiring 2 L oxygen. Physical exam was positive for trace lower extremity edema with no crackles or wheezing. Initial lab work was normal with negative COVID 19 test. Her CT scan revealed diffuse mild ground glass opacities. Echocardiogram showed grade I diastolic dysfunction. She was treated as heart failure and was started on diuretics without significant improvement. She was discharged on 2 L oxygen and diuretics. Her admissions recurred over the course of few months with progressive worsening of her imaging with diffuse GGO and increasing oxygen requirements for up to 5 L on exertion. Her symptoms of dyspnea progressed to the point where the patient was wheelchair bound and only able to walk a few feet. She was re admitted to the hospital and the pulmonary service was consulted. The patient was suspected of having a form of interstitial lung disease. Workup revealed normal ANA, RF, CCP, and ANCA. Her repeat echocardiogram revealed normal pulmonary artery pressures and normal ejection fraction. Her myositis panel showed positive PL1 antibodies and high CPK levels. A muscle biopsy was performed confirming necrotizing myopathy. The patient was diagnosed with antisynthetase syndrome. She was started on steroids then transitioned to Imuran with improvement in her symptoms. She is currently in pulmonary rehab and progressing as expected.

Due to low reserves in the body, especially under various catabolic conditions, tryptophan deficiency manifests itself rapidly, and both the serotonin and kynurenine pathways of metabolism are clinically significant in critically ill patients. In this review, we highlight these pathways as sources of serotonin and melatonin, which then regulate neurotransmission, influence circadian rhythm, cognitive functions, and the development of delirium. Kynurenines serve important signaling functions in inter-organ communication and modulate endogenous inflammation. Increased plasma kynurenine levels and kynurenine-tryptophan ratios are early indicators for the development of sepsis. They also influence the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and thereby the development of polyneuromyopathy in critically ill patients. The modulation of tryptophan metabolism could help prevent and treat age-related disease with low grade chronic inflammation as well as post intensive care syndrome in all its varied manifestations: cognitive decline (including delirium or dementia), physical impairment (catabolism, protein breakdown, loss of muscle mass and tone), and mental impairment (depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder).","output":"Tryptophan: A Unique Role in the Critically Ill"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"How does the gender of a political leader affect policy compliance of the public during a public health crisis?

In this regard, the current study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalized patients with and without CKD. Methods: This cross-sectional matched study was conducted on hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients with and without CKD admitted to Baqiyatallah Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from February 26, 2020 to March 26, 2020. The patients were homogenized in terms of age, gender, body mass index, and underlying diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. Demographic data, clinical symptoms, and laboratory and radiological findings were collected from patients' medical records and compared between the patients based on their CKD status. Results: Among the COVID-19 patients, 56 and 97 cases with and without CKD were investigated, respectively. In general, 111 (72.5%) patients with a mean age of 55 years were males. Patients with CKD had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and red cell distribution width (p<0.05). No differences were found regarding chest computed tomography findings, ICU admission, and death among COVID-19 patients with and without CKD. Conclusions: Overall, the findings support the use of red cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine for monitoring the COVID-19 patients with CKD and assessing the risk of disease progression. Eventually, managing comorbidities including hypertension and diabetes will reduce COVID-19 severity in CKD patients.

Past FOP studies have focused on the clinical aspects of the disease; therefore, there is a paucity of qualitative research on the patient experience. Our objective was to better understand the experience of children and adolescents living with FOP from their and their parents perspectives. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative research study comprising in-depth, open-ended interviews with children and adolescents with FOP and their parents. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via phone call or Microsoft Teams with parent-child dyads (n = 11), adolescents (n = 6), and two clinicians. Children/adolescents and their parents were asked open-ended questions to elicit their daily experience of FOP. RESULTS: Concepts were organized into two major themes: symptoms of FOP and the impact of FOP on daily life. Symptoms of FOP reported by children/adolescents, parents, and clinicians were pain, swelling, redness, and stiffness. Functional impacts of flares and FOP in general included accommodations, mobility, activities of daily living, daily activities, and social activities. Impacts were attributed to the difficulties children and adolescents faced living with a disease that prohibited common activities. CONCLUSIONS: This research documented the experience of children and adolescents with FOP and its effects on their daily lives. It provides a conceptual model for further exploration of the symptoms and impacts important to children and adolescents with FOP and their parents. Children and adolescents and their parents offered novel insights into life with the disease that have not previously been discussed in published literature. Future studies should build upon our conceptual model to create a holistic view of the patient experience of FOP, to inform clinical practice, and the assessment of the patient experience in clinical trials for the disease.

However, these studies have focused on a limited period after the implementation of lockdown policies. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of quarantine and reopening initiatives on admissions for varying types of injuries in pediatric patients. STUDY DESIGN: Registry data for an urban Level I pediatric trauma center were evaluated from April 1, 2018, to March 30, 2021. A timeline of local shutdown and reopening measures was established and used to partition the data into 6-month intervals. Data about demographics and injury characteristics were compared with similar intervals in 2018 and 2019 using appropriate statistical methodology for categorical, parametric, and nonparametric data. RESULTS: A total of 3,110 patients met criteria for inclusion. A total of 1,106 patients were admitted the year after the closure of schools and nonessential businesses. Decreases in overall admissions and evaluations for suspected child abuse noted early in the pandemic were not sustained during shutdown or reopening periods. However, we observed a 77% increase in all-terrain vehicle injuries, along with a 59% reduction in sports injuries (chi-square [8, N = 3,110] = 49.7; p < 0.001). Significant shifts in demographic and payor status were also noted. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to comprehensively examine the effects of quarantine and reopening policies on admission patterns for a pediatric trauma center in a metropolitan area. Total admissions and child abuse evaluations were not impacted. If shutdown measures are re-instituted, preventative efforts should be directed towards ATV use and recreational activities.","output":"Effect of Quarantine and Reopening Measures on Pediatric Trauma Admissions During the 2019 SARS-CoV2 Virus Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Perhaps the most important lesson learned from the COVID-19 pandemic is that of preparedness. Enhanced surveillance systems for early threat detection will be crucial to maximizing response time for implementation of public health measures and mobilization of resources in containing an emerging pandemic. Recent outbreaks have been dominated by viral pathogens, with RNA respiratory viruses being the most likely to have pandemic potential. These should therefore be a preparedness priority. Tools in the areas of virology, drug discovery, clinical pharmacology, translational medicine and pharmacometrics should be considered key components in the rapid identification and development of existing and novel interventions for a pandemic response. Prioritization of therapeutics should be based on in vitro activity, likelihood of achieving effective drug concentrations at the site of action, and safety profile at the doses that will be required for clinical efficacy. Deployment strategies must be tailored to the epidemiology of the disease, and the adequacy of the response should be re-evaluated in view of evolving epidemiological factors. An interdisciplinary framework integrating drug pharmacology, viral kinetics, epidemiology and health economics could help optimize the deployment strategy by improving decision-making around who to treat, when to treat, and with what type of intervention for optimal outcomes. Lastly, while an effective vaccine will ultimately end a pandemic, antiviral drug intervention guided by clinical pharmacology principles will continue to play a critical role in any pandemic response.","output":"Blueprint for pandemic response: Focus on translational medicine, clinical pharmacology and pharmacometrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose: Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), encompassing myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. We hypothesized that those biomarkers indicative of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) seen in large vessel occlusion (LVO) may also be elevated in T2D and further enhanced by stress conditions; therefore, these proteins represent potentially predictive biomarkers for those T2D patients at high risk of AIS. Methods: We performed an exploratory proteomic analysis in control subjects (n = 23) versus those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (n = 23) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp study to transient severe hypoglycemia [blood glucose <2.0 mmol/L (36 mg/dl)] in a prospective case-control study. We compared these proteins described as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AIS due to LVO: lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronic acid receptor-1 (LYVE1), thrombospondin-1 (THBS1), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP), and cadherin 1 (CDH1). Results: At baseline (BL), PPBP (p < 0.05), THBS1 (p < 0.05), and CDH1 (p < 0.01) were elevated in T2D; LYVE1 was not different between controls and T2D subjects at BL or at subsequent timepoints. PPBP and THBS1 tended to increase at hypoglycemia in both cohorts, though reached significance only in controls (p < 0.05), returning to BL levels post-hypoglycemia. CDH1 levels were higher in T2D at BL, at hypoglycemia and up to 2-h posthypoglycemia, thereafter reverting to BL levels. Conclusion: Elevated levels of PPBP, THBS1, and CDH1, circulatory proteins suggested as biomarkers of AIS due to LVO, may, in T2D patients, be prognostically indicative of a cohort of T2D patients at increased risk of ischaemic stroke.

In addition, the correlation between changes in mental health and lifestyles was evaluated. METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional study included 340 patients with diabetes who periodically visited our department. Changes in dietary habits, activities of daily living, and mental health before and during approximately six months after the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic were evaluated using a questionnaire, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. RESULTS: Approximately 20%, 30%, and over 50% of patients had worsened dietary habits, decreased activities of daily living, and deteriorated mental health, respectively. A multiple regression analysis showed that irregular meal timing was significantly associated with change in HbA1c (=0.328, p=0.001), and decreased walking time was significantly associated with changes in body weight (=-0.245, p=0.025). The change in fear and anxiety was positively associated with changes in meal timing regularity (r=0.129, p=0.019) and carbohydrate consumption (r=0.127, p=0.021). Subsequently, the change in depressed mood was positively associated with changes in carbohydrate (r=0.142, p=0.010) and alcohol (r=0.161, p=0.037) consumption, and the change in psychological stress was positively associated with changes in carbohydrates (r=0.183, p=0.001) and snack (r=0.151, p=0.008) consumption as well as sedentary time (r=0.158, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable medium-term impact on the lifestyle and mental health of patients with diabetes. Lifestyle changes were associated with glycemic and body weight control, and mental health changes were associated with lifestyle changes.

Here, we report a unique case of Type-1 CG associated to a CLL transformation diagnosed in the course of a human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection. Case presentation: A 91-year-old man was initially hospitalized for delirium. In a context of febrile rhinorrhea, the diagnosis of hMPV infection was made by molecular assay (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab. Owing to hyperlymphocytosis that developed during the course of the infection and unexplained peripheral neuropathy, a type-1 IgG Kappa CG secondary to a CLL was diagnosed. The patient was not treated for the CLL because of Binet A stage classification and his poor physical condition.

Objectives To assess the levels of COVID-19 associated psychological distress and fear amongst Southern German population, and to identify their coping strategies. Methods A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire was conducted in healthcare and community settings in the region of Ulm, Southern Germany. Assessment inventories were the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), which were valid and reliable tools. Results A total of 474 Individuals participated in the study. The mean age was 33.6 years, and 327 (69%) were females. Most participants (n = 381, 80.4%) had high levels of psychological distress, whereas only 5.1% had high levels of fear, and two-thirds of participants showed higher levels of coping. Moderate to very high levels of psychological distress were associated with being female, living alone, distress due to employment changes, experiencing financial impact, having multiple co-morbidities, being a smoker, increased alcohol use over the previous 6 months, contact with COVID-19 cases and healthcare providers for COVID-19-related stress. Individuals who were 60 years, lived with non-family members, had co-morbidities and visited a healthcare provider had higher levels of fear. Higher levels of education and income showed better coping amongst participants. Conclusion Psychological distress was very high during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and associated with low levels of coping.

Using an augmented theory of planned behavior (TPB), incorporating threat perceptions alongside the rational decision-making components of the TPB, the current study sought to identify predictors of blood donors' intentions to donate during two phases of an avian influenza outbreak. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Blood donors (n = 172) completed an on-line survey assessing the standard TPB predictors as well as measures of threat perceptions from the health belief model (i.e., perceived susceptibility and severity). Path analyses examined the utility of the augmented TPB to predict donors' intentions to donate during a low- and high-risk phase of an avian influenza outbreak. RESULTS In both phases, the model provided a good fit to the data explaining 69% (low risk) and 72% (high risk) of the variance in intentions. Attitude, subjective norm, and perceived susceptibility significantly predicted donor intentions in both phases. Within the low-risk phase, sex was an additional significant predictor of intention, while in the high-risk phase, perceived behavioral control was significantly related to intentions. CONCLUSIONS An augmented TPB model can be used to predict donors' intentions to donate blood in a low-risk and a high-risk phase of an outbreak of avian influenza. As such, the results provide important insights into donors' decision-making that can be used by blood agencies to maintain the blood supply in the context of an avian influenza outbreak.","output":"An examination of the predictors of blood donors' intentions to donate during two phases of an avian influenza outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND & AIMS Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have an imbalance in the gut microbiota that can lead to increase levels of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS), and indole-3 acetic acid (IAA). Among the therapeutic options for modulating gut microbiota are the bioactive compounds such as polyphenols present in cranberry, fruit with potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This clinical trial focuses on evaluating the effects of supplementation with a dry extract of cranberry on plasma levels of LPS and uremic toxins in non-dialysis CKD patients. METHODS It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomized into two groups: the cranberry group received 500 mg of dry cranberry extract (2 times daily), and the placebo group received 500 mg of corn starch (2 times daily) for two months. LPS plasma levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and uremic toxins (IS, p-CS, and IAA) by high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. Anthropometric measurements and food intake using the 24-h food recall technique were also evaluated before and after the intervention. RESULTS Twenty-five participants completed two months of supplementation: 12 patients in the cranberry group (8 women, 56.7  7.5 years, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 39.2  21.9 mL/min); 13 patients in the placebo group (9 women, 58.8  5.1 years, eGFR of 39.7  12.9 mL/min). As expected, there was a negative association between glomerular filtration rate and p-CS and IS plasma levels at the baseline. No change was observed in the uremic toxins and LPS levels.

This sudden switch from face\\\\to\\\\face teaching to online format prompted appropriate faculty training by the institutions. A university in Saudi Arabia organized a faculty development program to train its educators to design and implement a virtual classroom using the flipped teaching (FT) method. The flipped classroom is a student\\\\centered instructional design where students are expected to learn basic concepts on their own using resources provided by the instructor outside of class. The class time is used to rehearse and master this knowledge through discussion and application. Moving lectures outside of class allows opportunity to engage students with the content using student\\\\centered activities during class where more interaction between the faculty and students as well as among peers is expected. The present study tested the effectiveness of a remote faculty training program at an international institution in the development of their own remote flipped courses. The training was stretched over six biweekly sessions for which a course was created on Moodle, the Learning Management System. The participants (n=13) were guided to develop pre\\\\class assignments such as lecture videos, formative assessments to encourage students in pre\\\\class preparation, in\\\\class student engagement activities, and assessments. The faculty participants were given a pre\\\\ and a post\\\\training survey to learn about their knowledge, attitude, and confidence towards FT. The pre\\\\course survey results indicated that 62% of the participants had never tried FT and about 46% were not familiar with FT prior to receiving training while only 54% felt ready to flip. However, all participants intended to implement the FT method after completing the course. Following the training, all participants reportedly felt they could confidently flip their courses and implement FT strategies. All participants valued the training and hoped to reconvene monthly as a group to continue meeting as a group to share their remote FT experiences.

Nevertheless, we observe that the inconsistent input between training and testing when selecting the inside point will result in significant performance degradation. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning framework, named Inside Point Localization Network (IPL-Net), is proposed to infer the suitable position for the inside point to help the IOG algorithm. Concretely, when a user first clicks two outside points at the symmetrical corner locations of the target object, our proposed system automatically generates the sequence of movement to localize the inside point. We then perform the IOG interactive segmentation method for precisely segmenting the target object of interest. The inside point localization problem is difficult to define as a supervised learning framework because it is expensive to collect image and their corresponding inside points. Therefore, we formulate this problem as Markov Decision Process (MDP) and then optimize it with Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN). We train our network on the PASCAL dataset and demonstrate that the network achieves excellent performance.","output":"Automatic Inside Point Localization with Deep Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Object Segmentation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The size and heat sensitivity of Pleural effusion disease (PED) agent or virus (PEDV) propagated in rabbits were examined.

Rapid and accurate viral detection is a starting point in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic and flavivirus outbreaks. However, the shortage of diagnostic reagents and supplies, especially in resource-limited countries that experience co-circulation of SARS-CoV-2 and flaviviruses, are limitations that may result in lesser availability of RT-qPCR-based diagnostic tests. In this study, the utility of RNA-free extraction methods was assessed for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2 in heat-inactivated or chemical-inactivated samples. The findings demonstrate that direct real-time RT-qPCR is a feasible option in comparison to conventional real-time RT-qPCR based on viral genome extraction-based methods. The utility of heat-inactivation and direct real-time RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV-2, DENV-2 viral RNA detection was demonstrated by using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2 and spiked cell culture samples of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV-2. This study provides a simple alternative workflow for flavivirus and SARS-CoV-2 detection that includes heat inactivation and viral RNA extraction-free protocols, with aims to reduce the risk of exposure during processing of SARS-CoV-2 biological specimens and to overcome the supply-chain bottleneck, particularly in resource limited settings with flavivirus co-circulation.","output":"Direct Viral RNA Detection of SARS-CoV-2 and DENV in Inactivated Samples by Real-Time RT-qPCR: Implications for Diagnosis in Resource Limited Settings with Flavivirus Co-Circulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The implementation of evidence-based approaches by general practitioners (GPs) is new in the primary care setting, and few quantitative studies have evaluated the impact of contextual factors on the attendance of these approaches. METHODS: In total, 892 GPs from 75 community healthcare centers (CHCs) in Shanghai completed our survey. We used logistic regression to analyze factors affecting the number of evidence-based chronic disease programs attended by GPs and whether they had held the lead position in such a program. RESULTS: A total of 346 (38.8%) of the practitioners had never participated in any evidence-based chronic disease prevention (EBCDP) program. The EBCDP interventions in which the GPs had participated were predominantly related to hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. However, the proportion of GPs in the lead role was relatively low, between 0.8% (programs involving prevention and control of asthma) and 5.0% (diabetes). Organizational factors and areas were significantly associated with evidence-based practices (EBPs) of the GP, while monthly income and department were the most significantly related to GPs who have the lead role in a program. The results indicated that GPs who had taken the lead position had higher scores for policy and economic impeding factors. GPs who were men, had a higher income, and worked in prevention and healthcare departments and urban areas were more likely to take the lead position.

Personal, organizational, political, and economic factors and the factors of female sex, lower income, department type, and suburban area environment should be considered to facilitate the translation of evidence to practice.","output":"Impact of Contextual Factors on the Attendance and Role in the Evidence-Based Chronic Disease Prevention Programs Among Primary Care Practitioners in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: This study assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute upper limb referrals and operative case-mix at the beginning and ease of British lockdown. Methods: A longitudinal multicentre observational cohort study was conducted for both upper limb trauma referrals and operative case-mix over a 12-week period (6 weeks from the beginning and 6 weeks from the ease of the national lockdown). Statistical analysis included median ( median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios, and Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p  0.05. Results: There was a 158% (n = 456 vs. 177) increase in upper limb referrals and 133% (n = 91 vs. 39) increase in the operative trauma caseload at the ease of lockdown compared with its commencement.

Methods Four databases were searched; PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library in August 2020 for post 2010 literature on OHCA in adults. Critical outcomes were chest compression depth, rate and fraction. Important outcomes were any return of spontaneous circulation, survival to hospital and survival to discharge. Results A total of 9464 studies were identified with 61 eligibility for full text screening. A total of eight studies was included in the meta-analysis. Five studies investigated real-time feedback and three investigated post-event feedback. Meta-analysis revealed that real-time feedback statistically improves compression depth and rate while post-event feedback improved depth and fraction. Feedback did not statistically improve patient outcome but an improvement in absolute numbers revealed a clinical effect of feedback. Heterogenity varied from \\"might not be important\\" to \\"considerable\\". Conclusion To significantly improve CPR quality real-time and post-event feedback should be combined. Neither real-time nor post event feedback could statistically be associated with patient outcome however, a clinical effect was detected.

Three operational challenges with CAR-T therapy include the following: (1) the logistics of toxicity monitoring, ie, with frequent vital sign checks and neurologic assessments; (2) the specialized knowledge required for toxicity management, particularly with regard to CRS and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome; and (3) the need for high-quality symptomatic and supportive care during this intensive period.

JUUL Labs (JUUL) insists they do not market their product to teenagers. We created several scenarios to estimate the percentages of JUUL's net revenue from adults and youth in the US in 2018. METHODS: We used the number of youth (aged 12-17 years) and adults (aged 18 years) who reported using JUUL in the nationally representative Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study wave 4 (Dec 2016-Jan 2018) to estimate the youth proportion of JUUL users. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used data from the nationally representative Truth Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) study to estimate the youth proportion of JUUL users. Based on this percentage, we then applied several scenarios to estimate JUUL's net revenue from youth in the US in 2018. RESULTS: From the PATH Study, 31% of JUUL users were youth (aged 12-17 years). In the TLC study, 30% of current JUUL users were aged 15-17 years. Given that JUUL's net revenue was $1.3 billion in 2018, we calculated that JUUL made between $130 million and $650 million of its net revenue from youth, depending on consumption scenarios.

Microbial association network inference is of great significance in applications on clinical diagnosis, disease treatment, pathological analysis, etc. However, most current network inference methods focus on mining strong pairwise associations between microorganisms, which is defective in reflecting the comprehensive interactive patterns participated by multiple microorganisms. It is also possible that the microorganisms involved in the generated network are not dominant in the microbiome due to the mere focus on the strength of pairwise associations. Some scholars tried to mine comprehensive microbial associations by association rule mining methods, but the adopted algorithms are relatively basic and have severe limitations such as low calculation efficiency, lacking the ability of mining negative correlations and high redundancy in results, making it difficult to mine high-quality microbial association rules and accurately infer microbial association networks.

Because social factors cannot cause a trauma outcome directly, there must exist mediating causal factors related to the nature and severity of the injury, the robustness of the victim, access to care, or processes of care. An understanding these mediators is the point of departure for addressing inequities in outcomes. FINDINGS: Data were extracted from the registry of the Trauma Quality Improvement Program of the American College of Surgeons for 2007 through 2010. Inclusion criteria were age less than 19 years and head Abbreviated Injury Scale score of 4, 5, or 6. An Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition was undertaken to analyze the relative contributions of a large set of covariates to the difference in mortality rates between Black and White children. Covariates were aggregated into the following categories: Severity, Structure and Process, Mechanism, Demographics, and Insurance. Eligible for analysis were 7273 White children and 2320 Black children. There were 1661 deaths (17.3%) The raw mortality rates were 15.6 and 22.8% for White and Black children, respectively. Factors categorized as Severity accounted for 95% of the mortality difference, Mechanism accounted for 13%, Insurance accounted for 5%, and Demographics accounted for 2%. The contribution of Structure and Process did not attain statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of injury accounts for most of the disparity between Black and White children in traumatic brain injury mortality rates.

METHODS: A qualitative research approach was used to undertake interviews with 45 Royal Melbourne Hospital medical and nursing staff from emergency, intensive care and infectious diseases. Interview questions captured data on HCWs' role, familiarity with using protocols, psychological attributes and training for scenarios related to VHF patient management. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Categorical responses were analysed quantitatively and open-ended responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of participants indicated feeling capable of undertaking their role in managing VHF patients; 77% felt supported through personnel/resources. However, 69% indicated barriers to managing these patients effectively; and 68% felt anxious at the prospect of managing VHF patients. Themes emerging from participants' observations included concerns about training frequency, miscommunication, difficulty with uncertainty, feeling underprepared, and fear of transmitting infection to others.

Perceptions of interviewed staff have fed into recommendations to increase HCW preparedness and reduce anxiety, which include investigating support services, and exploring training options that create multi-departmental groups of highly specialised medical officers and nurses.","output":"Knowledge, attitudes and practices of healthcare workers within an Australian tertiary hospital to managing high-consequence infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The year 2020 has seen an unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic due to the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus in 180 countries. In a desperate effort to discover new drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, many scientists are working around the clock. Their valuable time and effort may benefit from computer-based mining of a large volume of health science literature that is a treasure trove of information. In this paper, we have developed a graph-based model using abstracts of 10,683 scientific articles to find key information on three topics: transmission, drug types, and genome research related to coronavirus. A subgraph is built for each of the three topics to extract more topic-focused information. Within each subgraph, we use a betweenness centrality measurement to rank order the importance of keywords related to drugs, diseases, pathogens, hosts of pathogens, and biomolecules. The results reveal intriguing information about antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Amantadine, Dexamethasone), pathogen-hosts (pigs, bats, macaque, cynomolgus), viral pathogens (zika, dengue, malaria, and several viruses in the coronaviridae virus family), and proteins and therapeutic mechanisms (oligonucleotide, interferon, glycoprotein) in connection with the core topic of coronavirus.

In the present study, soybean hull polysaccharide (SHP) was separated and purified to obtain three main fractions (F1, F2 and F3), and their chemical and monosaccharide compositions were analyzed. SHP was mainly composed of carbohydrates (64.3%), proteins (16.2%) and sulfates (12.5%), with minor levels of uronic acid (3.2%), and predominantly contained glucose and mannose as monosaccharides. Moreover, when compared with cells treated with RPMI medium, SHP was revealed to promote the proliferation and pinocytosis of RAW264.7 cells, and to enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-, interleukin (IL)-1? and IL-6. Furthermore, flow cytometry demonstrated that CD11b and CD40 were involved in the immune regulation of RAW264.7 cells by SHP. Moreover, western blotting and other experiments revealed that SHP, a type of pathogen-associated molecular pattern, was specifically recognized by the Toll-like receptor 2, which, in turn, upregulated the expression levels of proteins downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor B pathways. Notably, the immune activity of the F2 fraction was markedly higher than that of the crude polysaccharides. In summary, the purified F2 fraction of SHP may be an effective nutritional supplement for human disorders associated with low immunity.","output":"Immunostimulatory activity of soybean hull polysaccharide on macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Aims: Police personnel have been key frontline workers throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study was conducted to assess the correlates and outcomes of critically ill police personnel. Methods: This retrospective observational study analyzed key parameters of hospitalized police personnel who were critically ill with COVID-19 in Andhra Pradesh, India, between June and October 2020. Survival was analyzed for correlation with body mass index, ABO/Rh blood group, co-morbidities, treatment (oxygen therapy, prone positioning, mechanical ventilation, remdesivir, Ivermectin, oral and nasal topical povidone-iodine). We also performed Cox proportional hazard analysis with relevant function plots. Results: The majority of the 266 patients were male (n = 259; 97.4%) and obese (75.2%). The overall mortality of patients was 38% (n = 101). COVID-19 mortality increased significantly with age (p = 0.019) and BMI (p = 0.030) in the bivariate analysis. There was no significant difference between blood group (p = 0.297), co-morbidity (p = 0.582) and COVID-19 outcome. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were males (HR 4.89, 95% CI: 1.020-23.430) and ventilator therapy (HR 7.5, 95% CI: 4.527-12.296).

Various measures that focus on restricting social contacts have been implemented in order to reduce the spread of the virus. Understanding how daily activities and travel behaviour change during such global crisis and the reasons behind is crucial for developing suitable strategies for similar future events and analysing potential mid- and long-term impacts. METHODS: In order to provide empirical insights into changes in travel behaviour during the first Coronavirus-related lockdown in 2020 for Germany, an online survey with a relative representative sample for the German population was conducted a week after the start of the nationwide contact ban. The data was analysed performing descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results suggest in general an increase in car use and decrease in public transport use as well as more negative perception of public transport as a transport alternative during the pandemic. Regarding activity-related travel patterns, the findings show firstly, that the majority of people go less frequent shopping; simultaneously, an increase in online shopping can be seen and characteristics of this group were analysed. Secondly, half of the adult population still left their home for leisure or to run errands; young adults were more active than all other age groups. Thirdly, the majority of the working population still went to work; one out of four people worked in home-office.

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. GOALS: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. METHODS: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. ENVIRONMENTAL FINDINGS: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources C coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. ECOSYSTEM FINDINGS: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. HUMAN HEALTH FINDINGS: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase childrens risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals C phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste C can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South C environmental injustice on a planetary scale. CONCLUSIONS: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earths resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. RECOMMENDATIONS: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.","output":"Human Health and Ocean Pollution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"New viral respiratory pathogens are emerging with increasing frequency and have potentially devastating impacts on the population worldwide.

Whether it is associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is still under debating. Here, we performed genomic sequence alignment analysis of the genome of SARS-Cov-2 (Wuhan-hu-1) to the human genome reference. Sequence analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab1056-1173 presented high identities with the human protein PAPR1453-176(3Q6Z_A). After searching the fully sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes deposited in GISAID (https://www.gisaid.org/), we detected 170 SARS-CoV-2 variants with mutation in ORF1ab1061, where alanine (A) was substituted by serine (S). This alteration made a 7-amino acid peptide (VVVNASN) in ORF1ab1056-1062 identical to its counterpart in PARP1453-59(3Q6Z_A). HLA prediction suggested that the peptides with high identities in PARP14 and ORF1ab could be presented by a same globally prevalent HLA-A*11:01 molecule. And in consistent with the first reported case of hepatitis of unknown, SARS-CoV-2 ORF1abVVVNASN variants were mostly identified as Delta lineages in UK by the late 2021, with an overall frequency of 0.00161%. Thus, our preliminary results raised a possibility that infection by SARS-CoV-2 ORF1abVVVNASN variant might elicit an autoimmune T cell response via epitope mimicry and is associated with the outbreak of unknown hepatitis.

This report describes the team design, the activities performed before and during the deployment, analyzes the pathology encountered, and shares lessons learned from the mission. SOURCES: Data were collected from the delegation protocols and IDF medical records. All activities of the Israeli delegation were coordinated with the local government. OBSERVATIONS: The local authorities reported that a total of 107 people were killed and more than 700 people were wounded. The team was the first international team to arrive at the scene and assisted the local medical teams to treat 231 patients in the three local hospitals and 213 patients in field clinics in the villages surrounding Bata. The COVID-19 pandemic influenced the operation of this mission, and caution measures were activated. ANALYSIS: Unplanned explosions at munitions sites (UEMS) are a growing problem causing the medical teams to face unique challenges. By understanding the expected challenges, the team was reinforced with a plastic surgeon, portable ultrasound devices, a large amount and a variety of antibiotics, whole blood units, and freeze-dried plasma.

Amongst many symptoms like myalgia, headache, cough, breathless; fatigue is one of the major symptoms which makes the patient severely debilitated. Research on PCS, in particular fatigue, in patients with diabetes has not been done. METHODOLOGY: In this prospective study, we included patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had COVID-19 infection (mild to moderate severity), and matched T2D patients who did not suffer from COVID-19 infection. Demography, anthropometry, glycemic measures, treatment, COVID-19 infection details were recorded. Symptoms were scored using Chalder Fatigue Scale (reported as fatigue score, FS) and handgrip strength (in kg) was recorded by Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were included (cases, 52, controls, 56). Both groups were matched for age, duration of diabetes, BMI, TSH and vitamin D levels. T2D patients with COVID-19 infection had significant more fatigue when compared with patients without COVID-19 infection but comparable handgrip strength. Furthermore, patients with T2D with previous COVID-19 infection and who had FS >4 have had significant higher inflammation markers during acute illness, and post COVID-19, had increased post prandial blood glucose levels, lost more weight, had reduced physical activity and significantly lower handgrip strength as compared to those with FS <4. CONCLUSION: Patients with T2D who had COVID-19 infection as compared to those without had significantly more fatigue after the acute illness, and those with higher fatigue score had reduced handgrip strength indicating sarcopenia.

Detecting this disease from lung CT scan images is perhaps one of the fastest ways to diagnose patients. However, finding the presence of infected tissues and segment them from CT slices faces numerous challenges, including similar adjacent tissues, vague boundary, and erratic infections. To eliminate these obstacles, we propose a two-route convolutional neural network (CNN) by extracting global and local features for detecting and classifying COVID-19 infection from CT images. Each pixel from the image is classified into the normal and infected tissues. For improving the classification accuracy, we used two different strategies including fuzzy c-means clustering and local directional pattern (LDN) encoding methods to represent the input image differently. This allows us to find more complex pattern from the image. To overcome the overfitting problems due to small samples, an augmentation approach is utilized.

METHODS: It is a retrospective cohort study of patients older than 18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 infection that required mechanical ventilation (MV) for at least 24 hours between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020. Atypical ARDS was defined as driving pressure is less than 15 cm H2O throughout the period of MV, suggesting compliant lung based on the currently available evidence (Amato, Marcelo BP, et al., 2015). If it was impossible to maintain driving pressure less than 15 cm H2O for more than two days, the case was defined as classic ARDS with low compliance. Patients who required mechanical ventilation not more than 24 hours or expired within 24 hours since intubated and those transferred to another hospital were excluded. Patients who received remdesivir were also excluded because 95% of the patients did not receive it during their index hospitalization. The outcome was adjusted by age, sex, days of onset to ICU, the severity of illness estimated by APACHE score, and severity of ARDS based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients that required mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 induced ARDS during the study period were reviewed per inclusion and exclusion criteria. In-hospital mortality of 30 patients of the atypical ARDS group was 50% during the index hospitalization whereas it was 53 % for 30 patients of the classic ARDS group (p=0.80) when both were treated with the same ARDS protocol, including low tidal volume and higher PEEP. The average duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay was 10.23, 12.33, and 12.93 days for the atypical ARDS group, respectively, compared to 16.57, 18.33, and 19.33 for the classic ARDS group (p=0.003, 0.011, and 0.004, respectively). The classic ARDS group required prone positioning (67% vs. 37%;p=0.02) and use of paralytics (73% vs. 43%;p=0.018) more frequently compared to the atypical ARDS group. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study of 60 patients that required mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 induced ARDS between January 20, 2020, and April 30, 2020, in-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the atypical ARDS group and the classic ARDS group. However, the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay was significantly shorter in the atypical ARDS group compared to the classic ARDS group. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation between the two groups may suggest a different pathophysiologic process and a need for a different approach to COVID-induced ARDS depending on lung compliance.

The transmission of such pathogens to humans may lead to self-sustaining chains of transmission. These pathogens represent the highest risk for future pandemics. For their prevention, the transmission over the species barrier - although rare - should, by all means, be avoided. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, surprisingly though, most of the current research concentrates on the control by drugs and vaccines, while comparatively little scientific inquiry focuses on future prevention. Already in 2012, the World Bank recommended to engage in a systemic One Health approach for zoonoses control, considering integrated surveillance-response and control of human and animal diseases for primarily economic reasons. First examples, like integrated West Nile virus surveillance in mosquitos, wild birds, horses and humans in Italy show evidence of financial savings from a closer cooperation of human and animal health sectors. Provided a zoonotic origin can be ascertained for the COVID-19 pandemic, integrated wildlife, domestic animal and humans disease surveillance-response may contribute to prevent future outbreaks. In conclusion, the earlier a zoonotic pathogen can be detected in the environment, in wildlife or in domestic animals; and the better human, animal and environmental surveillance communicate with each other to prevent an outbreak, the lower are the cumulative costs.","output":"Towards integrated surveillance-response systems for the prevention of future pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Currently many organizations have adopted the development of software projects with agile methodologies, particularly Scrum, which has more than 20 years of development.

Chronic inflammation allows the host to recover or adapt through cellular and humoral responses, whereas acute inflammation leads to cytokine storms resulting in tissue damage. In this review, we present the overlapping outcomes of cancer inflammation with virus-induced inflammation. The study emphasises how anti-inflammatory drugs that work against cancer inflammation may work against the inflammation caused by the viral infection. It is established that the cytokine storm induced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to disease-associated mortality. While cancer remains the second among the diseases associated with mortality worldwide, cancer patients' mortality rates are often observed upon extended periods after illness, usually ranging from months to years. However, the mortality rates associated with COVID-19 disease are robust. The cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection appeared to be responsible for the multi-organ failure and increased mortality rates. Since both cancer and COVID-19 disease share overlapping inflammatory mechanisms, repurposing some anticancer and anti-inflammatory drugs for COVID-19 may lower mortality rates. Here, we review some of these inflammatory mechanisms and propose some potential chemotherapeutic agents to intervene in them. We also discuss the repercussions of anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids and hydroxychloroquine with zinc or antiviral drugs such as ivermectin and remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2 induced cytokine storm.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in 9954 recruits in the Korean Army Training Center with the general Korean population age <30 years between September and November, 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS At the Korean Army Training Center, samples were taken from 9954 men from September to November, 2020. Participants were randomly enlisted healthy adult men. The data were compared with 4,205,265 samples from the Korean general population. Men age <30 years were used, as this is similar to the age range of the military recruits. RESULTS Among military recruits, 31 subjects (0.31%) were positive for the antibody, while the Korean male population had 3757 (0.09%) positive individuals. Among these 31 men, 13 were previously diagnosed by PCR, while 18 (58.06%) had no history related to the disease. Positive military recruits were mostly from 2 regional clusters. The first cluster was Daegu and Gyeongbuk areas (1.97% and 0.80%, respectively), which had an outbreak in March, 2020. The second cluster was Gyeonggi and Seoul, or capital areas (0.23% and 0.20%, respectively), which currently has high PCR positivity. Overall, seroprevalence was 3.49 times higher in study subjects.

Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing respiratory sampling strategies for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The inclusion criteria were studies that assessed at least two respiratory sampling sites (oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, and sputum) in participants with COVID-19.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The literature on PEEK in implant prosthodontics published through August 2018 was identified with an online search of MEDLINE (via PubMed), Science Direct, Embase (via Ovid), and Google Scholar databases. Qualitative and quantitative syntheses were carried out for original research studies. RESULTS The amount of published original research studies was found to be limited. PEEK was found to be applied as a material in the fabrication of implant-supported fixed dental prosthesis (IFDP) frameworks (43%), prosthetic implant abutments (35%), implant abutment screws (15%), and retention clips on implant bars (7%). Only 38% of the studies were clinical studies, while 15% were observational and 47% were in vitro. The studies identified did not permit the estimation of long-term survival nor success rates for any of the prosthetic components. The results only allowed a preliminary short-term assessment of PEEK IFDP frameworks, which presented satisfactory survival but alarming success rates over the first year of service. CONCLUSION In light of the paucity of evidence on the viability of PEEK as an implant-prosthodontic material, its use cannot yet be endorsed.

In most studies, though, there have been no repetitions of items within a list, or occasionally a single repetition. These stimuli differ from the common uses of item series, which often include multiple repetitions (e.g., identification numbers; orders of people at a restaurant table). To begin to understand such cases we presented lists that, in some trial blocks, were constructed with no restrictions on repetitions. Specifically, we examined immediate serial recall of visually-presented, nine-digit lists, either spatially separated into three separate groups of three digits (Experiment 1) or undivided (Experiment 2). Many of the lists included single or multiple repetitions of digits, with repeated digits either adjacent or non-adjacent in an unpredictable manner. We assessed theoretical expectations derived from prior research. Effects of repetition were often helpful but, when repetitions favoured a grouping that conflicted with the presented grouping into threes in Experiment 1, repetition was disadvantageous. We suggest a theoretical analysis in which participants can use presented grouping cues or, when those cues are absent, create their own groupings to exploit repetitions among the stimuli.","output":"Immediate recall of serial numbers with or without multiple item repetitions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Article title: Chinese Citizen Satisfaction with Government Performance during COVID-19 Authors: Wu, C , Shi, Z , Wilkes, R , Wu, J , Gong, Z , He, N , Xiao, Z , Zhang, X , Lai, W , Zhou, D , Zhao, F , Yin, X , Xiong, P , Zhou, H , Chu, Q , Cao, L , Tian, R , Tan, Y , Yang, L , He, Z , Fairbrother, M , Mews, J , &amp;Giordano, G N Journal:Journal of Contemporary ChinaDOI:https://doi org/10 1080/10670564 2021 1893558 When the article was first published online, the author list was incomplete The author list has now been updated and reads as follows: Cary Wua, Zhilei Shib, Rima Wilkesc, Jiaji Wud, Zhiwen Gonge, Nengkun Hef, Zang Xiaog, Xiaojun Zhangh, Weijun Laii, Dongxia Zhoub, Feng Zhaoj, Xiufang Yink, Ping Xiongl, Hao Zhoum, Qinghua Chun, Libin Cao, Ruijing Tianp, Yu Tanq, Liyong Yangr, Zexuan Hes, Malcolm Fairbrothert, Jan Mewsw, and Giuseppe Nicola GiordanowaYork University, Canada;bZhongnan University of Economics and Law, China;cUniversity of British Columbia, Canada;dDonghua University, China;eUniversity of Science and Technology Beijing, China;fChongqing University of Arts and Sciences;gChengdu University, China;hFuzhou University, China;iShenzhen University, China;jHubei University of Economics, China;kAnhui Polytechnic University, China;lChongqing Finance and Economics College, China;mZhejiang University of Finance &amp;Economics, China;nGuilin University of Technology, China;East China University of Technology, China;pWuhan Polytechnic University, China;qHubei Minzu University, China;rYuxi Normal University, China;sEdinburgh University, UK;tUme?

Although it is well known that positive and negative affective states bear important cognitive/behavioral consequences, the effect of emotional experiences on decision-making remains unclear due to the existence of many conflicting results. Inspired by the need to understand if and to what extent the current COVID-19 pandemic has determined changes in our decision-making processes by means of the unusual, prolonged experience of negative feelings, in this study we investigate the effect of anger, fear, sadness, physical and moral disgust on intertemporal and risky choices. Results show that all emotions significantly increase subjects preferences for immediate rewards over delayed ones, and for risky rewards over certain ones, in comparison to a neutral emotion condition, although the magnitude of the effect differs across emotions. In particular, we observed a more pronounced effect in the case of sadness and moral disgust. These findings contribute to the literature on emotions and decision-making by offering an alternative explanation to the traditional motivational appraisal theories. Specifically, we propose that the increased preference for immediate gratification and risky outcomes serves as a mechanism of self-reward aimed at down-regulating negative feelings and restore the individuals emotional balance.","output":"I Feel Therefore I Decide: Effect of Negative Emotions on Temporal Discounting and Probability Discounting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Randomized placebo-controlled trials are considered to be the gold standard in clinical research and have the highest importance in the hierarchical system of evidence-based medicine. However, from the viewpoint of decision makers, due to lower external validity, practical results of efficacy research are often not in line with the huge investments made over decades. METHOD We conducted a narrative review. With a special focus on homeopathy, we give an overview on cohort, comparative cohort, case-control and cross-sectional study designs and explain guidelines and tools that help to improve the quality of observational studies, such as the STROBE Statement, RECORD, GRACE and ENCePP Guide. RESULTS Within the conventional medical research field, two types of arguments have been employed in favor of observational studies. First, observational studies allow for a more generalizable and robust estimation of effects in clinical practice, and if cohorts are large enough, there is no over-estimation of effect sizes, as is often feared. We argue that observational research is needed to balance the current over-emphasis on internal validity at the expense of external validity. Thus, observational research can be considered an important research tool to describe \\"real-world\\" care settings and can assist with the design and inform the results of randomised controlled trails.

RECENT FINDINGS The expanding epizootic of avian A/H5N1 influenza and increasing number of human cases heighten concern regarding the threat of pandemic influenza. Studies of the 1918 pandemic virus have shown the potential for direct interspecies transmission from an avian host. In the absence of an effective vaccine, antiviral agents could provide an important response measure. Inadequate supplies and potential antiviral resistance are limiting factors. Seasonal influenza heavily affects infants and young children, who also serve to foster transmission at the community level, findings that indicate the need for broader immunization strategies in pediatric populations. Like avian influenza, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was a zoonotic infection, perhaps derived from related coronaviruses in bats. Molecular diagnostic techniques have led to the recent identification of several new coronaviruses and a respiratory parvovirus. It has also helped to define the impact of previously described ones such as human metapneumovirus and rhinoviruses, which account for the majority of asthma exacerbations and frequent lower respiratory tract illnesses.

Yet, the true amount of infections is unknown and believed to exceed the reported numbers by several fold, depending on national testing policies that can strongly affect the proportion of undetected cases. To overcome this testing bias and better assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, we propose a genome-based computational pipeline, GInPipe, to reconstruct the SARS-CoV-2 incidence dynamics through time. After validating GInPipe against in silico generated outbreak data, as well as more complex phylodynamic analyses, we use the pipeline to reconstruct incidence histories in Denmark, Scotland, Switzerland, and Victoria (Australia) solely from viral sequence data. The proposed method robustly reconstructs the different pandemic waves in the investigated countries and regions, does not require phylodynamic reconstruction, and can be directly applied to publicly deposited SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data sets. We observe differences in the relative magnitude of reconstructed versus reported incidences during times with sparse availability of diagnostic tests. Using the reconstructed incidence dynamics, we assess how testing policies may have affected the probability to diagnose and report infected individuals. We find that under-reporting was highest in mid 2020 in all analysed countries, coinciding with liberal testing policies at times of low test capacities. Due to the increased use of real-time sequencing, it is envisaged that GInPipe can complement established surveillance tools to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and evaluate testing policies.

The aim of the study was to predict the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, using a score based on LUS findings. MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational, retrospective study was conducted on patients admitted to Niguarda hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia during the period of a month, from March 2nd to April 3rd 2020. Demographics, clinical, laboratory, and radiological findings were collected. LUS was performed in all patients. The chest was divided into 12 areas. The LUS report was drafted using a score from 0 to 3 with 0 corresponding to A pattern, 1 corresponding to well separated vertical artifacts (B lines), 2 corresponding to white lung and small consolidations, 3 corresponding to wide consolidations. The total score results from the sum of the scores for each area. The primary outcome was endotracheal intubation, no active further management, or death. The secondary outcome was discharge from the emergency room (ER). RESULTS 255 patients were enrolled. 93.7 % had a positive LUS. ETI was performed in 43 patients, and 24 received a DNI order. The general mortality rate was 15.7 %. Male sex (OR 3.04, p = 0.014), cardiovascular disease and hypertension (OR 2.75, p = 0.006), P/F (OR 0.99, p < 0.001) and an LUS score > 20 (OR 2.52, p = 0.046) were independent risk factors associated with the primary outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for an LUS score > 20 was performed with an AUC of 0.837. Independent risk factors associated with the secondary outcome were age (OR 0.96, p = 0.073), BMI (OR 0.87, p = 0,13), P/F (OR 1.03, p < 0.001), and LUS score < 10 (OR 20.9, p = 0.006). ROC curve analysis was performed using an LUS score < 10 with an AUC 0.967. CONCLUSION The extent of lung abnormalities evaluated by LUS score is a predictor of a worse outcome, ETI, or death.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Telephone survey on a pre-existing cohort of older adults with multimorbidity in primary care. METHOD: Mental health and health service utilisation outcomes were compared with the outcomes before the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong using paired t-tests, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test, and McNemar's test. Loneliness was measured by the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. The secondary outcomes (anxiety, depression, and insomnia) were measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool, and the Insomnia Severity Index. Appointments attendance data were extracted from a computerised medical record system.

The question of whether reproductive coercion (RC) influences these outcomes has received increased attention. Little is known about whether RC is independently associated with contraceptive use and having a sexually transmitted disease (STD) among African American female adolescents. Materials and Methods: Survey data for self-identified African American young women 14-19 years of age (n = 735) who accessed services at a publicly funded clinic were used to assess the extent of RC, the association between RC and other forms of intimate partner violence (IPV), and whether RC was independently associated with contraceptive use and an STD diagnosis. Results: Approximately 20% of participants had experienced RC; there was a statistically significant bivariate association between RC and other forms of IPV. In multivariate analyses, experiencing two or more forms of RC (vs. not experiencing any RC) was associated with reduced odds of contraceptive use in the past 3 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24-0.76) and with increased odds of having an STD (aOR = 2.43; 95% CI = 2.35-4.37). Experiencing only one type of RC and experiencing other forms of IPV were not associated with the outcomes. Although ease of partner communication (aOR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.80-0.98) was associated with having an STD, few other psychosocial variables were associated with the outcomes.

Anxiety and depression are the most common mental health problems among people during the pandemic, and many studies have reported anxiety and depressive symptoms in college students. However, information on the mental health status of international medical students during this critical period of time has been scarce, which hinders the efforts in making proper policy or strategies to help these students. The present study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in international medical students in China and to find out the factors that have potential predictive value for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out for international medical students during November 2020 at China Medical University in Shenyang, China. Five hundred and nineteen international students were interviewed with questionnaires containing demographic variables, Stressors in school, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) and Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Univariate logistic regression and stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted where appropriate to explore the predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in the sample population was 28.5% (148/519) and 31.6% (164/519), respectively. Stressors in school ( = 0.176, OR = 1.192, CI: 1.102C1.289), negative coping style ( = 0.639, OR = 1.894, CI: 1.287C2.788) and perceived stress ( = 0.230, OR = 1.258, CI: 1.184C1.337) were found to be the predictors of anxiety symptoms among the international medical students; while gender ( = ?0.594, OR = 0.552, CI: 0.315C0.968), stay up late ( = 0.828, OR = 2.288, CI: 1.182C4.431), current place of residence ( = 1.082, OR = 2.951, CI: 1.256C6.931), stressors in the school ( = 0.303, OR = 1.354, CI: 1.266C1.496), negative coping style ( = 0.866, OR = 2.377, CI: 1.516C3.725), perceived stress ( = 0.233, OR = 1.262, CI: 1.180C1.351) were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was moderate among international medical students in China. The communal predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms were stressors in school, negative coping style and perceived stress; while demographic factors such as gender (male), stay up late at night and current place of residence were found associated with depressive symptoms.

This aim of this study was to test whether blood urea nitrogen-to-creatinine ratio (BCR) is a predictor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Ranges of normal BCR values were calculated from 9165 healthy subjects, and 337 and 79 COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort and the validation cohort, respectively. Prognostic factor of death incidence was selected by LASSO regression analyses. The prognostic ability of BCR range was assessed by logistic regression analysis. A nomogram for predicting in-hospital mortality based on BCR was developed. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated with respect to its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness. RESULTS: Among 337 COVID-19 patients, 13.4% and 11.3% were classified into higher and lower than normal range group, respectively. KaplanCMeier curves for all-cause mortality showed that patients with higher BCR group had worse prognosis (P<0.0001). BCR above the normal range was independently associated with death in COVID-19 patients (OR: 7.54; 95%CI: 1.55C36.66; P=0.012). The nomogram had good discrimination in the training cohort (C-index 0.838; 0.795C0.880) and the validation cohort (C-index 0.929; 0.869C0.989), and good calibration.

With sometimes rapid deterioration they may require veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as an immediate life-saving technique, which is a time-limited solution. The technique of pulmonary artery to left atrium (PA-LA) shunt fitted with an oxygenator enables bridging the patient to transplant for a longer time period. This low-resistance paracorporeal pumpless lung assist device allows for de-adaptation of the right ventricle back to lower afterload before the lung transplantation is carried out. The PA-LA shunt with an oxygenator also conveys a risk of multiple complications with reported median of 10 to 26 days until transplant. We report a case of pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis in a 35-year-old female who had to wait for donor lungs during the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 for 143 days on PA-LA shunt with oxygenator and subsequently 51 days on VA-ECMO. The extremely long course associated with multiple complications including three cerebral embolisms, episodes of sepsis and ingrowth of the return cannula into the left ventricular wall gives insight into the limits of this bridging technique.","output":"A patient with pulmonary hypertension waiting for donor lungs during the pandemic: 194 days on extracorporeal life support including 143 days on pulmonary artery to left atrium shunt."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As we head toward more than 34 million cases of Coronavirus disease of 2019 and a million deaths worldwide, there is an urgent need to control the spread and recover the patients as soon as possible.

It has achieved success in complex problems like the detection of cancerous tumors, skin cancer, and diabetic retinopathy. In this study, considering the power and ability of deep learning, we will study the possibilities and role of deep learning in detecting COVID-19. Several deep learning models can be used to monitor, detect, and predict the spread of the virus. The convolutional neural network has great potential to detect COVID-19 as it is currently used to detect pneumonia using chest X-ray images. This knowledge is used to build a model to detect the presence of COVID-19 which gives a high accuracy with minimum error percentage. The model is highly capable of detecting patients with COVID-19.

However, even countries with high vaccination rates still see surges in case numbers and high numbers of hospitalized patients. The development of antiviral treatments hence remains a top priority in preventing hospitalization and death of COVID-19 patients, and eventually bringing an end to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains several essential enzymatic activities embedded within its non-structural proteins (nsps). We here focus on nsp3, that harbours an essential papain-like protease (PLpro) domain responsible for cleaving the viral polyprotein as part of viral processing. Moreover, nsp3/PLpro also cleaves ubiquitin and ISG15 modifications within the host cell, derailing innate immune responses. Small molecule inhibition of the PLpro protease domain significantly reduces viral loads in SARS-CoV-2 infection models, suggesting that PLpro is an excellent drug target for next generation antivirals. In this review we discuss the conserved structure and function of PLpro and the ongoing efforts to design small molecule PLpro inhibitors that exploit this knowledge. We first discuss the many drug repurposing attempts, concluding that it is unlikely that PLpro-targeting drugs already exist. We next discuss the wealth of structural information on SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibition, for which there are now 30 distinct crystal structures with small molecule inhibitors bound in a surprising number of distinct crystallographic settings. We focus on optimisation of an existing compound class, based on SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor GRL-0617, and recapitulate how new GRL-0617 derivatives exploit different features of PLpro, to overcome some compound liabilities.","output":"Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic needs therapies that are presently available and safe. We propose that subjects with metabolic syndrome, old age, and male gender have the greatest morbidity and mortality and have low stress proteins, in particular, low intracellular heme oxygenase (HO-1), making them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Additionally, COVID-19's heme reduction may contribute to even lower HO-1. Low-grade inflammation associated with these risk factors contributes to triggering a cytokine storm that spreads to multi-organ failure and near death. The high mortality of those treated with ventilator assistance may partially be explained by ventilator-induced inflammation. The cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 can limit the infection's damage. A paradox of COVID-19 hospital admissions data suggests that fewer cigarette-smokers are admitted compared with non-smokers in the general population. This unexpected observation may result from smoke induction of HO-1. Therapies with anti-viral properties that raise HO-1 include certain anesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane), hemin, estrogen, statins, curcumin, resveratrol, and melatonin. Controlled trials of these HO-1 inducers should be done in order to prevent or treat COVID-19 disease.","output":"COVID-19 and heme oxygenase: novel insight into the disease and potential therapies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID\\\\19) has been rapidly spreading out in China and all over the world.

We investigated the prevalence of HBoV infection and the association between viral (HBoV) load and clinical features of the infection in patients of all age-groups. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with symptoms of respiratory infection were tested for presence of HBoV by using real-time polymerase chain reaction. HBoV-positive patients were categorized into low- and high-viral-load groups using 1.010(6) copies/mL as the threshold value of viral load. RESULTS: Detection rate of HBoV was 4.8% (N=93) in a total of 1,926 samples with peak incidence of infection being observed in patients aged 6-12 months. HBoV infection was more frequently observed in young children, especially, in children aged less than 5 yr, and the HBoV load decreased with increase in age. HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses in 17 (18.3%) of the 93 HBoV-positive patients and 15 patients (88.2%) belonged to the low-viral-load group. Patients infected with HBoV alone showed a higher viral load than those patients in whom HBoV was codetected with other respiratory viruses (median load, 3.7810(5) copies/mL vs. 1.9410(4) copies/mL, P=0.014).

We suggest two binomial logit models for explaining the change in travel pattern, linking socioeconomic data per area and travel data with the probability to stop travelling. MODELLED VARIABLES: The first model investigates the impact of the socioeconomic factors: age; income; education level; gender; housing type; population density; country of origin; and employment level. The results show that decreases in public transport use are linked to all these factors. The second model groups the investigated areas into five distinct clusters based on the socioeconomic data, showing the impacts for different socioeconomic groups. During the autumn the differences between the groups diminished, and especially Cluster 1 (with the lowest education levels, lowest income and highest share of immigrants) reduced their public transport use to a similar level as the more affluent clusters. RESULTS: The results show that socioeconomic status affect the change in behaviour during the pandemic and that exposure to the virus is determined by citizens socioeconomic class. Furthermore, the results can guide policy into tailoring public transport supply to where the need is, instead of assuming that e.g. crowding is equally distributed within the public transport system in the event of a pandemic.

Many have argued that a more resilient or robust supply chain is needed. But what does a robust supply chain mean? And how do firms decisions change when taken that approach? This paper studies a very stylized model of a supply chain, where we study how the decision of a multinational corporation changes in the presence of uncertainty. The two standard theories of supply chain are just-in-time and just-in-case. Just-in-time argues in favor of pursuing efficiency, while just-in-case studies how such decision changes when the firm faces idiosyncratic risk. We find that a robust supply chain is very different specially in the presence of systemic shocks. In this case, firms need to concentrate on the worst-case. This strategy implies a supply chain where the allocation of resources and capabilities does not correspond to the standard theories studied in economics, but follow a heuristic behavioral rule called probability matching. It has been found in nature and in experimental research that subjects appeal to probability matching when seeking survival. We find that a robust supply chain will reproduce this behavioral outcome. In fact, a multinational optimizing under uncertainty follows a probability matching which leads to an allocation that is suboptimal from the individual producer point of view, but rules out the possibility of supply disruptions.","output":"From Just-in-Time, to Just-in-Case, to Just-in-Worst-Case: Simple Models of a Global Supply Chain under Uncertain Aggregate Shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 17% of adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) living in the community display behaviours that challenge.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A cohort of 226 adults with ID displaying behaviour that challenges who receive support from ISTs from each model will be recruited and assessed at baseline and 9 months later to compare the clinical and cost-effectiveness between models. The primary outcome is reduction in challenging behaviour measured by the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist-Community (ABC-C).

Failure of SARS and MERS vaccines in animal trials involved pathogenesis consistent with an immunological priming that could involve autoimmunity in lung tissues due to previous exposure to the SARS and MERS spike protein. Exposure pathogenesis to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 likely will lead to similar outcomes. Immunogenic peptides in viruses or bacteria that match human proteins are good candidates for pathogenic priming peptides (similar to the more diffuse idea of \\"immune enhancement\\"). Here I provide an assessment of potential for human pathogenesis via autoimmunity via exposure, via infection or injection. SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins, and all other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, immunogenic epitopes in each SARS-CoV-2 protein were compared to human proteins in search of high local homologous matching. Only one immunogenic epitope in a SARS-CoV-2 had no homology to human proteins. If all of the parts of the epitopes that are homologous to human proteins are excluded from consideration due to risk of pathogenic priming, the remaining immunogenic parts of the epitopes may be still immunogenic and remain as potentially viable candidates for vaccine development. Mapping of the genes encoding human protein matches to pathways point to targets that could explain the observed presentation of symptoms in COVID-19 disease. It also strongly points to a large number of opportunities for expected disturbances in the immune system itself, targeting elements of MCH Class I and Class II antigen presentation, PD-1 signaling, cross-presentation of soluble exogenous antigens and the ER-Phagosome pathway.

However, the association of sleep duration and screen time with anxiety among pregnant women under the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic scenario has been poorly addressed. We conducted one large-scale, multicenter cross-sectional study which recruited 1794 pregnant women across middle and west China. Self-reported demographic characteristics, lifestyle, and mental health status were collected from 6th February to 8th May 2020. We investigated the association of sleep duration and screen time with the risk of anxiety by multivariable logistic regression analysis and linear regression analysis after adjusting potential confounders. The dose-response relationship of sleep duration and screen time with anxiety was visualized using a cubic spline plot. Our data revealed that almost 35% of pregnant women suffered from anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sleep duration was dose-dependently associated with a lower risk of anxiety among pregnant women (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.27-0.63), while screen time exhibited a conversed effect (OR = 2.01, 95% CI:1.00-4.39).

The concert was repeated on three consecutive days with different audiences. Using inter-subject correlation (ISC) to identify reliable responses to music, we found that highly correlated responses depicted typical signatures of physiological arousal. By relating physiological ISC to quantitative values of music features, logistic regressions revealed that high physiological synchrony was consistently predicted by faster tempi (which had higher ratings of arousing emotions and engagement), but only in Classical and Romantic styles (rated as familiar) and not the Contemporary style (rated as unfamiliar). Additionally, highly synchronised responses across all three concert audiences occurred during important structural moments in the musicidentified using music theoretical analysisnamely at transitional passages, boundaries, and phrase repetitions.

Both the culture-independent approach (CI) and the culture-dependent (CD) approach were complementarily adopted in this study. A total of 341 unique OTUs were assigned, the richness showed to be higher in the Northern than in the Middle Magdalena region, and a high diversity was found at the phylum and genus levels in the samples obtained.

To clarify the frequency of viral pneumonia among patients with acute progressive clinical courses that required a differential diagnosis between ILDs and pneumonia, and to determine the most frequent ILDs misdiagnosed in cases of viral pneumonia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients hospitalized from 2010 to 2017 with an acute clinical course (30 days) who underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for the differential diagnosis of infection and ILDs. We performed a multiplex PCR for respiratory viruses using the patients' preserved BAL fluid. The final diagnosis was made by a multidisciplinary approach and after considering the PCR results. The diagnosis at discharge was compared to the final diagnosis. RESULTS: Among the 109 patients, 53 were diagnosed with viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia and other diseases showed some differences in symptoms and laboratory data; however, the differences were small or overlapped. Viral pneumonia was misdiagnosed on discharge as acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (AFOP/COP/CEP) (n=22), acute interstitial pneumonia (n=5), connective tissue disease-related ILDs (n=3), unclassifiable interstitial pneumonia (n=2), drug-induced ILD (n=1), and pneumonia (n=20). CONCLUSION: Approximately half of the patients who underwent BAL had viral pneumonia. The most common ILD-related misdiagnoses were AFOP/COP/CEP. Differences in symptoms and laboratory findings between viral pneumonia and other diseases were small, and viral pneumonia should be included in the differential diagnosis when physicians encounter cases in which the abovementioned ILDs are suspected.","output":"Viral Pneumonia Requiring Differentiation from Acute and Progressive Diffuse Interstitial Lung Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"X-ray imaging is a low-cost, powerful technology that has been extensively used in medical diagnosis and industrial nondestructive inspection.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality of rehabilitation under corona conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An anonymous survey of adult cochlear implant patients was carried out by a non-standardized questionnaire. Demographics were analyzed and the quality of medical aftercare, speech therapy, technical aftercare, psychological support and the hygiene modalities were compared to previous rehabilitation stays. RESULTS: In total 109 patients completed the questionnaire. The quality of rehabilitation and individual therapy were rated as qualitatively similar or improved. The threat of the pandemic and fear of corona were rated unexpectedly high with 68% and 50%, respectively. The hygiene measures during the rehabilitation stay eased subjective fears at the same time. The majority of patients were annoyed by wearing face masks but visors, protection shields and social distancing were more tolerated. CONCLUSION: The implementation of the new hygiene modalities within the therapeutic rehabilitation setting was well-accepted by patients allowing access to auditory rehabilitation.

Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a single case study, and it relies on qualitative data coming from multiple sources and collected at different points of time, specifically interviews, participant and non-participant observations from an ethnography conducted in 2009;interviews conducted between 2019 and 2020, and an analysis of the posts made within one Facebook group between February and May 2016. Findings The paper focuses on three stories of local political leadership at three different points in time which describe three leadership practices: political managerialism;charismatic followership;and hands-on relational leadership. It highlights the importance of hands-on relational leadership through popular acts of leadership which are performed face to face and/or on social media and the shift in the dominant technologies of local political leadership from the logic of managerialism toward the logic of social media.

Percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage is an established technique. Recently, transmural gallbladder drainage under the guidance of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS-GBD) was reported as a safe alternative. During surgery, fluorescence imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) has been increasingly used for visualizing the bile ducts. Herein, we report a sequential treatment approach which ensures safety without impairing normal activities before cholecystectomy: EUS-GBD followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy using ICG fluorescence imaging. MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE A 66-year-old man with acute cholecystitis underwent urgent EUS-GBD and had the drainage tube placement through the duodenum into the gallbladder. During 2.5 months of the waiting period, he had no clinical troubles. After insertion of a laparoscope, we found a structure between the gallbladder and the duodenum. We injected 0.025 mg/mL of ICG into the nasobiliary drainage tube (placed in the gallbladder through the duodenum) and confirmed that the structure was a fistula. After removing the tube, the fistula was divided using a surgical stapler under the guidance of fluorescence imaging. The cystic and common bile ducts were also clearly visualized as fluorescence. DISCUSSION We reported a safe sequential treatment approach for the patient who required biliary drainage: EUS-GBD followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy under the guidance of ICG fluorescence imaging. This sequential approach may improve patients' satisfaction with respect to quality of life during the waiting period and may ensure the safety of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","output":"A safe sequential treatment approach for patients who have acute cholecystitis with severe inflammation: Transmural gallbladder drainage followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy under the guidance of fluorescence imaging."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A brief consideration of the concepts of vulnerability and resilience are presented in this column It will serve as an introduction to the main article that considers conducting qualitative research on vulnerable populations during the time of COVID-19","output":"Vulnerability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of C. siliqua pulp corrosion inhibition on carbon steel has been studied by gravimetric testing and electrochemical methods.

Guidance issued early during the pandemic suggested avoiding transnasal approaches to minimize risks of transmitting COVID-19 to health care professionals involved in these procedures. Methods This observational, single-center study compares results of endoscopic transsphenoidal approach (TSA) for pituitary tumors since the start of the pandemic to a pre-pandemic period. Anesthetic time, surgical time, and complication rates were compared. Newly acquired COVID-19 infections and transmission rates to patients and staff were reviewed. Data were analyzed by using the independent t -test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Pearson Chi-square test, significance set at p &lt;0.05. Results Over a 12-month period, a total of 50 and 69 patients underwent endoscopic TSA for pituitary tumor during and before the pandemic, respectively. All patients tested negative for COVID-19 preoperatively. Median duration of anesthesia was 35minutes (interquartile range [IQR]: 22) during the pandemic and 25minutes (IQR: 8, p =0.0002) pre-pandemic. Median duration of surgery was 70minutes (IQR: 28) during the pandemic and 79minutes (IQR: 33.75, p =0.126) pre-pandemic. There were no statistically significant differences between intraoperative CSF leaks and complication rates. No staff members tested positive for COVID-19. Three patients tested positive for COVID-19 postdischarge, but the infections were community acquired. Conclusion In contrast to published guidelines, adequate preoperative testing, a multidisciplinary approach and the implementation of standardized protocols and vaccination against COVID-19 allow for endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery to be performed safely in patients with pituitary pathology during the pandemic.","output":"Safety of Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Pituitary Surgery during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Comparison to the Pre-Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although inflammation is a host-protective mechanism from infection and cellular danger signals, chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for various human diseases [...].","output":"Editorial of Special Issue Inflammasomes and Inflammation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fremdblut sparende Ma?nahmen versprechen den Nutzen einer ausreichenden Anzahl von Sauerstofftr?gern ohne die typischen Nachteile der allogener Bluttransfusion.

Laparotomy and laparoscopic surgery are current standard treatments; however, the laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) approach offers many potential benefits. We describe our technique for LESS biopsy of RTUO. PATIENTS AND METHODS Five patients underwent LESS biopsy for diagnosis of RTUO. A multichannel port was inserted into the peritoneal or retroperitoneal space through a 3-cm skin incision, which adequately exposed the retroperitoneal tumor. The specimen was grasped and isolated circumferentially from the surrounding tissue. RESULTS LESS surgery was performed successfully without any complications such as open conversion. Mean operative time was 183 min and estimated blood loss was negligible. The diagnoses were IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis (n = 4) and lymphoma (n = 1). Sufficient specimens were safely obtained not only for pathological diagnosis but also for further examinations such as immunophenotyping or DNA analysis. Convalescence was satisfactory. All patients were treated appropriately according to the resulting diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS LESS biopsy for RTUO is a safe and effective alternative to open surgical and standard laparoscopic biopsies.

Several studies have investigated psychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on medical staff, yet studies in the outpatient setting are scarce and studies addressing medical assistants are lacking. This study aimed to investigate pandemic-related stressors, attitudes, and work outcomes among medical assistants and to identify possible determinants. METHODS: The population under study were medical assistants across entire Germany. A self-devised online questionnaire was published between April 7th, 2020, and April 14th. including questions on pandemic-related stressors, attitudes and work outcomes. Additionally, symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder were measured by PHQ-2 and GAD-2, respectively. Logistic regression was performed to identify possible determinants. RESULTS: 2150 medical assistants provided complete data (98.0% female, mean age 37.6 years). Major stressors were uncertainty about the temporal scope of the pandemic (95.1% agreement), about how to act correctly (77.5%), feelings of not being allowed to let patients down (75.9%), uncertainty about one's financial situation (67.4%) and about contact persons for further information (67.1%). One third (29.9%) of the study population screened positively for depression and 42.6% for anxiety disorder. Feeling burdened by one's financial situation was significantly associated with working in specialist practices (1.32 [1.08-1.62]), caring for children (1.51 [1.22-1.87]), depression (1.28 [1.01-1.62]), and anxiety disorder (1.93 [1.55-2.39]).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this project is to assess current COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) among a predominantly Hispanic population from the Orange County, California community and identify risk factors that may contribute to increased susceptibility and vulnerability to contracting SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Our community Orange County-wide survey consists of quantitative survey questions in four domains: demographic information, COVID-19 knowledge questions, COVID-19 attitude questions, and COVID-19 practices questions. Survey questions are adapted from recent global KAP studies. Participants are being recruited from Amistad Medical Clinic, a private, primary health clinic group in Orange County that treats a predominantly Hispanic population. Patients recruited during telehealth visits are surveyed remotely by phone and those recruited during in-person clinic visits are surveyed in-person.

Rats were injected with 50 mg/kg MCT solution for inducing PAH model except for those in the sham group. From the day of modeling, rats of TXL, SIL and TXL+SIL groups were given TXL (1.2 g/kg), SIL (10 mg/kg) and combination solution (TXL:1.2 g/kg, SIL: 10 mg/kg) respectively, and rats in Sham and MCT groups were given normal saline (5 mL/kg). The samples were collected and tested after 21 consecutive days of intragastric administration. Echocardiography was used to measure the related indices of RVF, including pulmonary arterial flow spectrum, pulmonary artery diameter (PAD), right ventricular wall thickness (RVWT), right ventricular diameter (RVD), tricuspidannular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), right atrium transverse diameter (RAT), and inferior vena cava diameter (IVCD). Elastic Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining was adopted to measure the percentage of wall thickness (WT%) of pulmonary arteriols. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of right ventricular cardiomyocytes. RESULTS MCT-induced PAH rat model was successfully established. In MCT group the wall of pulmonary arterioles exhibited a prominent-increase thickness, PAD, RVWT, RVD, RAT, IVCD, WT%, right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI) as well as CSA of RV cardiomyocyte significantly increased (all P<0.01), and TAPSE markedly decreased (P<0.01). At the same time, TXL prominently improved all of the above indices (all P<0.01). In comparison with SIL, TXL significantly reduced RVD (P<0.05) and decreased CAS of RV cardiomyocytes (P<0.01), but TAPSE in SIL group was much larger than in TXL group (P<0.01).

This study aimed to investigate the impact of prioritising available doses on the basis of recipient antibody status, that is by exposure status, using Qatar as an example. METHODS: Vaccination impact (defined as the reduction in infection incidence and the number of vaccinations needed to avert one infection or one adverse disease outcome) was assessed under different scale-up scenarios using a deterministic meta-population mathematical model describing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression in the presence of vaccination. RESULTS: For a vaccine that protects against infection with an efficacy of 95%, half as many vaccinations were needed to avert one infection, disease outcome or death by prioritising antibody-negative individuals for vaccination. Prioritisation by antibody status reduced incidence at a faster rate and led to faster elimination of infection and return to normalcy. Further prioritisation by age group amplified the gains of prioritisation by antibody status. Gains from prioritisation by antibody status were largest in settings where the proportion of the population already infected at the commencement of vaccination was 30%C60%. For a vaccine that only protects against disease and not infection, vaccine impact was reduced by half, whether this impact was measured in terms of averted infections or disease outcomes, but the relative gains from using antibody status to prioritise vaccination recipients were similar.

In this study, we examined cross-phosphorylation of RprY on tyrosine residues and its importance for RprY function. We show that RprY reacts with phosphotyrosine antibodies, and found that the tyrosine (Y) residue at position 41 is predicted to be solvent accessible. Loss of RprY increased the level of heterotypic community development with Streptococcus gordonii, and the community-suppressive function of RprY required Y41. Expression of the Mfa1 fimbrial adhesin was increased in the rprY mutant and in the mutant complemented with rprY containing a Y41F mutation. In a microscale thermophoresis assay, recombinant RprY protein bound to the promoter region of mfa1, and binding was diminished with RprY containing the Y41F substitution. RprY was required for virulence of P. gingivalis in a murine model of alveolar bone loss. Transcriptional profiling indicated that RprY can control the expression of genes encoding the type IX secretion system (T9SS) machinery and virulence factors secreted through the T9SS, including the gingipain proteases and peptidylarginine deiminase (PPAD). Collectively, these results establish the RprY response regulator as a component of the tyrosine phosphorylation regulon in P. gingivalis, which can independently control heterotypic community development through the Mfa1 fimbriae and virulence through the T9SS.","output":"Role of the RprY response regulator in P. gingivalis community development and virulence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic still causes severe impacts on society and the economy.

This paper reports on findings of a study that explored the antecedents to COVID-19 pandemic preventive behaviours among high school students. This study is imperative because conditions in high schools and classrooms, specifically, result in elevated vulnerability for COVID-19 transmission among students and teachers. Following the survey research design, the study was divided into two phases: Phase 1 (exploration phase) participated by 300 students;and Phase 2 (confirmation phase) participated by 300 students between grades 7 to 12. Data collected in Phase 1 underwent exploratory factor analysis using SPSS while data collected in Phase 2 underwent confirmatory factor analysis using SPSS Amos.

It was initially linked to the animal-to-human transmission. However, it is now thought that COVID-19 is spreading through human-to-human transmission mainly via droplets. As there is no definite antiviral therapy for the treatment of cases with COVID-19 the best option for slowing down the pandemic and reducing mortality rates is protection against the virus of interest. To achieve this goal obtaining information about how first cases infected with COVID-19 is crucial. Hence, this study aims to review the studies published in peer-reviewed journals to report the first confirmed cases with COVID-19. Herein, we review the origin, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and progress of the disease and possible actions of authorities which would be effective in similar pandemics in the future. This study reviewed 13 cases (5 females and 8 males; 25-61 years old) from 10 countries. All cases have recovered from COVID-19. The results of this review suggested that timely reports of the confirmed cases, notifying World Health Organization and providing information to the general population about the methods of spreading the virus would have decreased the number of infected cases and mortality rates. In addition, the travel history of the first confirmed cases in various countries suggested that prompt actions in restricting travels and closing borders could be an efficient strategy in preventing the transmission of the disease outside of the affected sites.

Our lab previously showed the toxicological value of the scRNA-seq pipeline to characterize the sequelae of TCDD exposure in testes, demonstrating that loss of spermatids and spermatozoa, but not other cell types, contributed to the pathology of infertility in adult male zebrafish exposed during sexual differentiation. To investigate the potential for technical artifacts in scRNA-seq such as cell dissociation effects and reduced transcriptome coverage, we compared bulk-sequenced and scRNA-seq-paired samples from control and TCDD-exposed samples to understand what is gained and lost in scRNA-seq vs bulk-seq, both transcriptomically and toxicologically. We hypothesized that the testes may be sensitive to tissue disruption as they contain multiple cell types under constant division and/or maturation, and that TCDD exposure may mediate the extent of sensitivity. Thus, we sought to understand the extent to which this dissociation impacts the toxicological value of data returned from scRNA-seq. We confirm that the required dissociation of individual cells from intact tissue has a significant impact on gene expression, affecting gene pathways with the potential to confound toxicogenomics studies on exposures if findings are not well-controlled and well-situated in context. Additionally, a common scRNA-seq method using cDNA amplified from the 3 end of mRNA under-detects low-expressing transcripts including transcription factors. We confirm this, and show TCDD-related genes may be overlooked by scRNA-seq, however, this under-detection effect is not mediated by TCDD exposure. Even so, scRNA-seq generally extracted toxicologically relevant information better than the bulk-seq method in the present study. This report aims to inform future experimental design for transcriptomic investigation in the growing field of toxicogenomics by demonstrating the differential information extracted from sequencing cellsdespite being from the same tissue and exposure schemeis influenced by the specific protocol used, with implications for the interpretation of exposure-induced risk.","output":"Comparative Toxicotranscriptomics of Single Cell RNA-Seq and Conventional RNA-Seq in TCDD-Exposed Testicular Tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the common misconceptions about COVID-19 disease is to assume that we will not see a recurrence after the first wave of the disease has subsided.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as a gold-standard method for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, unexpected contamination of synthesized positive control samples included in COVID-19 test kits have increased the inconclusiveness of disease interpretation. Therefore, it is important to establish new methods for the preparation of reliable positive controls that are not affected by contamination for the accurate for diagnosis of COVID-19, but it still remains a challenge. METHODS: A new approach for producing synthetic positive controls using synthetic positive template (SPT) oligonucleotides was designed. SPT oligonucleotides contain probe binding and virus-irrelevant regions were used as templates for real-time PCR to evaluate the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 genes (RdRP, E, and N). The limit of detection (LOD) for individual SARS-CoV-2 genes by Ct values with different concentrations of SPT templates and genomic RNAs from SARS-CoV-2 infected samples was determined. RESULTS: LODs with SPT templates were >10-15 (atto) M for RdRP, 10-12 (femto) to 10-13 (100 atto) M for E gene, and 10-12 to 10-14 (10 atto) M for N gene, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR assay using serially diluted genomic RNAs prepared from SARS-CoV-2 virus infected cultures showed that picogram quantities of RNAs is resulted in the LOD. The sensitivity of RdRP and E genes based on Ct values was less than that of N gene with this platform. CONCLUSION: This method significantly reduces the risk of false-positive reactions resulting from contamination in the synthesis procedures of positive control materials. Therefore, this approach could be integrated into the currrently available COVID-19 test kits and will provide a general method for preparing positive controls in the diagnosis of emerging RNA virus infections.","output":"Positive control synthesis method for COVID-19 diagnosis by one-step real-time RT-PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of the current study was to identify latent profiles of COVID-19 fear, depression, anxiety, stress, mindfulness, and resilience among university students.

MATERIAL AND METHODS This was an observational, non-interventional, prospective, multicenter study conducted at 72 centers in Germany. Patients undergoing contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examinations with ioversol were enrolled. The use of ioversol bottles and pre-filled syringes in the diagnostic procedure was recorded in terms of efficiency (residual volume, re-use of CM) and safety (adverse events [AEs]). RESULTS A total of 10,836 patients were enrolled and included in this study. Ioversol bottles and syringes were used in 72% and 28% of cases, respectively. Analysis of the volume of CM in bottles before and after examinations, together with the volume used during the examination, suggested that in 22.5% of cases a new bottle was connected during the procedure. Further analysis revealed that in 80.2% of cases, the remaining volume of CM in the bottles could potentially be used for subsequent investigations, compared with <1% of cases for pre-filled syringes. For the total study population, AEs and serious AEs were reported in 30 (0.28%) and four (0.037%) patients, respectively, with no significant difference observed between ioversol bottles and syringes.

Variations in a hosts prion gene, PRNP, and its primary protein structure dramatically affect susceptibility to specific prion disorders, and breeding for PRNP variants that prevent scrapie infection has led to steep declines in the disease in North American and European sheep. While resistant alleles have been identified in cervids, a PRNP variant that completely prevents CWD has not yet been identified. Thus, control of the disease in farmed herds traditionally relies on quarantine and depopulation. In CWD-endemic areas, depopulation of private herds becomes challenging to justify, leading to opportunities to manage the disease in situ. We developed a selective breeding program for farmed white-tailed deer in a high-prevalence CWD-endemic area which focused on reducing frequencies of highly susceptible PRNP variants and introducing animals with less susceptible variants.

Conclusion: Our finding can be explained by the imposition, in early March 2020, of a national lockdown, which came into effect in an early epidemic phase in Tuscany, and thus limited the transmission of SARSCoV- 2 infection, as well as influenza, in the territory. In March and April, by causing the death of vulnerable elderly patients who had been spared by the mild seasonal flu in the prior months, COVID-19 acted with a harvesting effect.","output":"All-cause mortality during the influenza season 2019- 2020: comparison with previous influenza seasons in the territory of the local health authority \\"Central Tuscany\\", Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Biochemical specificity is critical in enzyme function, evolution, and engineering. Here we employ an established kinetic model to dissect the effects of reactant geometry and diffusion on product formation speed and accuracy in the presence of cognate (correct) and near-cognate (incorrect) substrates. Using this steady-state model for spherical geometries, we find that for distinct kinetic regimes the speed and accuracy of the reactions are optimized on different regions of the geometric landscape. From this model we deduce that accuracy can be strongly dependent on reactant geometric properties even for chemically limited reactions. Notably, substrates with a specific geometry and reactivity can be discriminated by the enzyme with higher efficacy than others through purely diffusive effects. For similar cognate and near-cognate substrate geometries (as is the case for polymerases or the ribosome), we observe that speed and accuracy are maximized in opposing regions of the geometric landscape. We also show that in relevant environments diffusive effects on accuracy can be substantial even far from extreme kinetic conditions. Finally, we find how reactant chemical discrimination and diffusion can be related to simultaneously optimize steady-state flux and accuracy. These results highlight how diffusion and geometry can be employed to enhance reaction speed and discrimination, and similarly how they impose fundamental restraints on these quantities.","output":"Diffusion control in biochemical specificity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the practice of strengthening the immune system may not guarantee that people will not contract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2), there is evidence that suggests that the likelihood and severity of many viral infections can be considerably reduced if appropriate measures are taken to increase the efficacy of the immune response to invading organisms.

Hospitals responded by expanding services to accommodate the forecasted rise in COVID-19-related admissions. We describe the effects these changes had on management of orthopaedic trauma and patient outcomes at a district general hospital in Southern England. Methods: Data were extrapolated retrospectively from two separate 6-week periods in 2019 and 2020 (1st April-13th May) using electronic records of patients referred to the orthopaedic team. Soft tissue injuries were included where a confirmed diagnosis was made with radiological evidence. Patients were excluded if no orthopaedic intervention was required. Data were compared between the two time periods. Results: There were fewer attendances to hospital in 2020 compared with 2019 (178 vs. 328), but time from presentation to surgery significantly increased in 2020 (2.94 days vs. 4.91 days, p = 0.009). There were fewer operative complications in 2020 (36/145 vs. 11/88, p < 0.001). However, ordinal logistic regression analysis found a significantly greater complication severity in 2020 including death (p = 0.039). Complication severity was unrelated to COVID-19 status. Conclusions: Restructuring of orthopaedic services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with significant delays to surgery and higher post-operative complication severity.

With aging, the human immune system becomes weaker, so people over the age of 65 years are at higher risk of complications after influenza infections. This population study, conducted in Poland, aimed to identify the subtypes of influenza virus infection and outcomes in individuals more than 65 years of age in the 2016/2017 to 2019/2020 epidemic seasons. MATERIAL/METHODS: The research materials were nose and throat swabs. Research was conducted in 16 Voivodship Sanitary and Epidemiological Stations and in the Department of Influenza Research, National Influenza Centre, NIPH-NIH. Methods of RNA isolation depended on the laboratory where the isolation was performed. In all laboratories, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the influenza virus type and subtype. RESULTS: The analysis of the incidence of influenza among people over the age of 65 included the 2016/2017, 2017/2018, 2018/2019, and 2019/2020 influenza epidemic seasons. We analyzed the percentage of positive samples, the dynamics of epidemic seasons, and the percentage share of influenza viruses in the 65+ age group, according to the epidemic season and percentage of deaths.

Innate immune cells such as natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages constitute a large part of the decidual leukocyte population at the maternal-fetal interface, playing an important role in placental development and as such in fetal growth and development. In this study, we hypothesized that training the innate immune cells before pregnancy could have an impact on pregnancy. To test this hypothesis, we used CBA/J x DBA/2 mouse model to investigate pregnancy outcomes and leukocyte population at the maternal-fetal interface. Although we were not able to show a beneficial effect of LPS-tolerogenic training on fetal resorption, Bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) training, known to prime innate immune cells to be proinflammatory, led to fetal growth restriction, without aggravating the fetal resorption rate. We also found that BCG training led to less NK cells and macrophages at the maternal-fetal interface at the early stage of placentation (E9.5), associated with a down-regulation of Ccr3 and Lif mRNA expression. This induced altered leucocyte population profile can be an explanation for the subsequent fetal growth restriction.

We show that primordial black hole binaries in our galaxy may produce detectable gravitational waves for different mass functions and formation mechanisms.

The second method, the Generalized Frequency-Hough, drops the assumption of linearity and allows the signal frequency to follow a power-law evolution. We explore the parameter space to which each method is sensitive, derive a theoretical sensitivity estimate, determine optimal search parameters and calculate the computational cost of all-sky and directed searches.

Our finding corroborates the fact that MFIs do not build their loan loss provisions (LLP) during economic booms when profit and earnings are high. Since they provision more during downturns, they are more likely to suffer from unexpected losses and experience failure. This is in sharp contrast with the current Basel III countercyclical buffer requirement suggesting that financial institutions, especially banks, should build sufficient buffer in booms so that they can avoid costly capital adjustment when the economy contracts. Deeper analyses suggest however that this behaviour mainly concerns profit-oriented and deposit-taking/regulated MFIs, with business model and target close to conventional banking.

Attention was focused on possible transmission by the sewage system because laboratory studies showed that patients excreted coronavirus RNA in their stools in Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong. To explore whether the stool of SARS patients or the sewage containing the stool of patients would transmit SARS-CoV or not, we used a style of electropositive filter media particle to concentrate the SARS-CoV from the sewage of two hospitals receiving SARS patients in Beijing, as well as cell culture, semi-nested RT-PCR and sequencing of genes to detect and identify the viruses from sewage.

METHODS: Commonly applied methods to analyse epidemic trajectories or make forecasts include phenomenological growth models (e.g., the Richards family of densities) and variants of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment model. Here, we focus on a practical forecasting approach, applied to interim UK COVID data, using a bivariate Reynolds model (for cases and deaths), with implementation based on Bayesian inference. We show the utility of informative priors in developing and estimating the model and compare error densities (Poisson-gamma, Poisson-lognormal, and Poisson-log-Student) for overdispersed data on new cases and deaths. We use cross validation to assess medium-term forecasts. We also consider the longer-term postlockdown epidemic profile to assess epidemic containment, using a two-phase model. RESULTS: Fit to interim mid-epidemic data show better fit to training data and better cross-validation performance for a Poisson-log-Student model. Estimation of longer-term epidemic data after lockdown relaxation, characterised by protracted slow downturn and then upturn in cases, casts doubt on effective containment. CONCLUSIONS: Many applications of phenomenological models have been to complete epidemics. However, evaluation of such models based simply on their fit to observed data may give only a partial picture, and cross validation against actual trends is also valuable. Similarly, it may be preferable to model incidence rather than cumulative data, although this raises questions about suitable error densities for modelling often erratic fluctuations. Hence, there may be utility in evaluating alternative error assumptions.","output":"Mid-Epidemic Forecasts of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths: A Bivariate Model Applied to the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To assess medium-term organ impairment in symptomatic individuals following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN: Baseline findings from a prospective, observational cohort study. SETTING: Community-based individuals from two UK centres between 1 April and 14 September 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals 18 years with persistent symptoms following recovery from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and age-matched healthy controls. INTERVENTION: Assessment of symptoms by standardised questionnaires (EQ-5D-5L, Dyspnoea-12) and organ-specific metrics by biochemical assessment and quantitative MRI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome defined as ongoing respiratory symptoms and/or moderate functional impairment in activities of daily living; single-organ and multiorgan impairment (heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen) by consensus definitions at baseline investigation. RESULTS: 201 individuals (mean age 45, range 21C71 years, 71% female, 88% white, 32% healthcare workers) completed the baseline assessment (median of 141 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection, IQR 110C162). The study population was at low risk of COVID-19 mortality (obesity 20%, hypertension 7%, type 2 diabetes 2%, heart disease 5%), with only 19% hospitalised with COVID-19. 42% of individuals had 10 or more symptoms and 60% had severe post-COVID-19 syndrome. Fatigue (98%), muscle aches (87%), breathlessness (88%) and headaches (83%) were most frequently reported. Mild organ impairment was present in the heart (26%), lungs (11%), kidneys (4%), liver (28%), pancreas (40%) and spleen (4%), with single-organ and multiorgan impairment in 70% and 29%, respectively. Hospitalisation was associated with older age (p=0.001), non-white ethnicity (p=0.016), increased liver volume (p<0.0001), pancreatic inflammation (p<0.01), and fat accumulation in the liver (p<0.05) and pancreas (p<0.01). Severe post-COVID-19 syndrome was associated with radiological evidence of cardiac damage (myocarditis) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In individuals at low risk of COVID-19 mortality with ongoing symptoms, 70% have impairment in one or more organs 4 months after initial COVID-19 symptoms, with implications for healthcare and public health, which have assumed low risk in young people with no comorbidities.

Our study aims to identify how Covid-19 impacts elderly inpatients with kidney cancer and determine risk factors associated with increased mortality. Methods Our retrospective cohort study utilized the PUDF dataset and included inpatients over 60-year-old, diagnosed with kidney cancer, and hospitalized within 30-day. Persons Chi-Square was used to measure the differences between survivors and non-survivors, and the Mann-Whitney test was for non-normality distribution for continuous variables. Then, a binary logistic regression was employed to identify the association between independent variables and mortality. Results Five hundred and twenty-two patients were included in the study, of which 7 (1.4%) died during hospitalization. According to the univariate analysis and Mann-Whitney test, expired patients were more likely to experience older age (p = 0.005), longer length of stay (p = 0.009), ICU (p = 0.012), HMO Medicare Risk (p = 0.005), Covid-19 (p < 0.001), paralysis (p < 0.001), and higher illness severity (p < 0.001).

We report local, regional, and distant recurrence data along with overall and breast cancer-specific survival for 1400 tumors treated with x-ray IORT. METHODS: A total of 1367 patients with 1400 distinct tumors were enrolled in a registry trial. All received breast conservation surgery and low-energy 50 kV x-ray IORT. To be eligible for excision plus IORT as the only local treatment, histopathology had to confirm tumor size 30 mm, margins 2 mm, negative lymph nodes, and no extensive lymphovascular invasion. Patients who failed any parameters were referred for additional surgery and/or whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT). RESULTS: There were 64 ipsilateral local recurrences, 60 were in the IORT only group, 7 axillary recurrences, and 7 distant recurrences. Forty-one local recurrences were within the same quadrant as the index cancer. Twenty-three were in different quadrants. With 62 months of median follow-up, the 5-year KaplanCMeier probability of any event for all 1400 tumors was 5.27%. For 1175 patients who received IORT only, it was 5.98%. For favorable subtypes, it ranged from 2.41 to 4.31%. Multivariate analysis revealed that biologic subtype luminal A and the addition of WBRT significantly reduced the risk of local recurrence.

Currently, care models predominantly focus on acute medical and pharmacological needs. As a step towards holistic care, the aim of this prospective study was to investigate the psychological and behavioural needs of IPF patients treated with pirfenidone from diagnosis until two years of follow-up. METHODS: The following variables were selected from the literature on patients needs and the COM-B model, a theoretical model explaining behaviour: medication adherence, barriers to adherence, importance and intentions of medication adherence, anxiety, depression, health literacy, knowledge, reported side effects, adherence to sun protection recommendations, alcohol use, physical activity, quality of life and health status. Linear and generalised linear models for longitudinal data were used to evaluate the evolution since treatment initiation. RESULTS: We included 66 outpatients: 72.7% men, mean age of 70.3 years (range 50C87), predicted mean forced vital capacity of 85.8% (SD 17.4) and predicted mean diffusing capacity for monoxide of 56.9% (SD 15.7). The participants placed considerable importance on following the treatment recommendations. We noticed difficulties regarding health literacy, alcohol use, pirfenidone adherence (decline over time) and adherence to sun protection recommendations (early in follow-up care). There were low levels of physical activity (no effect of time), high body mass indices (decline over time) and moderate levels of depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: When providing care to IPF patients, behavioural issues, health literacy and psychological well-being should be taken into consideration. There is a need to further explore interventions and care models to tackle these difficulties.

These results held when controlling for depressive symptoms and when analyzing social anxiety items that cannot be confounded with COVID-19-related anxiety. Conclusions: The current results suggest that reduced exposure to social situations may play a role in the maintenance of social anxiety. Alternative explanations are discussed.","output":"Social Distancing During A COVID-19 Lockdown Contributes to The Maintenance of Social Anxiety: A Natural Experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The purpose of this review is to discuss the current status of local and international efforts undergoing clinical trials aiming at developing a Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccine, and to highlight the anticipated challenges of this vaccine globally and in Saudi Arabia. Present Findings: COVID-19 vaccine development efforts started in early January 2020 when Chinese scientists shared the Coronavirus genomic sequence in public domain. Approximately 321 research groups initiated the search for a vaccine, out of which 41 have reached phase I/II trails and 11 reached phase-III clinical trials, including approved vaccines for early to limited use. Out of these projects are two labs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia still in early stages of development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Several vaccine attempts are being tested from traditional, attenuated virus methods, to new nucleic acid-based designs. However, no vaccine has yet completed clinical trials and reached public domain.In spite of the challenges faced during previous vaccine trials, researchers have found that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19 is structurally similar to the (SARS-CoV-1) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused epidemics in 2003 and 2012 respectively. Both SARS strains show identical affinity towards the type-II alveolar pneumocytes angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor binding domains and therefore, similar pathogenicity. The race to develop the vaccine is predominantly for individuals at high risk of developing the infection, i.e. population groups who are most susceptible to experiencing fatal symptoms of the coronavirus. These include patients with comorbidities, above the age of 60 years and people at risk of contracting large viral loads, such as healthcare providers caring for critical admissions in in-patient wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Room settings. Summary: Many different vaccine strategies are under development throughout different stages of the research timeline; however, it is estimated that none will show favorable results before end of 2020. For any immunization or interventional prevention/therapy system to reach the public and patients at high risk, it needs to undergo multiple phase trials to ensure safety and effectiveness. In this scoping review we aim to map the literature on COVID-19 vaccines and provide recommendations related to gaps in research, applicability and expected challenges for implementation of nationwide vaccination in Saudi Arabia.","output":"Status of the Current COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates: Implications in the Saudi Population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although recent studies have identified new group C human rhinoviruses (HRVCs), their spectrum of pediatric disease is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the presentation and burden of disease caused by HRVCs among young hospitalized children. METHODS: We conducted prospective population-based surveillance in 2 US counties among children less than 5 years of age hospitalized with acute respiratory illness or fever from October 2001 through September 2003. Nasal/throat swabs were obtained and tested for HRVs, as determined by means of RT-PCR and then characterized by means of partial sequencing. RESULTS: Of 1052 children enrolled and tested during the 2-year period, 167 (16%) had HRVs detected. Of 147 samples successfully sequenced, 64 were group A HRVs, 6 were group B HRVs, and 77 were HRVCs. Children with HRVCs were significantly more likely than those with group A HRVs to have underlying high-risk conditions, such as asthma (42% vs 23%, P = .023) and to have had a discharge diagnosis of asthma (55% vs 36%, P = .022). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, HRVCs were detected in 7% of children hospitalized for fever or respiratory conditions and constituted almost half of all rhinovirus-associated hospitalizations, suggesting that this novel group causes a substantial burden of pediatric disease.","output":"A novel group of rhinoviruses is associated with asthma hospitalizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between May 15 and June 20, 2003, 71 suspected cases of monkeypox were investigated and 37 individuals in the United States developed laboratory confirmed monkeypox. These were the first cases of human monkeypox ever documented in the United States or in the Western Hemisphere. The disease was transmitted from small animals imported from Africa to other animals, including prairie dogs sold as pets throughout the U.S. Midwest. Direct contact with the infected animals was the method of infection, and although human to human transmission was thought to have occurred, this was not confirmed by follow up testing. Because of the link with contact with a prairie dog, initial evaluation of the disease was focused toward diseases commonly associated with this animal (e.g., tularemia, plague). Laboratory findings at the Marshfield Clinic in Marshfield, Wisconsin pointed to the presence of an orthopox. The CDC confirmed monkeypox was the infecting orthopox agent. Occupational health nurses from the Marshfield Clinic had direct involvement in the identification and follow up of employees who had direct contact with the diagnosed patients. Programs, such as a respiratory protection program initiated and carried out by Clinic occupational health nurses, were used to prevent employee exposure for Clinic staff. One Clinic employee was thought to potentially have monkeypox because of her direct contact with one of the patients. Four Clinic employees were vaccinated with vaccinia vaccine as a result of their contact with patients or lab specimens. Quarantine of the potentially infected employee and her boyfriend uncovered issues that must be addressed if other infectious diseases requiring quarantine or isolation of individuals emerge or re-emerge. These include a system to compensate individuals in quarantine or isolation who do not have any other source of income. The issue of whether workers' compensation should cover an employee who is quarantined or isolated for a potential work related exposure to an infectious disease if no disease is actually diagnosed also needs to be explored. A better system of getting state or CDC laboratory results back to the local level, including the occupational health area of the generating facility, must be developed. This will be very important if diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or smallpox should re-emerge in the United States. Occupational health nurses are an integral part of any infectious disease process occurring in the United States. The identification of monkeypox in the United States shows that any planning to detect, prevent, and treat diseases with the potential to affect the employee population must include occupational health nurse involvement.","output":"Monkeypox in the United States: an occupational health look at the first cases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article reveals the issues of interdependence of the development of human capital in public administration on the level of its provision by the state in the context of COVID-19.

Therefore, it is logical to focus on AOM when striving to improve antibiotic prescribing in pediatrics. This quality improvement project aimed to improve documentation of diagnostic criteria and physical examination findings in the medical record and improve adherence to recommended antibiotic prescribing recommendations for AOM by nurse practitioners at a childrens hospital-owned pediatric retail clinic. METHODS: We used The Institute for Healthcare Improvements Quality Improvement methodology to introduce an AOM quality bundle to providers in a pediatric retail clinic. We created Plan-Do-Study-Act ramps and implemented interventions, including NP education, electronic medical record improvements, and parent engagement. The percentage of compliant bundles (all five specific predetermined criteria successfully met) was measured for all patients diagnosed with AOM. RESULTS: Baseline AOM bundle compliance began at a mean of 42%. Pareto analysis of baseline data indicated that antibiotic choice and duration were key failure modes. Antibiotic choice or duration errors occurred in 48% of reviewed charts at project inception. The interventions introduced throughout the project led to steady improvement in the percent of compliant bundles. The goal of 95% compliant bundles was achieved and maintained. At the projects conclusion, 98% of antibiotic prescriptions were accurate.

A comprehensive study focusing on in-depth technology evolution, applications, problems, and future trends of specifically 3D printed nano-MEH systems with an energy point of view is rarely conducted. Therefore, this paper looks into the state-of-the-art technologies, energy harvesting sources/methods, performance, implementations, emerging applications, potential challenges, and future perspectives of additively manufactured nano-mechanical energy harvesting (3DP-NMEH) systems. The prevailing challenges concerning renewable energy harvesting capacities, optimal energy scavenging, power management, material functionalization, sustainable prototyping strategies, new materials, commercialization, and hybridization are discussed. A novel solution is proposed for renewable energy generation and medicinal purposes based on the sustainable utilization of recyclable municipal and medical waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, recommendations for future research are presented concerning the cutting-edge issues hurdling the optimal exploitation of renewable energy resources through NMEHs. China and the USA are the most significant leading forces in enhancing 3DP-NMEH technology, with more than 75% contributions collectively. The reported output energy capacities of additively manufactured nano-MEH systems were 0.5C32 mW, 0.0002C45.6 mW, and 0.3C4.67 mW for electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and triboelectric nanogenerators, respectively.

Obtaining additional insight into the charge-transfer (CT) chemistry of this antibiotic could help researchers and clinicians to improve such treatment protocols. Toward this aim, we investigated the CT interactions between AZM and three -acceptors: picric acid (PA), chloranilic acid (CLA), and chloranil (CHL) in MeOH solvent. AZM formed colored products at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the acceptors through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. An n  * interaction was also proposed for the AZM-CHL CT product.

We find that SARS-CoV-2 gains a wide host range by binding ACE2 sites essential for ACE2 carboxypeptidase activity. Six mutations found only in rodent species immune to SARS-CoV-2 are sufficient to abolish viral binding to human and dog ACE2. This is achieved through context-dependent mutational effects (intramolecular epistasis) conserved despite ACE2 sequence divergence between species. Across mammals, this epistasis generates sequence-function diversity, but through structures all bound by SARS-CoV-2. Mutational trajectories to the mouse conformation not bound by SARS-CoV-2 are blocked, by single mutations functionally deleterious in isolation, but compensatory in combination, explaining why human polymorphisms at these sites are virtually non-existent. Closed to humans, this path was opened to rodents via permissive cardiovascular phenotypes and ancient increases to ACE2 activity, serendipitously granting SARS-CoV-2 immunity. This reveals how ancient evolutionary trajectories are linked with unprecedented phenotypes such as COVID-19 and suggests extreme caution should be taken to monitor and prevent emerging animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

However, the mechanism of action has not yet been finally clarified. In particular, unanswered questions include whether it only affects peripheral or whether it also affects the spinal or supraspinal level. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of low-level light therapy on primary and secondary hyperalgesia in a human pain model. METHODS: This study was planned as a randomized, sham-controlled, and double-blinded trial with repeated measures within subject design. Capsaicin was applied on both forearms of ten healthy volunteers to induce peripheral and central sensitization. One forearm was treated with low-level light therapy; the other served as sham control. RESULTS: Low-level light therapy significantly increased the mechanical pain threshold, heat pain threshold, and decreased pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that low-level light therapy is effective at reducing the heat and mechanical pain threshold in a human pain model, pointing to a significant modulating effect on peripheral and central sensitization. These effectsespecially in the absence of reported side effectsmake low-level light therapy a promising tool in pain management.

This brief retrospective of the 1918 pandemic is taken from the viewpoint of the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic and is based on a short lecture given during the 2021 Virtual Congress of the ERA-EDTA. SUMMARY This review summarizes and highlights some of the earlier pandemic's salient features, some parallels with today, and some potential learnings, bearing in mind that the flu pandemic occurred over 100 years ago at a time of major turmoil during the climax to WWl, and with limited medical expertise and knowledge, research facilities, or well-structured and resourced healthcare services. While there is little or no information on renal complications at the time, or an effective treatment, some observations in relation to COVID-19 and vaccination are included. Key Messages: Lessons are difficult to draw from 1918 other than the importance and value of non-pharmaceutical measures to limit viral transmission. While the economic impact of the 1918 pandemic was significant, as it is now with COVID-19, subsequent economic analysis has shown that protecting public health and preserving economic activity are not mutually exclusive. Both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses are neurotropic and may cause chronically debilitating neurological diseases, including conditions such as encephalitis lethargica (still debated) and myalgic encephalomyelitis (chronic fatigue syndrome), respectively.

Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common autosomal recessive diseases amongst Caucasian children. However, recent epidemiologic studies suggest that the disease in Hispanic, African American, and Asian American populations may be more common than previously recognized. The phenotypic expression is characterized by the constellation of pulmonary, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Progressive obstructive lung disease is the hallmark of cystic fibrosis, and end-stage respiratory failure is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. The most significant advance in the care has been the development of Cystic Fibrosis modulators, a class of drugs that restore cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator folding, intracellular processing, or function. Improved diagnostic abilities, a multidisciplinary approach to medical management, and the use of cystic fibrosis modulators have led to improvement in the quality of life and life expectancy. These patients undergo range of procedures such as nasal polypectomy, placement of gastrostomy tubes, vascular access device placement, transbronchial lung biopsies, and other thoracic surgeries. The anesthetic care of children with advanced cystic fibrosis disease is complex. Preoperative optimization can help improve postoperative outcomes. Strategies for pain control should rely on non-opiate, multimodal adjuncts, and regional or neuraxial techniques. Unfortunately for some children, a progressive respiratory disease often leads to end-stage respiratory failure and lung transplant surgery remains the only viable treatment option. Widespread use of lung transplant surgery as a treatment option is severely constraint by donor organ availability. Primary graft dysfunction is the most common cause of early death and can be seen within 48 hours of surgery. Median long-term survival after lung transplant remains modest.

The function of the endothelium appeared to be crucial as a regulator or the initiator of the inflammatory process. Culture of human endothelial cells and experimental systems made it possible to define the molecular basis of inflammation in vascular diseases, in diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, vasculitis and thromboembolic complications.

Many of them are present in natural sources and exhibit biological activities, often better than the corresponding activities of monomeric acylphloroglucinols. All the stable conformers of T-ACPLs contain seven intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which constitute the dominant stabilising factors. A total of 38 different T-ACPLs, including both naturally occurring and model molecules, have been calculated at the HF and DFT/B3LYP levels. The DFT/B3LYP calculations were carried out both without and with Grimmes dispersion correction, to highlight the dispersion (and, therefore, also electron correlation) effects for these molecules. The roles of dispersion are evaluated considering the effects of Grimmes correction on the estimation of the conformers energies, the description of the characteristics of the individual hydrogen bonds, the conformers geometries and other molecular properties.

By providing a comprehensive analysis of redox status, blood-gases and histological parameters, we aimed to contribute to the ongoing debate in the literature. We demonstrated the preventive effect of exercise, but diabetes did not alter the severity of ALI. ABSTRACT Background and objective : Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening respiratory condition. Diabetes (DM) is a metabolic disease, which is characterized by hyperglycemia. There is an ongoing debate on if there is a protective effect of diabetes in ALI. Exercise is a special type of physical activity that has numerous beneficial effects. Our study aims to investigate the effects of diabetes and exercise on the prognosis of ALI. METHODS Male, Wistar albino rats were divided into two groups (sedentary&exercise). Both groups were divided into four subgroups: Control, ALI, DM, DM+ALI (n = 6 each).Diabetes was induced by Streptozotocin (STZ) injection (50mg/kg). Maximal exercise capacity (MEC) was determined with the incremental load test. Animals were exercised on the treadmill for 45 minutes on 70% of the MEC, five days a week for 12 weeks. ALI was induced by intratracheal Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) injection (100g/100g) 24 hours before sacrification. We made an arterial blood-gas analysis. Redox status was measured both in plasma and lung tissue. MDA and 8OHdG levels were measured in lung tissue. Histological evaluation of lung tissue has been made. RESULTS ALI caused significant damage in lung tissue, which was verified histologically, also an increase in oxidative stress parameters. Exercise prevented the lung damage done by ALI and reduced the oxidative stress in lung tissue. Diabetes did not alter the magnitude of damage done by ALI. CONCLUSION The exercise showed a protective effect against diabetes and acute lung injury in rats. The effect of diabetes was insignificant on the prognosis of ALI.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to develop a quantitative assay for IgG to SARS-CoV-2 proteins that could be implemented in clinical and research laboratories. METHODS: The biotin-streptavidin technique was used to conjugate SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) or nucleocapsid protein to the solid phase of the ImmunoCAP. Plasma and serum samples from patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (n = 60) and samples from donors banked before the emergence of COVID-19 (n = 109) were used in the assay. SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were followed longitudinally in a subset of samples and were related to total IgG and IgG to reference antigens using an ImmunoCAP 250 platform. RESULTS: At a cutoff of 2.5 g/mL, the assay demonstrated sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95% for IgG to both SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Among 36 patients evaluated in a post-hospital follow-up clinic, median levels of IgG to spike-RBD and nucleocapsid were 34.7 g/mL (IQR 18C52) and 24.5 g/mL (IQR 9C59), respectively. Among 17 patients with longitudinal samples, there was a wide variation in the magnitude of IgG responses, but generally the response to spike-RBD and to nucleocapsid occurred in parallel, with peak levels approaching 100 g/mL, or 1% of total IgG.

We previously developed a predictive score for the occurrence of ACS in SCD patients admitted at hospital for a VOC episode (Bartolucci et al., 2016). Two hundred and fifty patients with severe VOC requiring hospitalization were included in the PRESEV I study and 19% developed a secondary ACS within days post-admission (median [IQR] : 3 [2.3]). A multivariate analysis of these data established a predictive score of secondary ACS, with a negative predictive value of 98,9% for the low-level risk. Variables for calculation of the score were: reticulocytes and leucocytes counts, hemoglobin and categorical pain score (spine -pelvis). Interestingly enough, Hydroxyurea treatment did not have any impact on the score. Our goal was to validate this score in a multicenter international study, as it could represent a useful tool for physicians, for improving VOC management, but also be of use for therapeutic trials. Herein, we present results for adults. Methods This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study was performed in thirteen centres, over two continents (Africa and Europe) and five countries (Mali, Togo, England, Belgium and France). Homozygous SCD patients, both adults and children (>2 years), were included, with severe VOC requiring admission at the emergency unit. Severe VOC was defined as pain or tenderness affecting at least one part of the body (e.g. limbs, ribs, sternum, head, spine and/or pelvis) requiring opioids (level 3) and not attributable to other causes. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of an ACS, defined as an auscultatory abnormality (crepitation or bronchial breathing), or the association of a new radiologic infiltrate and chest pain or decreased breath sounds. Secondary outcome measures were hospital length of stay, morphine consumption, transfusion, hospitalization in intensive care unit and mortality. The following parameters were recorded: temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, respiratory frequency, categorical pain score. Pulmonary auscultation was performed at least once a day by a physician, every day, for the length of stay. The auscultatory abnormality, defined as crepitation, bronchial breathing or decreased breath sounds, was confirmed by a second physician. If a patient was discharged before day 5, follow-up with a phone call and/or a visit, 3 to 7 days after discharge were performed, to prevent complications or ACS. Results Three hundred and seventy-two adult patients with a severe VOC requiring hospitalization were included. Mean age was 29 (8) years old, sex ratio (female/male) was 1.2. A hundred and ninety-one patients came from Europe and 181 from Africa. Out of the 372 patients, 68 (18.3%) further developed a secondary ACS. Mean day of ACS episode was 3.3 (1.37). Among the 304 patients who did not develop an ACS episode (81.7%), 41 had a low risk score of developing a secondary ACS (predictive score  5). Among the 68 patients who developed a secondary ACS, 43 had a high-risk score ( 11). Results are shown in table 1. Three deaths were reported, all on African continent (ACS, anemia and end-stage nephropathy). Discussion and Conclusion Our multicenter international study has allowed confirmation of the incidence of patients developing a secondary ACS during a VOC. This study confirms that the PRESEV score could indeed represent a useful tool for physicians, most especially within emergency structures, by identifying patients with a low risk of further developing an ACS with a good NPV and thus, allowing a better management of SCD patients experiencing a VOC. The PRESEV score was successfully put to practice during the Covid-19 pandemic at the referral SCD center of Henri Mondor hospital and identified low-risk patients, who benefited from homecare services (DREPADOM). As such, the PRESEV score could represent a significant help when one considers t e shortness of bed availabilities in certain circumstances (pandemics, hospital settings in resource-limited countries, etc).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 122 patients (61 men and 61 women, 48  15 years) confirmed with COVID-19 and 48 patients (23 men and 25 women, 47  19 years) confirmed with influenza were enrolled in the study. Thin-section CT was performed. The clinical data and the chest CT findings were recorded. RESULTS: The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever (74%) and cough (63%), and 102 patients (83%) had Wuhan contact. Pneumonia in 50 patients with COVID-19 (45%) distributed in the peripheral regions of the lung, while it showed mixed distribution in 26 patients (74%) with influenza (p = 0.022). The most common CT features of the COVID-19 group were pure ground-glass opacities (GGO, 36%), GGO with consolidation (51%), rounded opacities (35%), linear opacities (64%), bronchiolar wall thickening (49%), and interlobular septal thickening (66%). Compared with the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have rounded opacities (35% vs. 17%, p = 0.048) and interlobular septal thickening (66% vs. 43%, p = 0.014), but less likely to have nodules (28% vs. 71%, p < 0.001), tree-in-bud sign (9% vs. 40%, p < 0.001), and pleural effusion (6% vs. 31%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in the CT manifestations of patients with COVID-19 and influenza. Presence of rounded opacities and interlobular septal thickening, with the absence of nodules and tree-in-bud sign, and with the typical peripheral distribution, may help us differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. KEY POINTS: ? Typical CT features of COVID-19 include pure ground-glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation, rounded opacities, bronchiolar wall thickening, interlobular septal thickening, and a peripheral distribution. ?

PURPOSE: To identify features of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) associated with TACE refractoriness and to develop a prediction model for estimating the risk of TACE refractoriness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Among 1025 patients with intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who underwent TACE as a first-line treatment during 2010-2017, 427 patients who underwent preoperative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI were analyzed. According to the date of initial TACE, patients were divided into the development cohort (n = 211) and the test cohort (n = 216). TACE refractoriness was determined according to the Japan Society of Hepatology guidelines. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to investigate the association between clinical/MRI features and TACE refractoriness. The performance of the prediction model was internally and externally assessed using the C-index of discrimination and a Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test for calibration. RESULTS: By analyzing 427 patients, we constructed a prediction model with the following independent features associated with TACE refractoriness: maximum tumor size; tumor number; peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase (HBP); and the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodule on HBP. This system enabled the prediction of TACE refractoriness in the development cohort (C-index, 0.796) and the test cohort (C-index, 0.738) with good discrimination and calibration abilities. CONCLUSION: The prediction model based on gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI features in addition to the known predictors including tumor size and number can be used to estimate the risk of TACE refractoriness in patients with intermediate-stage HCC.","output":"Prediction of transarterial chemoembolization refractoriness in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma using imaging features of gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are recognized respiratory pathogens, and some strains, including HCoV-OC43, can infect human neuronal and glial cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and activate neuroinflammatory mechanisms. Moreover, HCoV-OC43 is neuroinvasive, neurotropic, and neurovirulent in susceptible mice, where it induces chronic encephalitis. Herein, we show that a single point mutation in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein (Y241H), acquired during viral persistence in human neural cells, led to a hind-limb paralytic disease in infected mice. Inhibition of glutamate excitotoxicity using a 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazol-4-yl)propranoic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (GYKI-52466) improved clinical scores related to the paralysis and motor disabilities in S mutant virus-infected mice, as well as protected the CNS from neuronal dysfunctions, as illustrated by restoration of the phosphorylation state of neurofilaments. Expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1, responsible for glutamate homeostasis, was downregulated following infection, and GYKI-52466 also significantly restored its steady-state expression level. Finally, GYKI-52466 treatment of S mutant virus-infected mice led to reduced microglial activation, which may lead to improvement in the regulation of CNS glutamate homeostasis. Taken together, our results strongly suggest an involvement of excitotoxicity in the paralysis-associated neuropathology induced by an HCoV-OC43 mutant which harbors a single point mutation in its spike protein that is acquired upon persistent virus infection.","output":"Glutamate excitotoxicity is involved in the induction of paralysis in mice after infection by a human coronavirus with a single point mutation in its spike protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This year, the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) Annual Meeting took place in a virtual format, as it was not possible to hold the planned in-person meeting due to the COVID-19 crisis The meeting hosted a science pavilion including the latest scientific discoveries, an interactive virtual exhibit hall and a virtual auditorium featuring live educational sessions, emulating the dynamics of a physical meeting This meeting report will highlight presentations from the 4-day meeting ? 2020 Clarivate Analytics","output":"67th society of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging (SNMMI) annual meeting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Understanding clinical characteristics of patient is important to plan human resource and logistics Moreover, this gives understanding of pattern of disease This study aim to find the clinical characteristics observed in patients with suspected COVID-19 admitted at Patan Hospital Method: This is cross sectional descriptive study conducted at Patan Hospital, Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Nepal, on April 2020 Suspected COVID-19 patient admitted from January 25 to April 20, 2020 is taken for the study Record files were retrieved from record section and patients age, gender, place of residence, travel history, duration of symptom onset, symptoms on admission like fever, cough, rhinorrnoea, sore throat, myalgia and shortness of breath was recorded Signs on admission like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were also recorded Data were descriptive analyzed Ethical approval was obtained Result: Total 40 suspected COVID-19 patients got admitted from 25 January to 20 April 2020 Of these admissions 25 (62 5%) were male, median age was 30 years, median days of return from abroad was 9 days, average duration of stay at hospital was 3 8 days There were two COVID-19 positive patients who were asymptomatic Conclusion: Travel history and history of travel to the community inside the country where COVID-19 has been detected is important to suspect COVID-19 Keyword: COVID-19, clinical characteristics, Nepal","output":"Clinical characteristics of suspected COVID-19 admitted to the isolation ward of Patan Hospital, Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What effect has the pandemic had on staff in early years settings including redundancies, turnover and training?

The role of different management approaches in reducing risk and vulnerability is also explored. Results suggest that concession areas having the largest accumulated and current biomass have the highest risk, which is also transferred to the municipal level. The scenarios modelled with better management practices that reduce diseases were able to reduce risks by 30C40%. The largest risk reduction is achieved when production biomass is divided in a more equitable manner among concession areas, suggesting the need for strategic improvements in spatial planning of the activity in the marine environment according to ecosystem carrying capacity and better practices. Improving adaptation capacity can reduce vulnerability between 20% and 30% for municipalities;for example, providing local employment can be a win-win management measure under the COVID-19 threat because it reduces movement of people and facilitates handling and responses to emergencies. A larger footprint in local economies and employment can also improve social perception and acceptance of the sector, thus contributing to improve adaptation changes and governance to face the threats. The framework used here to perform a risk and vulnerability assessment of salmon farming to the pandemic-associated threats can also be useful for other aquaculture systems elsewhere, provided that relevant information is available.","output":"Chilean salmon farming vulnerability to external stressors: The COVID 19 as a case to test and build resilience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Meningitis remains a rare but potentially life-threatening intracranial complication of acute rhinosinusitis.

Fourthly, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic mediated the OVXCstock connection, because this pandemic has had a tremendous impact on global financial markets. Our results reveal that the implications of OVX shocks on stock returns are nonlinear and dynamic and exhibit high asymmetry and heterogeneity. In particular, the positive OVX changes have a U-shaped effect on Chinese stock rewards in a bearish market, rather than the linear negative effect reported by Xiao et al. (2018).

Results indicate that adolescents' self-presentation practices were related to three different factors: social validation;authenticity;and image control. One of the most outstanding results is that self-presentation practices could be less guided by social feedback, since the number of followers or likes was irrelevant for most adolescents, and that adolescents increasingly tend to be guided by innovative predispositions of truthfulness. In turn, conclusions suggest that teens need to be equipped with suitable self-representation practices for safe and sustainable identity narratives on social networks, since the global COVID-19 pandemic has exponentially increased both the usage and the time spent on social networking sites, enlarging the availability of spaces for adolescents to express themselves and build their identities through different self-representation practices.","output":"Analysis of Digital Self-Presentation Practices and Profiles of Spanish Adolescents on Instagram and TikTok"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Cancer 'patients' are increasingly using traditional indigenous and complementary medicines (T&CM) alongside conventional medical treatments to both cure and cope with their cancer diagnoses. To date T&CM use among Indigenous cancer patients from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States has not been systematically reviewed. METHODS We systematically searched bibliographic databases to identify original research published between January 2000 and October 2017 regarding T&CM use by Indigenous cancer patients in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. Data from records meeting eligibility criteria were extracted and appraised for quality by 2 independent reviewers. RESULTS Twenty-one journal articles from 18 studies across all 4 countries met our inclusion criteria. T&CM use ranged from 19% to 57.7% (differing across countries). T&CM was mostly used concurrently with conventional cancer treatments to meet their spiritual, emotional, social, and cultural needs; however, bush, traditional, and herbal medicines were used in a minority of cases as an alternative. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the importance of T&CM use to Indigenous cancer patients across these 4 countries; we identified multiple perceived spiritual, emotional and cultural benefits to its use. The patient's perception of their health professional's attitudes toward T&CM in some cases hindered or encouraged the patient's disclosure. Additional research is required to further explore the use and disclosure of T&CM among Indigenous cancer patients to help inform and ensure effective, safe, coordinated care for Indigenous cancer patients that relies on shared open decision making and communication across patients, communities, and providers.","output":"Traditional and Complementary Medicine Use Among Indigenous Cancer Patients in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States: A Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a complex disease with short- and long-term respiratory, inflammatory and neurological symptoms that are triggered by the infection with SARS-CoV-2. Invasion of the brain by SARS-CoV-2 has been observed in humans and is postulated to be involved in post COVID condition. Brain infection is particularly pronounced in the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19. Here, we show that treatment of K18-hACE2 mice with melatonin and two melatonin-derived marketed drugs, agomelatine and ramelteon, prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry in the brain thereby reducing virus-induced damage of small cerebral vessels, immune cell infiltration and brain inflammation. Brain entry of SARS-CoV-2 through endothelial cells is prevented by melatonin through allosteric binding to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which interferes with the cell entry receptor function of ACE2 for SARS-CoV-2. Our findings open new perspectives for the repurposing of melatonergic drugs in the prevention of brain infection by SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-related long-term neurological symptoms.","output":"Melatonin drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain and virus-induced damage of cerebral small vessels"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SocialCecological systems are based on particular species and on their direct and human-mediated interactions. The golden humped tench or tinca gobba dorata, a variety of tenchTinca tinca (L., 1758)traditionally bred in artificial ponds called peschiere in Poirino highlands, northwest Italy, is one of such species. The aim of the study is to investigate the traditional farming of the golden humped tench, the associated knowledge, practices, and gastronomy, and to discuss the changes that the tench, the ponds, and their role in the local socialCecological system are going through. METHODS: The data analyzed were collected in different locations of Poirino highlands during MayCSeptember 2021. Fieldwork included semi-structured interviews (n = 23) with current and former tench farmers about the breeding and gastronomy of the tench and the management of the peschiere. The interviewees selection occurred through an exponential non-discriminative snowball sampling, and interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis. RESULTS: The golden humped tench has been farmed for centuries in ponds used also to water livestock and to irrigate cultivated fields, and managed by every peasant household in the area. This integrated aquaculture system is underpinned by detailed knowledge on the peschiera ecosystem and on the tench life cycle and supports a gastronomic knowledge that is part of the local heritage. The ongoing process of gastronomic valorization of the tench is sustaining the role of the fish in locals livelihoods and as a marker of regional identity, but it is also transforming tench farming, already threatened by livelihood change, pesticides, and invasive species, in controversial ways. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that ponds and tenches are core elements of the local socialCecological system, defining the cultural landscape and engendering a form of regional identity around them. Studying integrated aquaculture systems and associated knowledge and practices is relevant to design sustainable systems of food production and to address possibilities of conservation of biodiversity and livelihoods in aquatic environments.","output":"Integrated pond aquaculture and regional identity: ethnobiology of the golden humped tench of Poirino highlands, Northwest Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation among children and adolescents. Design: Nationwide, population-based cohort study. Setting: Norway from 1 March 2020 to 31 April 2021. Participants: All Norwegian residents <18 years of age. Main outcome measures: Population-based health care and population registries were used to study risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including socioeconomic factors, country of origin, and pre-existing chronic comorbidities. All residents were followed until age 18, emigration, death, or end of follow-up. Hazard ratios (HR) estimated by Cox regression models were adjusted for testing frequency. Further, risk factors for admission to the hospital among the infected were investigated. Results: Of 1 182 796 residents, 22608 (1.9%) tested positive by polymerase chain reaction or lateral flow tests, of whom 107 (0.5%) were admitted to a hospital. Low family income (aHR 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.46), crowded housing (1.35, 1.30 to 1.39), household size, age, and area of living were independent risk factors for infection. A non-Nordic country of origin was the strongest risk factor (aHR 2.37, 95% CI 2.30 to 2.49), whereas chronic comorbidity was not associated with the risk of infection. Chronic comorbidity was associated with hospitalisation (aHR 4.15, 2.63 to 6.56), in addition to age, whereas socioeconomic status and country of origin did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. Conclusions: Socioeconomic factors, country of origin, and area of living were associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, these factors did not predict hospitalisation among those infected. Chronic comorbidity was associated with the risk of admission but not with the overall risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation in children and adolescents in Norway: A nationwide population-based study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, toward the end of the Winter semester, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted life across the globe.

The VieScope (VSC) as a new type of laryngoscope consisting of a straight, shielded, illuminated tube used to perform intubation via a bougie was investigated in this prospective randomized trial in patients without expected difficult airways. METHODS: With ethics approval, 2  29 patients for elective surgery were randomized 1:1 to intubation with VSC or MacL. Endpoints were first attempt success rates (FAS), Percentage of Glottis Opening Scale (POGO), time to intubation (TTI), and difficulty ratings on visual analog scales (0C100, lower values better). Data are given as mean  standard deviation. RESULTS: The FAS was 83  38% for VSC and 86  34% for MacL (P = 0.723). For VSC, POGO was 86  17% and for MacL 68  30% (P = 0.007).

Though rates of food insecurity declined to pre-recession levels just prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, they are now once again increasing. As a result, in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, millions of young children continue to grow up in households that struggle daily with a problem that is often associated with the developing world. The result is both immediate and long-term health and development deficits for children. We propose that the degree of demographic and socioeconomic congruence between the households of young children and their neighborhood of residence lends unique insights to food insecurity. We examine this using the ECLS-K 2010-2011 for children in families with incomes below 400 percent of the federal poverty line (N = 8600). Results show that congruence between household and neighborhood education and race/ethnicity associates with the likelihood of experiencing food insecurity. For example, households with non-Hispanic black children living in neighborhoods with high proportions of non-Hispanic blacks have significantly lower probabilities of food insecurity than similar households living in neighborhoods with smaller black populations. Similarly, more highly educated families experience lower probability of food insecurity in high education neighborhoods than when they reside in low education neighborhoods. Focusing on neighborhood risk factors as absolute and independent contributors limits our understanding of how families experience food insecurity as well as any policy efforts to address it.","output":"Food insecurity in households with young children: A test of contextual congruence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The news of the new coronavirus infection was received with great excitement by the medical and patient community with cystic fibrosis, taking into account the possible consequences for patients. Objective: During the period from the beginning of the pandemic from March 1 to October 1, 2020, 10 cases of COVID-19 in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) were analysed (according to the organising committee of the CF Registry) in comparison with 85,282 sick children from the general population of children and adolescents of the Russian Federation. Methods: Detection of 2019-nCoV coronavirus RNA by PCR or ELISA of class M and G immunoglobulins for SARS-CoV-2. Results: As of October 1, the incidence of COVID-19 was 340:100,000 for children and 840:100,000 for adults. Among 10 children with CF (boys ?90%, girls ?10%) there were no children under 1y.o. (in the population- 12.4%), in the group 1C3y.o ?20% (in the population ?15.8%), in the group 4C7 y.o.- 40% (in the comparison group - 20.3%), in the group >8 y.o. ?40%, (in the comparison group 51.5%). Among children with CF, 1 child of 1y.o. was hospitalised (10% of all cases), in the general population C 34,912 (40.93%). The ratio of children treated on an outpatient basis and in a hospital in the population was 1: 2.2, with CF 1:10. Pneumonia in children with CF and COVID-19 was registered in 3 children (30%), and in children in the general population - 9.7%. Asymptomatic course was observed in 3 patients (30%) with CF. The main symptom of CF was fever (60%) and in the population ?7.5%, increased cough and weakness were in 50% of children with CF, in the population - 37% and 35.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The incidence among children with CF was less common than in adults, and there was a different age structure of children with COVID-19 among patients with CF and in the population.

However, these valuable data are not sufficiently covered by the available databases. In this study, a major update of VARIDT (a database previously constructed to provide DTs variability data) was thus described. First, the experimentally resolved structures of all DTs reported in the original VARIDT were discovered from PubMed and Protein Data Bank. Second, the structural variability data of each DT were collected by literature review, which included: (a) mutation-induced spatial variations in folded state, (b) difference among DT structures of human and model organisms, (c) outward/inward-facing DT conformations and (d) xenobiotics-driven alterations in the 3D complexes. Third, for those DTs without experimentally resolved structural variabilities, homology modeling was further applied as well-established protocol to enrich such valuable data. As a result, 145 mutation-induced spatial variations of 42 DTs, 1622 inter-species structures originating from 292 DTs, 118 outward/inward-facing conformations belonging to 59 DTs, and 822 xenobiotics-regulated structures in complex with 57 DTs were updated to VARIDT (https://idrblab.org/varidt/ and http://varidt.idrblab.net/).

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800/200 mg on day 1, and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 ug/mL (IQR 18.9;31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated. No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. Conclusions: High LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients. The ratio of calculated unbound drug fraction to published SARS-CoV2 EC50 values indicated insufficient LPV concentrations in the lung.

This study aims to assess the impact of reninCangiotensin system modulation (RASi) (either angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEIs) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)) on COVID-19 outcome. METHODS: We performed a cohort study on consecutive patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia at the Internal Medicine Unit of Sant'Orsola-Malpighi Hospital in Bologna, Italy. Patients with a possible alternative cause of respiratory failure other than COVID-19 were excluded. Clinical, pharmacological and laboratory data at admission and during the hospitalization were collected. Patients were treated with intravenous dexamethasone, low molecular weight heparin and nasal flow or Venturi mask oxygen. Subjects were followed until discharge, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission or death. Severe cases were defined by acute respiratory distress syndrome (arterial oxygen partial pressure and the fraction of inhaled oxygen ratio (P/F)  100 mmHg/%, or P/F  150 mmHg/% and respiratory rate  26/min). Patients with chronic use of RAS modulation were compared with those without for the composite outcome of in-hospital mortality or ICU admission. Hazard ratios (HR) were obtained by Cox regression, adjusted for several clinical factors. RESULTS: Of the 268 patients enrolled in the study, 93 (35%, mean age 68  13 years, 67% males) were treated with RASi (58% ACEIs and 42% ARBs). There were no meaningful differences between the RASI and no RASI group regarding clinical and laboratory parameters at admission. As expected, patients in the RASi group had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic heart disease. One hundred eight patients (40%) were admitted to ICU during hospitalization due to severe respiratory failure, and 24 (9%) died. The risk of in-hospital death or ICU admission was lower in the RASI group than in the non-RASI group (age and sex-adjusted HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.37C0.8), even after adjustment for several comorbidities (fully adjusted HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26C0.74). Seven (7.5%) patients died in the RASi group vs 17 (9.7%) in the non-RASi group, leading to a non-statistically significant mortality risk reduction (fully adjusted HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.18C1.90). The lower risk in the RASi group was primarily related to ARBs use compared to ACEIs (HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.28C0.92 and HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.51C1.32, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed an inverse association between the chronic use of RASi and COVID-19 pneumonia severity (either ICU admissions or in-hospital death), even when significant comorbidities are considered.","output":"ReninCangiotensin system modulation and outcomes in patients hospitalized for interstitial SARS-CoV2 pneumonia: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease named COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, is currently generating a global pandemic.

METHODS: The study used a quantitative, cross-sectional approach. Data was collected online using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI-18); the Coronavirus Awareness Scale-6 (CAS-6) and a questionnaire that included psychological and sociodemographic questions. The total sample size consisted of 1559 respondents from Honduras (34%), Chile (29%), Costa Rica (17%), Mexico (11%), and Spain (9%). RESULTS: The most common stress domains correspond to family (22.97%), financial (22.53%), academic (16.47%), leisure time constraints (14.23%), health (12.48%), peer group (7.63%), and religious concerns (3.69%). These domains are significantly associated with the respondent's country, sex, employment status, and being or not a health worker. Respondents who reported confinement stress also reported higher scores in anxiety, depression, and somatization. The Global Severity Index was significantly predicted by confinement stress, health, academic, and leisure time-related stress, sex, age, being a health worker, COVID-19 Personal Concern, and Perceived Seriousness. Non-significant predictors were employment status, the number of people at home, presence of older adults and children at home, financial, peer group, family, and religious concerns; the regression model had an R(2) of 0.26.

NB features changes in the normal voiding pattern at the bladder filling and emptying phases. Overactive NB is characterized by urgency symptoms, with or without urinary incontinence, caused by NB. This disorder affects many domains of life (physical, social, psychological, domestic, sexual) that limit personal autonomy and degrade the quality of life. Among the several treatments available, the conservative physical therapy intervention through tibial nerve electrostimulation (TNES) and parasacral electrostimulation (PSES) can help improve patient conditions with a smaller number of collateral effects than those of interventions based on medication. The aim of the present study is to compare the effects of TNES and PSES techniques in women with overactive NB after stroke episodes to assess the impact of urinary incontinence in these women, on their number of incontinence episodes, daytime and nocturnal urinary frequency, and quality of life. METHODS: This is a prospective clinical study to compare two randomized groups based on parallel and blind conditions. Forty-four women who have had a stroke episode at least 30 days before the trial and who have developed overactive NB will be recruited for the trial.

The identified cellular proteins comprised several functional categories, including cytoskeleton proteins, annexins, molecular chaperones, chromatin modifying proteins, enzymes-binding proteins, calcium-binding proteins and signal transduction-associated proteins. Among these, three host proteins have not been previously reported in virions of other virus families, including two signal transduction-associated proteins (syntenin and Ras small GTPase) and one tumor-associated protein (tumor protein D52). The presence of five selected cellular proteins (i.e., -actin, tubulin, annexin A2, heat shock protein Hsp90 and ezrin) associated with the purified NDV particles was validated by Western blot or immunogold labeling assays.

To better characterize the northern extent of emerging A. americanum, we conducted active surveillance (i.e., drag sampling) in summer 2020 throughout Michigans southern counties and detected one adult A. americanum from each of six widespread sites, including where they had been detected in 2019.

We show by means of the reproductive number, \${cal R}_0$ that the containment measures appear to have slowed the growth of the outbreak. Nevertheless, these measures remain only effective as long as a very large fraction of population, p, greater than the critical value $1-1/{cal R}_0$ remains confined. Using French current data, we give some simulation experiments with five scenarios including: (i) the validation of model with p estimated to 93%, (ii) the study of the effectiveness of containment measures, (iii) the study of the effectiveness of the large-scale testing, (iv) the study of the social distancing and wearing masks measures and (v) the study taking into account the combination of the large-scale test of detection of infected individuals and the social distancing with linear progressive easing of restrictions.

We also noticed that if the measures studied in our five scenarios are taken separately then the second wave might occur at least as far as the parameter values remain unchanged.","output":"A model of COVID-19 transmission to understand the effectiveness of the containment measures: application to data from France"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Passenger traffic dropped 90% at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic according to an International Air Traffic Association (IATA) analysis in December 2020 and the complexity of restarting air transport is still evident today.

Studies accounting for individual-level health characteristics are lacking. METHODS: We leveraged the breadth and depth of the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases and built a national cohort of 169,102 COVID-19 positive United States Veterans, enrolled between March 2, 2020 and January 31, 2021, and followed them through February 15, 2021. Annual average 2018 PM2.5 exposure, at an approximately 1 km2 resolution, was linked with residential street address at the year prior to COVID-19 positive test. COVID-19 hospitalization was defined as first hospital admission between 7 days prior to, and 15 days after, the first COVID-19 positive date. Adjusted Poisson regression assessed the association of PM2.5 with risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: There were 25,422 (15.0%) hospitalizations; 5,448 (11.9%), 5,056 (13.0%), 7,159 (16.1%), and 7,759 (19.4%) were in the lowest to highest PM2.5 quartile, respectively. In models adjusted for State, demographic and behavioral factors, contextual characteristics, and characteristics of the pandemic a one interquartile range increase in PM2.5 (1.9 g/m3) was associated with a 10% (95% CI: 8%-12%) increase in risk of hospitalization. The association of PM2.5 and risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 individuals was present in each wave of the pandemic. Models of non-linear exposure-response suggested increased risk at PM2.5 concentrations below the national standard 12 g/m3. Formal effect modification analyses suggested higher risk of hospitalization associated with PM2.5 in Black people compared to White people (p = 0.045), and in those living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to higher levels of PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 infected individuals. The risk was evident at PM2.5 levels below the regulatory standards. The analysis identified those of Black race and those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods as population groups that may be more susceptible to the untoward effect of PM2.5 on risk of hospitalization in the setting of COVID-19.","output":"Ambient fine particulate matter air pollution and the risk of hospitalization among COVID-19 positive individuals: Cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Adopting an intersectional feminist lens, we explore our identities as single and co-parents thrust into the new reality of the UK COVID-19 lock-down.

India initiated social distancing measures to combat the epidemic of COVID-19. The course of the epidemic of COVID-19 for India was predicted using stochastic probabilityCbased mathematical modeling. Methods: Data synthesis for the top few countries affected was studied for various factors affecting the epidemic. For projections of infected cases for India, the modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed/recovered framework modified for the effect of social distancing (Rho) was used. Simulation was carried out for 10,000 runs using python. Projections for infected cases and hospitalization requirement were estimated. Results: The epidemic curve will peak in the third week of June in India with 17,525,869 and 2,153,200 infected people with reproduction number of 1.8 and Rho of 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. Compared with the baseline scenario of no social distancing, for transmissibility with R0 = 1.8, the reduction in infections due to social distancing measure is 78% (Rho = 0.7) and 97% (Rho = 0.6). Similarly for R0 = 2.2 and 2.4, the reduction in infected numbers slightly lowers to 62% and 66% with Rho = 0.7 and 92% and 75% with Rho = 0.6, respectively. With R0 = 1.8 and Rho = 0.6, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed requirement is 107,660, whereas if transmissibility is high, the ICU bed requirement would increase to 1,994,682. Conclusions: The social distancing measures seem to have been working for India in absence of treatment in sight for COVID-19.

Uncertainty remains as to the magnitude of this effect and to how this association changes with time and degree of healing. METHODS PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science searches identified 1570 citations. Screening of abstracts identified 155 articles for full-text review, of which 19 met inclusion criteria. For 3 outcomes of interest (surgeries, hospitalizations, remission), weighted random-effects meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS In pooled analysis, MH predicted fewer major abdominal surgeries (relative risk [RR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26-0.46), increased remission (RR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.43-2.36), and fewer hospitalizations (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42-0.78). Complete MH and partial MH both showed significantly higher rates of favorable outcomes. Separate analyses for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis showed identical patterns for surgeries and remission. When subjects with no healing were excluded, and complete versus partial healing was compared, rates of surgery were not significantly different (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.46-1.44). However, complete healing was superior in predicting corticosteroid-free remission (RR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.24-2.34). Meta-regression found that the predictive power of this complete versus partial healing distinction was strongly associated with the duration of follow-up after endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS MH is a strong predictor of fewer surgeries, long-term clinical remission, and fewer hospitalizations. Complete healing is not significantly more favorable than partial healing for predicting surgeries or hospitalizations, but it did predict higher rates of clinical remission.

As observed in other airborne viral infections such as influenza and SARS-CoV-1, healthcare workers are at high risk for infection when performing aerosol-generating medical procedures (AGMP). Additionally, the threats of a global shortage of standard personal protective equipment (PPE) prompted many healthcare workers to explore alternative protective enclosures, such as the aerosol box invented by a Taiwanese anesthetist. Our study includes the design process of a protective barrier enclosure and its subsequent clinical implementation in the management of critically ill adults and children infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND RESULTS: The barrier enclosure was designed for use in our tertiary care facility and named SplashGuard CG (CG for Care Givers). The device has been adapted using a multi- and interdisciplinary approach, with collaboration between physicians, respiratory therapists, nurses, and biomechanical engineers. Computer-aided design and simulation sessions throughout the entire process facilitated the rapid and safe implementation of the SplashGuard CG in different settings (intensive care unit, emergency department, and the operating room) during AGMPs such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, nasopharyngeal suctioning, intubation and extubation, and noninvasive ventilation. Indications for use and anticipatory precautions were communicated to all healthcare workers using the SplashGuard CG. The entire process was completed within one month. CONCLUSION: The rapid design, development, and clinical implementation of a new barrier enclosure, the SplashGuard CG, was feasible in this time of crisis thanks to close collaboration between medical and engineering teams and the use of recurring simulation sessions to test and improve the initial prototypes.

Chartis has been validated during spontaneous breathing, undergoing procedural sedation (PS), but can also be performed under general anesthesia (GA). Performing Chartis under PS is often challenging because of coughing, mucus secretion and difficulties in maintaining an adequate level of sedation. The study objective was to investigate whether there is a difference in Chartis measurement outcomes between PS and GA. METHODS In this prospective study patients underwent Chartis measurements under both PS and GA. Study outcomes were Chartis measurement duration, number of measurements, feasibility and success rate. RESULTS We included 30 patients with severe emphysema (mean age 62 years and median FEV1 29% of pred.). Chartis measurement duration was significantly longer under PS than under GA (mean 20.34.2 minutes versus 15.14.4, P<0.001). There was no difference in the number of measurements performed (median 2 (range 1-3) for PS versus 1 (1-3) for GA, P=1.00).

In this paper, a new normalization algorithm that consists of MeanCVariance-Softmax-Rescale (MVSR) processes respectively is proposed to provide facilitation pre-assessment and diagnosis Covid-19 disease. In order to show the effect of MVSR normalization technique, the algorithm of proposed method is applied to chest X-ray and Sars-Cov-2 computed tomography images dataset. The normalized X-ray images with MVSR are used to recognize Covid-19 virus via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. At the implementation stage, the MVSR algorithm is executed on MATLAB environment, then all the arithmetic operations of the MVSR normalization are coded in VHDL with the help of fixed-point fractional number representation format on FPGA platform. The experimental platform consists of Zynq-7000 Development FPGA Board and VGA monitor to display the both original and MVSR normalized chest X-ray images. The CNN model is constructed and executed using Anaconda Navigator interface with python language. Based on the results of this study, infections of Covid-19 disease can be easily diagnosed with MVSR normalization technique.

We performed pleiotropic meta-analyses using Fishers method and omnibus test applied to summary statistics for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD and EDU in large-scale univariate GWAS at suggestive-effect (5  10(?8) < p < 0.1) and genome-wide (p  5  10(?8)) significance levels. We report 53 SNPs that attained p  5  10(?8) at least in one of the pleiotropic meta-analyses and were reported in the univariate GWAS at 5  10(?8) < p < 0.1. Of them, there were 46 pleiotropic SNPs according to Fishers method. Additionally, Fishers method identified 25 of 206 SNPs with pleiotropic effects, which attained p  5  10(?8) in the univariate GWAS. We showed that a large fraction of the pleiotropic associations was affected by a counterintuitive phenomenon of antagonistic genetic heterogeneity, which explains the increase, rather than decrease, of the significance of the pleiotropic associations in the omnibus test. Functional enrichment analysis showed that apart from cancers, gene set harboring the non-pleiotropic SNPs was characterized by late-onset AD and neurodevelopmental disorders. The pleiotropic gene set was characterized by a broad spectrum of progressive neurological and neuromuscular diseases and immune-mediated conditions, including progressive motor neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinsons disease, and severe AD.

Because of budget and theatre time constraints, the trauma waiting list often exceeds 50 - 60 patients who need urgent and emergent surgery in high-volume orthopaedic trauma centres. This situation is exacerbated by other surgical disciplines using orthopaedic theatre time for life-threatening injuries because of lack of own theatre availability. One of the proposed solutions to this problem is outsourcing of some of the cases to private medical facilities. OBJECTIVES: To establish the volume of work done by an orthopaedic registrar during a 3-month trauma rotation, and to calculate the implant and theatre costs, as well as compare the salary of a registrar with the theoretical private surgeon fees for procedures performed by the registrar in the 3-month period. METHODS: In a retrospective study, the surgical logbook of a single registrar during a 3-month rotation, from 14 January to 14 April 2019, was reviewed. Surgeon fees were calculated for these procedures, according to current medical aid rates, without additional modifier codes being added. RESULTS: During the 3-month study period, a total of 157 surgical procedures was performed, ranging from total hip arthroplasty to debridement of septic hands. Surgeon fees amounted to ZAR186 565.10 per month a?? double the gross salary of a registrar. Total implant costs amounted to ZAR1 272 667. Theatre costs were ZAR1 301 976 for the 3-month period. CONCLUSIONS: Although this analysis was conducted over a short period, it highlights the significant amount of trauma work done by a single individual at a high-volume tertiary orthopaedic trauma unit.

Even after adequate treatment, IDA group had significantly more hospitalizations (median, 25th - 75th: 2 (0 - 4) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P < 0.001), falls (median, 25th - 75th: 1 (0 - 3) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P < 0.001) and mortalities (10.8% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.011); CDA group had significantly more hospitalizations (median, 25th - 75th: 1 (0 - 2) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.007), but no difference in falls (median, 25th - 75th: 0 (0 - 1) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.171) and mortalities (7.6% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.083); and FDA group had significantly more hospitalizations (median, 25th - 75th: 1 (0 - 2) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.001), but no difference in falls (median, 25th - 75th: 0 (0 - 1) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.615) and mortalities (4.5% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.550), compared to the NNDA group. Age, Black race, higher number of comorbidities, presence of malignancy and use of direct oral anticoagulants were associated with increased odds of AHO in patients with NDA. Conclusions Compared to the patients with NNDA, patients with IDA had more hospitalizations, falls and mortalities even after adequate treatment; while patients with CDA and FDA had only more hospitalizations. Adequate treatment mitigated falls and mortalities in elderly patients with CDA and FDA.","output":"Impact of Correcting Nutritional Deficiency Anemias in the Elderly on Hospitalizations, Falls, and Mortalities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This qualitative research investigates the impact of the lockdowns (which started in March 2020) and other factors on Pakistani migrant workers food access and consumption practices in Kuala Lumpur. It also explores how they managed food supply. The article drives data from 14 in-depth informal interviews conducted through WhatsApp messenger and face to face. The qualitative interviews were categorized into themes and were analyzed. It used the concepts of social practices and the more proximate structural layers to assert that marginalized groups used their rationale and choices to access food and survived in intense social pressure or returned to their home country. The migrant workers narratives revealed that they did not have work for around seven months;thus, they had no wages. However, as a rule, many of the migrant workers one month's wages were still not paid by their employers, which the workers were received through weekly installments for food during the lockdowns. As a result, most of the workers wages and savings were exhausted. Thus, they started seeking help for food from their community groups, friends, and the local Malaysians in their neighborhood and other cities. Most workers complained that once their wages were exhausted, they did not receive support from their employers. Thus, the workers had abandoned beverages and sweets dishes;and rarely cooked fish and beef. However, almost all respondents in this research had received food support from their community members. The study found that android mobile phones, cheap internet, social media, and close networking enabled the migrant workers to navigate financial and food supply during the pandemic. The study concludes that during a health crisis like the pandemic and consequent strict measures by the governments, the food security of the migrant workers (the vulnerable groups) at the grassroots level could easily be ensured with the community's help, networking, and cheap mobile technology.","output":"Pakistani migrant workers social practices to deal with food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two thought provoking comments related to understanding the problems with the coronavirus are presented.","output":"Two simple comments regarding coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus pandemic has drastically affected healthcare organizations across the globe.

From September 2015 through August 2018, 203 NoV outbreaks involving 2500 cases were reported to the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. METHODS: Faecal specimens for 203 outbreaks were collected and epidemiological data were obtained through the AGE outbreak surveillance system in Shenzhen. Genotypes were determined by sequencing analysis. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary characteristics of NoV in Shenzhen, molecular evolution and mutations were evaluated based on time-scale evolutionary phylogeny and amino acid mutations. RESULTS: A total of nine districts reported NoV outbreaks and the reported NoV outbreaks peaked from November to March. Among the 203 NoV outbreaks, 150 were sequenced successfully. Most of these outbreaks were associated with the NoV GII.2[P16] strain (45.3%, 92/203) and occurred in school settings (91.6%, 186/203). The evolutionary rates of the RdRp region and the VP1 sequence were 2.1  10(C3) (95% HPD interval, 1.7  10(C3)C2.5  10(C3)) substitutions/site/year and 2.7  10(C3) (95% HPD interval, 2.4  10(C3)C3.1  10(C3)) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The common ancestors of the GII.2[P16] strain from Shenzhen and GII.4 Sydney 2012[P16] diverged from 2011 to 2012. The common ancestors of the GII.2[P16] strain from Shenzhen and previous GII.2[P16] (2010C2012) diverged from 2003 to 2004. The results of amino acid mutations showed 6 amino acid substitutions (*77E, R750K, P845Q, H1310Y, K1546Q, T1549A) were found only in GII.4 Sydney 2012[P16] and the GII.2[P16] recombinant strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the molecular epidemiological patterns in Shenzhen, China, from September 2015 to August 2018 and provides evidence that the epidemic trend of GII.2[P16] recombinant strain had weakened and the non-structural proteins of the recombinant strain might have played a more significant role than VP1.

Although telehealth is commonly utilized throughout medicine and mental health practices, teletesting has remained limited within cognitive and academic evaluations. This may be largely due to concern for the validity of test administration via remote assessment. This cross-sectional study examined the equivalency of cognitive [Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children - Fifth Edition (WISC-V)] and academic [Kaufman Test of Educational Achievement - Third Edition (KTEA-3)] subtests administered via either teletesting or traditional in-person testing within clinically referred youth. METHOD: Chart review using a retrospective, cross-sectional design included a total of 893 children and adolescents, ranging from 4 to 17 years (Mean age = 10.2 years, SD = 2.9 years) who were administered at least one subtest from the aforementioned cognitive or academic assessments. Of these, 285 received teletesting, with the remaining (n = 608) receiving in-person assessment. A total of seven subtests (five from the WISC-V and two from the KTEA-3) were examined. A series of inverse probability of exposure weighted (IPEW) linear regression models examined differences between groups for each of the seven subtests after adjustment for numerous demographic, diagnostic, and parent-reported symptom variables. RESULTS: Only two significant differences were found, such that WISC-V Visual Puzzles (p < .01) and KTEA-3 Math Concepts (p = .03) scores were slightly higher in the teletesting versus in-person groups.

This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilize a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from 3 multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. RESULTS Of 513 samples 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included Influenza A - H1 2009(26.0%), Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus(21.5%), Influenza A - H3N2 (17.0%), Human Metapneumovirus (9.4%), Influenza B (6.6%), Coronavirus (4.9%), Para-influenza virus (4.5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and Adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). TInfluenza A - H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. CONCLUSIONS There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country.

SETTING The study's setting was in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. METHODS Data from 145 T2D patients who had SG (37%) or GB (63%) and at least 1-year follow-up were analyzed. Diabetes remission was defined as hemoglobin A1c  6.0% without diabetes medications. Analysis involved binary logistic regression to identify predictors and general linear regression for variables associated with glycemic improvement after surgery. RESULTS Baseline parameters are as follows: BMI 40.0  7.6 kg/m2, A1c 8.4  1.6%, diabetes duration 9.3 years, ethnic composition: Chinese (51.7%), Malay (23.4%), Indian (20.7%), Others (4.1%). 55.9% achieved diabetes remission at 1 year. Baseline A1c, baseline BMI, and diabetes duration were significant pre-operative factors for remission (cumulative R 2 = 0.334). At 12 months, percentage weight loss was similar after SG (24.1  7.4%) and GB (25.4  7.4%, p = 0.31). Greater A1c decrease was seen with GB compared to SG (2.7  1.6 vs 2.0  1.5%, p = 0.006), significant even after adjustment for weight loss, age, BMI, baseline A1c, and diabetes duration (p = 0.033). Weight loss at 12 months also correlated independently with A1c reduction. Ethnicity did not influence weight loss, diabetes remission, or glycemic control after MBS.

The reasons for decreased PAP compliance during the COVID-19 pandemic are unclear. The primary outcome will be to identify if there is a common reason that patients at the Albuquerque VA were less compliant with PAP after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Compliance data for 4/1/2020 through 9/30/2020 was compared to compliance data for 4/1/2019 through 9/30/2019. Compliance after PAP machine setup was confirmed to be lower during the 2020 time period. Noncompliant patients will be selected by setup type, new versus machine replacement, and surveyed for reasons for noncompliance. The survey will be conducted at the Albuquerque VA Sleep Center and will include questions regarding beliefs, barriers, and challenges with the use of PAP therapy during the coronavirus pandemic. The definition for initial PAP compliance will be the use of PAP therapy for greater than or equal to four hours per night on at least 70% of nights. RESULTS: For the 6-month time period of 4/1/2019 through 9/30/2019, there were 758 PAP setups at the Albuquerque VA. The 30-day compliance for the 758 setups was found to be 61.4%. Comparatively, for the six-month period of 4/1/2020 through 9/30/2020, there were 462 setups with a 30-day compliance result of 49.7%. A survey consisting of questions designed to elicit barriers to use as well as beliefs regarding PAP and COVID-19 will be administered to 20% (n = 46) of the non-compliant patients who were set up with a PAP machine during the 2020 study period. CONCLUSION: PAP compliance after machine setup was lower at the Albuquerque VA sleep center in 2020 versus 2019 (49.7% versus 61.4%). The reasons for the lower observed compliance are attributed to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. A random sampling of the non-compliant patients during the 2020 time period will be performed and the results will be presented once available.

It has been an increasing trend in recent years (Wang H, Xu WM, Zhu KJ, Zhu SJ, Zhang HF, Wang J, Yang Y, Shao FY, Jiang NM, Tao ZY, Jin HY, Tang Y, Huo LL, Dong F, Li ZJ, Ding H, Liu ZG, Emerg Microbes Infect 9:889-99, 2020). Brucellosis is capable to invade multiple systems throughout the body, lacking in typical clinical manifestations, and easily misdiagnosed and mistreated. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a male, 5-year-and-11-month old child without relevant medical history, who was admitted to hospital for 20 days of fever. When admitted to the hospital, we found that he was enervated, irritable and sleepy, accompanied with red eyes phenomenon. After anti-infection treatment with meropenem, no improvement observed. Lumbar puncture revealed normal CSF protein, normal cells, and negative culture. Later, doppler echocardiography suggested coronary aneurysms, and incomplete Kawasaki Disease with coronary aneurysms was proposed. The next day, brucellosis agglutination test was positive. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cerebrospinal fluid suggested B.melitensis, which was confirmed again by blood culture. The child was finally diagnosed as brucellosis with meningocephalitis, coronary aneurysm and keratitis. According to our preliminary research and review, such case has never been reported in detail before. After diagnosis confirmation, the child was treated with rifampicin, compound sulfamethoxazole, and ceftriaxone for cocktail anti-infection therapy. Aspirin and dipyridamole were also applied for anticoagulant therapy. After medical treatment, body temperature of the child has reached normal level, eye symptoms alleviated, and mental condition gradually turned normal. Re-examination of the doppler echocardiographic indicated that the coronary aneurysm was aggravated, so warfarin was added for amplification of anticoagulation treatment. At present, 3 months of follow-up, the coronary artery dilatation gradually assuaged, and the condition is continued to alleviate. CONCLUSION: Brucellosis can invade nervous system, coronary artery, and cornea. Brucellosis lacks specific signs for clinical diagnosis. The traditional agglutination test and the new mNGS are convenient and effective, which can provide the reference for clinical diagnosis.","output":"Meningoencephalitis, coronary artery and keratitis as an onset of brucellosis: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a respiratory illness with multiple extra-pulmonary complications.

We argue that the enormous benefit Africa derived from globalization, especially, during the COVID-19 pandemic, makes it imperative for the African Union to rethink its globalization strategy, as well as strategies to mitigate African economies from the vulnerability of future pandemic. We argue that the vulnerability of African economies to the COVID-19 could be traced to characteristics of African economies, such as the dominance of low-skilled labour force, informally employed workers that do not have the option of working remotely, digital divide due to poor internet penetration, urban and rural structures that promote the spread of a virus, and breakdown of critical global supply chain may.

It is anticipated that rationing of health care resources will be required, thus demanding that choices be made about which individuals should receive potentially life-saving care when not all who can be saved can be served. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION Most proposed triage and allocation plans have used medical inclusion and exclusion criteria to reduce this gap, but there will still be many more patients than resources. Thus, the potential to arbitrarily exclude groups of people on non-medical grounds in order to reduce relative scarcity could offer an attractive option. Can societies make reasoned anticipatory decisions to keep certain people from receiving influenza treatment in order to maximize the availability of care for other, more favored groups? RESULTS In this paper, we argue that taking the fundamental moral equality of people seriously requires the inclusion of vulnerable, socially marginalized groups (such as illegal immigrants and incarcerated prisoners) in planning for a pandemic. While there may be a majoritarian justification for a priori discrimination against some groups of people on non-medical grounds, there are no morally defensible reasons to do so and many reasons not to engage in such behavior. CONCLUSIONS Pandemic planners should resist attempts to institute either unsanctioned or authorized discrimination in resource allocation. Because of their unique position in society, their ethical code and their essential role in confronting a pandemic, physicians can (and should) defend egalitarianism in the allocation of health care resources in such a public health crisis and advocate and act against such exclusion were it to occur.","output":"Preparing for an influenza pandemic: are some people more equal than others?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While COVID-19 is rapidly propagating around the globe, the need for providing real-time forecasts of the epidemics pushes fits of dynamical and statistical models to available data beyond their capabilities.

Those uncertainties significantly reduce after the epidemics peak is reached. Differences in the uncertainty of the forecasts at a regional level can be used to highlight the delay in the spread of the virus. Our results warn that long term extrapolation of epidemics counts must be handled with extreme care as they crucially depend not only on the quality of data, but also on the stage of the epidemics, due to the intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics.

METHODS: Two hundred thirty-nine consecutive inpatients with COVID-19, supported with laboratory tests, were evaluated. Detailed neurological examinations and evaluations of all patients were performed. All evaluations and examinations were performed by two neurologists who have at least five-year experience. RESULTS: This study was carried out 239 patients (133 male + 106 female) with diagnosed COVID-19. Neurological findings were present in 83 of 239 patients (34.7%). The most common neurological finding was a headache (27.6%). D-dimer blood levels were detected to be significantly higher in patients with at least one neurological symptom than patients without the neurological symptom (p < 0.05). IL-6 level was found to be significantly higher in patients with headache than without headache (p < 0.05).

Overactivity of the immune system may result in a devastating immuno-inflammation with extensive damage to tissue leading to organ damage and/or failure. The literature suggests several human diseases in which neutrophil elastase (NE) is postulated to be important in the pathophysiology including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), breast and lung cancer, and recently also in Sars-cov-2 virus infection (Covid-19). In particular, the lungs are affected by the destructive power of the protease neutrophil elastase (NE). In this paper, we report the pre-clinical development of a selective and specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [11C]GW457427, as an in vivo biomarker for the study of NE, now available for human studies. METHODS: [11C]GW457427 was produced by methylation of GW447631 using [11C]methyl triflate and GMP validated production and quality control methods were developed. Chemical purity was high with no traces of the precursor GW611437 or other uv-absorbing compounds. A method for the determination of intact [11C]GW457427 in plasma was developed and the binding characteristics were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. An animal model for lung inflammation was used to investigate the specificity and sensitivity of the [11C]GW457427 tracer for neutrophil elastase (NE) in pulmonary inflammation, verified by blockade using two structurally different elastase inhibitors. RESULTS: [11C]GW457427 was obtained in approximately 45% radiochemical yield and with a radiochemical purity higher than 98%. Molar activity was in the range 130-360 GBq/mol. Binding to NE was shown to be highly specific both in vitro and in vivo and a significantly higher uptake of tracer was found in a lipopolysaccharide mouse model of pulmonary inflammation compared with control animals. The uptake in lung tissue measured as standardized uptake value (SUV) strongly correlated with tissue NE content as measured by ELISA. In vitro studies also showed specific tracer binding in aortic tissue of patients with abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA). The rate of metabolism in rats was appropriate considering the critical balance between available tracer for binding and requirement for blood clearance with about 40% and 20% intact [11C]GW457427 in plasma at 5 and 40 min, respectively. Radioactivity was cleared from blood and organs in control animals with mainly hepatobiliary excretion with distribution in the intestines and the urinary bladder; but without retention of the tracer in healthy organs of interests such as the lung, liver, kidneys or in the cardiovascular system. A dosimetry study in rat indicated that the whole-body effective dose was 2.2 Sv/MBq with bone marrow as the limiting organ. It is estimated that up to five PET-CT investigations could be performed in humans without exceeding a total dose of 10 mSv. CONCLUSION: [11C]GW457427 is a promising in vivo PET-biomarker for NE with high specific binding demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. A GMP validated production method including quality control has been developed and a microdosing toxicity study performed with no adverse signs.

However, a systemic investigation into associations between ACE2 and oncogenic pathways, tumor progression, and clinical outcomes in pan-cancer remains lacking. Methods: : Using cancer genomics datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program, we performed computational analyses of associations between ACE2 expression and antitumor immunity, immunotherapy response, oncogenic pathways, tumor progression phenotypes, and clinical outcomes in 12 cancer cohorts. We also identified co-expression networks of ACE2 in cancer. Results: : ACE2 upregulation was associated with increased antitumor immune signatures and PD-L1 expression, and favorable anti-PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 immunotherapy response. ACE2 expression levels inversely correlated with the activity of cell cycle, mismatch repair, TGF-, Wnt, VEGF, and Notch signaling pathways.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight hundred and twelve medical workers took part in a cross-sectional Internet survey. The questionnaire included a socio-demographic block, a block of questionnaires for assessing the level of symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-9 and GAD-7). The data were processed using statistical methods. RESULTS The prevalence of anxiety and depression among healthcare providers during the pandemic was 48.77% and 57.63% respectively. Subjectively poor quality of sleep was noted by 37.4% of respondents. Cluster analysis distinguished 4 groups of respondents: group 1 was characterized by high scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a low subjective assessment of sleep quality; group 2 had low scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7 and a high subjective assessment of sleep quality; respondents from clusters 3 and 4 had average total scores on PHQ-9 and GAD-7, however, group 4 was characterized by significantly lower values of subjective sleep quality assessment. CONCLUSION The division into clusters makes it possible to understand which groups of medical workers require psychological (psychotherapeutic) support in the first place.

Our objective was to assess the utility of lymphocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods: We conducted a cohort study of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 or another respiratory infection (i.e., influenza, CAP) at seven hospitals in Ontario, Canada.The first available lymphocyte count during the hospitalization was used. Standard test characteristics for lymphocyte count (x109/L) were calculated (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating curve [AUC]). All analyses were conducting using R. Results: There were 869 hospitalizations for COVID-19, 669 for influenza, and 3009 for CAP. The mean age across the three groups was 67 and patients with pneumonia were older than those with influenza or COVID19, and approximately 46% were woman. The median lymphocyte count was nearly identical for the three groups of patients: 1.0 x109/L (interquartile range [IQR]:0.7,2.0) for COVID-19, 0.9 x109/L (IQR 0.6,1.0) for influenza, and 1.0 x109/L (IQR 0.6,2.0) for CAP. At a lymphocyte threshold of less than 2.0 x109/L, the sensitivity was 87% and the specificity was approximately 10%. As the lymphocyte threshold increased, the sensitivity of diagnosing COVID-19 increased while the specificity decreased. The AUC for lymphocyte count was approximately 50%. Interpretation: Lymphocyte count has poor diagnostic discrimination to differentiate between COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. The lymphopenia we consistently observed across the three illnesses in our study may reflect a non-specific sign of illness severity. However, lymphocyte count above 2.0 x109/L may be useful in ruling out COVID-19 (sensitivity = 87%).","output":"Assessing the utility of lymphocyte count to diagnose COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dementia is caused by a variety of neurodegenerative diseases and is associated with a decline in memory and other cognitive abilities, while inflicting an enormous socioeconomic burden. The complexity of dementia and its associated comorbidities presents immense challenges for dementia research and care, particularly in clinical decision-making. MAIN BODY: Despite the lack of disease-modifying therapies, there is an increasing and urgent need to make timely and accurate clinical decisions in dementia diagnosis and prognosis to allow appropriate care and treatment. However, the dementia care pathway is currently suboptimal. We propose that through computational approaches, understanding of dementia aetiology could be improved, and dementia assessments could be more standardised, objective and efficient. In particular, we suggest that these will involve appropriate data infrastructure, the use of data-driven computational neurology approaches and the development of practical clinical decision support systems. We also discuss the technical, structural, economic, political and policy-making challenges that accompany such implementations.

In particular, in a situation where the world is entering a rapidly aging society, health care services are being researched and developed in the direction of preventing diseases in advance and maintaining a healthy life. Healthcare services are bringing important changes in the pandemic era caused by covid-19. There is a need for a system capable of efficiently sharing and exchanging information of heterogeneous services to prevent emergencies and support optimal medical services. In this paper, we designed and developed a system that can collect, convert, and store bio-signals from various wearable sensors into international standard data to develop such healthcare services. HL7 (health level seven) FHIR (fast healthcare interoperability resources) applied mutandis in this paper is a standard protocol for data exchange between medical information systems of real-Time collected bio signals.

The interface module consists of a client part and a server part. The client part generates a variety of signal data from the healthcare service user and delivers the message to the server part. The server part is designed and implemented to parse the received message by segment field unit and transmit whether the message is abnormal or not to the client part.

We think that lockdowns may lead to weight gain and worsening of glycemic parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). The purpose of this study was to investigate how type 2 DM patients were affected by the lockdown. METHOD: Type 2 DM patients unable to attend regular follow-ups due to lockdown over a 75-day period between March and June 2020 and who again attended polyclinic follow-up when the lockdown was lifted were included in the study. These patients' glycemic control and weight status were compared with the pre-lockdown period. In addition, patients' general habits, and adherence to diet and exercise were evaluated, while their general health was assessed using the Short-Form 36-item survey. RESULT: The research involved 101 type 2 DM patients, 57 men (56.5%) and 44 women (44.5%), with a mean age of 55  13. Patients' mean pre-lockdown weight was 84.7  16.4 kg, rising to 85.5  16.8 kg post-lockdown, although the increase was not statistically significant (p = 0.781).

Anexhaustive search is performed to create a base of information that the panel considers when making recommendations for best clinical practices. This literature, coupled with clinical experience, is the basis for recommendations and for identification of gaps in the base of knowledge regarding trialing for intrathecal pump placement. RESULTS The panel has made recommendations for the proper methods of trialing for long-term intrathecal drug delivery. CONCLUSION The use of intrathecal drug delivery is an important part of the treatment algorithm for moderate to severe chronic pain. It has become common practice to perform a temporary neuroaxial infusion before permanent device implantation.

Unprecedented efforts have enabled development and authorization of a range of vaccines, which reduce transmission rates and confer protection against the associated disease COVID-19. These vaccines are conceptually diverse, including e.g. classical adjuvanted whole-inactivated virus, viral vectors, and mRNA vaccines. We have analysed two prototypic model vaccines, the strongly TH1-biased measles vaccine-derived candidate MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) and a TH2-biased Alum-adjuvanted, non-stabilized Spike (S) protein side-by-side, for their ability to protect Syrian hamsters upon challenge with a low-passage SARS-CoV-2 patient isolate. As expected, the MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccine protected the hamsters safely from severe disease. In contrast, the protein vaccine induced vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) with massive infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs. Global RNA-Seq analysis of hamster lungs revealed reduced viral RNA and less host dysregulation in MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccinated animals, while S protein vaccination triggered enhanced host gene dysregulation compared to unvaccinated control animals. Of note, mRNAs encoding the major eosinophil attractant CCL-11, the TH2 response-driving cytokine IL-19, as well as TH2-cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were exclusively up-regulated in the lungs of S protein vaccinated animals, consistent with previously described VAERD induced by RSV vaccine candidates. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were also up-regulated in S-specific splenocytes after protein vaccination. Using scRNA-Seq, T cells and innate lymphoid cells were identified as the source of these cytokines, while Ccl11 and Il19 mRNAs were expressed in lung macrophages displaying an activated phenotype. Interestingly, the amount of viral reads in this macrophage population correlated with the abundance of Fc-receptor reads. These findings suggest that VAERD is triggered by induction of TH2-type helper cells secreting IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, together with stimulation of macrophage subsets dependent on non-neutralizing antibodies. Via this mechanism, uncontrolled eosinophil recruitment to the infected tissue occurs, a hallmark of VAERD immunopathogenesis. These effects could effectively be treated using dexamethasone and were not observed in animals vaccinated with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H). Taken together, our data validate the potential of TH2-biased COVID-19 vaccines and identify the transcriptional mediators that underlie VAERD, but confirm safety of TH1-biased vaccine concepts such as vector-based or mRNA vaccines. Dexamethasone, which is already in use for treatment of severe COVID-19, may alleviate such VAERD, but in-depth scrutiny of any next-generation protein-based vaccine candidates is required, prior and after their regulatory approval.","output":"In contrast to TH2-biased approaches, TH1 COVID-19 vaccines protect Syrian hamsters from severe disease in the absence of dexamethasone-treatable vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory pathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the problem of estimating the number of defective items $d$ within a pile of $n$ elements up to a multiplicative factor of $\\\\Delta>1$, using deterministic group testing algorithms.

We included any type of study on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results about their mental health. We were, therefore, interested in quantitative studies examining the prevalence of problems and effects of interventions, as well as qualitative studies examining experiences. We had no restrictions related to study design, methodological quality or language. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The disproportion between the need for technological supplies of intensive care medicine and their scarcity promotes, among many factors, high rates of psychological distress. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fear and anguish were observed during the pandemic, probably related to extremely high workloads and the lack of personal protective equipment.","output":"THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (ICU): PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS IN HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS C A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives COVID-19 disease, which rapidly became a pandemic, led to significant changes in the provision of health services. This included radical changes to the supply and delivery of routine services to release resources for emergency care. During this process, a range of restrictions were imposed including the recommended rules to be followed before, during and after surgery. Health services provided for breast cancer diagnosis, treatment and follow-up have also undergone enforced changes meaning the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with priority has come to the fore. In this study, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, between March 11, 2020 and May 31, 2020 was assessed in comparison to pre-pandemic practice in terms of divided into two periods, and breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Material and Methods Surgeons dealing with breast cancer treatment and registered to SENATURK (Turkish Senology Academy) were contacted online. The period was divided into two, between March 11th and April 30th and May 1st to May 31st, 2020. Surgeons were requested to complete two electronic evaluation forms, one for each period, investigating change in practice. Only complete responses for both periods were included in the analysis. Results There were 93 respondents. Except for less multidisciplinary breast councils, there was no delay in radiological and pathological diagnoses. The number of breast cancer surgeries increased in Period 2, and more COVID-19 positive breast cancer patients were operated in Period 2. Benign breast patients were delayed less frequently in Period 2. In the statistical analysis performed between the two groups, it was found that only a significant difference was in the number of outpatients with benign breasts. Conclusion With sufficient awareness of the risks of COVID-19 and with individual protection, breast cancer treatment was not affected during the assessed period of active pandemic in Turkey.","output":"Changes and disruptions in diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of breast cancer during two periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innate and adaptive immune responses have evolved distinct strategies for controlling different viral pathogens. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a picornavirus that can cause paralysis, diabetes, and myocarditis within days of infection. The optimal innate immune response against EMCV in vivo requires CD1d. Interaction of antigen-presenting cell CD1d with distinct natural killer T-cell (\\"NKT\\") populations can induce rapid gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production and NK-cell activation. The T-cell response of CD1d-deficient mice (lacking all NKT cells) against acute EMCV infection was further studied in vitro and in vivo. EMCV persisted at higher levels in CD1d-knockout (KO) splenocyte cultures infected in vitro. Furthermore, optimal resistance to repeat cycles of EMCV infection in vitro was also shown to depend on CD1d. However, this was not reflected in the relative levels of NK-cell activation but rather by the responses of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell populations. Repeated EMCV infection in vitro induced less IFN-gamma and alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) from CD1d-deficient splenocytes than with the wild type. Furthermore, the level of EMCV replication in wild-type splenocytes was markedly and specifically increased by addition of blocking anti-CD1d antibody. Depletion experiments demonstrated that dendritic cells contributed less than the combination of NK and NKT cells to anti-EMCV responses and that none of these cell types was the main source of IFN-alpha. Finally, EMCV infection in vivo produced higher levels of viremia in CD1d-KO mice than in wild-type animals, coupled with significantly less lymphocyte activation and IFN-alpha production. These results point to the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism of rapid CD1d-dependent stimulation of the antiviral adaptive cellular immune response.","output":"CD1d mediates T-cell-dependent resistance to secondary infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) in vitro and immune response to EMCV infection in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been associated with outbreaks of canine infectious respiratory disease in shelters and boarding kennel environments.

In this study, reverse transcription iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) was developed to facilitate point-of-need diagnosis of CDV infection. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity (limit of detection 95%) of the established CDV RT-iiPCR was about 11 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA per reaction. CDV RT-iiPCR generated positive signals from CDV, but not Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine parvovirus, canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus 2, canine influenza virus (subtype H3N8), canine parainfluenza virus, and canine respiratory coronavirus. To evaluate accuracy of the established reaction in canine distemper clinical diagnosis, 110 specimens from dogs, raccoons, and foxes suspected with CDV infection were tested simultaneously by CDV RT-iiPCR and real-time RT-PCR. CDV RT-iiPCR demonstrated excellent sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%), compared to real-time RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated an excellent correlation between RT-iiPCR and a reference real time RT-PCR method.

Mobile air purifiers are used to reduce the risk of infection indoors. We focus on an air purifier that generates a defined volumetric air flow through a highly efficient filter material. We investigate the transport of aerosol particles from an infected dummy equipped with an aerosol generator to receiving thermal dummies. For analysis, we use up to 12 particle sensors to monitor the particle concentration with high spatial resolution. Based on the measurement data, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is set up and validated. The experimental and numerical methods are used to investigate how the risk of infection suggested by the particle exposure in an exemplary lecture hall can be reduced by a clever choice of orientation of the air purifier. It turns out that obstructing the outlet stream of the air purifier may be particularly advantageous. The particle concentration at the head height deviates by 13% for variations of the location and orientation. At an air change per hour of 5, the cumulated PM1 mass at the head level was reduced by 75%, independently of the location of the infected dummy, compared to the natural decay case, showing that filtration is an effective means of reducing aerosol particle concentrations. Finally, CFD simulation was used to monitor the particle fates. The steady simulation results fit quite well with the experimental findings and provide additional information about the particle path and for assessing the comfort level due to air flow.","output":"Reducing indoor particle exposure using mobile air purifiersExperimental and numerical analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ObjectiveThe second round of the serial cross-sectional sentinel-based population survey to assess active infection, seroprevalence, and their evolution in the general population across Karnataka was conducted.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive computational analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with single nanobodies Nb6, VHH E, and complex with VHH E/VHH V nanobody combination. We combined coarse-grained and all-atom molecular simulations and collective dynamics analysis with binding free energy scanning, perturbation-response scanning, and network centrality analysis to examine mechanisms of nanobody-induced allosteric modulation and cooperativity in the SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer complexes with these nanobodies. By quantifying energetic and allosteric determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with nanobodies, we also examined nanobody-induced modulation of escaping mutations and the effect of the Omicron variant on nanobody binding. The mutational scanning analysis supported the notion that E484A mutation can have a significant detrimental effect on nanobody binding and result in Omicron-induced escape from nanobody neutralization. Our findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein might exploit the plasticity of specific allosteric hotspots to generate escape mutants that alter response to binding without compromising activity. The network analysis supported these findings showing that VHH E/VHH V nanobody binding can induce long-range couplings between the cryptic binding epitope and ACE2-binding site through a broader ensemble of communication paths that is less dependent on specific mediating centers and therefore may be less sensitive to mutational perturbations of functional residues. The results suggest that binding affinity and long-range communications of the SARS-CoV-2 complexes with nanobodies can be determined by structurally stable regulatory centers and conformationally adaptable hotspots that are allosterically coupled and collectively control resilience to mutational escape.","output":"Allosteric Determinants of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Binding with Nanobodies: Examining Mechanisms of Mutational Escape and Sensitivity of the Omicron Variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the case of a 2-year-old girl with acute-onset divergent strabismus and ptosis in the right eye.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic mapping study is to provide an overview and a structured understanding of CMH literature available in the Scopus database. METHODS: A total of 289 selected publications were analyzed based on 8 classification criteria: publication year, publication source, research type, contribution type, empirical type, mental health issues, targeted cohort groups, and countries where the empirically evaluated studies were conducted. RESULTS: The results showed that there was an increasing interest in CMH publications; journals were the main publication channels of the selected papers; exploratory research was the dominant research type; advantages and challenges of the use of technology for mental health care were the most investigated subjects; most of the selected studies had not been evaluated empirically; depression and anxiety were the most addressed mental disorders; young people were the most targeted cohort groups in the selected publications; and Australia, followed by the United States, was the country where most empirically evaluated studies were conducted. CONCLUSIONS: CMH is a promising research field to present novel approaches to assist in the management, treatment, and diagnosis of mental health issues that can help overcome existing mental health care delivery barriers.

Inhibitory and facilitatory mechanisms affect the perception of stimuli as painful or non-painful, and in addition may affect the perceived intensity of pain. Endogenous opioids are key mediators in the descending pain suppression pathways. Additionally, monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine positively or negatively modulate pain signaling, depending on receptor type and location. The various mediators involved in pain signaling provide potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Single analgesic therapies may be limited in their ability to comprehensively target these complex pain signaling pathways. Therapeutic approaches acting on multiple pain transmission pathways through different mechanisms of action provide an opportunity to maximize efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of pain. SCOPE This article discusses the various physiologic processes involved in pain signaling and modulation, describes the mechanisms by which various classes of analgesic agents are believed to produce their clinical effects, and explores the potential benefits of a multiple-mechanism approach to analgesia. Published articles describing the physiologic processes involved in pain signaling and modulation and the mechanisms of analgesia for different drug classes were reviewed. MEDLINE searches were conducted to identify relevant studies published through August 2009 that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of multiple-mechanism analgesic regimens. English language-only randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials were considered. FINDINGS/CONCLUSION Multiple neurotransmitters and other mediators are involved in the endogenous modulation of pain signaling, providing numerous opportunities for intervention with different classes of analgesics. Data from numerous clinical trials indicate that multiple-mechanism approaches to analgesia provide comparable or superior analgesic efficacy with lower doses of the individual agents and reduced incidence of side effects. These data support current guidelines which endorse multiple-mechanism strategies for both acute and chronic pain management.","output":"Mechanisms of pain transmission and pharmacologic management."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This review aimed to investigate whether bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is safe in patients with severe acute respiratory failure (ARF). METHODS We searched the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and other databases up to June 2, 2021 for studies that examined BAL for severe ARF. We included all cohort studies and randomized or non-randomized trials, while we excluded case-control studies, case reports, and case series. We evaluated the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. RESULTS We included 17 studies (1085 patients) in the meta-analysis. The integrated frequency of death was 0.000% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.000-0.045%, I2 = 0.0%). The pooled risk of severe complications of respiratory system, cardiovascular system, and major bleeding was 1.32% (95% CI: 0.000-4.41%, I2 = 84.8%), 0.040% (95% CI: 0.000-0.71%, I2 = 9.3%), and 0.000% (95% CI: 0.000-0.27%, I2 = 0.0%), respectively. In the subgroup analysis with mechanical ventilation during BAL, there were few severe complications of the respiratory system (3/717 patients in 13 studies) and almost no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0%). CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that severe complications of BAL for severe ARF are probably rare, particularly in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

However, variability in the sensitivity of diagnostic thresholds exists, which may be due to a lack of standardized normative reference values. Current estimates of normal median nerve CSA stem largely from small studies using a local pool of healthy controls. A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to identify all available data for median nerve CSA in healthy, asymptomatic individuals to create a comprehensive set of normative reference values. METHODS Articles that include sonographic measures of median nerve CSA will be identified through a rigorous search of published evidence, a hand search through tables of contents of key journals, and the gray literature, including ClinicalTrials.gov and conference abstracts. Each abstract and full text will be reviewed by multiple raters to identify studies from 2000 to present that include original data. Any study that provides median nerve CSA values from healthy individuals will be included (e.g., reference value study, control participants in a diagnostic study). Studies will be assessed for quality using a modified version of the National Institute of Health Study Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies, with primary focus on the use of a detailed and acceptable image acquisition and analysis protocol. Using data from included studies, reference values will be calculated for median nerve CSA by anatomical regions, including the distal forearm, wrist, and carpal tunnel at the level of the pisiform. Reference values will be stratified by gender, ethnicity, and age based upon the specificity of the data provided by the included articles. DISCUSSION A comprehensive set of normative reference values of median nerve CSA will reduce variability across studies, allowing future research to more accurately evaluate and establish diagnostic thresholds. Additionally, normative values can serve as a reference for evaluating treatment outcomes and provide a means to investigate and understand minor nuances in CSA changes that may be indicative of preclinical stages of median nerve pathology.

Existing treatments that can be repurposed as prophylactic and therapeutic agents may reduce the pandemics devastation. Emerging evidence of potential applications in other therapeutic contexts has led to the investigation of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for COVID-19. Such products include vitamin C, vitamin D, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, probiotics, and zinc, all of which are currently under clinical investigation. In this review, we critically appraise the evidence surrounding dietary supplements and nutraceuticals for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Overall, further study is required before evidence-based recommendations can be formulated, but nutritional status plays a significant role in patient outcomes, and these products may help alleviate deficiencies. For example, evidence indicates that vitamin D deficiency may be associated with a greater incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19, suggesting that vitamin D supplementation may hold prophylactic or therapeutic value. A growing number of scientific organizations are now considering recommending vitamin D supplementation to those at high risk of COVID-19. Because research in vitamin D and other nutraceuticals and supplements is preliminary, here we evaluate the extent to which these nutraceutical and dietary supplements hold potential in the COVID-19 crisis. IMPORTANCE Sales of dietary supplements and nutraceuticals have increased during the pandemic due to their perceived immune-boosting effects. However, little is known about the efficacy of these dietary supplements and nutraceuticals against the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) or the disease that it causes, CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review provides a critical overview of the potential prophylactic and therapeutic value of various dietary supplements and nutraceuticals from the evidence available to date. These include vitamin C, vitamin D, and zinc, which are often perceived by the public as treating respiratory infections or supporting immune health. Consumers need to be aware of misinformation and false promises surrounding some supplements, which may be subject to limited regulation by authorities. However, considerably more research is required to determine whether dietary supplements and nutraceuticals exhibit prophylactic and therapeutic value against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19.

HCV replication cycle is closely tied to lipid metabolism and infection by this virus causes profound changes in host lipid homeostasis. We focused our attention on a phosphatidate phosphate (PAP) enzyme family (the lipin family), which mediate the conversion of phosphatidate to diacylglycerol in the cytoplasm, playing a key role in triglyceride biosynthesis and in phospholipid homeostasis. Lipins may also translocate to the nucleus to act as transcriptional regulators of genes involved in lipid metabolism. The best-characterized member of this family is lipin1, which cooperates with lipin2 to maintain glycerophospholipid homeostasis in the liver. Lipin1-deficient cell lines were generated by RNAi to study the role of this protein in different steps of HCV replication cycle. Using surrogate models that recapitulate different aspects of HCV infection, we concluded that lipin1 is rate limiting for the generation of functional replicase complexes, in a step downstream primary translation that leads to early HCV RNA replication. Infection studies in lipin1-deficient cells overexpressing wild type or phosphatase-defective lipin1 proteins suggest that lipin1 phosphatase activity is required to support HCV infection.

Using a mouse model of viral hepatitis, we identified virus-induced early transcriptional changes in the redox pathways in the liver, including downregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 (Sod1). Sod1(?/?) mice exhibited increased inflammation and aggravated liver damage upon viral infection, which was independent of T and NK cells and could be ameliorated by antioxidant treatment. Type I interferon (IFN-I) led to a downregulation of Sod1 and caused oxidative liver damage in Sod1(?/?) and wild-type mice.

Hence, there is an urgent need to discover effective drugs to control this pandemic. NSP16 is a methyltransferase that methylates the ribose 2'-O position of the viral nucleotide. Taking advantage of the recently solved structure of NSP16 with its inhibitor, S-Adenosylmethionine, we have virtually screened FDA approved drugs, drug candidates and natural compounds. The compounds with the best docking scores were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using the MM-PBSA method. The known drugs which were identified as potential inhibitors of NSP16 from SARS-CoV-2 included DB02498, DB03909, DB03186, Galuteolin, ZINC000029416466, ZINC000026985532, and ZINC000085537017. DB02498 (Carba-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide) is an approved drug which has been used since the late 1960s in intravenous form to significantly lessen withdrawal symptoms from a variety of drugs and alcohol addicts and it has the best MM-PBSA binding free energy of-12.83  0.52 kcal/mol.

However, a discrepancy between measured and theoretical values has been reported in airway resistance through ETTs. The causes of the discrepancy were estimated by physical and rheological simulations. METHODS The pressure losses through total lengths of ETTs and slip joints under a volumetric flow rate of 30 L/min were measured, and the pressure losses through the tubular parts of ETTs with internal diameters (IDs) of 6.0-, 6.5-, 7.0-, 7.5-, and 8.0 mm were measured. The Reynolds number of each setting was calculated, and the pressure losses through the total length of the ETT, the tubular part, and the slip joint of each size of tube were estimated. RESULTS The Reynolds numbers were >5000 in all sizes of ETTs. Measured pressure losses were larger in small sized ETTs than in large sized ETTs-520.9 Pascals (Pa) in 6.0-mm ID and 136.4 Pa in 8.0-mm ID tubes. The measured pressure losses through the tubular part were comparable to the predicted values. The measured pressure losses through the slip joints were larger than the predicted values, and they accounted for approximately 25-40% of total pressure losses of the ETTs. CONCLUSION Especially in small sized tubes, the pressure loss through the slip joint accounts for a large percentage of the total pressure loss through the ETT.

While both types can be exposed to the virus and contribute to its spread, the vulnerable people tend to be more cautious as being exposed to the virus can be fatal for them due to their conditions, e.g., advanced age or prior medical conditions. We assume that both types would like to participate in in-person social activities as freely as possible and they make this decision based on the total number of infected people in the society.

We introduced an innovative course to rapidly on-board a group of non-intensive care unit (ICU) nurse practitioners as they begin to practice working in a critical care setting. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a brief educational course could improve non-ICU practitioners knowledge and comfort in practicing in an intensive care setting. METHODS: We implemented a multi-strategy blended 12-week curriculum composed of bedside teaching, asynchronous online learning and simulation. The course content was a product of data collected from a targeted needs assessment. The cognitive learning objectives were taught through the online modules. Four simulation sessions were used to teach procedural skills. Bedside teaching simultaneously occurred from critical care faculty during daily rounds. We assessed learning through a pre and post knowledge multiple choice question (MCQ) test. Faculty assessed learners by direct observation and review of clinical documentation. We evaluated learner reaction and comfort in critical practice by comparing pre and post surveys. RESULTS: All 7 NPs were satisfied with the course and found the format to work well with their clinical schedules. The course also improved their self-reported comfort in managing critically ill patients in a medical ICU. There was an increase in the mean group score from the pre-to the post-course MCQ (60% vs 73%).

In this study, using rice stripe virus (RSV) and its insect vector (small brown planthopper, Laodelphax striatellus) as a model, we found that the Toll pathway was activated upon RSV infection. In comparison of viruliferous and non-viruliferous planthoppers, we found that four Toll pathway core genes (Toll, Tube, MyD88, and Dorsal) were upregulated in viruliferous planthoppers. When the planthoppers infected with RSV, the expressions of Toll and MyD88 were rapidly upregulated at the early stage (1 and 3 days post-infection), whereas Dorsal was upregulated at the late stage (9 days post-infection). Furthermore, induction of Toll pathway was initiated by interaction between a Toll receptor and RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP). Knockdown of Toll increased the proliferation of RSV in vector insect, and the dsToll-treated insects exhibited higher mortality than that of dsGFP-treated ones.

Because of this, the diagnosis of PCOS in adolescence is often unclear and few studies have compared adolescent and adult PCOS phenotype distribution and features. The aim is to compare phenotypes in adolescents and young adults with PCOS. METHODS: 109 girls aged from 13 to 19 years were retrospectively studied. All patients had a gynecological age > 2 years. 63 patients were adolescents (3-5 years beyond menarche) while 46 patients were young adults (6-9 years beyond menarche). Diagnosis of different PCOS phenotypes (A, B, C, D) was made according to the Rotterdam criteria. Clinical data (menstrual cycles, BMI, presence of hirsutism), androgen circulating levels (total testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate) and ovarian morphology by ultrasound were assessed. RESULTS: 109 patients presented PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria. Phenotype A was by far the most common phenotype (73.4%) followed by phenotype B (21.1%). Only few patients had phenotype C (4.6%) or phenotype D (0.9%). When patients were divided in two groups (adolescent and young adult patients), no significant difference in prevalence and features of the different phenotypes was observed. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of adolescent and young adult women with PCOS, the progression of age does not change the prevalence and the features of main PCOS phenotypes.

The ImageDataGenerator class is used to overcome the small dataset size and generate ten thousand augmented images. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art VGG16, AlexNet, and InceptionV3 models. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model outperforms other baseline models with high accuracy values: 97.68% for two classes, 89.85% for three classes, and 84.76% for four classes.

This approach has been successfully implemented across global centers as part of the Benchmark Program. Considering restricted hospital resources resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, a modified same day discharge (SDD) clinical pathway was implemented for selected TAVR patients at a single Benchmark site. Methods All patients accepted for TAVR were assessed for the SDD clinical pathway. Eligibility criteria included adequate social support and accessibility to the TAVR program post-discharge. Patients with preexisting conduction disease were excluded. The clinical pathway comprised of mobilization, bloodwork and electrocardiogram 4 hours post-TAVR and discharge 8 hours following groin hemostasis. Results From June to December 2020, 142 patients underwent TAVR at a single community Benchmark site. Of those, 29 highly selected patients were successfully discharged the same day using the SDD clinical pathway. There were no vascular access complications, permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, or mortality in the SDD group during index admission or at 30-day follow-up. When compared to a standard therapy group, there was no statistically significant difference in 30-day cardiovascular readmission. Conclusions This study demonstrates the safety and feasibility of same day discharge post-TAVR in a highly selected cohort of patients, with no observable difference in safety outcomes when compared to patients who were discharged according to standard institutional practice.Abbreviations: AS: aortic stenosis;ACT: Activated clotting time;AV: atrioventricular;AVB: atrioventricular block;BBB: bundle branch block;CAIC: Canadian Society for Cardiovascular Angiography;CCL: cardiac catheterization laboratory;CT: Computed topography;CV: cardiovascular;IQR: Interquartile Range;IVCD: intraventricular conduction delay;LBBB: left bundle branch block;LOS: length of stay;NDD: next day discharge;PPM: permanent pacemaker;RBBB: right bundle branch block;SCAI: Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention;SD: standard deviation;SDD: same day discharge;ST: standard therapy;STS PROM: society of thoracic surgeons predicted risk of mortality;TAVR: transcatheter aortic valve replacement;TF: transfemoral;THV: transcatheter heart valve;TTE: transthoracic echocardiogram;VARC: Valve Academic Research Consortium","output":"Same Day Discharge during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Highly Selected Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Video Description: This webinar will tackle the difficult but central issue of how to manage COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] patients in humanitarian responses and low-income settings We will discuss decision-making on which services to offer and dilemmas to consider, and hear from a real-life scenario treating patients in Sudan The duration of this video is 59 minutes and 2 seconds COVID-19 (Disease);Humanitarianism;Poor;Public health","output":"COVID-19 Case Management in Humanitarian and Low-Income Settings: Dilemmas and Decisions [video]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, an electrochemical approach for the determination of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was developed.

Early and accurate identification of high-risk patients in the course of the current COVID-19 pandemic is vital for planning and making proper use of available resources. The purpose of this study was to identify the key variables that account for worse outcomes to create a predictive model that could be used effectively for triage. Through literature review, 44 variables that could be linked to an unfavorable course of COVID-19 disease were obtained, including clinical, laboratory, and X-ray variables. These were used for a 2-round modified Delphi processing with 14 experts to select a final list of variables with the greatest predictive power for the construction of a scoring system, leading to the creation of a new scoring system: the COVID-19 Severity Index.

ID e-consults (ID electronic consultations or asynchronous?) are an alternative but data are limited on their effectiveness, especially patient outcomes. METHODS: In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and ID physician outage, we were asked to perform ID e-consults at a 380-bed tertiary care hospital located in Blair County, PA. We performed retrospective chart reviews of 121 patients initially evaluated by ID e-consults between April 2020 and July 2020. Follow-up visits were also conducted via e-consults with or without direct phone calls with the patient. Key patient outcomes assessed were length of stay (LOS), disposition after hospitalization, 30-day mortality from initial ID e-consult and 30-day readmission post-discharge. RESULTS: The majority of patients were white males and non-ICU (Table 1). The most common ID diagnosis was bacteremia (27.3%, 33/121), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (15.7%, 19/121) and bone/joint infections (14.9%, 18/121) (Figure 1). Table 2 shows patient outcomes. Average total LOS was 11 days and 7 days post-initial ID e-consult. 48.7% (59/121) of patients were discharged home and 37.2% (45/121) to a post-acute rehabilitation facility. 2.5% (3/121) of patients required transfer to a higher level of care facility; none of which were to obtain in-person ID care. The index mortality rate was 3.3% (4/121), which appears to be lower than published data for in-person ID care. The 30-day mortality rate was 4.1% (5/121), which is also comparable to previously reported for ID e-consults. 25.6% (31/121) of patients required readmission within 30 days but only 14.0% (17/121) were related to the initial infection.

METHODS: A web-based national survey was developed by the Working Group Young Rheumatology of the German Society for Rheumatology and the German League against Rheumatism. The prospective survey was distributed via social media (Twitter, Instagram and Facebook), QR code and email. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and regression analyses were performed to show correlations. RESULTS: We analysed the responses of 299 patients and 129 rheumatologists. Most patients (74%) and rheumatologists (76%) believed that DHAs are useful in the management of rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) and felt confident in their own usage thereof (90%; 86%). 38% of patients and 71% of rheumatologists reported that their attitude had changed positively towards DHAs and that their usage had increased due to COVID-19 (29%; 48%). The majority in both groups agreed on implementing virtual visits for follow-up appointments in stable disease conditions. The most reported advantages of DHAs were usage independent of time and place (76.6%; 77.5%). The main barriers were a lack of information on suitable, available DHAs (58.5%; 41.9%), poor usability (42.1% of patients) and a lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHAs (23.2% of rheumatologists). Only a minority (<10% in both groups) believed that digitalisation has a negative impact on the patientCdoctor relationship. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic instigated an increase in patients and rheumatologists acceptance and usage of DHAs, possibly introducing a permanent paradigm shift in the management of RMDs.","output":"Digital rheumatology in the era of COVID-19: results of a national patient and physician survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 49-year-old man was referred to orthopaedics with an acute onset of left forearm and hand swelling, widespread blisters and erythema after lying face down on the floor for an unknown period of time.

Although the virus is a ubiquitous problem, world leaders have varied appreciably in their responses resulting in substantially different outcomes in terms of virus mitigation, population health, and economic stability. One explanation for this inconsistency is that leaders have taken differential approaches to making sense of the crisis that, in turn, have driven their approaches to decision making and communication. The present article elaborates on the role of leaders as sensemakers and explains how a leader's sensemaking approach is a critical element in successful crisis management efforts. Through the charismatic, ideological, pragmatic (CIP) leadership model, a sensemaking-focused theory of leadership, it is explained how specific, relatively stable sensemaking approaches manifest and what actions leaders engaged in those styles are likely to take in times of crisis. These connections are then reinforced through case examples of 3 world leaders, framed through CIP, and demonstrate how their sensemaking approach has influenced their response to COVID-19. The article concludes with a discussion of the impacts that these differential approaches to COVID-19 may have on the global community, and recommendations for more explicit incorporation of sensemaking into our understanding of leadership.

Using the SG2 primer pair, designed by Sigma-Aldrich, we were able to detect the equivalent of 1.7106 viral copies per mL of saliva after heat inactivation; approximately equivalent to the median viral load in symptomatic patients. This would make our assay potentially useful for rapid detection of high-shedding infected individuals. We also provide a comparison of the PCR efficiency and specificity, which varied considerably, across 9 reported primer pairs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Primer pairs SG2 and CCDC-N showed highest specificity and PCR efficiency. Finally, we provide an alternate primer pair to use as a positive control for human RNA detection in SARS-CoV-2 assays, as we found that the widely used US CDC primers (targeting human RPP30) do not span an exon-exon junction and therefore does not provide an adequate control for the reverse transcription reaction.","output":"SYBR green one-step qRT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MOTIVATION: In the age of big data, the amount of scientific information available online dwarfs the ability of current tools to support researchers in locating and securing access to the necessary materials. Well-structured open data and the smart systems that make the appropriate use of it are invaluable and can help health researchers and professionals to find the appropriate information by, e.g., configuring the monitoring of information or refining a specific query on a disease. METHODS: We present an automated text classifier approach based on the MEDLINE/MeSH thesaurus, trained on the manual annotation of more than 26 million expert-annotated scientific abstracts. The classifier was developed tailor-fit to the public health and health research domain experts, in the light of their specific challenges and needs. We have applied the proposed methodology on three specific health domains: the Coronavirus, Mental Health and Diabetes, considering the pertinence of the first, and the known relations with the other two health topics.

Like corporations, universities, and other businesses forced to respond to the dual epidemics of COVID-19 and racist violence, the music profession devised antiracist policies and engaged in critical dialogues about whiteness and Eurocentrism in music pedagogy, curriculum, and performance. These emergent responses to the ongoing crisis of systemic racism are well intended, but by focusing exclusively on macro-level policies and failing to address the everyday racism and race-related trauma that students and teachers of color experience at the micro level, they fall well short of the racial reckoning that music education needs.

Sections include: (1) Mental and Physical Consequences of Racism;(2) Healing Our Hidden Wounds;and (3) The Cost of Racism. Yi concludes that to commit themselves to antiracism, teachers must reinvent music spaces with a racial equity lens. They will begin to see progress toward music diversity when they acknowledge the relationships among psychological, cultural, and aesthetic environments. Educators must begin with a critical assessment of their own positionality as they seek to implement pedagogy that empowers students to become agents of change and, in that process, to heal from race-related trauma.

Methods: We analyzed 1,018 PET/CT studies performed between January 1, 2021, and February 15, 2021. Information about the dates and sites of vaccination was collected. Visual and semiquantitative analysis of axillaryCneck lymphadenopathy and arm uptake was correlated with immunization data. Results: Increased uptake in axillary lymphadenopathy was observed unilaterally in 66% of vaccinated patients, in 55% of patients vaccinated once, and in 69% of those vaccinated twice. The intensity of uptake decreased over time. Fifty-four of 274 patients (20%) had simultaneous increased activity in the posterior arm and ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy (double sign [DS]).

Because ICU healthcare workers are exposed to aerosol-generating procedures, ensuring optimal personal protective equipment (PPE) preparedness is important. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate PPE preparedness across ICUs in six Asia-Pacific countries during the initial phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which is defined by the World Health Organization as guideline adherence, training healthcare workers, procuring stocks, and responding appropriately to suspected cases. METHODS: A cross-sectional Web-based survey was circulated to 633 level II/III ICUs of Australia, New Zealand (NZ), Singapore, Hong Kong (HK), India, and the Philippines. FINDINGS: Two hundred sixty-three intensivists responded, representing 231 individual ICUs eligible for analysis. Response rates were 68-100% in all countries except India, where it was 24%. Ninety-seven percent of ICUs either conformed to or exceeded World Health Organization recommendations for PPE practice. Fifty-nine percent ICUs used airborne precautions irrespective of aerosol generation procedures. There were variations in negative-pressure room use (highest in HK/Singapore), training (best in NZ), and PPE stock awareness (best in HK/Singapore/NZ). High-flow nasal oxygenation and noninvasive ventilation were not options in most HK (66.7% and 83.3%, respectively) and Singapore ICUs (50% and 80%, respectively), but were considered in other countries to a greater extent. Thirty-eight percent ICUs reported not having specialised airway teams. Showering and \\"buddy systems\\" were underused. Clinical waste disposal training was suboptimal (38%). CONCLUSIONS: Many ICUs in the Asia-Pacific reported suboptimal PPE preparedness in several domains, particularly related to PPE training, practice, and stock awareness, which requires remediation. Adoption of low-cost approaches such as buddy systems should be encouraged. The complete avoidance of high-flow nasal oxygenation reported by several intensivists needs reconsideration.

The OR of non-improvement/improvement in 6MWT was 0.30 (p-value = 0.13) between COVID-19 and controls; however, the odds of non-improvement in CRQ tended to be 3.02 times higher (p-value = 0.075) in COVID-19 patients. Severe and critical COVID-19 patients had similar rehabilitation outcomes. Conclusions: Inpatient PR can effectively improve physical functions and life quality in COVID-19 patients, irrespective of disease severity. Whether the relatively low gains in CRQ is an indicator of chronic disease development in COVID-19 patients needs further studies.","output":"Effectiveness of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Severe and Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients: A Controlled Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To describe the delivery of care for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) from the perspective of rheumatologists in the Netherlands during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed methods design was used with quantitative and qualitative data from a cross-sectional survey sent to all members of the Dutch Rheumatology Society in May 2020. The survey contained questions on demographics, the current way of care delivery, and also on usage, acceptance, facilitators and barriers of telemedicine. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively. The answers to the open questions were categorized into themes. Seventy-five respondents completed the survey. During the COVID-19 pandemic, continuity of care was guaranteed through telephone and video consultations by 99% and 9% of the respondents, respectively. More than 80% of the total number of outpatient visits were performed exclusively via telephone with in-person visits only on indication. One-quarter of the respondents used patient reported outcomes to guide telephone consultations. The top three facilitators for telemedicine were less travel time for patients, ease of use of the system and shorter waiting period for patients. The top three barriers were impossibility to perform physical examination, difficulty estimating how the patient is doing and difficulty in reaching patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, care for patients with RMDs in the Netherlands continued uninterrupted by the aid of telemedicine. On average, respondents were content with current solutions, although some felt insecure mainly because of the inability to perform physical examination and missing nonverbal communication with their patients.

METHODS This prospective investigation was conducted in individuals with morbid obesity who had undergone LGP from 2000 to 2016. Patients with weight loss failure, weight regain, and regain-prone cases were indicated for reoperation. Re-plication, laparoscopic one anastomosis gastric bypass (LOAGB), and modified jejunoileal bypass were done as revisional surgery. RESULTS Revisional surgery was performed in 102 of 124 patients who needed reoperation. Overall, 39 re-plication, 38 LOAGB, and 25 malabsorptive procedures were performed. Re-plication was the shortest surgery and had the shortest length of hospital stay. The percentage of TWL at 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up was 20.5%, 25%, and 26.8% for re-plication; 20.2%, 27%, and 30.5% for LOAGB; and 22.9%, 28.9%, and 32.6% for the malabsorptive procedure, respectively. In addition, the percentage of EWL at 6, 12, and 24 months of follow-up was 62%, 74.6%, and 79.6% for re-plication; 51.6%, 68.2%, and 75.9% for LOAGB; and 55.4%, 70.1%, and 79.1% for malabsorptive procedure, respectively. In long-term follow-up, according to %TWL, LOAGB and malabsorptive procedure had better outcome compared to re-plication, whereas there was no statistically significant difference in %EWL among the three surgical approaches. CONCLUSIONS In terms of weight loss, reoperation on failed LGP was completely successful and no treatment failure was reported. All three revisional procedures, including re-plication, LOAGB, and malabsorptive procedure showed promising results and provided substantial weight loss. Since there is little information about the long-term efficacy and safety of revisional surgery on failed LGP, we highly recommend further investigations to confirm our results.","output":"Outcomes of Reoperation After Laparoscopic Gastric Plication Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferon gamma (IFN-?3) is a crucial cytokine in host immune response to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

The pandemic has shown that there is still a delay in the early response to disease outbreaks and needs a method for unknown disease outbreak detection. The study's objective is to establish a new medical knowledge representation and reasoning model, and use the model to explore the feasibility of unknown disease outbreak detection. Methods: The study defined abnormal values with diagnostic significances from clinical data as the Features, and defined the Features as the antecedents of inference rules to match with knowledge bases, achieved in detecting known or emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Meanwhile, the study built a syndromic surveillance base to capture the target cases' Features to improve the reliability and fault-tolerant ability of the system. Results: The study combined the method with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and early COVID-19 outbreaks as empirical studies. The results showed that with suitable surveillance guidelines, the method proposed in this study was capable to detect outbreaks of SARS, MERS, and early COVID-19 pandemics. The quick matching accuracies of confirmed infection cases were 89.1, 26.3C98%, and 82%, and the syndromic surveillance base would capture the Features of the remaining cases to ensure the overall detection accuracies. Based on the early COVID-19 data in Wuhan, this study estimated that the median time of the early COVID-19 cases from illness onset to local authorities' responses could be reduced to 7.0C10.0 days. Conclusions: This study offers a new solution to transfer traditional medical knowledge into structured data and form diagnosis rules, enables the representation of doctors' logistic thinking and the knowledge transmission among different users. The results of empirical studies demonstrate that by constantly inputting medical knowledge into the system, the proposed method will be capable to detect unknown diseases from existing ones and perform an early response to the initial outbreaks.","output":"Unknown Disease Outbreaks Detection: A Pilot Study on Feature-Based Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/AIM Lately, studies have reported contradicting results on the cytokine storm seen in critically-ill COVID-19 patients. Depending on the control group used, cytokines have been found to be higher, similar or even lower in COVID-19 compared to critical illnesses associated with elevated cytokine concentrations. However, most of these studies do not take into account critical illness severity. Hence, we decided to compare cytokine levels in critically-ill COVID-19 patients and critically-ill patients of a general intensive care unit (ICU), who did not have sepsis or septic shock, but had an equal disease severity. PATIENTS AND METHODS Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor- (TNF-) were measured on ICU admission in mechanically ventilated, COVID-19 (N=36) and non-COVID-19 (N=30) patients, who had not received dexamethasone, and had equal critical illness severity. Non-COVID-19 patients did not have sepsis or septic shock. RESULTS In our case control study, circulating IL-6 and IL-10 were lower, while TNF- and IL-8 levels were higher in critically-ill COVID-19 patients, compared to critically-ill non-COVID-19 patients.

The academic literature indicates that climatic features, specifically the temperature and absolute humidity, are very important factors affecting infectious pulmonary disease epidemics (e.g., SARS, MERS);however, the influence of climatic parameters on COVID-19 remains extremely controversial. The goal of this study is to quantify the existing relationship between several daily climate parameters (temperature, relative humidity, accumulated precipitation, solar radiation, wind direction and intensity, and evaporation), local morphological parameters, and new daily positive swabs for COVID-19, which represents the only parameter that can be statistically used to quantify the pandemic. The daily deaths parameter was not considered because it is not reliable due to frequent administrative errors. Daily data on meteorological conditions and new cases of COVID-19 were collected for the Lombardy area from March 1, 2020, to April 20, 2020. This region in Italy exhibited the largest number of official deaths in the world per million inhabitants, with a value of approximately 1700 per million on june 30, 2020. Moreover, the apparent lethality was approximately 17% in this area, mainly due to the considerable housing density and the extensive presence of industrial and craft areas. The Mann-Kendall test and multivariate statistical analysis showed that none of the considered climatic variables exhibited statistically significant relationships with the epidemiological evolution of COVID-19, at least in the spring months in temperate subcontinental climate areas, with the exception of solar radiation, which was directly related and showed an otherwise low explained variability of approximately 20%. Furthermore, the average temperatures of two highly representative meteorological stations of Molise and Lucania, the most weakly affected by the pandemic.

An age-stratified agent-based model was developed to explore the impact of shutdowns to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada under the assumption that current efforts to control the epidemic remains insufficient and in the absence of a vaccine. Methods: We estimated the current levels of interventions in Canada to generate a baseline scenario from 7 February to 7 September 2020. Four aspects of shutdowns were explored in scenarios that ran from 8 September 2020 to 7 January 2022, these included the impact of how quickly shutdowns are implemented, the duration of shutdowns, the minimum break (delays) between shutdowns and the types of sectors to shutdown. Comparisons among scenarios were made using cases, hospitalizations, deaths and shutdown days during the 700-day model runs. Results: We found a negative relationship between reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the number of shutdown days. However, we also found that for shutdowns to be optimally effective, they need to be implemented fast with minimal delay, initiated when community transmission is low, sustained for an adequate period and be stringent and target multiple sectors, particularly those driving transmission. By applying shutdowns in this manner, the total number of shutdown days could be reduced compared to delaying the shutdowns until further into the epidemic when transmission is higher and/or implementing short insufficient shutdowns that would require frequent re-implementation. This paper contrasts a range of shutdown strategies and trade-offs between health outcomes and economic metrics that need to be considered within the local context. Interpretation: Given the immense socioeconomic impact of shutdowns, they should be avoided where possible and used only when other public health measures are insufficient to control the epidemic. If used, the time it buys to delay the epidemic should be used to enhance other equally effective, but less disruptive, public health measures.","output":"Modelling the impact of shutdowns on resurging SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to understand the functional impact of vestibular dysfunction on balance control in children with hearing loss. The vestibular system is an important contributor to maintaining balance. In adults, vestibular dysfunction is known to lead to unsteadiness and falls. Considerably less is known about the effects of vestibular dysfunction in children with hearing loss.

RESULTS A total of 20 articles were included in this systematic review, of which, 17 reported an association between vestibular dysfunction and balance abnormalities in children with hearing loss. Bias (as measured by the Downs and Black Checklist) was a concern, as most studies were nonblinded cohort studies or case series selected through convenience sampling. CONCLUSIONS Research to date has predominantly found that children with concomitant hearing loss and vestibular impairment tend to perform more poorly on balance measures than either children with hearing loss and normal vestibular function or children with both normal-hearing and normal vestibular function.

METHODS: Patients with a sporadic vestibular schwannoma and started on observational surveillance management between January 2005 and December 2010 were included. Demographic data, tumor size, hearing and vestibular changes, and follow-up length were recorded. Patient factors were analyzed for association with being lost to follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 122 patients were included with a median length of follow-up of 5 months (range, 0-146). After initial surveillance, 22.1% (n = 27) of patients had a change in management to either microsurgery or radiosurgery. Of the remaining 77.9% (n = 95), nearly half (44.2%, n = 42) never returned for a second visit, and all but 3 were eventually lost to follow-up.

People with moderate to severe dementia are at very high risk of becoming infected as the disease mainly impacts on older people with other health problems and once infected the person with dementia is more likely to become seriously ill than other people. To prevent infection, people are required to wear masks and isolate from contact with others. It is believed that these measures can reduce the quality of life and general well-being of people with moderate to severe dementia in hospital or social care. This belief has not yet been demonstrated by research. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADD TO THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: We show that people with moderate to severe dementia receiving care on mental health hospital wards and subject to strict infection prevention measures can still achieve high levels of well-being. We show that mental health nurses alter the focus of their care to deliberately overcome the challenges and particularly the restrictions on visiting by families. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: We believe that the changes in practice we observed can occur in other healthcare and social care settings and that whilst restrictions remain in place care staff can protect and possibly enhance well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia. ABSTRACT: Introduction The effect of coronavirus (COVID-19) on people living with dementia is potentially severe in its clinical impacts. More widely, for this vulnerable group, the social restrictions to limit the spread of infection may be emotionally and psychologically damaging. Aim To explore the impact of restrictions on well-being for people with moderate to severe dementia in acute mental health hospital care. Method \\"Dementia Care Mapping\\" was the observational tool used to determine well- or ill-being. Observations were undertaken in two mental health hospital wards during a time of restrictions and the use of personal protective equipment. Results We report levels of well-being that are higher than might be expected alongside a change in the focus of psychological care delivered through mental health nursing interventions aimed at enhancing well-being. Discussion-We postulate that mental health nurses faced with an unprecedented challenge respond by changing practice to mitigate for infection prevention measures and to compensate for family absence. Implications for practice We suggest that the desirable enhancing actions by nursing staff which raise well-being in these hospital settings are readily transferable to other settings that are aiming to maintain well-being but also practising under COVID-19 restrictions.","output":"Dementia care from behind the mask?

The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the relationships between 24-hour movement behaviours and health indicators in school-aged children from Arab-speaking countries.

A total of 16 studies, comprising 15,346 participants from nine countries were included. These studies were conducted between 2000 and 2019. In general, low levels of PA and sleep and high SB were unfavourably associated with adiposity outcomes, behavioural problems, depression and low self-esteem. Favourable associations were reported between sleep duration and adiposity outcomes. SB was favourably associated with adiposity outcomes, withdrawn behaviour, attention and externalizing problems. PA was favourably associated with improved self-esteem and adiposity outcomes.

Smartphone based video calling using whatsapp messenger has been proposed as a feasible Telemedicine application to provide outpatient services in this scenario. A pilot run of outpatient services during lockdown period through whatsapp facilitated video calling at Ayurveda Gathiya Clinic, State Ayurvedic College and Hospital, Lucknow has shown a way forward of running such services with a mass appeal, ease of operation and high interface gratification among users and service providers. Within its limitations related to the quality and quantity of information sought, this comes as a viable method of patient -physician interfacing during the phase of lockdown.","output":"On the brighter side of COVID-19 induced Lockdown: Devising the collateral methods to provide Ayurveda consultation during impasse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Changeux et al. (Changeux et al. C. R. Biol. 343:33-39.) recently suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and that such interactions may be involved in pathology and infectivity. This hypothesis is based on the fact that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein contains a sequence motif similar to known nAChR antagonists. Here, we use molecular simulations of validated atomically detailed structures of nAChRs and of the spike to investigate the possible binding of the Y674-R685 region of the spike to nAChRs. We examine the binding of the Y674-R685 loop to three nAChRs, namely the human &#945;4?2 and &#945;7 subtypes and the muscle-like &#945;??3? receptor from Tetronarce californica. Our results predict that Y674-R685 has affinity for nAChRs. The region of the spike responsible for binding contains a PRRA motif, a four-residue insertion not found in other SARS-like coronaviruses. The conformational behavior of the bound Y674-R685 is highly dependent on the receptor subtype; it adopts extended conformations in the &#945;4?2 and &#945;7 complexes but is more compact when bound to the muscle-like receptor. In the &#945;4?2 and &#945;??3? complexes, the interaction of Y674-R685 with the receptors forces the loop C region to adopt an open conformation, similar to other known nAChR antagonists. In contrast, in the &#945;7 complex, Y674-R685 penetrates deeply into the binding pocket in which it forms interactions with the residues lining the aromatic box, namely with TrpB, TyrC1, and TyrC2. Estimates of binding energy suggest that Y674-R685 forms stable complexes with all three nAChR subtypes. Analyses of simulations of the glycosylated spike show that the Y674-R685 region is accessible for binding. We suggest a potential binding orientation of the spike protein with nAChRs, in which they are in a nonparallel arrangement to one another.","output":"A potential interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) recipients are at an increased risk of poor outcomes from COVID-19. While the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer) COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are highly immunogenic in the general population, the immune response in SCT recipients is poorly understood. We characterized the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in a cohort of SCT patients. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 16 allogeneic SCT patients and 23 healthy controls. Blood samples for both cohorts were collected prior to first vaccination (baseline), at the time of second vaccination, and approximately 28 days post-second vaccination. Anti-Spike (S), anti-S1, anti-receptor binding domain (RBD), and anti-Nucleocapsid (N) IgG levels were measured quantitatively from plasma using a multiplexed single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay. Reactogenicity was captured for the SCT cohort via a self-reported post-vaccination diary for 7 days after each dose. RESULTS: Demographics and SCT recipients characteristics are shown in Table 1. In the SCT cohort, we observed a significantly lower anti-S (p< 0.0001), S1 (p< 0.0001), and RBD (p< 0.0001) IgG responses as compared to healthy controls, both at the time of dose 2 and 28 days post-vaccine series (Fig 1). Overall, 62.5% of SCT recipients were responders after vaccine series completion, as compared to 100% of healthy controls (Fig 2). While no patients had a reported history of COVID-19 diagnosis, 2 patients in the SCT cohort had elevated anti-S IgG levels and 1 showed elevated anti-N at baseline. 10/16 participants in the SCT cohort completed at least one post-vaccination diary. Local and systemic reactions were reported by 67% and 22% of participants, respectively, after dose 1, and 63% and 50% after dose 2 (Figure 3). All reported events were mild. Table 1: Demographics [Image: see text] Figure 1: Plasma IgG Titers [Image: see text] Anti-Spike (A), anti-S1 (B), anti-RBD (C), and anti-nucleocapsid (D) IgG titers were measured at baseline, time of second dose, and approximately 28 days after second vaccination. IgG levels were measured quantitatively using multiplexed single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassays, and are reported as Normalized Average Enzymes per Bead (AEB). Allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients (mauve) showed significantly lower anti-S, S1, and RBD IgG responses as compared to healthy controls (mint). Low titers of anti-N IgG demonstrates no history of COVID-19 natural infection during the course of the study. Figure 3. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events [Image: see text] 10 allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients completed at least one diary for 7 days after vaccination. Reactions after dose 1 are shown in light blue, and reactions after dose 2 are shown in dark blue. Local reactions (A) were reported by 67% (6/9) of participants after dose 1, and 63% (5/8) after dose 2. Systemic reactions (B) were reported by 22% (2/9) of participants after dose 1, and 50% (4/8) after dose 2. All reported events were mild (Grade 1). CONCLUSION: Among SCT recipients, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were well-tolerated but less immunogenic than in healthy controls. Further study is warranted to better understand heterogeneous characteristics that may affect the immune response in order to optimize COVID-19 vaccination strategies for SCT recipients.

CONCLUSIONS: Although not considered a mental illness, moral injury is an important condition for psychiatrists to have an awareness of, as it is associated with psychological distress and/or impairments in emotional, social or behavioural functioning. Potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) for community psychiatrists may include staff shortages and deficient resources rendering it difficult to provide an acceptable standard of professional care; time constraints negatively impacting teaching, supervising and mentoring medical students; cost-prohibition regarding preferred medication choices; lack of gender and cultural diversity of available psychiatrists; and work environments not conducive to psychiatrists speaking out about their concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated PMIEs for some community psychiatrists. Whether or not a PMIE transitions to a moral injury may be influenced by the individual's resilience and the quality of emotional, psychological and administrative support they receive before, during and after the potentially precipitating event. Preventative strategies to mitigate susceptibility to a moral injury may be implemented at both a systems level and individual level, and include collective healthcare advocacy action.","output":"Moral injury and psychiatrists in public community mental health services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccinations may be one of the solutions to end the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS: Bal Umang Drishya Sanstha (BUDS) is a non-profit organisation providing child health and welfare services to marginalised urban slum communities in New Delhi, India. As part of formative evaluation of BUDSs COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts, the team conducted a rapid survey of 60 children (10C17 years) and 62 young adults (18C25 years) who were beneficiaries of the relief programme. The team also undertook semi-structured interviews with nine young women attending BUDSs second-chance education programme. RESULTS: Almost all respondents had some understanding of COVID-19 (54 children (90%) and 53 young adults (85%)) and the reasons for public health measures (59 children (98%) and 56 young adults (90%)). Over 80% of girls and 60% of boys experienced financial strains and food shortages. Gender discrepancies were particularly evident in areas of family stress, with girls and young women disproportionately experiencing distress and family violence. Girls were more likely to be fearful of contracting the disease, while boys were more concerned about getting back to school. In-depth interviews with young women revealed that government ration schemes were insufficient to support vulnerable families; there were interesting cultural understandings of and responses to the pandemic. Young women reported high rates of anxiety and distress.

To achieve this, eleven fecal samples from dairy cows with winter dysentery, three from calves, and two from horses, all from Brazil, were analysed. It could be concluded that the enteric BCoV genealogy from newborn and adult cattle is directly associated with geographic distribution patterns, when S and HE genes are taken into account. A less-resolved genealogy exists for the HE and N genes in cattle, with a trend for an age-related segregation pattern.

It was designated SARS-CoV-2 because of its genetic similarities to the 2003 SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Now that SARS-CoV-2 has spread worldwide, there is a risk of it establishing new animal reservoirs and recombination with native circulating coronaviruses. To screen local animal populations in the United States for exposure to SARS-like coronaviruses, we developed a serological assay using the receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2s RBD is antigenically distinct from common human and animal coronaviruses allowing us to identify animals previously infected with SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Using an indirect ELISA for SARS-CoV-2s RBD, we screened serum from wild and domestic animals for the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2s RBD. Surprisingly pre-pandemic feline serum samples submitted to the University of Tennessee Veterinary Hospital were 50% positive for anti-SARS RBD antibodies. Some of these samples were serologically negative for feline coronavirus (FCoV), raising the question of the etiological agent generating anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD cross-reactivity. We also identified several white-tailed deer from South Carolina with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. These results are intriguing as cross-reactive antibodies towards SARS-CoV-2 RBD have not been reported to date. The etiological agent responsible for seropositivity was not readily apparent, but finding seropositive cats prior to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights our lack of information about circulating coronaviruses in other species. Importance We report cross-reactive antibodies from pre-pandemic cats and post-pandemic South Carolina white-tailed deer that are specific for that SARS-CoV RBD. There are several potential explanations for this cross-reactivity, each with important implications to coronavirus disease surveillance. Perhaps the most intriguing possibility is the existence and transmission of an etiological agent (such as another coronavirus) with similarity to SARS-CoV-2s RBD region. However, we lack conclusive evidence of pre-pandemic transmission of a SARS-like virus. Our findings provide impetus for the adoption of a One Health Initiative focusing on infectious disease surveillance of multiple animal species to predict the next zoonotic transmission to humans and future pandemics.","output":"Possible Cross Reactivity of Feline and White-tailed Deer Antibodies Against the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans.

Patients with COVID-19 who presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) shared distinct characteristics. For example, the patients were older, and had higher levels of inflammatory indicators [i.e., levels of CRP, SAA, procalcitonin (PCT), and interleukin-6; CRP-to-PCT ratio; SAA-to-CRP ratio; and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)], higher inflammatory cell counts (i.e., white blood cell count and neutrophil count), and lower lymphocyte counts compared with patients without ARDS. Patients without ARDS still exhibited mild illness and had elevated SAA levels but not CRP levels. In patients with elevated SAA and CRP levels, the NLR was statistically associated with disease severity. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the combined predictive probability of CRP and SAA levels, along with white blood cell count, showed the highest area under the curve (AUC; 0.878), and was able to distinguish between patients with and without ARDS. The cut-off level for SAA to predict the severity of COVID-19 was 92.900, with a sensitivity of 95.8%, a specificity of 53.7%, and an AUC of 0.712. For patients with elevated levels of SAA but not CRP, a mild condition was predicted.

Here, we report on one of the largest multicenter epidemiological studies to explore the clinical features and prevalence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary mold infections (CAPMIs) among mechanically ventilated patients. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum samples were collected for culture, galactomannan (GM), and -D-glucan (BDG) testing. Patients were classified as probable CAPMI based on the presence of host factors, radiological findings, and mycological criteria. Results: During the study period, 302 COVID-19 patients were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), among whom 105 were mechanically ventilated for 4 days. Probable CAPMI was observed among 38% of patients (40/105), among whom BAL culture of 29 patients turned positive for molds, while galactomannan testing on BAL (GM index 1) and serum (GM index >0.5) samples were positive for 60% (24/40) and 37.5% (15/39) of patients, respectively.

METHOD: This cross-sectional study was carried out on 526 patients with documented telogen effluvium that recovered from COVID-19. Demographic data, concurrent alopecia, associated diseases, and COVID-19 severity were recorded. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical methods. RESULTS: The mean age of the 526 patients (410 females, 116 males) was 30.97  9.592 years, with 7.65  1.739 weeks of mean time of alopecia onset.

The majority of gene expression studies of IBD are generated from heterogeneous biopsies, providing no distinction between immune cells, the epithelium and other mucosal cells. By using laser capture microdissection (LCM) coupled with RNA sequencing, we aimed to characterize the expressional changes of the isolated colonic epithelial monolayer from ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohns disease (CD) patients compared to healthy controls (HC). The analysis identified 3706 genes as differentially expressed between active IBD epithelium and HC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to stratify genes into modules, which were subsequently characterized using enrichment analysis. Our data show a distinct upregulation of the antigen presentation machinery during inflammation, including major histocompatibility complex class II molecules (e.g. HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1, HLA-DRA) and key transcription factors/activators (STAT1, IRF1, CIITA). We also see an epithelial downregulation of retinoic acid-responsive nuclear receptors (RARA, RARB, RXRA), but upregulation of retinoid-metabolizing enzymes (RDH11, ALDH1A2, ALDH1A3), which together suggest a perturbation of epithelial vitamin A signaling during active IBD. Lastly, we identified a cluster of stress-related genes, including activator protein 1 components JUNB and ATF3, as significantly upregulated in active UC but not in CD, revealing an interesting aspect of IBD heterogeneity. The results represent a unique resource for enhanced understanding of epithelial involvement in IBD inflammation and is a valuable tool for further studies on these processes.","output":"Profound gene expression changes in the epithelial monolayer of active ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer in Asia, including Korea, has rapidly increased. Each country has shown different clinical features. This study presents a comprehensive understanding of breast cancer in different age groups in Korea and determines potential measures for improving patient survival. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer stages I to III with available clinicopathologic and follow-up data were included in the study. KaplanCMeier survival graphs were generated for each group and compared using log-rank test. The hazard ratio for each risk factor was calculated using the Cox regression model and the 95% confidence interval. RESULTS: The final cohort included 833 patients with a mean age of 51.311.3 years (range, 22C89 years), and 191 (22.9%) of them were aged >60 years. Patients aged 60 years had worse overall survival (OS) and distant disease-free survival than those aged <60 years. Although no difference was observed in the tumor biology, elderly patients showed significant differences in practice patterns: they tended to undergo mastectomy (40.2% vs 62.8%, P<0.001), did not receive the standard chemotherapy (88.4% vs 69.3%, P < 0.001), and had a higher risk of developing second primary cancer or diseases other than breast cancer (1.2% vs 6.8%, P < 0.001), which significantly correlated with poor survival in elderly patients. CONCLUSION: Less-than-the-standard treatment of care or development of a second primary disease resulted in poor prognosis in elderly patients in Korea.

The aim of this study is to critically review the literature to investigate whether NIV reduces mortality, intubation rate, length of stay and complications in patients with chest trauma, compared to standard therapy. METHODS We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective observational studies, by searching PubMed, EMBASE and bibliographies of articles retrieved. We screened for relevance studies that enrolled adults with chest trauma who developed mild to severe acute respiratory failure and were treated with NIV. We included studies reporting at least one clinical outcome of interest to perform a meta-analysis. RESULTS Ten studies (368 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included for the meta-analysis. Five studies (219 patients) reported mortality and results were quite homogeneous across studies, with a summary relative risk for patients treated with NIV compared with standard care (oxygen therapy and invasive mechanical ventilation) of 0.26 (95 % confidence interval 0.09-0.71, p = 0.003). There was no advantage in mortality of continuous positive airway pressure over noninvasive pressure support ventilation. NIV significantly increased arterial oxygenation and was associated with a significant reduction in intubation rate, in the incidence of overall complications and infections.

Oncologic outcomes are often tied to tumour grade; however, grade is only a factor in the aggressiveness of a tumor. Extracompartmental extension, or tumor stage, has been found to be predictive of a poor outcome in other flat bone chondrosarcomas; however, this relationship has not been identified in the scapula. The purpose of the current study was to analyze the impact of tumour stage on the outcome of patients with scapular chondrosarcoma. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (26 males:13 females) with a mean age of 46  17 undergoing surgical resection of a scapular chondrosarcomas were reviewed. Most patients had grade 1 (n = 24) tumors, with 26 (67%) having extracompartmental extension. The mean follow-up was eight years. RESULTS: The ten year disease-specific survival was 77%. High-grade tumours (HR 18.15, p < 0.01) were associated with death due to disease. The ten year local recurrence- and metastatic-free survival were 77% and 74%. Positive surgical margins (HR 8.85, p < 0.01) were associated with local recurrence, and local recurrence was associated with metastatic disease (HR3.37, p = 0.04). All disease recurrences and death due to disease occurred in patients with extracompartmental extension (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Extracompartmental extension was associated with a worse oncologic outcome in patients with scapular chondrosarcomas. Positive margins were associated with local recurrence, which was associated with metastatic disease; wide local excision with negative margins should be a goal for all patients, regardless of tumour grade.","output":"Impact of tumour stage on the surgical outcomes of scapular chondrosarcoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Establishing anatomical coordinate systems (CS) from anatomical landmarks is sensitive to landmark selection. Vastly different results can be obtained amongst observers which can greatly affect the resulting joint kinematics. The aim of this study is to introduce an objective method for calculating functional CS definitions for bones in joints that observe three-cylindrical-joint kinematic chain decomposition methods and to apply the method on tibiofemoral joint specimens. This method is driven by low resistance joint motion during loading profiles and not from anatomical landmark selection. Two anatomical CS definitions were established from points collected by five observers, for twelve knees. The knees underwent passive flexion and internal/external rotation using the anatomical CSs. The kinematics from these profiles were used in linear least squares minimization of off-axis motions to redefine the tibia and femur origins, the femur flexion axis and the tibia internal rotation axis. Significant improvements in reproducibility of 7.4 mm (tibia origin, p < 0.001), 3.4 mm (femur origin, p < 0.001), and 2.9 (femur FE-axis, p < 0.001) between the two functional CSs compared to the two anatomical CSs were observed. Functional CSs led to significant decreases in off-axis motion during discrete passive flexion profiles. This new strategy for establishing functional CSs provides an objective approach that will reduce the effects of observer error in establishing CSs. Additionally, functional CSs allow for better interpretations of kinematic responses due to loading because effects of kinematic cross-talk is minimized.","output":"A generalized framework for determination of functional musculoskeletal joint coordinate systems."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There are widespread concerns that ethnic minorities and migrants may have inadequate access to COVID-19 vaccines. . Improving vaccine uptake among these vulnerable groups is important towards controlling the spread of COVID-19 and reducing unnecessary mortality. Here we perform a systematic review of ethnic minorities and migrants access to and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases for papers published between 1 January 2020 and 7 October 2021. Studies were included if they were peer-reviewed articles; written in English, included data or estimates of ethnic minorities or migrants access to vaccines; and employed either qualitative or quantitative methods. Of a total of 248 studies screened, 33 met these criteria and included in the final sample. Risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using Newcastle Ottawa Scale and Critical Appraisal Skills Program tools. We conducted a Synthesis Without Meta-analysis for quantitative studies and a Framework synthesis for qualitative studies. RESULTS: 31 of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries, including in the US (n = 17 studies), UK (n = 10), Qatar (n = 2), Israel (n = 1) and France (n = 1). One study was in an upper middle-income country -China (n=1) and another covered multiple countries (n = 1). 26 studies reported outcomes for ethnic minorities while 9 studies reported on migrants. Most of the studies were quantitative -cross sectional studies (n=24) and ecological (n=4). The remaining were qualitative (n=4) and mixed methods (n=1). There was consistent evidence of elevated levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Black/Afro-Caribbean groups in the US and UK, while studies of Hispanic/Latino populations in the US and Asian populations in the UK provided mixed pictures, with levels higher, lower, or the same as their White counterparts. Asians in the US had the highest COVID-19 vaccine acceptance compared to other ethnic groups. There was higher vaccine acceptance among migrant groups in Qatar and China than in the general population. However, migrants to the UK experienced barriers to vaccine access, mainly attributed to language and communication issues. Lack of confidence, mainly due to mistrust of government and health systems coupled with poor communication were the main barriers to uptake among Black ethnic minorities and migrants. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that low confidence in COVID-19 vaccines among Black ethnic minorities driven by mistrust and safety concerns led to high vaccine hesitancy in this group. Such vaccine hesitancy rates constitute a major barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among this ethnic minority. For migrants, convenience factors such as language barriers, fear of deportation and reduced physical access reduced access to COVID-19 vaccines. Building trust, reducing physical barriers and improving communication and transparency about vaccine development through healthcare workers, religious and community leaders can improve access and facilitate uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among ethnic minority and migrant communities.","output":"Ethnic/racial minorities and migrants access to COVID-19 vaccines: A systematic review of barriers and facilitators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic caused by the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the way classes in higher education are conducted.

Although rubella virus infection usually produces a mild febrile rash illness in children and adults, infection during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester, can result in miscarriage, fetal death, stillbirth, or an infant born with a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). A single dose of rubella-containing vaccine (RCV) can provide lifelong protection against rubella (1). The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (GVAP) included a target to achieve elimination of rubella in at least five of the six World Health Organization (WHO) regions* by 2020 (2), and WHO recommends capitalizing on the accelerated measles elimination activities as an opportunity to introduce RCV (1). This report updates a previous report (3) and summarizes global progress toward control and elimination of rubella and CRS from 2012, when accelerated rubella control activities were initiated, through 2020. Among 194 WHO Member States, the number with RCV in their immunization schedules has increased from 132 (68%) in 2012 to 173 (89%) in 2020; 70% of the world's infants were vaccinated against rubella in 2020. Reported rubella cases declined by 48%, from 94,277 in 2012 to 49,136 in 2019, and decreased further to 10,194 in 2020. Rubella elimination has been verified in 93 (48%) of 194 countries including the entire Region of the Americas (AMR). To increase the equity of protection and make further progress to eliminate rubella, it is important that the 21 countries that have not yet done so should introduce RCV. Likewise, countries that have introduced RCV can achieve and maintain rubella elimination with high vaccination coverage and surveillance for rubella and CRS. Four of six WHO regions have established rubella elimination goals; the two WHO regions that have not yet established an elimination goal (the African [AFR] and Eastern Mediterranean [EMR] regions) have expressed a commitment to rubella elimination and should consider establishing a goal.","output":"Progress Toward Rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome Control and Elimination  Worldwide, 2012C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the last twenty years, there have seen several outbreaks of different coronavirus diseases across the world. These outbreaks often led to respiratory tract diseases and have proved to be fatal sometimes. Currently, we are facing an elusive health crisis with the emergence of COVID-19 disease of the coronavirus family. One of the modes of transmission of COVID- 19 is airborne transmission. This transmission occurs as humans breathe in the droplets released by an infected person through breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, or sneezing. Hence, public health officials have mandated the use of face masks which can reduce disease transmission by 65%. For face recognition programs, commonly used for security verification purposes, the use of face mask presents an arduous challenge since these programs were typically trained with human faces devoid of masks but now due to the onset of Covid-19 pandemic, they are forced to identify faces with masks. Hence, this paper investigates the same problem by developing a deep learning based model capable of accurately identifying people with face-masks. In this paper, the authors train a ResNet-50 based architecture that performs well at recognizing masked faces. The outcome of this study could be seamlessly integrated into existing face recognition programs that are designed to detect faces for security verification purposes.","output":"Masked Face Recognition using ResNet-50"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To analysis the anxiety status of Chinese medical workers during the epidemic of COVID-19 by meta-analysis method.

The solutions survey includes technical solutions, procedures and rules to improve systems integration and increase regional electricity exchanges in Med-TSO countries, and is aimed at achieving a higher quality of services and better efficiency of energy supply in Med-TSO member countries in the framework of the expected energy transition. The main scope is to present solutions that will be made available due to maturity and experience in the coming decade, specifically: high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technologies, energy storage, sectors coupling, smart grid technologies and services, inter-TSO and transmissionCdistribution cooperation platforms, etc. The article presents two case studies: the island paradigm and a new cross-border interconnection project of common interest. Finally, the post-pandemic core role of TSOs, which has become more relevant than ever, is transformed into a key-enabler of energy transition towards a sustainable, resilient and innovative climate-neutral recovery.","output":"Grid Integration as a Strategy of Med-TSO in the Mediterranean Area in the Framework of Climate Change and Energy Transition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As COVID-19 vaccines are rolled out across the world, there are growing concerns about the role that trust, belief in conspiracy theories and spread of misinformation through social media impact vaccine hesitancy. We use a nationally representative survey of 1,476 adults in the UK between December 12 to 18, 2020 and five focus groups conducted in the same period. Trust is a core predictor, with distrust in vaccines in general and mistrust in government raising vaccine hesitancy. Trust in health institutions and experts and perceived personal threat are vital, with focus groups revealing that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is driven by a misunderstanding of herd immunity as providing protection, fear of rapid vaccine development and side effects, belief the virus is man-made and related to population control. Particularly those who obtain information from relatively unregulated social media sources such as YouTube that have recommendations tailored by watch history are less likely to be willing to become vaccinated. Those who hold general conspiratorial beliefs are less willing to be vaccinated. Since an increasing number of individuals use social media for gathering health information, interventions require action from governments, health officials and social media companies. More attention needs to help people understand their own risks, unpack complex concepts and fill knowledge voids.","output":"Lack of trust and social media echo chambers predict COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV2 virus, which causes COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) has become a pandemic and has expanded all over the world. Because of increasing number of cases day by day, it takes time to interpret the data thus the limitations in terms of both treatment and findings are emerged. Due to such limitations, the need for clinical decisions making system with predictive algorithms has arisen. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying the diseases. In this study, we design clinical predictive models that estimate, using artificial intelligence and data, which patients are susceptible to receive a COVID-19 disease. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, accuracy, AUROC, and scores calculated. From 12,727 individuals, models were tested with basic information (sex, age) and the patients type of case, which is the combination of their symptoms, their travel during the last 14 days, their contact with an infected person or their participation in a festival requiring a gathering. We used 5 machine learning algorithms (LR, SVM, k-NN, RF, XGBoost) and 1 deep learning algorithm (ANN). Our models were validated with train-test split approach. The experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify patients that have COVID-19 disease at an accuracy of 73% and AUC of 69%.

However, there is limited research on the barriers and needs of genetic counselors (GCs) interested in implementing new SDMs into their practice. In fall 2017, the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC) Access and Service Delivery Committee's SDM Subcommittee sent an online survey to the NSGC membership regarding the use of SDMs, which aimed to update the understanding of current SDM use and how this has changed over time. The survey included several questions with open-response components assessing the need for new SDMs and barriers to implementation. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify common themes. Among 517 usable responses (16% response rate), more than half (54.4%) of respondents indicated their current SDM was inadequate to address the patient need in their area. Nearly two-thirds (64.8%) indicated they were in the process of or planning to make changes to their SDM, although 40.6% did not have a specific timeline. Three major themes related to expanding access, reimbursement for services, and lack of support were identified from responses to questions about implementation of additional SDMs. Access included subthemes of geographic and physical location limitations, addressing long wait times, and the need to expand services. Reimbursement for services included issues with billing, genetic counselor licensure, and limitations due to the need for physician involvement in billing. The lack of support was evident with issues related to understaffing; difficulty gaining support at the administrative, institutional, or physician level; time constraints; and funding concerns. This study shows that GCs need education, tools, and resources to overcome barriers in implementing new or adapting current SDMs, and there is a need for policy change, including new billing and coverage models.","output":"Genetic counseling service delivery models: A study of genetic counselors' interests, needs, and barriers to implementation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus infecting humans that is associated with acute pneumonia, occasional renal failure, and a high mortality rate and is considered a threat to public health. The construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the MERS-CoV genome in a bacterial artificial chromosome is reported here, providing a reverse genetics system to study the molecular biology of the virus and to develop attenuated viruses as vaccine candidates. Following transfection with the cDNA clone, infectious virus was rescued in both Vero A66 and Huh-7 cells. Recombinant MERS-CoVs (rMERS-CoVs) lacking the accessory genes 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 were successfully rescued from cDNA clones with these genes deleted. The mutant viruses presented growth kinetics similar to those of the wild-type virus, indicating that accessory genes were not essential for MERS-CoV replication in cell cultures. In contrast, an engineered mutant virus lacking the structural E protein (rMERS-CoV-E) was not successfully rescued, since viral infectivity was lost at early passages. Interestingly, the rMERS-CoV-E genome replicated after cDNA clone was transfected into cells. The infectious virus was rescued and propagated in cells expressing the E protein in trans, indicating that this virus was replication competent and propagation defective. Therefore, the rMERS-CoV-E mutant virus is potentially a safe and promising vaccine candidate to prevent MERS-CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Since the emergence of MERS-CoV in the Arabian Peninsula during the summer of 2012, it has already spread to 10 different countries, infecting around 94 persons and showing a mortality rate higher than 50%. This article describes the development of the first reverse genetics system for MERS-CoV, based on the construction of an infectious cDNA clone inserted into a bacterial artificial chromosome. Using this system, a collection of rMERS-CoV deletion mutants has been generated. Interestingly, one of the mutants with the E gene deleted was a replication-competent, propagation-defective virus that could only be grown in the laboratory by providing E protein in trans, whereas it would only survive a single virus infection cycle in vivo. This virus constitutes a vaccine candidate that may represent a balance between safety and efficacy for the induction of mucosal immunity, which is needed to prevent MERS-CoV infection.","output":"Engineering a Replication-Competent, Propagation-Defective Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus as a Vaccine Candidate"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study explored the COVID-19 pandemic's impacts on domestic violence (DV) with the following research questions: 1) Did DV occurring during the pandemic differ on certain variables from cases occurring on a typical day the previous year? 2) Did DV occurring after the implementation of shelter-in-place orders differ (on these same variables) from cases occurring prior to shelter-in-place orders? Methods: Two logistic regression models were developed to predict DV case differences before and during the pandemic. DV reports (N=4618) were collected from the Chicago Police Department. Cases from March 2019 and March 2020 were analyzed based on multiple variables. One model was set to predict case differences since the pandemic began, and another model was set to predict case differences during the shelter-in-place period later that month. Results: Both models were significant with multiple significant predictors. During the pandemic period, cases with arrests were 3% less likely to have occurred, and cases at residential locations were 22% more likely to have occurred. During the shelter-in-place period, cases at residential locations were 64% more likely to have occurred, and cases with child victims were 67% less likely to have occurred. Conclusions: This study offers a rapid analysis of DV case differences since the pandemic and shelter-in-place began. Additional variables and data sources could improve model explanatory power.

Conclusive evidence for reflux on oesophageal testing include advanced grade erosive oesophagitis (LA grades C and D), long-segment Barrett's mucosa or peptic strictures on endoscopy or distal oesophageal acid exposure time (AET) >6% on ambulatory pH or pH-impedance monitoring. A normal endoscopy does not exclude GERD, but provides supportive evidence refuting GERD in conjunction with distal AET <4% and <40 reflux episodes on pH-impedance monitoring off proton pump inhibitors. Reflux-symptom association on ambulatory reflux monitoring provides supportive evidence for reflux triggered symptoms, and may predict a better treatment outcome when present. When endoscopy and pH or pH-impedance monitoring are inconclusive, adjunctive evidence from biopsy findings (histopathology scores, dilated intercellular spaces), motor evaluation (hypotensive lower oesophageal sphincter, hiatus hernia and oesophageal body hypomotility on high-resolution manometry) and novel impedance metrics (baseline impedance, postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave index) can add confidence for a GERD diagnosis; however, diagnosis cannot be based on these findings alone. An assessment of anatomy, motor function, reflux burden and symptomatic phenotype will therefore help direct management.

We study spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), a progressive degenerative disorder of the neuromuscular system caused by the polyQ androgen receptor (AR). Using a knock-in mouse model of SBMA, AR113Q mice, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligases which are a hallmark of the canonical muscle atrophy machinery are not induced in AR113Q muscle. Similarly, we find no evidence to suggest dysfunction of signaling pathways that trigger muscle hypertrophy or impairment of the muscle stem cell niche. Instead, we find that skeletal muscle atrophy is characterized by diminished function of the transcriptional regulator Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2), a regulator of myofiber homeostasis. Decreased expression of MEF2 target genes is age- and glutamine tract length-dependent, occurs due to polyQ AR proteotoxicity, and is associated with sequestration of MEF2 into intranuclear inclusions in muscle. Skeletal muscle from R6/2 mice, a model of Huntington disease which develops progressive atrophy, also sequesters MEF2 into inclusions and displays age-dependent loss of MEF2 target genes. Similarly, SBMA patient muscle shows loss of MEF2 target gene expression, and restoring MEF2 activity in AR113Q muscle rescues fiber size and MEF2-regulated gene expression. This work establishes MEF2 impairment as a novel mechanism of skeletal muscle atrophy downstream of toxic polyglutamine proteins and as a therapeutic target for muscle atrophy in these disorders.

Consequently, physicians need to provide a more precise patient-centred healthcare. Professional interpreting appears to play a crucial part in tackling the challenges of language barriers adequately. The aim of this study was to conduct process evaluation through the implementing of video remote interpreting (VR) and telephone remote interpreting (TR) within primary care facilities in the northern German metropolis of Hamburg. METHODS: We conducted a three-armed exploratory pilot trial, which compared VR to TR and to a control group (CG) in different primary care settings. We assessed feasibility of implementation, as well as the acceptance of interpreting tools among their users. In addition, we compared the quality of communication as perceived by patients and physicians, as well as the enabling of patient-centred medicine over all three study groups using quantitative questionnaires. RESULTS: 13 practices (7 GPs, 3 Gynaecologists, 3 Paediatricians) took part in this trial. 183 interpreting calls were documented, 178 physicians as well as 127 patients answered their respective questionnaires. The implementation of the VR- und TR-tools went smoothly and they were broadly accepted by their users. However, the tools were used significantly less often than we had anticipated. With regards to quantitative questionnaires, VR scored significantly better than the control group in terms of the perceived quality of communication by both, patients and physicians and enabled of patient-centred medicine. CONCLUSION: Our main findings were the discrepancy between the assumed high demand of professional interpreting solutions on the one hand and the low willingness of practices to participate on the other. The rather low utilisation rates were also noteworthy. This discrepancy indicates a lack of awareness concerning the adverse effects of using informal or no interpreter in medical settings, which needs to be rectified. Due to the small sample size, all statistical results must be viewed with caution.

All nidoviruses have a common genome organization and generate a nested set (nido C Latin for nest) of 3 co-terminal mRNAs. CoVs have been isolated from a variety of species, including birds, livestock, domestic animals, and humans. CoV infections can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurologic disease, depending on the strain of the virus and the site of infection. Importantly, CoVs have been shown to cross species barriers and have emerged from animal reservoirs to infect humans and cause severe disease. The CoV responsible for an outbreak of severe acute respiratory disease (SARS-CoV) in 2002C03 likely originated as a bat coronavirus which, during replication in an intermediate host (such as the palm civet), evolved to be able to infect humans efficiently. SARS-CoV infected over 8000 people with approximately 10% mortality rate before it was controlled by public health measures of isolation of infected individuals and contacts.

This study aimed to explore the association between noninvasive CA multimodal monitoring measurements and GCS scores. METHODS Acutely comatose patients with a variety of neurological injuries admitted to a neurocritical care unit were monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy-based multimodal monitoring for up to 72 hours. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2), cerebral oximetry index (COx), GCS, and GCS motor data were measured hourly. COx was calculated as a Pearson correlation coefficient between low-frequency changes in rScO2 and mean arterial pressure. Mixed random effects models with random intercept was used to determine the relationship between hourly near-infrared spectroscopy-based measurements and GCS or GCS motor scores. RESULTS A total of 871 observations (h) were analyzed from 57 patients with a variety of neurological conditions. Mean age was 58.714.2 years and the male to female ratio was 1:1.3.

In contrast rScO2 was not associated with GCS (=-0.002, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01, P=0.76) or GCS motor score (=-0.001, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01, P=0.84). CONCLUSIONS This study showed that fluctuations in GCS scores are inversely associated with fluctuations in COx; as COx increases (impaired autoregulation), more severe neurological impairment is observed. However, the difference in COx between high and low GCS is small and warrants further studies investigating this association. CA multimodal monitoring with COx may have the potential to be used as a surrogate of neurological status when the neurological examination is not reliable (ie, sedation and paralytic drug administration).","output":"Glasgow Coma Scale Score Fluctuations are Inversely Associated With a NIRS-based Index of Cerebral Autoregulation in Acutely Comatose Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic situation has affected millions of people with tens of thousands of deaths worldwide. Despite all efforts for finding drugs or vaccines, the key role for the survival of patients is still related to the immune system. Therefore, improving the efficacy and the functionality of the immune system of COVID-19 patients is very crucial. The potential new, non-invasive, FDA-approved biophysical technology that could be considered in this regard is tumor treating fields (TTFields) based on an alternating electric field has great biological effects. TTFields have significant effects in improving the functionality of dendritic cell, and cytotoxic T-cells, and these cells have a major role in defense against viral infection. Hence, applying TTFields could help COVID-19 patients against infection. Additionally, TTFields can reduce viral genomic replication, by reducing the expressions of some of the vital members of DNA replication complex genes from the minichromosome maintenance family (MCMs). These genes not only are involved in DNA replication but it has also been proven that they have a crucial role in viral replication. Also, TTFields suppress the formation of the network of tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) which is knows as filamentous (F)-actin-rich tubular structures. TNTs have a critical role in promoting the spread of viruses through improving viral entry and acting as a protective agent for viral components from immune cells and even pharmaceuticals. Moreover, TTFields enhance autophagy which leads to apoptosis of virally infected cells. Thus, it can be speculated that using TTFields may prove to be a promising approach as a subsidiary treatment of COVID-19.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study including 1926 participants who received inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, compared their local and systemic reactions in 7 days after each dose of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and antiCSARS-CoV-2 IgG after vaccination in all participants. RESULTS: Pain at the injection site within seven days after the first injection was the most commonly reported local reaction, occurring in 31.0% of the patients with allergic disease and 18.9% in the control group, respectively (P < 0.001). After the first dose, systemic events were more frequently reported in patients with allergic disease than control group (30.2% vs. 22.9%, P < 0.001). After the second dose, systemic events occurred less often, affecting 17.1% of the patients with allergic disease and 11.1% of the control group (P < 0.002). The occurrence of fatigue, vertigo, diarrhea, skin rash, sore throat were the most frequent systemic reactions. Overall, a lower incidence of local and systemic reactive events was observed after the second dose than the first dose in patients with allergic disease and control group. Nearly all participants had positive IgG antibodies, and participants with allergic disease had higher frequencies compared with control group (100.0 vs.99.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Although local and systemic reactions were more frequently reported in patients with allergic disease than control group, administration of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was safe and well tolerated by all participants; no participants experienced a serious adverse event, and none were hospitalized.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: To investigate monthly prescription claims for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medicines during the first UK wave, interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was used. A national cohort of community patients' data were examined. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics show salbutamol, aminophylline, ipratropium, and theophylline remain below pre-pandemic levels.Montelukast showed pre-pandemic monthly increase (Est. 67,151 doses, P = 0.05, 95% CI: 1011, 133,291), followed by a jump of 1.6 million doses at March , followed by monthly declines (Est. -112,098 doses, P = 0.216, 95% CI: -293,499, 69,303).Before the pandemic, tiotropium, salbutamol, aminophylline, and ipratropium (P = 0.003) show monthly declines but theophylline and beclometasone showed increases. In March , salbutamol (P = 0.033) and ipratropium (P = 0.001) show a significant jump. After March , ipratropium continues with a downward trajectory (P = 0.001), with a generalized negative trend for all other agents. Salbutamol confidence bounds become negative after March 2020. Some brands were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: An 'unmet' medical gap is identified. While it is essential to understand the underlying reasons, urgent action needs to be taken to reassess patients and ensure continuity of care.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARIES (PLS)Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are long-term lung conditions, affecting 6 million & 1.2 million people respectively and causing breathing difficulties. Sufferers are at a higher risk of chest infections including the coronavirus. Regular use of prescribed medication stabilizes these conditions and prevents them from getting worse. It is common to be prescribed a combination of five to eight oral and inhaled medications.We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the dispensing of these specific medicines across England during the first wave. The English Prescribing Dataset was checked from January 2019 to February 2020 (14 months before the pandemic) and March to October 2020 (8 months after its onset).We find that since March 2020, salbutamol, aminophylline, ipratropium, and theophylline have not returned to their pre-pandemic levels. However, for all agents, there is great variability. Further analysis suggests these trends are not reversing, suggesting that people have not been using their medication as anticipated for 8 months, which is concerning.As a consequence of this work, we recommend that doctors specifically call these patients and discuss their health as a matter of urgency, we encourage patients to continue to take their medication. We advise policy changes to waive the NHS prescription levy for asthma and COPD medication and we seek more granular data for further harm quantification. There are several strengths and weaknesses to our analysis, and we need to conduct more studies to ask patients about their experiences.","output":"Asthma and COPD medicines prescription-claims: A time-series analysis of England's national prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic (Jan 2019 to Oct 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence, testing and vaccination practices, and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in New Zealand METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using KaplanCMeier methods. RESULTS: The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0C16) and 650 days (95% CI 431C993), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib vs dupilumab in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Heads Up was a 24-week, head-to-head, phase 3b, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of upadacitinib with dupilumab among 692 adults with moderate-to-severe AD who were candidates for systemic therapy. The study was conducted from February 21, 2019, to December 9, 2020, at 129 centers located in 22 countries across Europe, North and South America, Oceania, and the Asia-Pacific region. Efficacy analyses were conducted in the intent-to-treat population. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized 1:1 and treated with oral upadacitinib, 30 mg once daily, or subcutaneous dupilumab, 300 mg every other week. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was achievement of 75% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI75) at week 16. Secondary end points were percentage change from baseline in the Worst Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (weekly average), proportion of patients achieving EASI100 and EASI90 at week 16, percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS at week 4, proportion of patients achieving EASI75 at week 2, percentage change from baseline in Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) at week 1, and Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) improvement of 4 points or more at week 16. End points at week 24 included EASI75, EASI90, EASI100, and improvement of 4 points or more in Worst Pruritus NRS from baseline (weekly average). Safety was assessed as treatment-emergent adverse events in all patients receiving 1 or more dose of either drug. RESULTS: Of 924 patients screened, 348 (183 men [52.6%]; mean [SD] age, 36.6 [14.6] years) were randomized to receive upadacitinib and 344 were randomized to receive dupilumab (194 men [56.4%]; mean [SD] age, 36.9 [14.1] years); demographic and disease characteristics were balanced among treatment groups. At week 16, 247 patients receiving upadacitinib (71.0%) and 210 patients receiving dupilumab (61.1%) achieved EASI75 (P = .006). All ranked secondary end points also demonstrated the superiority of upadacitinib vs dupilumab, including improvement in Worst Pruritus NRS as early as week 1 (mean [SE], 31.4% [1.7%] vs 8.8% [1.8%]; P < .001), achievement of EASI75 as early as week 2 (152 [43.7%] vs 60 [17.4%]; P < .001), and achievement of EASI100 at week 16 (97 [27.9%] vs 26 [7.6%]; P < .001). Rates of serious infection, eczema herpeticum, herpes zoster, and laboratory-related adverse events were higher for patients who received upadacitinib, whereas rates of conjunctivitis and injection-site reactions were higher for patients who received dupilumab.

Studies have found that severe cases of COVID-19 may be associated with coagulopathies, however the potential association with AIHA is not clear. CASE REPORT: A patient with no known risk factors or underlying predisposition for developing AIHA presented to a hospital with vague symptoms and profound anemia with a complicated blood bank evaluation. She was found to have COVID-19 and AIHA, for which extensive laboratory testing was performed, including direct antiglobulin tests, elution studies, and cold agglutinin titers, to identify the causative autoantibody. She required multiple blood transfusions and therapeutic interventions prior to clinical stabilization. DISCUSSION: AIHA is a complex disease with a spectrum of presentations and clinical severity. Many diseases have been associated with a propensity for developing AIHA, however there are few cases in the literature of patients with COVID-19 and AIHA. Most of the reports involve patients with other underlying conditions that are known to be associated with the development of AIHA. The presentation, clinical findings, and therapeutic interventions in a patient with severe AIHA, without other underlying conditions, in the setting of COVID-19 are discussed. CONCLUSION: There are few reports of patients with concurrent COVID-19 and AIHA, and the association is not clear. Although COVID-19 has been shown to be associated with coagulopathies, more research is required to determine whether AIHA may also be a potential complication.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a medical record review of all patients with a diagnosis code of long-COVID (DB948A) at all hospitals in the North Denmark Region from February 27, 2020 through June 30, 2021. Confirmed long-COVID was categorized as fulfillment of all three criteria: (1) a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 on a respiratory sample or a positive serum antibody test, (2) symptoms suggestive of long-COVID with no other diagnosis considered more likely, and (3) symptom duration >6 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients were assigned a hospital diagnosis code for long-COVID corresponding to 1.4% of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals during the study period (n=21,727). Next, 40 patients were excluded due to incomplete diagnostic evaluation at time of record review leaving 266 patients for analysis. The patients had a median age of 51 years (interquartile range 43C60) and 175/266 (66%) were females.

Here, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of placenta and other tissues from fetuses in comparison with those from adults using public-available datasets. Our analysis revealed that a very small proportion of trophoblast cells expressed the Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene, suggesting a low possibility of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to fetus during pregnancy. We found that the fetal adrenal gland, heart, kidney and stomach were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, because these organs contained cell clusters that expressed high levels of the ACE2 gene. In particular, a higher proportion of ACE2-expressing cell clusters in the adrenal gland and kidney also expressed the Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) gene compared with other organs. Surprisingly, ACE2-expressing type II alveolar (AT2) equivalent cells were absent in fetal lungs. This is in sharp contrast to adult lungs. As ACE2 expression is regulated by various conditions, including oxygen concentration, inflammation and smoking, caution is warranted to avoid triggering potential ACE2 expression in fetal and placental tissue.","output":"Single-cell expression profiles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 reveals potential vertical transmission and fetus infection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This manuscript is focused on features' definition for the outcome prediction of matches of NBA basketball championship.

RESULTS The follow-up was 94% complete. Cumulative follow-up time was 2268 patient-years [mean follow-up time 5.1 (4.3 SD) years]. Thirty-day mortality was 2.2% (n = 10). Late (>30 days) survival did not differ from that of the age- and gender-matched general population. Freedom from reoperation in patients without additional cusp reconstruction was 94% [95% confidence interval (CI) 91-98] and 92% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, which was not significantly different (P = 1) for patients who did require additional cusp reconstruction 98% (95% CI 95-100) and 89% (95% CI 81-99). In patients with tricuspid aortic valves (n = 338), freedom from reoperation was 96% (95% CI 94-99) and 93% (95% CI 88-97) at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Patients with bicuspid aortic valves (n = 111) had a freedom from reoperation of 94% (95% CI 89-99) at 5 years and 88% (95% CI 79-98) at 10 years (P = 0.021 for the comparison to tricuspid aortic valve).

Although age-based formulas are generally used with choice of an ETT based on the internal diameter (ID), measurements of the outer diameter (OD) of the ETT would seem to be a more scientific approach to determine the proper size of an ETT. However, the variable OD of the ETT despite the same ID makes the selection of a proper sized ETT more difficult. The current study compares airway dimensions measured using computed tomography (CT) with the OD of ETTs from various manufacturers. METHODS The outer diameter of commonly used ETTs (12 cuffed and 5 uncuffed) were measured and compared with CT-based cricoid measurements obtained from a previous study involving 130 pediatric patients, ranging in age from 1 month to 10 years. These data were used to determine the likelihood of a clinically acceptable match. RESULTS The differences of the cricoid dimensions between the 5th and the 95th percentile in each group ranged from a minimum of 2.23mm to a maximum of 6.51mm. Depending on the manufacturer, there was significant variation in the OD of the ETTs with the same ID. These discrepancies, which varied according to manufacturer and were greater with uncuffed as compared to cuffed ETTs, impacted the chances of an acceptable fit with the cricoid diameters. CONCLUSION When choosing an ETT, age-based formulas which use the ID may not be uniformly accurate in ensuring the appropriately-sized ETT given the variation in the OD despite the same ID. These issues further support the use of cuffed ETTs as the variation in fit can be adjusted by inflation of the cuff to provide an adequate tracheal seal.","output":"Endotracheal tubes and the cricoid: Is there a good fit?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Host responses to viral infection include both immune activation and programmed cell death.

MAVS-induced cell death requires mitochondrial localization, is caspase dependent, and displays hallmarks of apoptosis. Furthermore, MAVS(?/?) fibroblasts are resistant to Sendai virus-induced apoptosis. A functional screen identifies the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein (NSP15) as inhibitors of MAVS-induced apoptosis, possibly as a method of immune evasion.

Methods: We used the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scales to survey the psychology burden of students in April 2020. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine medical students who signed up for volunteer activities in Chinese from February to April 2020. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Results: The detection of depression, anxiety and stress of medical student volunteers were 26.8%, 20.2% and 11.1%, respectively. The volunteer's negative emotions were more pronounced before work and diminished gradually. Most participants expressed no concern about being infected themselves, but worry about family infection. Participant's motivations for volunteering were primarily their duties as medical students and encouragement from their families/teachers. The vast majority of medical students said they would be willing to work as medical assistants again and this experience would not affect their career choice. Conclusions: Chinese medical student volunteers tended to show negative emotions at the beginning of their work, and then gradually declined, while positive emotions emerged.

The spike protein of virus SARS-CoV-2 is significant because of two reasons. Firstly, the spike protein of this virus binds with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Secondly, it has several antigenic regions that might be targeted for vaccine development. However, the structural analytical data for the spike protein of this virus is not available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we performed an analysis to understand the structural two subunits of S glycoprotein (S gp) of SARS-CoV-2. Further, an analysis of secondary structure components and the tertiary structure analysis of RBD was carried out. We also performed molecular interaction analysis between S gp of this virus and hACE2 as well as between SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 to compare the binding properties of these two viruses. RESULTS: We noted that the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 form eleven hydrogen bonds, while the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 receptor form seven hydrogen bonds, indicating that the molecular interaction of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 receptor is more stable than SARS-CoV S gp and hACE2 receptor. The pairwise sequence alignment of S gp SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 shows several conserved residues of these two proteins. Besides, conserved pattern analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S gp and hACE2 revealed the presence of several highly conserved regions for these two proteins. The molecular dynamics simulation shows a stable interplay between SARS-CoV-2 S gp with the hACE2 receptor.

In this work, we try to analyze the tweets and detect the trending topics and major concerns of people on Twitter, which can enable us to better understand the situation, and devise better planning. More specifically we propose a model based on the universal sentence encoder to detect the main topics of Tweets in recent months. We used universal sentence encoder in order to derive the semantic representation and the similarity of tweets. We then used the sentence similarity and their embeddings, and feed them to K-means clustering algorithm to group similar tweets (in semantic sense). After that, the cluster summary is obtained using a text summarization algorithm based on deep learning, which can uncover the underlying topics of each cluster. Through experimental results, we show that our model can detect very informative topics, by processing a large number of tweets on sentence level (which can preserve the overall meaning of the tweets). Since this framework has no restriction on specific data distribution, it can be used to detect trending topics from any other social media and any other context rather than COVID-19.

Variants including Omicron now seriously threaten the efficacy of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines that target the spike protein. Viral evolution over a much longer timescale has generated a wide range of genetically distinct sarbecoviruses in animal populations, including the pandemic viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. The genetic diversity and widespread zoonotic potential of this group complicates current attempts to develop drugs in preparation for the next sarbecovirus pandemic. Receptor-based decoy inhibitors can target a wide range of viral strains with a common receptor and may have intrinsic resistance to escape mutant generation and antigenic drift. We previously generated an affinity-matured decoy inhibitor based on the receptor target of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and deployed it in an adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV) for intranasal delivery and passive prophylaxis against COVID-19. Here, we demonstrate the exceptional binding and neutralizing potency of this ACE2 decoy against SARS-CoV-2 variants including Omicron, as well as binding to diverse ACE2-dependent coronaviruses. We also discuss a strategy of decoy-based treatment and passive protection to mitigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future airway virus threats. Author SummaryViral sequences can change dramatically during pandemics lasting multiple years. Likewise, evolution over centuries has generated genetically diverse virus families posing similar threats to humans. This variation presents a challenge to drug development, in both the breadth of achievable protection against related groups of viruses and the durability of therapeutic agents or vaccines during extended outbreaks. This phenomenon has played out dramatically during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The highly divergent Omicron variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has upended previous gains won by vaccine and monoclonal antibody development. Moreover, ecological surveys have increasingly revealed a broad class of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in animals, each poised to cause a future human pandemic. Here, we evaluate an alternative to antibody-based protection and prevention--a decoy molecule based on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Our engineered decoy has proven resistant to SARS-CoV-2 evolution during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and can neutralize all variants of concern, including Omicron. Furthermore, the decoy binds tightly to a broad class of sarbecoviruses related to pandemic SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, indicating that receptor decoys offer advantages over monoclonal antibodies and may be deployed during the COVID-19 pandemic and future coronavirus outbreaks to prevent and treat severe illness.","output":"High activity of an affinity-matured ACE2 decoy against Omicron SARS-CoV-2 and pre-emergent coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, peoples normal lives were disrupted by a sudden plague (COVID-19), the huge impact of COVID-19 on society has never been appeared.

Here we report the rescue of recombinant Isfahan virus (rISFV) from genomic cDNA as a potential new vaccine vector platform. The rISFV genome was modified to attenuate virulence and express the VEEV and EEEV E2/E1 surface glycoproteins as vaccine antigens. A single dose of the rISFV vaccine vectors elicited neutralizing antibody responses and protected mice from lethal VEEV and EEEV challenges at 1 month postvaccination as well as lethal VEEV challenge at 8 months postvaccination. A mixture of rISFV vectors expressing the VEEV and EEEV E2/E1 glycoproteins also provided durable, single-dose protection from lethal VEEV and EEEV challenges, demonstrating the potential for a multivalent vaccine formulation. These findings were paralleled in studies with an attenuated form of rVSV expressing the VEEV E2/E1 glycoproteins. Both the rVSV and rISFV vectors were attenuated by using an approach that has demonstrated safety in human trials of an rVSV/HIV-1 vaccine. Vaccines based on either of these vaccine vector platforms may present a safe and effective approach to prevent alphavirus-induced disease in humans.IMPORTANCE This work introduces rISFV as a novel vaccine vector platform that is serologically distinct and phylogenetically distant from VSV. The rISFV vector has been attenuated by an approach used for an rVSV vector that has demonstrated safety in clinical studies. The vaccine potential of the rISFV vector was investigated in a well-established alphavirus disease model. The findings indicate the feasibility of producing a safe, efficacious, multivalent vaccine against the encephalitic alphaviruses VEEV and EEEV, both of which can cause fatal disease. This work also demonstrates the efficacy of an attenuated rVSV vector that has already demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in multiple HIV-1 phase I clinical studies. The absence of serological cross-reactivity between rVSV and rISFV and their phylogenetic divergence within the Vesiculovirus genus indicate potential for two stand-alone vaccine vector platforms that could be used to target multiple bacterial and/or viral agents in successive immunization campaigns or as heterologous prime-boost agents.","output":"Recombinant Isfahan Virus and Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Vaccine Vectors Provide Durable, Multivalent, Single-Dose Protection against Lethal Alphavirus Challenge."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scores of measures implemented to fight the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic was briefly discussed.

No prevention strategy specifically addresses this period. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, two-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in nine hospitals in Kenya and Uganda to determine whether 3 months of malaria chemoprevention could reduce morbidity and mortality after hospital discharge in children younger than 5 years of age who had been admitted with severe anemia. All children received standard in-hospital care for severe anemia and a 3-day course of artemether-lumefantrine at discharge. Two weeks after discharge, children were randomly assigned to receive dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (chemoprevention group) or placebo, administered as 3-day courses at 2, 6, and 10 weeks after discharge. Children were followed for 26 weeks after discharge. The primary outcome was one or more hospital readmissions for any reason or death from the time of randomization to 6 months after discharge. Conditional risk-set modeling for recurrent events was used to calculate hazard ratios with the use of the Prentice-Williams-Peterson total-time approach. RESULTS: From May 2016 through May 2018, a total of 1049 children underwent randomization; 524 were assigned to the chemoprevention group and 525 to the placebo group. From week 3 through week 26, a total of 184 events of readmission or death occurred in the chemoprevention group and 316 occurred in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.78; P<0.001). The lower incidence of readmission or death in the chemoprevention group than in the placebo group was restricted to the intervention period (week 3 through week 14) (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.42) and was not sustained after that time (week 15 through week 26) (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.47). No serious adverse events were attributed to dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine. CONCLUSIONS: In areas with intense malaria transmission, 3 months of postdischarge malaria chemoprevention with monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine in children who had recently received treatment for severe anemia prevented more deaths or readmissions for any reason after discharge than placebo.

Background The contribution of our study is to use qualitative methods to understand nurses' experiences and perceptions of the risk of the contagion linked to the shortage of PPE during the first wave of the pandemic, whose explosive start strained health systems around the globe. Design Qualitative descriptive design according to the Rapid Research Evaluation and Appraisal model. Methods Semi-structured videoconference interviews were conducted to explore the experiences of 29 nurses including staff nurses, nursing supervisors and nursing directors from hospital and community services of the Spanish health system. Interviews lasted 30?45 min and were conducted in May 2020. We carried out a thematic analysis using Dedoose. The COREQ checklist was used to report findings. Results We identified the following themes and subthemes: 1. Experiences with personal protective equipment: scarcity, inequality, reutilization, self-protection, delegation of responsibility, and gap between protocols and reality;2. Perception of the risk of contagion: lack of credibility, lack of trust, lack of support, and meeting subjective needs. Conclusions The scarcity of personal protective equipment and inequality in its distribution led nurses to take initiatives to feel more protected. Mid-ranking supervisors were caught between the responsibility of monitoring and rationing personal protective equipment and providing the necessary protection to nurses. The disjuncture between protocols and the available supply of personal protective equipment caused confusion. Lack of credibility, lack of trust and lack of support from management influenced participants' perception of the risk of contagion. Mid-ranking supervisors were often responsible for trying to alleviate fear among nursing staff. Relevance to clinical practice Understanding the factors involved in risk perception can be helpful to decision-makers who help protect nurses in clinical practice. These results can help administrators and policymakers because they point to the need for nurses to feel that their departments and centers look after their safety at work. Transparent communication and emotional support may contribute to their well-being in the face of risk.","output":"Spanish nurses experiences with personal protective equipment and perceptions of risk of contagion from COVID-19: A qualitative rapid appraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Knowledge of coronaviruses in wild carnivores is limited.

It was quickly discovered that the etiological factor of the new disease (COVID-19) was a previously unknown SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The global spread of of COVID-19 has lead to the declaration of a pandemic status in 2019-2020 as declared by the World Health Organization and Public Health Emergency of International Concern. SARS-CoV-2 characterizes with high epidemic potential and is effectively disseminated between humans. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related pathogens. Their prime route of distribution is air-droplet transmission. Combating infectious diseases disseminated by inhalation is very difficult, and mainly relies on the use of vaccines. However, despite the lack of an effective anti-SARS-CoV vaccine and specific antiviral drugs, the strict sanitary procedures proved to be sufficient to stop the SARS epidemic in June 2003. However, epidemic research has indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in humans significantly more effectively than SARS-CoV; therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to expand. This indicates that the so far anti-epidemic activities to control COVID-19 are insufficient.

C. trachomatis enter the cells and replicate to infect different tissues/organs, giving rise to a spectrum of pathological conditions; however, the exact mechanism or receptor(s) for their entry is not well understood. Here we report that CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), an apical epithelial anion channel, is required for cellular entry and internalization of C. trachomatis. Human epithelial cell lines expressing functional CFTR internalized more C. trachomatis than the cells expressing mutant Delta508 CFTR. The in vitro cellular uptake of C. trachomatis can be blocked by CFTR inhibitors or antibody, and the in vivo cellular uptake of C. trachomatis in CFTR mutant (CFTR(-/-)) mice was significantly less compared with that in the wild-type. Direct interaction between CFTR and C. trachomatis LPS (lipopolysaccharide) is demonstrated by their immune-co-localization and co-immunoprecipitation. Despite an increase in CFTR expression observed upon C. trachomatis LPS challenge, a reduction in its ion channel activity is observed, consistent with the notion that CFTR functions as a receptor for cellular entry and internationization of C. trachomatis, with compromised ion-channel function. These findings, for the first time, demonstrate that CFTR functions as a cell-surface receptor for epithelial cell entry, and internalization of C. trachomatis and these findings may lead to the development of new treatment strategies to curtail the spread of chlamydial infections.","output":"CFTR is required for cellular entry and internalization of Chlamydia trachomatis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The broad availability of smartphones and the number of health apps in app stores have risen in recent years. Health apps have benefits for individuals (eg, the ability to monitor ones health) as well as for researchers (eg, the ability to collect data in population-based, clinical, and observational studies). Although the number of health apps on the global app market is huge and the associated potential seems to be great, app-based questionnaires for collecting patient-related data have not played an important role in epidemiological studies so far. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to provide an overview of studies that have collected patient data using an app-based approach, with a particular focus on longitudinal studies. This literature review describes the current extent to which smartphones have been used for collecting (patient) data for research purposes, and the potential benefits and challenges associated with this approach. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review of studies that used data collection via apps. PubMed was used to identify studies describing the use of smartphone app questionnaires for collecting data over time. Overall, 17 articles were included in the summary. RESULTS: Based on the results of this scoping review, there are only a few studies that integrate smartphone apps into data-collection approaches. Studies dealing with the collection of health-related data via smartphone apps have mainly been developed with regard to psychosomatic, neurodegenerative, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as malign neoplasm. Among the identified studies, the duration of data collection ranged from 4 weeks to 12 months, and the participants mean ages ranged from 7 to 69 years. Potential can be seen for real-time information transfer, fast data synchronization (which saves time and increases effectivity), and the possibility of tracking responses longitudinally. Furthermore, smartphone-based data-collection techniques might prevent biases, such as reminder bias or mistakes occurring during manual data transfers. In chronic diseases, real-time communication with physicians and early detection of symptoms enables rapid modifications in disease management. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that using mobile technologies can help to overcome challenges linked with data collection in epidemiological research. However, further feasibility studies need to be conducted in the near future to test the applicability and acceptance of these mobile apps for epidemiological research in various subpopulations.","output":"Possibilities, Problems, and Perspectives of Data Collection by Mobile Apps in Longitudinal Epidemiological Studies: Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows that severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be complicated by a significant coagulopathy, that likely manifests in the form of both microthrombosis and VTE This recognition has led to the urgent need for practical guidance regarding prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE METHODS: A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) format that addressed urgent clinical questions regarding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with COVID-19 MEDLINE (via PubMed or Ovid), Embase, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials were systematically searched for relevant literature, and references were screened for inclusion Validated evaluation tools were used to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation When evidence did not exist, guidance was developed based on consensus using the modified Delphi process RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on 13 Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome questions resulted in 22 statements Very little evidence exists in the COVID-19 population The panel thus used expert consensus and existing evidence-based guidelines to craft the guidance statements CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on the optimal strategies to prevent, diagnose, and treat VTE in patients with COVID-19 is sparse but rapidly evolving","output":"Prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we present our experience with the use of breakout rooms in a second year undergraduate Software Design course at a large North American institution.

The encouraging results of a recent trial conducted in young children in Burkina Faso and Mali in which a combination of the RTS,S/AS01(E) malaria vaccine and seasonal malaria chemoprevention led to a substantial reduction in clinical cases of malaria, severe malaria, and malaria deaths compared with the administration of either intervention given alone suggests that there may be other epidemiological/clinical situations in which a combination of malaria vaccination and chemoprevention could be beneficial. Some of these potential opportunities are considered in this paper. These include combining vaccination with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in infants, with intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (through vaccination of women of child-bearing age before or during pregnancy), or with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in the management of children recently admitted to hospital with severe anaemia. Other potential uses of the combination are prevention of malaria in children at particular risk from the adverse effects of clinical malaria, such as those with sickle cell disease, and during the final stages of a malaria elimination programme when vaccination could be combined with repeated rounds of mass drug administration. The combination of a pre-erythrocytic stage malaria vaccine with an effective chemopreventive regimen could make a valuable contribution to malaria control and elimination in a variety of clinical or epidemiological situations, and the potential of this approach to malaria control needs to be explored.","output":"Combining malaria vaccination with chemoprevention: a promising new approach to malaria control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of COVID-19 has caused radical changes in the structure of people's daily routines in most of the countries around the world and have had a big impact on physical activity (PA) and daily movement. Previous studies reported the increase of sedentary behaviours during movement restrictions. This study investigates the impact of the first Italian lockdown measures (9 march - 3 may 2020) on PA habits and factors potentially associated with starting or ceasing PA practice during home confinement. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out using an online 40-item questionnaire spread in May 2020 in Italy. Multivariable regressions were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1865 people were enrolled. During lockdown, PA was performed by 65.5% of the sample. Overall, the number of physically active people increased by 8%, compared to the pre-pandemic period level (56%). A change in PA habits occurred in 34.1% of the sample (37.9% of them stopped PA and 62.1% started it). Starting PA during lockdown was related to being on a diet, whereas living with children and having poor psychological well-being were inversely related with starting PA. Conversely, unhealthy factors like being overweight or obese, having poor mental well-being and the occurrence of emotional overeating were related to stopping PA during lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: The first Covid-19 Italian lockdown had a significant impact on healthy habits of the population, leading to an increase of physically active individuals. Furthermore, a relation between unhealthy lifestyle factors and stopping physical activity during lockdown was found. European governments should adopt health promotion strategies to avoid the increase of sedentary behaviours during and after the pandemic.

Gating is disrupted both in schizophrenia patients and their unaffected relatives, suggesting that gating deficit may represent a biomarker associated with a genetic liability to the disorder. To assess the strength of the evidence for the etiopathogenetic links between genetic variation, gating efficiency, and schizophrenia, we carried out a systematic review of human genetic association studies of sensory gating (suppression of the P50 component of the auditory event-related brain potential) and sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response). Sixty-three full-text articles met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. In total, 117 genetic variants were reported to be associated with gating functions: 33 variants for sensory gating, 80 variants for sensorimotor gating, and four variants for both sensory and sensorimotor gating. However, only five of these associations (four for prepulse inhibition-CHRNA3 rs1317286, COMT rs4680, HTR2A rs6311, and TCF4 rs9960767, and one for P50 suppression-CHRNA7 rs67158670) were consistently replicated in independent samples. Although these variants and genes were all implicated in schizophrenia in research studies, only two polymorphisms (HTR2A rs6311 and TCF4 rs9960767) were also reported to be associated with schizophrenia at a meta-analytic or genome-wide level of evidence. Thus, although gating is widely considered as an important endophenotype of schizophrenia, these findings demonstrate that evidence for a common genetic etiology of impaired gating functions and schizophrenia is yet unsatisfactory, warranting further studies in this field.","output":"Genetic Determinants of Gating Functions: Do We Get Closer to Understanding Schizophrenia Etiopathogenesis?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the mechanism and level of upper airway obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients during natural sleep, together with synchronous electroencephalogram and respiratory events registration at 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) platform with high spatial and temporal resolution. STUDY DESIGN A prospective cohort study of 20 randomly selected OSA patients. METHODS Fifteen of 20 patients were able to complete spontaneous sleep during MRI. While asleep, dynamic MR images of pharynx were obtained in the midline sagittal view. During the scan, nasal and oral airflow, thoracoabdominal wall effort, and electroencephalogram were synchronously recorded. The physiologic data were retrospectively scored to identify periods of apneas and synchronized with dynamic MR images. RESULTS In all 15 patients, the site of complete airway obstruction occurred at the retropalatal space. We noticed different positions of the soft palate during apneic events. In seven of 15 patients (47%), the soft palate was attached to the tongue base and moved backward, compressing the airway. In five of 15 patients (33%), the soft palate was detached from the tongue base and solely moved backward, compressing the airway. In three patients (20%), we recorded both mechanisms of complete airway obstruction. In cases with attached soft palate to the tongue base, we noticed significant narrowing of the retrolingual space during apneic events. CONCLUSION We describe a novel mechanism of obstruction dependent on the position of soft palate.

This contrasts with other respiratory viruses where disease manifestations are often more severe in children. We hypothesize that a more robust early innate immune response to SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) protects against severe disease.METHODSClinical outcomes, SARS-CoV-2 viral copies, and cellular gene expression were compared in nasopharyngeal swabs obtained at the time of presentation to the emergency department from 12 children and 27 adults using bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. Total protein, cytokines, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA were quantified in nasal fluid.RESULTSSARS-CoV-2 copies, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, and TMPRSS2 gene expression were similar in children and adults, but children displayed higher expression of genes associated with IFN signaling, NLRP3 inflammasome, and other innate pathways. Higher levels of IFN-&#945;2, IFN-?3, IP-10, IL-8, and IL-1? protein were detected in nasal fluid in children versus adults. Children also expressed higher levels of genes associated with immune cells, whereas expression of those associated with epithelial cells did not differ in children versus adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG were detected at similar levels in nasal fluid from both groups. None of the children required supplemental oxygen, whereas 7 adults did (P = 0.03); 4 adults died.CONCLUSIONThese findings provide direct evidence of a more vigorous early mucosal immune response in children compared with adults and suggest that this contributes to favorable clinical outcomes.FUNDINGNIH grants R01 AI134367, UL1 TR002556, T32 AI007501, T32GM007288, P30 AI124414; an Albert Einstein College of Medicine Dean's COVID-19 Pilot Research Award; and the Eric J.

METHODS This pilot, open-label, single-arm study included adult symptomatic patients with suspected or confirmed CoViD-19 for whom the general practitioner or other carer had decided not to proceed to hospitalization. Participants were monitored daily at home, by measuring the pulse oximetry (SpO2) at rest and after a rapid walking test. The study assessed feasibility outcomes (at least 80% of patients recommended to be sent to the competent emergency room actually transferred within 24 hours from reporting) and efficacy (SpO2 at emergency room admission). Patients with SpO2 values below 90% (86% if affected by chronic pulmonary diseases) at rest or with a decrease in SpO2 of five percentage points after a rapid walking test were recommended for hospital care. RESULTS Thirty-seven participants reported by the local health unit of Alessandria and the Metropolitan City of Turin were included in the study. Enrollment, initially planned for two months to reach a target of 340, was interrupted early due to the drastic reduction in the number of cases. On average, each participant was monitored for 8.2 (median 6.0) days, for a total of 302 visits. The participants showed milder symptoms than those observed in the first phase of the epidemic, at least in terms of pulmonary impairment. No patient had a decrease in SpO2 of 5 percentage points or greater and only one patient required hospitalization due to a worsening of the disease.

However, oral cavities have come under renewed scrutiny worldwide because saliva, a mixture of salivary secretions, pharyngeal secretions, and gingival crevicular fluid, have not only been shown to contain infective viral loads, mediating the route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via droplet, aerosol, or contagion, but also used as a sample for viral RNA testing with a usefulness comparable to the nasopharyngeal swab. The oral cavity is an important portal for ingress of SARS-CoV-2, being an entryway to the bronchi, alveoli, and rest of the lower respiratory tract, causing inflammation by viral infection. Moreover, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a host receptor for SARS-CoV-2, coupled with proteases responsible for viral entry have been found to be expressed on the tongue and other oral mucosae, suggesting that the oral cavity is the site of virus replication and propagation. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the aspiration of oral bacteria (such as periodontal pathogens) along with saliva into the lower respiratory tract may be a complicating factor for COVID-19 because chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes are known COVID-19 comorbidities with a greater risk of disease aggravation and higher death rate. These comorbidities have a strong connection to chronic periodontitis and periodontal pathogens, and an oral health management is an effective measure to prevent these comorbidities. In addition, oral bacteria, particularly periodontal pathogens, could be proinflammatory stimulants to respiratory epithelia upon its exposure to aspirated bacteria. Therefore, it may be expected that oral health management not only prevents comorbidities involved in aggravating COVID-19 but also has an effect against COVID-19 progression. This review discusses the significance of oral health management in SARS-CoV-2 infection in the era of \\"the new normal with COVID-19\\" and COVID-19 prevention with reference to the hypothetical mechanisms that the authors and the other researchers have proposed.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Significance of Oral Health Management in the Era of \\"the New Normal with COVID-19\\""},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective We aimed to document data on the epidemiology and factors associated with clinical course leading to death of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Methods Prospective observational cohort study on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 disease in February-24th/May-17th 2020 in Milan, Italy. Uni-multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed. Deaths percentage by two-weeks intervals according to age and disease severity was analysed. Results A total of 174/539 (32.3%) patients died in hospital over 8,228 person-day follow-up; the 14-day Kaplan-Meier probability of death was 29.5% (95%CI: 25.5-34.0). Older age, burden of comorbidities, COVID-19 disease severity, inflammatory markers at admission were independent predictors of increased risk, while several drug-combinations were predictors of reduced risk of in-hospital death. The highest fatality rate, 36.5%, occurred during the 2nd-3rd week of March, when 55.4% of patients presented with severe disease, while a second peak, by the end of April, was related to the admission of older patients (55% > = 80 years) with less severe disease, 30% coming from long-term care facilities. Conclusions The unusual fatality rate in our setting is likely to be related to age and the clinical conditions of our patients.

Accordingly, this study proposes a model to predict science teachers intentions to use mobile applications in the teaching process. Our model merges the Technology Acceptance Model, the Flow Theory, and the Theory of Planned Behavior. It includes 11 hypotheses that were tested with 1203 pre-service and in-service science teachers from different cities in Turkey. Additionally, the study investigates the mediating role of attitude and perceived usefulness on teachers intentions to use mobile apps. Further, it examines the moderating role of the sample type on teachers behavioral intentions.

However, its environmental consequences are poorly understood. Thus, to assess whether COVID-19 therapy based on the use of azithromycin (AZT) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) during the pandemic affects wild aquatic life, we exposed (for 72 h) neotropical tadpoles of the species Physalaemus cuvieri to the water containing these drugs to 12.5 g/L. We observed that the increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase in tadpoles exposed to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) was predominant to keep the production of NO, ROS, TBARS and H2O2 equitable between the experimental groups. In addition, the uptake of AZT and the strong interaction of AZT with acetylcholinesterase (AChE), predicted by the molecular docking analysis, were associated with the anticholinesterase effect observed in the groups exposed to the antibiotic. However, the unexpected increase in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in these same groups suggests its constitutive role in maintaining cholinergic homeostasis. Therefore, taken together, our data provide a pioneering evidence that the exposure of P. cuvieri tadpoles to AZT (alone or in combination with HCQ) in a predictably increased environmental concentration (12.5 g/L) elicits a compensatory adaptive response that can have, in the short period of exposure, guaranteed the survival of the animals. However, the high energy cost for maintaining physiological homeostasis, can compromise the growth and development of animals and, therefore, in the medium-long term, have a general negative effect on the health of animals. Thus, it is possible that COVID-19 therapy, based on the use of AZT, affects wild aquatic life, which requires greater attention to the impacts that this drug may represent.","output":"Can use of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19 affect aquatic wildlife?

Given the essential role of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in regulating a myriad of cellular processes, it is not surprising that malfunction of UPS components is implicated in numerous human diseases, including many types of cancer. The clinical success of proteasome inhibitors in treating multiple myeloma has further stimulated enthusiasm for targeting UPS proteins for pharmacological intervention in cancer treatment, particularly in the precision medicine era. Unfortunately, despite tremendous efforts, the paucity of potent and selective UPS inhibitors has severely hampered attempts to exploit the UPS for therapeutic benefits. To tackle this problem, many groups have been working on technology advancement to rapidly and effectively screen for potent and specific UPS modulators as intracellular probes or early-phase therapeutic agents. Here, we review several emerging technologies for developing chemical- and protein-based molecules to manipulate UPS enzymatic activity, with the aim of providing an overview of strategies available to target ubiquitination for cancer therapy.","output":"Emerging drug development technologies targeting ubiquitination for cancer therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To explore the clinical and radiology features of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

We aimed to identify minimal epitopes on the RBD that would induce antibody responses that block the interaction of the RBD and ACE2 as a strategy leading to an effective vaccine with reduced risk of inducing immunopathology. METHODS: We procured a series of overlapping 20\\\\amino acid peptides spanning the RBD and asked which were recognised by plasma from COVID\\\\19 convalescent patients.

However, CRC is considered as one of the most preventable cancers by which the mortality rates reduce about 60% through implementing the screening programmes. The present study aimed to evaluate the main barriers of CRC screening in a defined population. METHOD: Healthy individuals from all regions of the state were invited to participate in different healthcare centres. They were assessed by a provided online risk assessment tool, which was completed for all recruited subjects, and has been developed to assess the CRC risk based on personal and family history of adenoma, CRC, and other high-risk diseases. Research team staff assessed all individuals by this tool and then eligible people according to their lifetime risk of CRC were included in the study. There was not any age restriction in this study. Colonoscopy and three stool-based tests including faecal occult blood test, faecal immunochemical test and stool DNA tests were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 725 cases including 425 (58.6%) males and 300 (41.4%) females participated in the study. Lack of knowledge and attitude about screening programmes was the most common barrier, especially among women (68% for women versus 58% for men) and those from rural areas (88% in rural versus 55% in urban areas). Fear of colonoscopy and procedure complications and pain (48%), discomfort and anxiety from inserting a tube into the bowel (65% among females versus 43% among males) were reported commonly. Embarrassment and dignity were other complaints, especially in women (62% in females versus 35% in males). CONCLUSION: Increasing knowledge and attitude about the aims and benefits of screening programmes, acceptable and convenient communication of health systems with the general population are considered to be the key elements in the success and implementation of any screening programme.","output":"Identifying the main barriers for participation in a population-based colorectal cancer screening programme in East Azerbaijan, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at a high risk of major bleeding owing to their comorbidity and risk profile, no validated tools exist to predict bleeding risk.

We identified plate waste (including wasted beverages), which remains after the lunch of schoolchildren in grades 1C7, examining a total of 7064 lunch samples. The originality of the research is due to the fact that a unified menu was designed for the field study, which ensured the same field study conditions in all the schools. The results of the research revealed that the average weight of plate waste per schoolchild reached 178 g, and the total weight of plate waste accounted for 28.75% of the total weight of food served. No significant differences in plate waste weight between various age groups and grades of schoolchildren were found, which was also confirmed by a one-way ANOVA test. An analysis of plate waste by food category showed that beverages accounted for the largest share of total plate waste (42.24%), followed by staple food (28.38%) and meat (11.77%). An analysis of plate waste shares of food served (%) by food category revealed a similar situation: the largest share of food served was made up of beverages (37.56%), followed by staple food (36.48%) and meat (28.77%). An analysis of the monetary value of food waste showed that the average cost of plate waste (excluding beverage) per schoolchild was EUR 0.236, which represented 16.6% of the national and municipal funding of EUR 1.42 per portion.

To investigate the possible role of pangolins as a source of potential zoonoses, we collected throat and rectal swabs from 334 Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) confiscated in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah between August 2009 and March 2019. Total nucleic acid was extracted for viral molecular screening using conventional PCR protocols used to routinely identify known and novel viruses in extensive prior sampling (> 50,000 mammals). No sample yielded a positive PCR result for any of the targeted viral families-Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae. In the light of recent reports of coronaviruses including a SARS-CoV-2-related virus in Sunda pangolins in China, the lack of any coronavirus detection in our 'upstream' market chain samples suggests that these detections in 'downstream' animals more plausibly reflect exposure to infected humans, wildlife or other animals within the wildlife trade network.

While early studies have uncovered some evidence of racial and ethnic differences in mask-wearing behavior, critical gaps remain. We begin to address these gaps by (1) more comprehensively investigating the role of race and ethnicity on mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) examining whether gender intersects with race and ethnicity to differently influence mask-wearing patterns. METHODS: Data were drawn from the COVID-19 Impact Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of adults living in the U.S. Data were pooled from three time points that ranged from late April 2020 to early June 2020. The final analytic sample consisted of 4688 non-institutionalized adults living in the U.S. A series of logistic regression models with robust standard errors were used to estimate differences in mask-wearing patterns. RESULTS: Compared with White respondents, results revealed Black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents were more likely to report wearing a mask in response to the coronavirus.

The aim of this study was to identify and characterise pulmonary sequelae caused by SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at 12-month from discharge. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective, observational study, patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and without prior diagnosis of structural lung diseases were stratified by maximum ventilatory support (oxygen only, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV)) and followed up at 12 months from discharge. Pulmonary function tests and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), 6 min walking test, high resolution CT (HRCT) scan, and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale were collected. RESULTS: Out of 287 patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and followed up at 1 year, DLCO impairment, mainly of mild entity and improved with respect to the 6-month follow-up, was observed more frequently in the oxygen only and IMV group (53% and 49% of patients, respectively), compared to 29% in the CPAP group. Abnormalities at chest HRCT were found in 46%, 65% and 80% of cases in the oxygen only, CPAP and IMV group, respectively. Non-fibrotic interstitial lung abnormalities, in particular reticulations and ground-glass attenuation, were the main finding, while honeycombing was found only in 1% of cases. Older patients and those requiring IMV were at higher risk of developing radiological pulmonary sequelae. Dyspnea evaluated through mMRC scale was reported by 35% of patients with no differences between groups, compared to 29% at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: DLCO alteration and non-fibrotic interstitial lung abnormalities are common after 1 year from hospitalization due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, particularly in older patients requiring higher ventilatory support.

We explored specific antibody seroprevalence of all employees at a single hospital in the epicentre of the outbreak, to identify areas of risk in nosocomial setting and to evaluate the usefulness of antibody testing. AIMS: Aim of this study was to explore SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a single hospital workers cohort. METHODS: All hospital workers were invited to fill in a questionnaire and undergo a blood test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, using two commercial tests (DiaSorin and Abbott). Seropositivity was determined overall and according to demographic and occupations characteristics, for both tests singly and combined. RESULTS: The study enrolled 1562 hospital workers (95% of the eligible population). Overall, 153 (9.8%) participants were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG on DiaSorin test, and 150 (9.6%) were positive on Abbott test; both tests were positive in 123 (7.9%) cases and at least one was positive in 180 (11.5%) cases. Factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity included: being a smoker, working in emergency or medicine departments, being a healthcare practitioner, self-reporting a relative with COVID-19 or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and having undergone a nasopharyngeal swab test. The tests were accurate in discriminating infected cases, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 using manufacturer-suggested cut-offs and 0.929 using optimised cut-offs. For discriminating symptomatic subjects, this value was 0.915 using optimised cut-offs. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 in this population of hospital workers was overall about 10%, with an excess prevalence in roles and departments associated with contacts with COVID-19 patients.","output":"Risk factors of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among hospital employees in Italy: a single-centre study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertension (HTN) is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) worldwide, affecting 1.39 billion people.

In this study, we combined the SIDARTHE model2, which predicts the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections, with a new data-based model that projects new cases onto casualties and healthcare system costs. Based on the Italian case study, we outline several scenarios: mass vaccination campaigns with different paces, different transmission rates due to new variants and different enforced countermeasures, including the alternation of opening and closure phases. Our results demonstrate that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have a higher effect on the epidemic evolution than vaccination alone, advocating for the need to keep NPIs in place during the first phase of the vaccination campaign. Our model predicts that, from April 2021 to January 2022, in a scenario with no vaccine rollout and weak NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 1.27), as many as 298,000 deaths associated with COVID-19 could occur. However, fast vaccination rollouts could reduce mortality to as few as 51,000 deaths. Implementation of restrictive NPIs ([Formula: see text] = 0.9) could reduce COVID-19 deaths to 30,000 without vaccinating the population and to 18,000 with a fast rollout of vaccines. We also show that, if intermittent open-close strategies are adopted, implementing a closing phase first could reduce deaths (from 47,000 to 27,000 with slow vaccine rollout) and healthcare system costs, without substantive aggravation of socioeconomic losses.","output":"Modeling vaccination rollouts, SARS-CoV-2 variants and the requirement for non-pharmaceutical interventions in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In a relatively short period of its existence, the new coronavirus has had a huge impact on the health care system and social infrastructure around the world.

According to recent studies, one of the main symptoms of COVID-19 is coughing. The goal of this research effort is to develop a method for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 by detecting cough during recorded conversations. The method is composed of five main modules: sound extraction, sound feature extraction, cough detection, cough classification, and COVID-19 diagnosis. The method extracts relevant features from the audio signal and then uses machine learning and deep learning models, like SVM, KNN, and RNN, to classify them, which can successfully diagnose COVID-19 from audio recordings. Our method has relatively high accuracy when dealing with completely unfamiliar cough samples. When the training set and the test set are from two different databases, it still achieves an accuracy of 81.25% (AUC of 0.79).

In our analysis of the mechanism of action, Antcin K inhibited the expression of three cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-], interleukin 1 beta [IL-1] and IL-8) in human RASFs; cytokines that are crucial to RA synovial inflammation. Notably, incubation of RASFs with Antcin K reduced the phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT) and nuclear factor-B (NF-B) signaling cascades, all of which promote cytokine production in RA. Intraperitoneal injections of Antcin K (10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg) attenuated paw swelling, cartilage degradation and bone erosion, and decreased serum levels of TNF-, IL-1, IL-8 in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice; in further experiments, IL-6 levels were similarly reduced.

The top 10 tweets from each topic cluster were content coded for three types of misinformation categories related to scientific authority: medical endorsements of hydroxychloroquine, scientific information used to support hydroxychloroquines use, and a comparison group that included scientific evidence opposing hydroxychloroquines use. Results show a much higher volume of tweets featuring medical endorsements and use of supportive scientific information compared to accurate and updated scientific evidence, that misinformation-related tweets propagated for a longer time frame, and the majority of hydroxychloroquine Twitter discourse expressed positive views about the drug. Metadata from Twitter accounts found that prominent users within misinformation discourse were more likely to have media or political affiliation and explicitly expressed support for President Trump.

OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the evidence-based and theory-informed development of the Tele-Active Rehabilitation (Tele-AR) intervention for pediatric concussion, which was specifically designed for remote service delivery. METHODS: The intervention was designed by clinician-researchers with experience in pediatric concussion rehabilitation following the Medical Research Council guidance for developing complex interventions. Development involved a critical review of the literature to identify existing evidence, the expansion of the theoretical basis for active rehabilitation, and the modeling of the intervention process and outcomes. RESULTS: Tele-AR is a 6-week home exercise and education and support program facilitated through weekly videoconferencing appointments with a clinician. Exercise consists of low- to moderate-intensity subsymptom threshold aerobic activity and coordination drills that are individualized to participant needs and interests (prescribed for 3 days per week). Education includes the evidence-supported Concussion & You self-management program, which covers topics related to energy management, nutrition, hydration, sleep hygiene, and return to activity. Elements of self-determination theory are incorporated to support motivation and engagement. We present a logic model describing predicted intervention effects using a biopsychosocial conceptualization of outcomes after concussion.

More than 20% of the affected patients cannot be offered radical resection because of comorbidity alone. The lung is also the second most common site of distant metastases of extrathoracic tumors; it is the only site of such metastases in 20% of cases. In recent years, image-guided thermoablation has been used with increasing frequency in patients who are unable to undergo surgery for medical reasons. METHODS The PubMed database was selectively searched for publications on the indications, complications, and results of the thermoablative techniques currently in clinical use, with special attention to radiofrequency ablation (RFA). RESULTS There is only a small evidence base to date concerning the treatment of malignant lung tumors with thermoablation. Retrospective and prospective case series have been published, but no randomized controlled trials have yet been conducted. RFA, the most common technique, involves the image-guided percutaneous placement of one or more probes in the tumor, to which thermal energy is then applied. For peripherally located tumors that measure less than 3 cm in diameter, local control of tumor growth can be achieved in about 90% of cases. The long-term results that are now available from smaller series provisionally indicate 5-year survival rates of 20% to 61%. The most common complication is pneumothorax requiring drainage, which occurs in about 10% of cases. In the intermediate term, thermoablation does not cause any clinically relevant loss of pulmonary function. CONCLUSION Image-guided thermoablation cannot now be considered an alternative to surgery for the treatment of malignant lung tumors with curative intent.

In women with weight gain, increase in BMI values was higher in patients (1.3  1 kg/m(2)) than controls (1.0  0.6 kg/m(2); p = 0.01). Among those who gained weight, delta BMI values showed positive correlations with delta sleep induction time (r = 0.25, p = 0.001), delta PSQI (r = 0.24, p = 0.004) and delta TFEQ-18 scores (r = 0.25, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Weight changes during social isolation are similar in women with PCOS and healthy women. However, within those who gain weight, increase in BMI is more pronounced in women with PCOS. Weight gain appears to be related to alterations in sleep quality and eating habits rather than reduced physical activity. LEVEL III: Evidence obtained from cohort or caseCcontrol analytic studies.","output":"Impact of social isolation during COVID-19 pandemic on health behaviors and weight management in women with polycystic ovary syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19, small and medium-sized enterprises have been greatly affected In order to cope with the difficulty of capital turnover for small and medium-sized enterprises, the government has successively introduced a series of financial policies to increase credit support and reduce financing costs The rapid development of technology has also prompted further innovations in the operating models of banks and other credit platforms However, banks and credit platforms must consider practical issues such as their own capital costs and risk assessment while they help small and medium-sized enterprises reduce financing costs This paper aims to study and design a credit risk assessment system based on big data technology and machine learning algorithms It is hoped that the system will enhance the bank's ability to identify the credit risks of small and medium-sized enterprises, so as to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for small and medium-sized enterprises At the same time, it will reduce the bank's own bad loan ratio and increase profit margins Achieving a win-win situation for small and medium-sized enterprises and banks, it's crucial to promote jointly the development of economy ? 2021 IEEE","output":"Research and Design of Credit Risk Assessment System Based on Big Data and Machine Learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE WORK: Worrying data indicate the urgency of strongly limiting Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAI). Therefore, according to the Theory of Planned Behavior, the psychosocial precursors of correct sanitation and sanitization were assessed. METHODS: An Italian sample of hospital health workers (nurses, healthcare assistants, cleaners; N=250), replied to a validated questionnaire measuring: a) knowledge of HAI; b) favorable attitude towards the correct sanitation and sanitization procedure; c) perception that the management and colleagues give importance to the government of infectious risk; d) perception of being able to implement risk management behaviors; e) perception of having received proper training for the prevention of HAI. RESULTS: The results show many mistakes about knowledge, the perception of insufficient specific training, and not always favorable attitude towards sanitation and sanitization practices. Workers also perceive that they can act the required behaviors and that the management of infectious risk represents a value in the group they belong to, but they believe that the management does not offer sufficient support. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement of the factors considered (knowledge, personal attitudes, actions of management and colleagues, perception of being able to implement the required behaviors) is affected by proper training.

However, true incidence of thromboembolic events is difficult to determine in the ICU setting. The aim of our study was to investigate the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission and assessing the utility of point of care ultrasound (POCUS) to screen for and diagnose lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT). METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study between April 22nd and May 26th, 2020 where all adult patients with the diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia admitted to 8 ICUs of Montefiore Medical Center were included. POCUS exam was performed on all patients at day 1 of ICU admission and at day 7 and 14 after the first exam. RESULTS: The primary outcome was to study the cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events in Covid-19 patients needing ICU admission. A total of 107 patients were included. All patients got POCUS exam on day 1 in the ICU, 62% got day 7 and 41% got day 14 exam. POCUS diagnosed 17 lower extremity DVTs on day 1, 3 new on day 7 and 1 new on day 14. Forty patients developed 52 thromboembolic events, with the rate of 37.3%. We found a high 45-day cumulative incidence of thromboembolic events of 37% and a high 45-day cumulative incidence of lower and upper extremity DVT of 21% and 10% respectively. Twelve (30%) patients had failure of therapeutic anticoagulation. Occurrence of a thromboembolic event was not associated with a higher risk of mortality (HR 1.08, p value = .81).

The secondary aim was to quantify the impact of misclassification error bias on publicly reported case data in Maryland. Methods: Using a stratified random sampling approach, 50,000 individuals were selected from a simulated Maryland population to estimate the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Data from the 2014-2018 and 2018 American Community Surveys were used. The simulated prevalence was 0.5% and 1.0% for active and past COVID-19, respectively. Bayesian models, informed by published validity estimates, were used to account for misclassification error when estimating the prevalence of active and past COVID-19. Results: Failure to account for misclassification error overestimated the simulated prevalence for active and past COVID-19. Adjustment for misclassification error decreased the point estimate for active and past COVID-10 prevalence by 55% and 29%, respectively. Adjustment for sampling method and misclassification error only captured the simulated past COVID-19 prevalence. The simulated active COVID-19 prevalence was only captured when set to 0.7% and above. Adjustment for misclassification error for publicly reported Maryland data increased the estimated average daily cases by 8%. Conclusions: Random sampling and testing of COVID-19 is needed but must be accompanied by adjustment for misclassification error to avoid over- or underestimating the prevalence. This approach bolsters disease control efforts.

In addition, the effect of nasal strip on the prevention of discomfort in breathing with mask was also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was carried out with 48 HCWs (Control Group-CG, n = 20; Experimental Group 1-EG1, n = 20; Experimental Group 2-EG2, n = 8) who use PPE on the face region and work with COVID-19 patients. Data was collected with Data Collection Form developed by researchers. In participants in CG, normal procedures of the institution in using PPE were followed. In EG1, prophylactic dressing was used on risky areas on the face. In EG2, nasal strip sticky on one side was used in addition to prophylactic dressing. The evaluation of the facial skin was made once a day by a researcher with expertise in wound management. RESULTS: Groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics of participants. Overall rate of skin injuries associated with PPE use was 47.9%. Skin injuries developed in all participants in CG (n = 20), and in two and one participants in EG1 and EG2 respectively, with significant difference between groups. The most common skin injuries were Stage 1 pressure injury (29.2%), blanchable erythema of intact skin (27.1%) and itching (18.8%). No participant in EG2 reported discomfort in breathing (n = 8). Significant difference was found between groups in favor of EG2 in terms of experiencing discomfort in breathing (p < 0.001).

Increased patient access to medical information and education has elicited interest in minimally invasive surgical techniques that obtain improved surgical outcomes and cosmesis. Because of these factors, there is a growing interest in single-incision surgery. Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) single-incision hernia repair technique has been reported with different meshes used in a tack fixation system. Recently, self-fixating mesh technology has offered the possibility of avoiding tack fixation and potentially avoiding chronic postoperative pain. Self-fixating mesh technology employs monofilament polylactic acid (PLA) creating a microgrip system that provides self-adherence of the mesh to adjacent tissue. This tack-free fixation system provides coverage over the entire myopectineal orifice and surrounding areas where traditional tacks cannot be placed. Self-fixating mesh has also been safely applied in laparoscopic TEP procedures, but this mesh has not been described in single site TEP surgery; possibly because of the potential difficulty with mesh deployment. We sought to determine the technical feasibility of a single-site laparoscopic TEP repair of inguinal hernias and to discuss our techniques and patient short-term outcomes. METHODS Review of a prospectively maintained database of patients who received single-site laparoscopic TEP herniorrhaphy from August 2012 through August 2015. Patient characteristics and demographics and perioperative and postoperative data were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (aged 55.2 14.2; 17.6% women) with a mean body mass index of 26.2  3.9 were analyzed. Mean operative time was 99.5  30.5 minutes, 41.2% were left-side repairs, and 50% were bilateral. Estimated blood loss was 18.4  14.1 mL. Recurrent hernias accounted for 14.7% of cases; 32.4% of cases were combination surgeries, most commonly a concurrent umbilical hernia repair. The most common short-term postoperative complication was urinary retention (4 patients). The median length of follow-up was 25 days (IQR 18.75-61.75). Complications occurring at >30 days included hydrocele (2 patients) and stitch abscess (1 patient). Eight (23.5%) patients had complications (surgical or during follow-up). No recurrences or deaths were reported.

Thus, it is necessary to develop a universal approach to halt the spread of new and unknown viruses as they are discovered. One such promising approach is to target lipid membranes, which are common to all viruses and bacteria. The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has reaffirmed the importance of interactions between the virus envelope and the host cell plasma membrane as a critical mechanism of infection. Metadichol?, a nanolipid emulsion of long-chain alcohols, has been demonstrated as a strong candidate that inhibits the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. Naturally derived substances, such as long-chain saturated lipid alcohols, reduce viral infectivity, including that of coronaviruses (such as SARS-CoV-2) by modifying their lipid-dependent attachment mechanism to human host cells. The receptor ACE2 mediates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells, whereas the serine protease TMPRSS2 primes the viral S protein. In this study, Metadichol? was found to be 270 times more potent an inhibitor of TMPRSS2 (EC(50) = 96 ng/mL) than camostat mesylate (EC(50) = 26000 ng/mL). Additionally, it inhibits ACE with an EC(50) of 71 ng/mL, but it is a very weak inhibitor of ACE2 at an EC(50) of 31 g/mL. Furthermore, the live viral assay performed in Caco-2 cells revealed that Metadichol? inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication at an EC(90) of 0.16 g/mL. Moreover, Metadichol? had an EC(90) of 0.00037 M, making it 2081 and 3371 times more potent than remdesivir (EC(50) = 0.77 M) and chloroquine (EC(50) = 1.14 M), respectively.","output":"Metadichol?: A Novel Nanolipid Formulation That Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and a Multitude of Pathological Viruses In Vitro"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study used digital polymerase chain reaction (dPCR) to determine whether envelope (E) gene-negative and nucleocapsid (N2) gene-positive (E-N+) results obtained with the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay are reliable.

Distance learning requires self-motivation and does not give you direct access to your instructor. Some students fear the loss of human contact with an instructor - like asking questions during and after class - which promotes learning, understanding and communication. Moreover, classical distance learning methods do not offer immediate feedback that can help students in their understanding of the lecture. In this context, interactive pedagogic tools (IPT) could be useful for medical education continuity and for maintaining human contact necessary in pedagogy. We briefly evaluated interactive pedagogic tool compared to traditionnal distancial tools on medical students.

We used data from 2392 women without a history of breast cancer enrolled in the Boston Mammography Cohort Study (BMCS) to investigate whether subgroups defined by age, race, or family history of breast cancer: 1) experienced greater declines in screening or diagnostic imaging during the lockdown;or 2) had slower rebound during reopening. In this interrupted time series analysis, we used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to model expected monthly rates of breast cancer screening and diagnostic imaging from January 2019 through December 2020. We defined the pre-COVID-19 period as January 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020;the lockdown period as March 1 to May 30, 2020;and the reopening period as June 1 to December 31, 2020. We examined changes in trends overall and tested for the difference in trends by age (<50 vs 50), race (white vs non-white), and first-degree family history of breast cancer (yes or no). The mean monthly rate of breast cancer screening in the BMCS cohort was 45 per 1000 people during the pre-COVID-19 period, 7 per 1000 people during the lockdown period, and 50 per 1000 people during the reopening period. The mean monthly rate of breast cancer diagnostic imaging was 6 per 1000 people during the pre-COVID-19 period, 3 per 1000 people during the lockdown period, and 6 per 1000 people during the reopening period. During the pre-COVID-19 period, those who are age 50 or older had 5.3% higher monthly trend in breast cancer screening rates (p=0.005) and 9.8% higher monthly trend in diagnostic imaging rates (p=0.0389). During the lockdown period, those who were age 50 or older had a lower monthly trend in breast cancer screening rates compared to those who were younger than 50 (p<0.0001), while those who were white and those with family history have higher monthly trends of breast cancer screening rates compared to their respective counterparts (p<0.0001). During the reopening phase, those who are age 50 or older have 18.5% lower monthly trend in breast cancer screening rates in comparison to those who are younger than 50 (p=0.0008) and those who were white have 36.2% higher monthly trend in breast cancer diagnostic procedure rates in comparison to those who are non-white (p=0.018). Overall, we observed a significant decline in breast cancer screening rates with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the most part, screening and diagnostic imaging rates during the reopening phase equaled or exceeded those of the pre-COVID-19 period. However, the rate of return to screening was lower in women age 50 or older and the rebound in diagnostic imaging was lower in nonwhite women. Careful attention must be paid as the COVID-19 recovery continues to ensure equitable resumption of care.

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an enteropathgenic coronavirus and causes high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets. Here, we demonstrated that microRNA-27b-3p (miR-27b-3p) suppressed TGEV replication by directly targeting porcine suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS6), while TGEV infection downregulated miR-27b-3p expression in swine testicular (ST) cells and in piglets. Mechanistically, the decrease of miR-27b-3p expression during TGEV infection was mediated by the activated inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) pathway of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Further studies showed that when ER stress was induced by TGEV, IRE1 acted as an RNase activated by autophosphorylation and unconventionally spliced mRNA encoding a potent transcription factor, X-box-binding protein 1 (Xbp1s). Xbp1s inhibited the transcription of miR-27 and ultimately reduced the production of miR-27b-3p. Therefore, our findings indicate that TGEV inhibits the expression of an anti-coronavirus microRNA through the IRE1 pathway and suggest a novel way in which coronavirus regulates the host cell response to infection.

The clinical performance of two isothermal amplification-based tests (Atila Biosystems iAMP coronavirus disease of 2019 [COVID-19] detection test and OptiGene COVID-19 direct plus RT-loop-mediated isothermal amplification [LAMP] test) was compared with that of clinical RT-PCR assays using different sampling strategies. A total of 1,378 participants were tested across 4 study sites. Compared with standard of care RT-PCR testing, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the Atila iAMP test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 76.2% and 94.9%, respectively, and increased to 88.8% and 89.5%, respectively, after exclusion of an outlier study site. Sensitivity varied based on the anatomic site from which the sample was collected. Sensitivity for nasopharyngeal sampling was 65.4% (range across study sites, 52.8% to 79.8%), for midturbinate was 88.2%, for saliva was 55.1% (range across study sites, 42.9% to 77.8%), and for anterior nares was 66.7% (range across study sites, 63.6% to 76.5%). The specificity for these anatomic collection sites ranged from 96.7% to 100%. Sensitivity improved in symptomatic patients (overall, 82.7%) and those with a higher viral load (overall, 92.4% for cycle threshold [C(T)] of 25). Sensitivity and specificity of the OptiGene direct plus RT-LAMP test, which was conducted at a single study site, were 25.5% and 100%, respectively. The Atila iAMP COVID test with midturbinate sampling is a rapid, low-cost assay for detecting SARS-CoV-2, especially in symptomatic patients and those with a high viral load, and could be used to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in clinical settings. Variation of performance between study sites highlights the need for site-specific clinical validation of these assays before clinical adoption. IMPORTANCE Numerous SARS-CoV-2 detection assays have been developed and introduced into the market under emergency use authorizations (EUAs). EUAs are granted primarily based on small studies of analytic sensitivity and specificity with limited clinical validations. A thorough clinical performance evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 assays is important to understand the strengths, limitations, and specific applications of these assays. In this first large-scale multicentric study, we evaluated the clinical performance and operational characteristics of two isothermal amplification-based SARS-CoV-2 tests, namely, (i) iAMP COVID-19 detection test (Atila BioSystems, USA) and (ii) COVID-19 direct plus RT-LAMP test (OptiGene Ltd., UK), compared with those of clinical RT-PCR tests using different sampling strategies (i.e., nasopharyngeal, self-sampled anterior nares, self-sampled midturbinate, and saliva). An important specific use for these isothermal amplification-based, rapid, low-cost, and easy-to-perform SARS-CoV-2 assays is to allow for a safer return to preventive clinical encounters, such as cancer screening, particularly in low- and middle-income countries that have low SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rates.","output":"Multisite Clinical Validation of Isothermal Amplification-Based SARS-CoV-2 Detection Assays Using Different Sampling Strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has mandated significant isolation measures.

Here, we report immediate impacts of changes in human activities on wildlife and environmental threats during the early lockdown months of 2020, based on 877 qualitative reports and 332 quantitative assessments from 89 different studies. Hundreds of reports of unusual species observations from around the world suggest that animals quickly responded to the reductions in human presence. However, negative effects of lockdown on conservation also emerged, as confinement resulted in some park officials being unable to perform conservation, restoration and enforcement tasks, resulting in local increases in illegal activities such as hunting. Overall, there is a complex mixture of positive and negative effects of the pandemic lockdown on nature, all of which have the potential to lead to cascading responses which in turn impact wildlife and nature conservation. While the net effect of the lockdown will need to be assessed over years as data becomes available and persistent effects emerge, immediate responses were detected across the world. Thus initial qualitative and quantitative data arising from this serendipitous global quasi-experimental perturbation highlights the dual role that humans play in threatening and protecting species and ecosystems.

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid essential for basic cellular functions, causes unfavorable outcomes during stroke progression. LPA-producing enzyme autotaxin (ATX) is regulated in ischemic stroke. We used an electrical cell-substrate impedance sensor (ECIS) to measure endothelial permeability. Mitochondrial bioenergetics were obtained using a Seahorse analyzer. AR-2 probe fluorescence assay was used to measure ATX activity. LPA increased endothelial permeability and reduced junctional protein expression in mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC). LPA receptor inhibitors Ki16425 and AM095 attenuated the LPA-induced changes in the endothelial permeability and junctional proteins. LPA significantly diminished mitochondrial function in MBMEC. ATX was upregulated (p < 0.05) in brain microvascular endothelial cells under hypoxic reperfusion. ATX activity and permeability were attenuated with the use of an ATX inhibitor in a mouse stroke model. The upregulation of ATX with hypoxic reperfusion leads to LPA production in brain endothelial cells favoring permeability.

We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the utility of using a time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics sequence in the diagnosis, characterization, and localization of spinal vascular malformations, comparing it with the criterion standard of spinal DSA. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-five consecutive patients with a suspected diagnosis of spinal vascular malformation underwent time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics followed by spinal DSA. All scans were performed on a 1.5T scanner by using a standard 8-channel spine coil and were reported by a neuroradiologist before the DSA was performed. RESULTS Forty-seven lesions were confirmed on time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics and classified as spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (n = 33, with 1 patient having a type Ib fistula), perimedullary spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas (n = 10), and intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (n = 3). One patient had an extradural spinal vascular malformation. Time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics identified the location of the arterial feeder to within 1 vertebral level in 27/33 patients (81.8%) with spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas and correctly predicted the side in 22/33 (66.6%) patients. Perimedullary spinal cord arteriovenous fistulas were erroneously considered to represent spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas before spinal DSA. The anatomy of the arterial supply to intramedullary arteriovenous malformations was also poorly characterized on time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography. CONCLUSIONS It has been our experience that time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics is a useful confirmatory tool when a spinal vascular malformation is suspected on the basis of clinical and conventional MR imaging findings. As experience with the technique grows and sequences are refined, it may be possible to rely on time-resolved imaging of contrast kinetics as a screening tool for the diagnosis of spinal vascular malformations.","output":"Time-resolved contrast-enhanced MR angiography of spinal vascular malformations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aims to statistically assess the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2.

We created three vulnerability indices to identify areas and people who require greater support while elucidating health inequities to inform emergency response in Kenya. METHODS: Geospatial indicators were assembled to create three vulnerability indices; Social VulnerabilityIndex (SVI), Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (EVI) and a composite of the two, that is, Social Epidemiological Vulnerability Index (SEVI) resolved at 295 subcounties in Kenya. SVI included 19 indicators that affect the spread of disease; socioeconomic deprivation, access to services and population dynamics, whereas EVI comprised 5 indicators describing comorbidities associated with COVID-19 severe disease progression. The indicators were scaled to a common measurement scale, spatially overlaid via arithmetic mean and equally weighted. The indices were classified into seven classes, 1-2 denoted low vulnerability and 6-7, high vulnerability. The population within vulnerabilities classes was quantified. RESULTS: The spatial variation of each index was heterogeneous across Kenya. Forty-nine northwestern and partly eastern subcounties (6.9 million people) were highly vulnerable, whereas 58 subcounties (9.7 million people) in western and central Kenya were the least vulnerable for SVI. For EVI, 48 subcounties (7.2 million people) in central and the adjacent areas and 81 subcounties (13.2 million people) in northern Kenya were the most and least vulnerable, respectively. Overall (SEVI), 46 subcounties (7.0 million people) around central and southeastern were more vulnerable, whereas 81 subcounties (14.4 million people) were least vulnerable. CONCLUSION: The vulnerability indices created are tools relevant to the county, national government and stakeholders for prioritisation and improved planning.

We leveraged public and surveillance M. tuberculosis (Mtb) whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, to generate more comprehensive country-level resistance prevalence estimates (antibiograms) using in silico resistance prediction. Methods: We curated and quality-controlled Mtb WGS data. We used a validated random forest model to predict phenotypic resistance to twelve drugs and bias-corrected for model performance, outbreak sampling, and resistance oversampling. We validated our estimates using a national DR survey conducted in South Africa. Results: Mtb isolates from 29 countries (n=19,149) met sequence quality criteria. Marginal genotypic resistance estimates overlapped with the South African DR survey for all drugs except isoniazid and second-line injectables that were underestimated (n=3,134); among multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, estimates overlapped for pyrazinamide and the fluoroquinolones. Globally, mono-resistance to isoniazid was estimated at 10.9% (95% CI: 10.2-11.7%, n = 14,012. Mono-levofloxacin resistance rates were highest in South Asia (Pakistan 3.4% [0.1-11%], n=111 and India 2.8% [0.08-9.4%], n=114). Rates of resistance discordance between isoniazid and ethionamide were high with 74.4% (IQR: 64.5-79.7%) of isoniazid resistant isolates predicted to be ethionamide susceptible.

DR prevalence in Mtb can be reliably estimated using public WGS and phenotypic resistance prediction for key antibiotics.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study surveying first year medical students assigned to four different Swiss medical education tracks with distinctive additional education focuses (ETH Zurich: medical technology and engineering, University of St. Gallen and University of Lucerne: primary healthcare and University of Zurich: no distinctive focus). RESULTS: We surveyed 354 medical students (response rate across all included medical education tracks 71.1%), 64.8% female, mean age 20 years. Regarding career openness, we found that 52.8% of medical students had neither a strong commitment nor a strong reservation for any of the proposed career options and 17.0% had a strong commitment. Among medical disciplines, medical subspecialties were attractive to the largest part of students (inpatient subspecialties attractive for 71%, outpatient for 58%), attractiveness of general practice was moderate (30%), academic (22%) and industrial sector (17%) careers were least attractive. Proportions of medical students attracted to general practice were similar at medical education tracks with focus on primary healthcare compared to other medical education tracks (32.2% vs. 25.8%, p = 0.391). Conversely, proportions of medical students attracted to academic or industry careers were significantly higher at the ETH Zurich compared to other medical education tracks (37.2%, vs. 13.1%, p < 0.001 and 31.9%, vs. 8.8%, p < 0.001 respectively).

These enzymes are cytidine deaminases which transform cytosine into uracil. They preferentially mutate cytidine preceded by thymidine making the 5TC motif their favored target. Viruses have evolved different strategies to evade APOBEC3 restriction. Certain viruses actively encode viral proteins antagonizing the APOBEC3s, others passively face the APOBEC3 selection pressure thanks to a depleted genome for APOBEC3-targeted motifs. Hence, the APOBEC3s left on the genome of certain viruses an evolutionary footprint. The aim of our study is the identification of these viruses having a genome shaped by the APOBEC3s. We analyzed the genome of 33,400 human viruses for the depletion of APOBEC3-favored motifs. We demonstrate that the APOBEC3 selection pressure impacts at least 22% of all currently annotated human viral species. The papillomaviridae and polyomaviridae are the most intensively footprinted families; evidencing a selection pressure acting genome-wide and on both strands. Members of the parvoviridae family are differentially targeted in term of both magnitude and localization of the footprint. Interestingly, a massive APOBEC3 footprint is present on both strands of the B19 erythroparvovirus; making this viral genome one of the most cleaned sequences for APOBEC3-favored motifs. We also identified the endemic coronaviridae as significantly footprinted. Interestingly, no such footprint has been detected on the zoonotic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. In addition to viruses that are footprinted genome-wide, certain viruses are footprinted only on very short sections of their genome. That is the case for the gamma-herpesviridae and adenoviridae where the footprint is localized on the lytic origins of replication. A mild footprint can also be detected on the negative strand of the reverse transcribing HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV-1 and HBV viruses.

Methods: In this pilot study, sebum samples were collected from 67 hospitalised patients (30 COVID-19 positive and 37 COVID-19 negative) by gauze swab. Lipidomics analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, identifying 998 reproducible features. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to the resulting feature set. Findings: Lipid levels were depressed in COVID-19 positive participants, indicative of dyslipidemia; p-values of 0022 and 0015 were obtained for triglycerides and ceramides respectively, with effect sizes of 044 and 057.

METHODS: The MVP COVID-19 Survey was developed to collect COVID-19 specific elements including symptoms, diagnosis, hospitalization, behavioral and psychosocial factors and to augment existing MVP data with longitudinal collection of key domains in physical and mental health. Due to the rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, a multipronged strategy was implemented to widely disseminate the COVID-19 Survey and capture data using both the online platform and mailings. RESULTS: We limited the findings of this paper to the initial phase of survey dissemination which began in May 2020. A total of 729,625 eligible MVP Veterans were invited to complete version 1 of the COVID-19 Survey. As of October 31, 2020, 58,159 surveys have been returned. The mean and standard deviation (SD) age of responders was 71 (11) years, 8.6% were female, 8.2% were Black, 5.6% were Hispanic, and 446 (0.8%) self-reported a COVID-19 diagnosis. Over 90% of responders reported wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequent hand washing. CONCLUSION: The MVP COVID-19 Survey provides a systematic collection of data regarding COVID-19 behaviors among Veterans and represents one of the first large-scale, national surveillance efforts of COVID-19 in the Veteran population.

Because no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines are available to treat COVID-19, early diagnostics, isolation, and prevention are crucial for containing the outbreak. Molecular diagnostics using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are the current gold standard for detection. However, viral RNAs are much less stable during transport and storage than proteins such as antigens and antibodies. Consequently, false-negative RT-PCR results can occur due to inadequate collection of clinical specimens or poor handling of a specimen during testing. Although antigen immunoassays are stable diagnostics for detection of past infection, infection progress, and transmission dynamics, no matched antibody pair for immunoassay of SARS-CoV-2 antigens has yet been reported. In this study, we designed and developed a novel rapid detection method for SARS-CoV-2 spike 1 (S1) protein using the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, which can form matched pairs with commercially available antibodies. ACE2 and S1-mAb were paired with each other for capture and detection in a lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) that did not cross-react with SARS-CoV Spike 1 or MERS-CoV Spike 1 protein. The SARS-CoV-2 S1 (<5 ng of recombinant proteins/reaction) was detected by the ACE2-based LFIA. The limit of detection of our ACE2-LFIA was 1.86  105 copies/mL in the clinical specimen of COVID-19 Patients without no cross-reactivity for nasal swabs from healthy subjects.

The purpose of the service is to assist recovery after hospital discharges or other sudden changes in a patients functional level. The service is often provided by a team of nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. The purpose of this paper is to compare users of this service to users who receive traditional home care services. Outcomes to be measured are risk of long-term care and mortality. METHODS: All users of health and care services in a Norwegian municipality were eligible for inclusion. Data was extracted from the local user administrative database. Users were divided in two groups: those who received reablement and those home care users who did not receive reablement service. Propensity score matching was used to match users based on age, sex, and level of functioning in activities of daily living (ADL). Survival analysis was deployed to test if the reablement users had different risk of becoming long-term care users, and whether the mortality rate differed for this group. RESULTS: 153 reablement users were included in the study. These were matched to 153 non-reablement home care users. The groups had similar distributions of age, sex, and level of functioning when starting their service trajectories. Regressions showed that reablement users had lower risk of using long-term care services in the study period (time at risk up to 4 years), and lower mortality. However, none of these estimates were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that the reablement users in one municipality had lower use of long -term care and lower mortality when properly estimated, but numbers were too small for statistical significance to be found.

METHODS For this descriptive study, retrospective data of the first COVID-19 wave in an interdisciplinary adult ICU of a Swiss University hospital was used. The study included data regarding healthcare staffing and COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome was the ICU mortality in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS Patients median age was 61 years (range 32C86), simplified acute physiology score (SAPS-II) was 46 (13C90), 81% of the patients were males, 79% were mechanically ventilated (3 of them on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation), 31% were under renal replacement therapy and 21% received steroids. All patients were fully anticoagulated from the time of admission. No off-label experimental antiviral or anti-inflammatory drugs were used with the exception of one patient, and antibiotic prescription was restrictive. Nurse-to-patient ratio was 1:1 during all shifts, and the physician-to-patient ratio was 1:4 (day shift) and 1:10 (night shift).

The on-going pandemic has seen many critically-ill COVID-19 with ARDS, yet the incidence of excessive sedation and its association to delirium in these patients has to date not been assessed. We aimed at comparing the incidence and outcome of excessive sedation and delirium in two cohorts of critically-ill patients. Methods: : This was an international, dual center retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from two cohorts of critically ill patients, with and without COVID-19 disease, pertaining to two different hospital settings. Depth of sedation was monitored through processed EEG and delirium through the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU(CAM-ICU). The main outcomes were the incidence of excessive sedation and delirium between the two cohorts, and secondary outcomes were length of ICU and hospital stay and mechanical ventilation duration. Results: : Fifty-seven non -COVID-19 and 21 COVID-19 patients were included, 38(49%) of whom had ARDS. Twenty-seven(47.3%) non -COVID-19 and 11(52.3%) COVID-19 patients fulfilled the criteria for excessive sedation. Excessively sedated patients were older(p=0.034) and had delirium more frequently(p<0.001). There was a trend in excessive sedation in ARDS patients, while there was no correlation between excessive sedation and COVID-19 diagnosis. COVID-19 with ARDS was related to delirium at the limit of significance. On adjusted analysis excessive sedation was independently related to delirium(p=0.008). Patients with delirium had longer MV duration, ICU-LOS and H-LOS. In the adjusted analysis, delirium was an independent predictor of ICU-LOS(p=0.005) and MV duration(p=0.039).

Newly developed evaluation methods, the overall filter quality (q(f,o)) and the q(f) ratio were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of decontamination methods for respirators. A scanning mobility particle sizer is utilized to measure the concentration of polydispersed particles with diameter 14.6C594 nm. The penetration of particles and pressure drop (p) through the mask are used to determine q(f) and q(f,o). Experimental results reveal that the most penetrating particle size (MPS) for the pre-decontaminated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 279 nm, respectively, and the respective penetration rates were 2.6%, 23.2% and 70.0%. The p through the pretreated N95 masks was 9.2 mm H(2)O at the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers, exceeding the p values obtained through Gauze and Spunlace masks. Decontamination increased the sizes of the most penetrating particles, changing the q(f) values of all of the masks: q(f) fell as particle size increased because the penetration increased. Bleach increased the p of N95, but destroyed the Gauze mask. However, the use of an autoclave reduces the p values of both the N95 and the Gauze mask. Neither the rice cooker nor ethanol altered the p of the Gauze mask. Chemical decontamination methods reduced the q(f,o) values for the three electret masks. The value of q(f,o) for PM(0.1) exceeded that for PM(0.1C0.6), because particles smaller than 100 nm had lower penetration, resulting in a better q(f) for a given pressure drop. The values of q(f,o), particularly for PM(0.1), reveal that for the tested treatments and masks, physical decontamination methods are less destructive to the filter than chemical methods. Nevertheless, when purchasing new or reusing FFRs, penetration should be regarded as the priority.","output":"Filter quality of electret masks in filtering 14.6C594 nm aerosol particles: Effects of five decontamination methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective The Solitaire Platinum 440 mm stent retriever contains radiopaque markers with a long length. We evaluated the effect of Solitaire Platinum 440 mm stent retriever in Solumbra technique thrombectomy, and compared it with shorter Solitaire stent retrievers. Methods A total of 70 patients who underwent Solumbra technique thrombectomy with equal diameter (4 mm) and different length (40 vs. 20 mm) Solitaire stent retrievers were divided into two groups : the Solitaire Platinum 440 mm stent (440) group and the Solitaire FR 420 mm stent or Solitaire Platinum 420 mm stent (420) group. The clinical outcomes, Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score, the first pass reperfusion status, and complications were evaluated and compared between the two groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive factors for reperfusion and complete reperfusion from the first pass. Results Higher first-pass reperfusion and complete reperfusion were achieved in the 440 group (68.0% and 48.0%) than in the 420 group (46.7% and 33.3%; p=0.004 and 0.007, respectively).

The Covid-19 pandemic raises the question of how a country susceptible to political manipulation and external economic shocks can balance the populations health with the mantra of peace, stability, and economic growth. While the government put much effort into protecting the health of the population and curbing the spread of Covid-19, it was primarily inclined toward maintaining the economy and enforcing peace and stability.

Although there is a large literature examining the relationship between a wide range of political economy exposures and health outcomes, the extent to which the different aspects of political economy influence health, and through which mechanisms and in what contexts, is only partially understood. The areas in which there are few high-quality studies are also unclear. Objectives. To systematically review the literature describing the impact of political economy on population health. Search Methods. We undertook a systematic review of reviews, searching MEDLINE, Embase, International Bibliography of the Social Sciences, ProQuest Public Health, Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, EconLit, SocINDEX, Web of Science, and the gray literature via Google Scholar. Selection Criteria. We included studies that were a review of the literature. Relevant exposures were differences or changes in policy, law, or rules; economic conditions; institutions or social structures; or politics, power, or conflict. Relevant outcomes were any overall measure of population health such as self-assessed health, mortality, life expectancy, survival, morbidity, well-being, illness, ill health, and life span. Two authors independently reviewed all citations for relevance. Data Collection and Analysis. We undertook critical appraisal of all included reviews by using modified Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria and then synthesized narratively giving greater weight to the higher-quality reviews. Main Results. From 4912 citations, we included 58 reviews. Both the quality of the reviews and the underlying studies within the reviews were variable. Social democratic welfare states, higher public spending, fair trade policies, extensions to compulsory education provision, microfinance initiatives in low-income countries, health and safety policy, improved access to health care, and high-quality affordable housing have positive impacts on population health. Neoliberal restructuring seems to be associated with increased health inequalities and higher income inequality with lower self-rated health and higher mortality. Authors' Conclusions. Politics, economics, and public policy are important determinants of population health. Countries with social democratic regimes, higher public spending, and lower income inequalities have populations with better health. There are substantial gaps in the synthesized evidence on the relationship between political economy and health, and there is a need for higher-quality reviews and empirical studies in this area. However, there is sufficient evidence in this review, if applied through policy and practice, to have marked beneficial health impacts. Public Health Implications. Policymakers should be aware that social democratic welfare state types, countries that spend more on public services, and countries with lower income inequalities have better self-rated health and lower mortality. Research funders and researchers should be aware that there remain substantial gaps in the available evidence base. One such area concerns the interrelationship between governance, polities, power, macroeconomic policy, public policy, and population health, including how these aspects of political economy generate social class processes and forms of discrimination that have a differential impact across social groups. This includes the influence of patterns of ownership (of land and capital) and tax policies. For some areas, there are many lower-quality reviews, which leave uncertainties in the relationship between political economy and population health, and a high-quality review is needed. There are also areas in which the available reviews have identified primary research gaps such as the impact of changes to housing policy, availability, and tenure.","output":"Impact of Political Economy on Population Health: A Systematic Review of Reviews."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) following coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is rarely reported in the literature.

The aim of this review is to analyze the information available up to date on the course of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD), the frequency of complications in these patients, the effectiveness and side effects of vaccination against COVID-19. Various studies in Europe and the United States have found that the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with ARD is similar to that in the general population. Negative prognostic factors are thought to be old age, comorbidity, moderate/high ARD activity, and corticosteroid (CS) intake at doses > 10 mg/day. Patients with systemic ARD are considered to be at higher risk of thromboembolic events due to chronic inflammation and/or the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome, as well as the nature of COVID-19 - an endothelial lesion causing thrombosis and microangiopathy. It is observed a higher risk of severe pneumonia in patients treated with Rituximab, as well as an increase in hospitalizations and deaths amongst them. The opposite trend is observed in patients treated with anti-TNF. With the development of vaccines against COVID-19, questions arise about their effectiveness in patients with ARD, as well as the frequency of complications associated with them. In these studies, slightly lower levels of neutralizing antibodies were observed in patients with ARD compared to the general population, most commonly associated with Methotrexate or targeted synthetic DMARDs. The most common side effects seen in these patients after vaccination are pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache. Complaints of the musculoskeletal system are more common in patients with ARD than in the general population.

Here we report the development and validation of a real-time RT-PCR specific for PRRSGard? , a newly available commercial PRRSV-2 MLV vaccine. Analytical specificity, sensitivity, and diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR were evaluated and compared to a commercial PRRSV screening PCR (reference PCR). PRRSGard and reference PCRs did not cross-react with any of the 27 non-PRRSV swine pathogens. PRRSGard PCR did not cross-react with other PRRSV-2 vaccine viruses and 31 laboratory and field PRRSV-2 isolates representing various genetic lineages of PRRSV-2. PRRSGard and reference PCRs consistently detected up to 10-6 and 10-5 dilutions of PRRSGard vaccine virus, respectively. Based on testing serial dilutions of in vitro transcribed RNA, the 95% limit of detection of PRRSGard PCR was 16 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 36 and 7 genomic copies/reaction with CT cut-off value of 37. Diagnostic performance of PRRSGard PCR was evaluated using 846 clinical samples (684 serum and 162 oral fluid samples).

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in the area and position of Uphold Lite? mesh 6 weeks and 12 months after anterior and/or apical prolapse repair. METHODS This observational prospective multicenter study included patients who had undergone transvaginal surgery for symptomatic POP-Q stage  II anterior and/or apical compartment prolapse with placement of Uphold Lite mesh. The dimensions and position of the mesh were evaluated at 6 weeks and 12 months by ultrasonography. Correlations between ultrasonographic mesh characteristics and POP recurrence were analyzed. RESULTS Fifty evaluable women with an average age of 66.8 years were included. No statistically significant difference in mesh area was found between week 6 and month 12 postoperatively, either at rest (1746.92 vs. 1574.48 mm2; p = 0.15) or on Valsalva (1568.81 vs. 1542.98 mm2; p = 0.65). The ROC-AUC of the distance between the mesh and the bladder neck (M-BN) at 6 weeks for predicting cystocele recurrence at 12 months was 0.764 (95% CI 0.573-0.955) at rest and 0.724 (95% CI 0.533-0.916) on Valsalva.

Nasal and throat respiratory specimens were obtained from enrolled children and tested for viruses using a real-time reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. AdV-positive specimens were typed by partial hexon gene sequencing. Demographic and clinical features were compared between AdV detected as single pathogen versus co-detected with other respiratory viruses, and between AdV-B and AdV-C species. RESULTS AdV was detected in 475/3168 (15%) children hospitalized with ARI; of these, 216 (45%) specimens were successfully typed with AdV-C as the most common species detected (140/216; 65%). Children with AdV-single detection (88/475; 19%) had a higher frequency of fever (71% vs. 56%; P=0.015), diarrhea (18% vs. 11%; p=0.048), and/or seizures/abnormal movements (14% vs. 5%; p=0.003).

Nucleotide diversity within species is low in cichlids, with 92% of surveyed populations having less diversity than the median value found in other vertebrates. Divergence within radiations is also low, and a large proportion of variation is shared among species due to incomplete lineage sorting and widespread hybridization. Population genetics therefore provides a suitable conceptual framework for evolutionary genomic studies of cichlid radiations. We focus in detail on the roles of hybridization in shaping the patterns of genetic variation and in promoting cichlid diversification. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Animal Biosciences, Volume 9 is February 16, 2021.

OBJECTIVES: A systematic review to examine the physiological effects the different types of masks have on healthy adults when doing physical exercise. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, and Litcovid were searched up to March 20, 2021, following the PRISMA model. Articles published in the last 5 years with healthy adults. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 633 studies related to the use of masks during physical exercise were found, of which 8 articles met the criteria to be included. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2. DATA EXTRACTION: The search process and the review of the articles were carried out by independent expert researchers. The risk of bias and the methodological quality of the different studies included in the systematic review were calculated following the Cochrane criteria using an adaptation for random cross-studies. Once the information was properly structured, the results were extracted, and the findings of the study analyzed. RESULTS: There were significant changes in the following physiological variables when engaging in physical exercise using masks: 25% in the heart rate and dyspnea, 37.5% in the rating of perceived exertion, 50% in the pulmonary variables, and 37.5% in discomfort. The oxygen saturation, blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and the concentration of blood lactate did not present any significant effect in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The usage of masks by a healthy adult population during the performance of physical exercise has shown minimal effects with regard to physiological, cardiorespiratory, and perceived responses. Some symptoms can be dyspnea, effort perceived, or discomfort, among others. These findings indicate that the use of masks is not harmful to individuals' health. It does not present any significant detrimental effect on physical performance or risk to their well-being. However, further experiments are required to corroborate the findings of this review.","output":"The Physiological Effects of Face Masks During Exercise Worn Due to COVID-19: A Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives Studies that measure the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (seroprevalence) are essential to understand population exposure to SARS-CoV-2 among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We aimed to measure seroprevalence in the Scottish population over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic C from prior to the first recorded case in Scotland, through to the second pandemic wave. Study design Serial cross-sectional. Methods We tested 41,477 residual samples retrieved from primary and antenatal care settings across Scotland for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a 12-month period from December 2019-December 2020 (pre-rollout of COVID-19 vaccination). Five-weekly rolling seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for the sensitivity and specificity of the assays and weighted to reference populations. Temporal trends in seroprevalence estimates and weekly SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive notifications were compared. Results Five-weekly rolling seroprevalence rates were 0% until the end of March, when they increased contemporaneously with the first pandemic wave. Seroprevalence rates remained stable through the summer (range 3%C5%) during a period of social restrictions, following which they increased concurrently with the second wave, reaching 9.6% (95% CI 8.4%-10.8%) in week beginning 28th December 2020. Seroprevalence rates were lower in rural vs. urban areas (adjusted odds ratio[AOR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.61C0.79) and among individuals aged 20-39 and 60+ (AORs 0.74, 95% CI 0.64C0.86, and 0.80, 95% CI 0.69C0.91, respectively) relative to those aged 0-19 years. Conclusions After two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, less than one in ten individuals in the Scottish population had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

Importantly, public health representatives have limited access to information, which permit them to assess trends and changes in vectorChuman contact. Exposed individuals may, however, seek information on the Internet and thereby deliver input to a search record for the given vector. The variation in search-frequencies may reflect the variation in contact rates, but varying general interest could also influence the data. We here investigated records for search terms synonymous with tick(s), and found that the records reflect the seasonal variation, which one would expect when these result from tick encounters. Albeit, variable use of search terminology suggest that these records should not be used to make comparisons between years. ABSTRACT: Monitoring vectorChuman interaction is pivotal for assessing potential transmission rates of vector borne diseases and their associated public health impact. People often seek information following an insect bite in order to identify hematophagous arthropods, which in recent years often is done using Internet resources. Through this activity, a record of net searches is generated, which include information that reflect local humanCarthropod interaction, e.g., for the common tick (Ixodes ricinus) in European countries. Such records could in principle provide low cost real-time monitoring data, if indeed Internet search activities adequately reflect tickChuman interaction. We here explore Google Trends records for within-year and between-year trends, for four different Danish search terms for tick(s). We further assess the relationship between monthly search-frequencies and local weather conditions (temperatures and precipitation from 2007 to 2016) in nine European countries. Our findings point to significant limitations in the records due to changes in search-term preferences over the given years. However, the seasonal dynamics are comparable among search-terms. Moreover, the seasonal pattern in search terms vary across Europe in tune with changes in temperature and precipitation. We conclude that, the within-year variation for given search-terms provide credible information, which systematically vary with local weather patterns. We are not convinced that these records merely reflect general interest. It will, however, require a more in-depth analysis by researchers that have specific insight into local language practices to fully assess the strength and weaknesses of this approach","output":"Monitoring Temporal Trends in Internet Searches for Ticks across Europe by Google Trends: TickCHuman Interaction or General Interest?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 patients may develop coagulopathy which is associated with poor prognosis and high risk of thrombosis. The objective of this work was to evaluate the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis of lower limbs (DVT) through ultrasonography in patients infected with COVID-19 admitted to hospital in conventional units with 5 days monitoring. The secondary objective was to determine if D-dimer levels body mass index (BMI) and C-reactive ; protein (CRP) were associated with DVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 patients with a mean age of 6512.3 years infected with COVID-19 were admitted to three conventional units at our institution ,28 patients were women. A COVID-19 diagnosis was made by transcriptase polymerase chain reaction by means of nasopharyngeal swab or by chest computer tomography (CT) without iodine contrast media. Demographics ,co-morbidities characteristics and laboratory parameters were collected . A preventive anticoagulation treatment was established on admission with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) . A complete venous duplex ultrasound (DU) test of lower limbs was performed on Day (D) 0 and D5 .A pulmonary CT angiograms with iodine contrast media (CTPA) was required when was ; suspected pulmonary embolism (PE). RESULTS: On D0 the DU showed acute DVT in seven patients (9.75%).A CTPA was performed in 12 patients (16.65%) ,3 of whom with an acute PE (25 %). On D0 acute DVT was not significantly associated with CRP (mean 10198.6 in the group without DVT versus 67.658.4 mg/l p=0.43) or BMI ( 27.7 5.04 versus 28.1  2.65 Kg/m2 p=0.54 ).However we found a significant association between acute DVT and D-dimer levels (15362347 versus 9652 10205 ng/ml p <0.01).Among the patients included on D0 only 32 had a DU on D5.Forty of them (55.55%) were not examined for the following reasons : 7 were previously diagnosed with VTE on D0 (9.7%) and therefore had been excluded on D5 8 (11%) had been transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) 10 (14%) discharged from the hospital 5 (7%) died and 10 ( 13.9%) due to technical issues.

The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has not been seen since the outbreak of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the early eighties. But there is another unseen pandemic running alongside the current COVID-19 pandemic, which affects a vast number of people, crossing international boundaries and occurring in every single country worldwide. The pandemic of traumatic injuries. Traumatic injuries account for 11% of the current Global Burden of Disease, resulting in nearly 5 million deaths annually and is the third-leading cause of death worldwide. For every trauma-related death, it is estimated that up to 50 people sustain permanent or temporary disabilities. Furthermore, traumatic injuries occur at disproportionately higher rates in low- and middle-income countries, with approximately 90% of injuries and more than 90% of global deaths from injury occurring these countries. Injuries are increasing worldwide, crossing international boundaries and affecting a large number of people, in the same manner Human Immunodeficiency Virus did in the 1980's and COVID-19 is today. The tremendous global effort to tackle the COVID-19 and Human Immunodeficiency Virus pandemics has occurred whilst ignoring the comparable pandemic of injury.

Coughing and sneezing by an infected person can emit pathogen-containing particles with diameters less than 10 m that can reach the alveolar region. Based on our analysis of the sparse literature on respiratory aerosols, we estimated that emitted particles quickly decrease in diameter due to water loss to one-half the initial values, and that in one cough the volume in particles with initial diameters less than 20 m is 6  10(?8) mL. The pathogen emission rate from a source case depends on the frequency of expiratory events, the respirable particle volume, and the pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid. Viable airborne pathogens are removed by exhaust ventilation, particle settling, die-off, and air disinfection methods; each removal mechanism can be assigned a first-order rate constant. The pathogen concentration in well-mixed room air depends on the emission rate, the size distribution of respirable particles carrying pathogens, and the removal rate constants. The particle settling rate and the alveolar deposition fraction depend on particle size. Given these inputs plus a susceptible person's breathing rate and exposure duration to room air, an expected alveolar dose  is estimated. If the infectious dose is one organism, as appears to be true for tuberculosis, infection risk is estimated by the expression: R = 1 ? exp(?). Using published tuberculosis data concerning cough frequency, bacilli concentration in respiratory fluid, and die-off rate, we illustrate the model via a plausible scenario for a person visiting the room of a pulmonary tuberculosis case. We suggest that patients termed superspreaders or dangerous disseminators are those infrequently encountered persons with high values of cough and/or sneeze frequency, elevated pathogen concentration in respiratory fluid, and/or increased respirable aerosol volume per expiratory event such that their pathogen emission rate is much higher than average.","output":"Toward Understanding the Risk of Secondary Airborne Infection: Emission of Respirable Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The clinical manifestation of COVID-19 is nonspecific and varies greatly, which makes it more difficult to discriminate from other (virus) infections. Neither individual findings nor combinations of findings are specific enough to be able to diagnose COVID-19 with a high degree of certainty.

METHOD: Development and implementation of a symptom-based COVID-19 score based on a multicentric retrospective evaluation in three German emergency departments from 9 March until 30 April 2020 of patients suspected of having COVID-19 and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. RESULTS: The study population included 697 patients and 9.4% of these patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 infection. A COVID-19 score of &#8805;5 points was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of illness. The sensitivity of the score was 98.4% with a moderate specificity of 48.3%. DISCUSSION: The score, which is easy to obtain during the initial assessment, supports the assessment of the pretest probability for a COVID-19 infection as part of the risk stratification and can influence the treatment pathway in terms of pre-emptive isolation, PCR testing and other treatment options at an early stage. Due to the nonspecific symptoms of the disease; however, it must be accepted that the goal of high sensitivity results in a relatively low specificity of the score.","output":"[Risk stratification through implementation and evaluation of a COVID-19 score : A retrospective diagnostic study]./ Risikostratifizierung durch Implementierung und Evaluation eines COVID-19-Scores : Eine retrospektive Diagnostikstudie"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sustaining finite public resources presents a dilemma between acting in self-interest for present benefit versus working toward long-term collective gain.

Neutral participants increased their point taking when the pool was depleting compared with when it was sustained; however, this pattern was not observed for grateful participants. Study 2 (N = 224) replicated these findings while also showing the effect of gratitude to be distinct from happiness.

This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DIs for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), in comparison with alternative care options, from the perspective of the UK health care system. METHODS: An open-source decision analytic cohort model was used to extrapolate the results of a network meta-analysis over a patients lifetime and estimate the costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years) of DIs and their comparators. The net monetary benefit (NMB) and probability of cost effectiveness was estimated for each comparator, and we conducted a Value of Information analysis to evaluate the scale and drivers of uncertainty. RESULTS: DIs were associated with lower NMB compared with medication and with group therapy, but greater NMB compared with non-therapeutic controls and with usual care. DIs that were supported by a clinician, an assistant or a lay person had higher delivery costs than purely patient-self-directed DIs, yielding a greater NMB when opportunity cost was above 3000/QALY. There was considerable uncertainty in the findings driven largely by uncertainty in the estimated treatment effects. The value of further research to establish the effectiveness of DIs for GAD was substantial, at least 12.9 billion. CONCLUSIONS: The high uncertainty about these results does not allow for recommendations based on the cost effectiveness of DIs. However, the analysis highlights areas for future research, and demonstrates that apparent cost savings associated with DIs can be offset by reduced effectiveness.

METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2019-2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, which surveyed a nationally representative, prospective cohort of 3078 U.S. veterans. Pre-pandemic and 1-year peri-pandemic risk and protective factors associated with incident and chronic probable AUD were examined. RESULTS: A total of 6.9 % (n = 183) of veterans were classified as chronic probable AUD, 3.2 % (n = 85) as remitted from AUD, and 2.7 % (n = 71) as incident probable AUD during the pandemic; the prevalence of probable AUD in the full sample remained stable -10.1 % pre-pandemic and 9.6 % peri-pandemic.

In addition, several natural polymers offer potential distinct applications in gene delivery and genetic engineering. However, some of these polymers have drawbacks, such as their lack of water retention and elasticity. Sacran, one of the high-molecular-weight natural polysaccharides (megamolecular polysaccharides) derived from Aphanothece sacrum (A. sacrum), has good water retention and elasticity. Historically, sacran has been used as a dietary food. Moreover, sacran can be applied in biomedical fields as an active material, excipient, and genetic engineering material.

More specifically, this paper investigates how a change in their daily routines created opportunities to interact with and experience UGS differently and how their emotional response and perception towards these spaces changed. Semi-structured interviews allowed for stories, experiences and emotions to unfold, which revealed that the participants' gained an appreciation for the potential of UGS to support their wellbeing during a stressful and isolating time. UGS interaction also allowed them to form tangible memories of summer 2020 as it provided a safe arena for them to maintain social contact with friends outdoors, or to escape their home environment and experience respite and relaxation in a natural setting.

Current trends indicate that mental illness, substance use, and burnout are more prevalent in medical students compared to the general population due to excessive academic, personal, and societal stressors. Pass/fail grading systems and longitudinal, collaborative learning approaches with peer support appear to be protective for student wellness. Additionally, maintaining enjoyable hobbies, cultivating social support networks, and developing resiliency decrease distress in medical students on an individual level. Faculty and administrator development is also a necessary component to ensuring student wellness.

We describe a novel methodology to extract useful spatiotemporal information from COVID-19 pandemic data. (2) Methods: We perform specific analyses based on mathematical and statistical tools, like mathematical morphology, hierarchical clustering, parametric data modeling and non-parametric statistics. These analyses are here applied to the large dataset consisting of about 19,000 COVID-19 patients in the Veneto region (Italy) during the entire Italian national lockdown.

We identify four clusters of connected provinces based on the temporal evolution of the incidence. Surprisingly, while one cluster consists of three neighboring provinces, another one contains two provinces more than 210 km apart by highway. The survival function of the local spatial incidence values is modeled here by a tapered Pareto model, also used in other applied fields like seismology and economy in connection to networks.

The instrument was applied to 873 women aged between 40 and 65 years. Considering the proposal to regroup the set of data related to the level of physical activity of climacteric women using the IPAQ, we used 2 algorithms: Kohonen and k-means, and, to evaluate the validity of these clusters, 3 indexes were used: Silhouette, PBM and Dunn. The questionnaire was tested for validity (factor analysis) and precision (Cronbach's alpha). The Random Forests technique was used to assess the importance of the variables that make up the IPAQ. To classify these variables, we used 3 algorithms: Suport Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Decision Tree. The results of the tests to evaluate the clusters suggested that what is recommended for IPAQ, when applied to climacteric women, is to categorize the results into two groups. The factor analysis resulted in three factors, with factor 1 being composed of variables 3 to 6; factor 2 for variables 7 and 8; and factor 3 for variables 1 and 2. Regarding the reliability estimate, the results of the standardized Cronbach's alpha test showed values between 0.63 to 0.85, being considered acceptable for the construction of the construct. In the test of importance of the variables that make up the instrument, the results showed that variables 1 and 8 presented a lesser degree of importance and by the analysis of Accuracy, Recall, Precision and area under the ROC curve, there was no variation when the results were analyzed with all IPAQ variables but variables 1 and 8.

Healthcare provider sensitization training directed at psychosocial and tangible support and an audio-visual training tool for parent-attendants were developed that included: 1) handwashing, infection prevention, protocol for entry; 2) developmentally supportive care, breastfeeding, expression of breastmilk and assisted feeding; 3) kangaroo mother care; and 4) preparation for discharge and care at home. The study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the FCC model in a NICU in India. METHODS: A prospective cohort design collected quantitative data on each parent-attendant/infant dyad at enrollment, during the NICU stay, and at discharge. Feasibility of the FCC program was measured by assessing the participation of parent-attendants and healthcare providers, and whether training components were implemented as intended. Acceptability was measured by the proportion of parent-attendants who participated in the trainings and their ability to accurately complete program activities. RESULTS: Of 395 NICU admissions during the study period, eligible participants included 333 parent-attendant/infant dyads, 24 doctors, and 21 nurses. Of the 1242 planned parent-attendant training sessions, 939 (75.6%) were held, indicating that program fidelity was high, and the majority of trainings were implemented as intended. While 50% of parent-attendants completed all 4 FCC training sessions, 95% completed sessions 1 and 2; 60% of the total participating parent-attendants completed session 3, and 75% completed session 4. Compliance rates were over 96% for 5 of 10 FCC parent-attendant activities, and 60 to 78% for the remaining 5 activities. CONCLUSIONS: FCC was feasible to implement in this setting and was acceptable to participating parent-attendants and healthcare providers. Parents participated in trainings conducted by NICU providers and engaged in essential care to their infants in the NICU.

Once monthly follow-up visits occurred over the 6-month study period. SETTING Baltimore City, Maryland, USA. PARTICIPANTS We grouped 135 participants into 45 triads (asthmatic child (2-12 years of age), maternal caregiver and social network member). Triads were assigned in a 1:1 allocation ratio. The maternal caregiver and social network members were active smokers and contributed to paediatric TSE. INTERVENTIONS Triads were randomised to receive either usual care (TSE education and quitline referrals) or usual care plus financial incentives. Cash incentives up to $1000 were earned by caregivers and designated social network participants. Incentives for either caregivers or social network participants were provided contingent on their individual reduction of tobacco usage measured by biomarkers of tobacco usage. Study visits occurred once a month during the 6-month trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The main outcome measure was mean change in monthly paediatric cotinine levels over 6 months of follow-up interval and was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS The mean change in monthly child cotinine values was not significantly different in the intervention cohort over the 6-month follow-up period, compared with the control group (p=0.098, CI -0.16 to 1.89). Trends in child cotinine could not be ascribed to caregivers or social network members.

There is no evidence-based treatment for the infection and prevention of transmission using social distancing, isolation and hygiene measures is widely recommended. Tobacco smoking is rampant in communities around the globe and the addiction to tobacco results in deaths of more than 8 million individuals each year.

Hepatopancreatico-biliary (HPB) cancers are characterised by rapid disease progression. This study aims to assess delays in receiving surgery for this patient cohort during the first COVID-19 wave. METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery between April and July 2020 (COVID period) were compared with a control group from the preceding year. Delay in receiving surgery was defined as more than 50 days between referral and surgery date. Statistical analysis was carried out to evaluate predictors of delay and short-term outcomes. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods, 94 and 115 patients underwent surgery, respectively. No patients contracted COVID-19 postoperatively. Some 118 patients waited more than 50 days for surgery versus 91 who received surgery within 50 days from referral. Independent predictors for surgical delay were undergoing surgery in the COVID-19 era (odds ratio (OR) 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-4.1; p=0.015), referral pathway (OR 35.1, 95% CI 4.2-296; p=0.001) and presenting pathology (OR 8.3, 95% CI 1.2-56.1; p=0.03).

METHODS From December 2008 to July 2014, 10 patients underwent robotic anatomic liver resection in the right liver. The procedure is as follows: (1) mobilization of the liver and isolation and clamping of a selected Glissonean pedicle; (2) transection of the liver parenchyma using a rubber band retraction technique; (3) division of the Glissonean pedicle after full exposure, followed by completion of parenchymal transection. RESULTS The median age of the patients was 52.50 (range 28-59) years, and seven were male. All patients had hepatocellular carcinoma. The types of resections performed were as follows: segmentectomy 6 (n = 1), segmentectomy of 4b + 5 ventral segments (n = 2), right posterior sectionectomy (n = 3), extended right hepatectomy (n = 1), extended right posterior sectionectomy (n = 2), and central bisectionectomy (n = 1).

The aims of this study were not only identifying the factors associated with the polarised COVID-19 pandemic in Japan but also discussing effective preventive measures. METHODS: This was an ecological study using online survey data which was cross-sectionally conducted by the author. A total of 6000 respondents who resided in 10 low- and 10 high-COVID-19 incidence prefectures, with a wide gap in terms of COVID-19 incidence, in Japan were recruited. Data on COVID-19 cases and geodemographic information were obtained from official government sites. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare variables between the two areas and age groups. RESULTS: This study revealed that that age influenced peoples behaviours and perceptions, except one behaviour of wearing facemasks. The major factors significantly associated with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people were commuting by private automobile (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.444; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.394C0.501), commuting by public transportation (AOR, 6.813; 95% CI, 5.567C8.336), washing hands (AOR, 1.233; 95% CI, 1.005C1.511), opening windows regularly (AOR, 1.248; 95% CI, 1.104C1.412), avoiding crowded places (AOR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.641C0.893), non-scheduled visits to drinking places (AOR, 1.212; 95% CI, 1.054C1.392) and perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (AOR, 1.380; 95% CI, 1.180C1.612). These factors were strongly associated with age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Effective preventive measures for COVID-19 transmission can be developed by understanding the characteristics of populated areas, such as public transportation infrastructure and younger peoples movements and behaviours in relation to the population age structure to contain the current epidemic and protect the most vulnerable elderly people.","output":"Polarized nature of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan: associations with population age structure and behaviours"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Where there is limited access to COVID-19 tests, or where the results of such tests have been delayed or even invalidated (e g , California and Utah), there is a need for scalable alternative approaches-such as a heuristic model or \\"pregnancy test for COVID-19\\" that can factor in the time denominator (i e , duration of symptoms) This paper asks whether infection among these public health and safety agencies is a \\"canary in the coal mine,\\" litmus test, or microcosm (pick your analogy) for the communities in which they operate Can COVID-19 infection counts and rates be seen \\"moving around\\" communities by examining the virus's effect on emergency responders themselves?

Climate may affect the results of the use of emollients in neonates for AD prevention and possible adverse cutaneous eruptions. OBJECTIVES To test the hypothesis that emollients used during infancy can prevent AD in high-risk neonates in a country with a tropical climate and to evaluate other possible adverse cutaneous eruptions in this population. METHODS This was a randomized controlled study in a tertiary care hospital with a 6 months' duration. Eligible neonates were randomly assigned to receive either emollient and skin-care advice (emollient group) or skin-care advice only (control group). The intervention was started within 3 weeks of birth. RESULTS The emollient group showed a significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of AD at 6 months (relative risk, 0.39; 95% CI 0.24 - 0.64; P < 0.001). The emollient group started to develop AD later and had a lower severity of AD than the control group (P < 0.001). Compared to moderate adherence, low adherence to emollient application was associated with a lower number of patients with AD (P=0.008). Potentially emollient-related cutaneous eruptions, such as miliaria, and suspected cutaneous infections, such as impetigo, were more frequent in the emollient group. Exposure to passive smoking showed a significant difference in the development of AD compared to non-smoking exposure, both during pregnancy and after the child's birth (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The present study suggests that, in a tropical climate, emollient applied to the skin of at-risk neonates on an \\"as needed\\" basis (depending on environmental factors, level of skin dryness), rather than on a \\"daily basis\\", can provide a substantial benefit for AD prevention.","output":"Effects of an emollient application on newborn skin from birth for prevention of atopic dermatitis: A randomized controlled study in Thai neonates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-stranded positive RNA virus surrounded by four structural proteins which are envelope, membrane, spike and nuclear capsid This virus was identified at the end of 2019 and caused respiratory illness (i e coronavirus disease 2019: COVID-19) There is no specific vaccine or medication for the COVID-19 and current treatment relies on existing drugs including anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents Here, we describe the potential use electromagnetic radiation to treat COVID-19 infected individuals The electromagnetic radiation, particularly UV-C has so far proved to be highly effective as coronavirus disinfectant method on medical instruments and material surfaces Photochemical mechanisms of UV-C with human cell could alter the single strand RNA and effective to obtain photodimeric lesions in nucleic acid of the virus Inactivation mechanisms by photodimers induced in genome commonly lead to mutagenesis, where base pairing during viral RNA replication will be interfere usually at pyrimidine dimers Therefore, application of UV-C at moderate intensities within periodical irradiation on patient might be useful to inactivate RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and can be used as an alternative for non-invasive treatment of COVID-19 patients ?

The ability to competently engage in a multicultural world is often considered the literacy of the future. Global interconnectedness has brought studies into intercultural competence to centre stage. This has increased the demand for cross-cultural education experiences that facilitate such learning. However, there is a dearth of empirical research into the issues and effects surrounding short-term cross-cultural educational experiences for adolescents. This mixed-methods study extends previous research by looking specifically into what impact short-term cross-cultural experiences may have on the formation of intercultural competence (IC) and emotional intelligence (EI) of Australian high school students. This study used two instruments for measuring IC and EI in a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design (n = 14), the General Ethnocentrism (GENE) Scale and Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ). Moreover, it conducted in-depth post-experience qualitative interviews (n = 7) that broadly followed a phenomenological paradigm of inquiry. The findings suggest that fully embodied cross-cultural immersive experiences can effectively support the formation of IC and EI in high school students and may thereby play a contributing role in redressing ignorance, xenophobia, prejudice, and discrimination. A greater understanding of the linkages between immersive cross-cultural experiences and intercultural competence offers prospects for policymakers, educators, pastoral carers, and other relevant stakeholders who might employ such experiential learning to foster more interculturally and interracially harmonious human relations.","output":"The Impact of Short-Term Cross-Cultural Experience on the Intercultural Competence of Participating Students: A Case Study of Australian High School Students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o A Organiza??o Mundial de Sade (OMS) alerta que a atual pandemia pelo SARS-CoV-2 provocou grande impacto no suprimento de sangue, ocasionado pela redu??o significativa nas doa??es que repercutem nos hemocentros, que precisam reestruturar o servi?o para o risco iminente de desabastecimento e o consequente comprometimento da assistncia hospitalar.

METHODS A questionnaire was administered to 1,958 urban workers, 1,909 rural workers, and 4,452 migrant workers in Zhejiang Province, Eastern China, in 2004. Blood samples for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis were taken from the migrant and urban workers. RESULTS Migrants were young, worked very long hours, and their living conditions were very basic. Nineteen percent had some form of health insurance and 26% were entitled to limited sick pay compared with 68% and 66%, respectively, for urban workers. Migrants had the best self-rated health and reported the least acute illness, chronic disease, and disability, after controlling for age and education. There were no HIV infections detected in either the migrant or urban workers. However, 15 urban workers (0.68%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35, 1.02) and 20 migrants (0.48%, 95% CI 0.26, 0.66, p=0.06) tested positive for syphilis. The high cost of health care in the city was a barrier to health-care access in the last year for 15% of the migrants and 8% of the urban workers. Forty-seven percent of the migrants were unwilling to make contributions to health insurance. CONCLUSIONS These migrants demonstrated the \\"healthy migrant effect.\\" However, poor living conditions and inattention to health may make migrants vulnerable to poor long-term health.

We used a similar approach with explants from rhesus macaques to establish the system and to compare infection kinetics with marine mammals. Trachea, bronchi, and lungs from 11 California sea lions, 2 Northern elephant seals and 10 rhesus macaques were inoculated within 24 hours post-mortem with 6 strains representing 4 IAV subtypes. Explants from all 3 species showed similar IAV infection kinetics with peak viral titers 48-72 hours post-inoculation (hpi) that increased by 2-4 log10 PFU/explant relative to the inoculum. Immunohistochemistry localized IAV infection to apical epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that respiratory tissue explants from marine mammals support IAV infection. In the absence of the ability to perform experimental infections of marine mammals, this ex vivo culture of respiratory tissues mirrors the in vivo environment and serves as a tool to study IAV susceptibility, host-range, and tissue tropism. We adapted the explant approach and used it to inoculate tissues from 2 rhesus macaques with severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-CoV-2 titers increased by 2-4 log10 PFU/explant relative to the inoculum and peaked 48 or 72 hpi in trachea, bronchi, and kidney of both macaques and in the lung of 1 animal. These results demonstrate that this ex vivo model can define infection dynamics for 2 respiratory viruses of significant public health importance. Importance Although influenza A virus can infect marine mammals, a dearth of marine mammal cell lines and ethical and logistical challenges prohibiting experimental infections of living marine mammals means that little is known about IAV infection kinetics in these species. We circumvented these limitations by adapting a respiratory tract explant model first to establish the approach with rhesus macaques and then for use with marine mammals. We observed that multiple strains representing 4 IAV subtypes infected trachea, bronchi, and lungs of macaques and marine mammals with variable peak titers and kinetics. We adapted the approach for SARS-CoV-2 and observed that the infection kinetics in inoculated rhesus macaque explants parallel observations from ex vivo human lungs. This ex vivo model can define infection dynamics for 2 respiratory viruses of significant public health importance and use of explants from animals euthanized for other reasons reduces use of animals in research.","output":"Respiratory tract explant infection dynamics of influenza A virus in California sea lions, northern elephant seals, and rhesus macaques and severe acute respiratory syndrome virus-2 in rhesus macaques"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: TILRR is a modulator of genes in the NF-B inflammation pathway. It regulates inflammation-responsive genes, the secretion of inflammatory mediators, and the migration of immune cells. Because inflammation drives the pathogenesis of many infectious and inflammatory diseases, it is important to know the expression of TILRR protein in tissues and cells. This study examined TILRR protein expression in healthy adult human and macaques tissues and PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells). METHODS AND RESULTS: Tissues (trachea, lungs, stomach, small intestine [ileum], cecum, colon, rectum, vagina, cervix, uterus, and penis) and PBMCs from humans and macaques were lysed in RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) lysis buffer. The TILRR protein was examined by fluorescent Western blot analysis. The relative fluorescence units (rfu) of TILRR protein expression were quantified by Image Studio software (LI-COR). The results showed that adult healthy female (n=1) rectal and cervicovaginal tissues expressed a higher level of TILRR protein than the other tissues (trachea, lungs, stomach, small intestine [ileum], cecum, colon, uterus, and penis) examined. Like humans, the lungs, colon, and rectal tissues of healthy adult female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) (n=2) expressed the TILRR protein. In addition, PBMCs of healthy adult women (n=4), adult female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) (n=4), and adult male and female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) (n=4) showed a similar expression level of TILRR protein (p= 0.2858).

Minutes of moderate-to-vigorous (MV) PA and steps were measured using a waist-worn accelerometer (ActiGraph GT3x) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Achievement of the 150 minute/week MVPA goal was examined using total minutes and bout minutes (i.e., counting only PA occurring in bouts 10 minutes in length). Change in PA was analyzed using non-parametric tests for multiple comparisons. Associations of factors with meeting the PA goal were modeled using binary logistic regression. Results: At 6 months, there were increases from baseline in MVPA (median [p25, p75]: 5.3 [-0.9, 17.6] minutes/day) and steps (863 [-145, 2790] steps/day), both p<0.001.

Within the investigated population of healthy adults who had never been positively diagnosed with or vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, we found that 35.5% (178 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and 52.5% (263 out of 501) were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA; 21.6% of the investigated population developed virus-specific IgG or IgA while being asymptomatic. Anti-RBD IgG, which represents virus-neutralizing potential, was found in 25.6% of individuals (128 out of 501). These patients, though positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, cannot be identified in the public health system as convalescents due to undiagnosed infections, and they are considered unaffected by SARS-CoV-2. Their contribution to population immunity against COVID-19 should however be considered in predictions and modeling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of note, the majority of the investigated population still lacked anti-RBD IgG protection (74.4%); thus the positive fraction is not sufficient for effective population immunity, and vaccination against COVID-19 is still of the most importance for controlling the pandemic.","output":"Hidden fraction of Polish population immune to SARS-CoV-2 in May 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the present study is to explore the mediation role of anxiety sensitivity on the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19. The study was conducted with the relational method. The research data were collected online from 302 individuals (Male N--76, Female N = 226) with Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. The result of both mediation analysis and bootstrapping analysis (with 5000 bootstrap resamples) showed that the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and fear of COVID-19 was mediated by anxiety sensitivity. Anxiety sensitivity decreased the effect of intolerance of uncertainty on fear of COV1D-19. Moreover, comparing intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety sensitivity in terms of their predictive levels of the fear of COVID-19, it was concluded that anxiety sensitivity predicted the fear of COVID-19 more, and that anxiety sensitivity included the variance of intolerance to the uncertainty associated with the fear of COVID-19.

Amidst a dearth of such data and guided by evidence that nurses in ICUs experience personal, professional and existential issues in similar conditions, a systematic scoping review (SSR) is proposed to evaluate prevailing accounts of physicians facing dying patients in ICUs through the lens of Personhood. Such data would enhance understanding and guide the provision of better support for ICU physicians. METHODS: An SSR adopts the Systematic Evidenced Based Approach (SEBA) to map prevailing accounts of caring for dying patients in ICUs. To enhance the transparency and reproducibility of this process, concurrent and independent use of tabulated summaries, thematic analysis and directed content analysis (Split Approach) is adopted. RESULTS: Eight thousand three hundred fifty-eight abstracts were reviewed from four databases, 474 full-text articles were evaluated, 58 articles were included, and the Split Approach revealed six categories/themes centered around the Innate, Individual, Relational and Societal Rings of Personhood, conflicts in providing end of life care and coping mechanisms employed. CONCLUSION: This SSR suggests that caring for dying patients in ICU impacts how physicians view their personhood. To resolve conflicts within individual concepts of personhood, physicians use prioritization, reframing and rely on accessible, personalized support from colleagues to steer coping strategies. An adapted form of the Ring Theory of Personhood is proposed to direct timely personalized, appropriate and holistic support.

Imbued with the chronic stressors that often accompany high-risk, interpersonal work, the healthcare industry is rife with stories of burnout, and the addition of a pandemic has intensified the challenges of an already demanding work environment. With an aim toward understanding the root causes of pandemic-exacerbated burnout, we document the experiences of 93 healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and, in doing so, explore an important link between burnout and work-nonwork boundaries. We find the contextual shock of the pandemic resulted in an increased incidence of boundary violations-undesired disruptions between work and other important life domains such as personal and family life. These boundary violations-which we classify as physical, temporal, or knowledge-based-frequently corresponded to greater reports of burnout manifested by exhaustion, detachment, and inefficacy. We detail specific patterns within the broader context of boundary violations whereby intrusion events are associated with increased job-related demands and distancing events are associated with reduced job-related resources. In addition to documenting the connection between burnout and boundary violations, we also reveal how workers utilized specific boundary work tactics in response to specific types of boundary violations to redefine boundaries and forestall burnout. Our grounded theorizing points to theoretical and practical implications for the impact of boundary work tactics on burnout and other stress-related phenomena.

To examine their response to the pandemic, we analyzed their perspective, and association with psychiatric symptoms and stress among HCW with psychiatric diagnosis. Using an online survey of HCW, we analyzed demographics, work information, health factors, open-ended question, sources of stress and standardized mental health scales (Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL)). Sixteen out of 129 HCWs reported a pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis (median age 32 years, 8 were females, 8 work in the emergency department). Their perception of the impact severity on symptoms was significantly correlated with all the mental health scales and with stress from avoiding physical contact. In multivariate analysis, PSS score and PCL score were associated with self-rated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on symptoms (standardized beta = .51 for PCL and standardized beta = .55 for PSS). GAD-7 score was significantly related to both impact (standardized beta = .44) and stress from avoiding physical contact (standardized beta = .53). HCWs with psychiatric diagnoses reported a range of perception of the impact of the pandemic on their symptoms with increased severity associated with worse psychiatric outcomes and more stress from avoiding physical contact with others.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eligible adults residing in the area under study were chosen by simple random sampling and interviewed using a predesigned and pretested data collection schedule to assess awareness and perception. Based on their total awareness score, the participants were classified as having good awareness or poor awareness toward eye donation. RESULTS Among 423 participants, 52.0% were male, 34.0% were 18 to 30 years old, 38.3% were educated up to secondary level, and 85.6% had eye disease in their family. Of total participants, 70.2% had heard about eye donation, with 59.9% of this group having knowledge of eye donation only after death and 57.9% having knowledge that donation must occur within 6 hours of death. In addition, 52.9% were aware about donation from home, 30.6% said only the cornea is transplantable, and 52.2% knew it can be preserved. Participants with higher education, higher socioeconomic status, and outside of the house occupational engagement had significantly higher chance of good eye donation awareness.

We report the incidence of VTE among children with and without IBD. METHODS: We conducted a matched cohort study within a distributed network of population-based Canadian provincial health administrative databases. Children <16 years diagnosed with IBD were identified using validated algorithms from administrative data in Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Qubec and compared to age- and sex-matched children without IBD. Hospitalizations for VTE within 5 years of IBD diagnosis were identified. Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to pool province-specific incidence rates and incidence rate ratios [IRR] with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Hazard ratios [HR] from Cox proportional hazards models were pooled with fixed-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The 5-year incidence of VTE among 3593 children with IBD was 31.2 [95% CI 23.7C41.0] per 10 000 person-years [PY] compared to 0.8 [95% CI 0.4C1.7] per 10 000 PY among 16 289 children without IBD [unadjusted IRR 38.84, 95% CI 16.59C90.83; adjusted HR 22.91, 95% CI 11.50C45.63]. VTE was less common in Crohns disease than ulcerative colitis [unadjusted IRR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27C0.83; adjusted HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29C0.94]. The findings were similar for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism when comparing children with and without IBD. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of VTE is much higher in children with IBD than controls without IBD.

Anti-inflammatory effects of hypoglycemic agents have been reported, and their beneficial or harmful effects in patients with diabetes and COVID-19 remain controversial. Purpose: This study was performed to clarify this association. Data Sources: Relevant literature was searched on China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, Chinese periodical service platform VIP Database, Sinomed (China Biology Medicine, CBM), MedRxiv, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Ovid Databases (LWW), Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, Oxford Academic, Nature Press Group, Cochrane Library and BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine up to November 14, 2020. Study Selection: Only observational studies of hypoglycemic agents vs. drugs or therapy without hypoglycemic agents in adult diabetic patients with COVID-19 were included. Data Extraction: Data of death and poor composite outcomes were extracted. Data Synthesis: The pooled effects were calculated using the fixed-effects or random-effects models based on heterogeneity assessment. Limitation: Most studies were retrospective cohort studies with relative weak capability to verify causality. Conclusion: Home use of metformin might be beneficial in decreasing mortality in diabetic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Pregnant women were categorised as 'at risk' requiring extra vigilance with behavioural guidelines. Their understanding and ability to adhere to recommendations was unknown. OBJECTIVES: To complete a behavioural analysis of the determinants of recommended social distancing behaviour in pregnant women, according to the 'capability, opportunity, motivation and behaviour' ('COM-B') model to inform the development of recommendations/materials to support pregnant women in understanding and adhering to behavioural guidelines. DESIGN: Qualitative interview study with pregnant women in the Bristol area (UK). METHODS: Semi-structured telephone/videoconference interviews were conducted following a topic guide informed by the COM-B model, transcribed verbatim and subjected to framework analysis. Infographic materials were iteratively produced with stakeholder consultation, to support pregnant women. RESULTS: Thirty-one women participated (selected for demographic range). Women reported adhering to social distancing recommendations and intended to continue. COM-B analysis identified gaps in understanding around risk, vulnerability, and the extent of required social distancing, as well as facilitators of social distancing behaviour (e.g. social support, motivation to stay safe, home environment/resources). Additional themes around detrimental mental health effects and changes to maternity healthcare from the social distancing measures were identified. Infographic resources (plus midwife report) addressing women's key concerns were produced and disseminated. CONCLUSIONS: The COM-B model provided useful details of determinants of pregnant women's adherence to social distancing behaviours. The confusion of what being 'at risk' meant and varying interpretation of what was expected indicates a need for greater clarity around categories and guidance.

A total of 60 pneumonia patients admitted to Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University from January to July 2020 were selected as the research objects and Southern Medical University pneumonia patients as the research object, to be evenly divided into two groups, each group of 30 people. The control group was treated with conventional anti-infection treatment, and the observation group was treated with supplementary respiratory rehabilitation training on the basis of conventional treatment. The therapeutic effects of the two groups were compared. The results showed that the absorption time of lung lesions was (9.17  3.46) days in the observation group and (13.97  3.07) days in the control group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (t = 5.683, P < 0.001).

The purpose of this study was to synthesize N-(purin-6-yl)dipeptides containing the terminal fragment of (S)-glutamic acid. To obtain the target compounds, two synthetic routes were tested. The first of them is based on coupling of N-(purin-6-yl)-(S)-amino acids to dimethyl (S)-glutamate in the presence of carbodiimide coupling agent followed by the removal of ester groups. However, it turned out that this coupling process was accompanied by racemization of the chiral center of N-(purin-6-yl)--amino acids and in all cases led to mixtures of (S,S)- and (R,S)-diastereomers (6:4). Individual (S,S)-diastereomers were obtained using an alternative approach based on the nucleophilic substitution of chlorine in 6-chloropurine or 2-amino-6-chloropurine with corresponding dipeptides as nucleophiles. The enantiomeric purity of the target compounds was confirmed by chiral HPLC. To test the assumption that racemization of the chiral center of N-(purin-6-yl)--amino acids occurs with the participation of nitrogen atoms of the imidazole ring via the stage of formation of a chirally labile intermediate, we obtained such structural analogs of N-(purin-6-yl)-(S)-alanine as N-(9-benzylpurin-6-yl)-(S)-alanine and N-(7-deazapurin-6-yl)-(S)-alanine. It was found that coupling of these compounds to dimethyl (S)-glutamate was also accompanied by racemization. This indicates that the imidazole fragment does not play a crucial role in this process. When testing the antimycobacterial activity of some of the obtained compounds, conjugates with moderate activity against the laboratory Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain (MIC 3.1C6.25 g/mL) were identified.

Herein, we report a one-step process of synthesizing semi-dissolving microneedle (SDMN) patches that enable effective transdermal drug delivery without loading drugs themselves by introducing TEMPO-oxidized bacterial cellulose nanofibers (TOBCNs), which are well dispersed, while retaining their unique properties in the aqueous phase. The SDMN patch fabricated by the micro-molding of a TOBCN/hydrophilic biopolymer mixture had a two-layer structure comprising a water-soluble needle layer and a TOBCN-containing insoluble backing layer. Moreover, the SDMN patch, which had a hole in the backing layer where TOBCNs are distributed uniformly, could offer novel advantages for the delivery of large quantities of active ingredients. In vitro permeation analysis confirmed that TOBCNs with high water absorption capacity could serve as drug reservoirs. Upon SDMN insertion and the application of drug aqueous solution through the drug inlet hole, the TOBCNs rapidly absorbed the solution and supplied it to the needle layer. Simultaneously, the needle layer dissolved in body fluids and the drug solution to form micro-channels, which enabled the delivery of larger quantities of drugs to the skin compared to that enabled by solution application alone.","output":"A Semi-Dissolving Microneedle Patch Incorporating TEMPO-Oxidized Bacterial Cellulose Nanofibers for Enhanced Transdermal Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs), including the latest COVID-19 pandemic, have emerged and raised global public health crises in recent decades.

This study aimed to exploit machine learning technologies to cope with this challenge. The study was based on 83,227 hospital admissions with influenza-like illness and we analysed the risk effects of 19 comorbidities along with age and gender for severe illness or mortality risk. The experimental results revealed that the conventional decision tree (DT) models built with only 6 features, including age, gender, and four comorbidities, delivered the same level of prediction accuracy as the state-of-the-art deep neural network models built with 18 features. Accordingly, we further studied how to exploit the DT models with different sensitivity levels to determine patient triage and optimize medical resource allocation in different stages of an EID disaster to aid the frontline clinicians and policy-makers.

These challenges include obtaining sufficient statistical power as well as meeting eligibility requirements such as age, sex, and study proximity. Similarly, persons with ALS (PALS) face difficulty finding and enrolling in research studies for which they are eligible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe how the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registrys (ATSDR) National ALS Registry is linking PALS to scientists who are conducting research, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies. METHODS: Through the Registrys online research notification mechanism (RNM), PALS can elect to be notified about new research opportunities. This mechanism allows researchers to upload a standardized application outlining their study design and objectives, and proof of Institutional Review Board approval. If the application is approved, ATSDR queries the Registry for PALS meeting the studys specific eligibility criteria, and then distributes the researchers study material and contact information to PALS via email. PALS then need to contact the researcher directly to take part in any research. Such an approach allows ATSDR to protect the confidentiality of Registry enrollees. RESULTS: From 2013 to 2019, a total of 46 institutions around the United States and abroad have leveraged this tool and over 600,000 emails have been sent, resulting in over 2000 patients conservatively recruited for clinical trials and epidemiological studies. Patients between the ages of 60 and 69 had the highest level of participation, whereas those between the ages of 18 and 39 and aged over 80 had the lowest. More males participated (4170/7030, 59.32%) than females (2860/7030, 40.68%). CONCLUSIONS: The National ALS Registrys RNM benefits PALS by connecting them to appropriate ALS research. Simultaneously, the system benefits researchers by expediting recruitment, increasing sample size, and efficiently identifying PALS meeting specific eligibility requirements. As more researchers learn about and use this mechanism, both PALS and researchers can hasten research and expand trial options for PALS.","output":"Recruitment of Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis for Clinical Trials and Epidemiological Studies: Descriptive Study of the National ALS Registrys Research Notification Mechanism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The use of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic became ubiquitous. Such masks are believed to be effective in prevention of respiratory viral transmission. OBJECTIVES The study was undertaken to assess the use of face masks among students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with focus on similarities and differences between medical and non-medical students. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study was based on the specially designed survey. The questionnaire, after consultation with 10 students, was created using Google Forms and posted on numerous Facebook groups for students in Poland. The recall period of the questionnaire was the previous 7 days. In 48 h, 2,315 answers were obtained. Fifty-nine questionnaires were excluded due to data incompleteness and failure to fulfil inclusion criteria. Therefore, 2,256 surveys (97.5%) were considered for final analysis. RESULTS Medical students showed significantly different attitudes and practices concerning the use of face masks. Medical students used face masks more commonly and for longer periods of time. Moreover, they wore single-use masks more often and less frequently re-used them. Also, multiple use of single-use face masks and masks decontamination procedures were less common among medical students. CONCLUSIONS We suggest that medical students might be of help in educational campaigns for general public on proper use of face protection.","output":"Face masks use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences in attitudes and practices between medical and non-medical students.

This study aim to investigate the role of ephrinA1/ephA2 in LPS-induced epithelial hyperpermeability. Methods In vivo model challenged with oral LPS in C57BL/6 mice and in vitro model exposed to LPS in Caco2 monolayer were established. The barrier function was assessed including expression of tight junction proteins (occludin and claudin-1), transepithelial electrical resistance, and permeability to macromolecules (fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fluorescent dextran 4 kDa [FD4]). Moreover, the expression and phosphorylation of ephrinA1/ephA2 were quantified, and its roles in the process of epithelial barrier disruption were confirmed via stimulating ephA2 with ephrinA1-Fc chimera (ephrinA1-Fc) and inactivating ephA2 with ephA2-Fc chimera (ephA2-Fc), or ephA2 monoclonal antibody (ephA2-mab), as well as inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) with PD98059. Results LPS induced significant barrier dysfunction with dismissed occludin and claudin-1 expression, reduced transepithelial electrical resistance and increased FD4 permeability, accompanied by upregulated ephrinA1/ephA2 pathway and phosphorylation of ephA2 receptor. Furthermore, ephA2-Fc, and ephA2-mab ameliorated LPS-induced epithelial hyperpermeability, which was also inhibited by PD98059. Additionally, ephrinA1-Fc led to apparent epithelial leakage in Caco2 monolayer by promoting the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, which could be obviously blocked by ephA2-mab and PD98059.

The experimental ECMO circuit consisted of a centrifugal pump, a membrane oxygenator, and a pneumatic pulsatile flow generator system developed in-house. Nonpulsatile ECMO was initiated at a flow rate of 140 mL/kg/min for the first 30 min with normal heart beating, with rectal temperature maintained at 36C. Ventricular fibrillation was then induced with a 3.5-V alternating current to generate a cardiac dysfunction model. Using this model, we collected the data on pulsatile and nonpulsatile groups.

OBJECTIVE: To ascertain renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients perspectives on COVID-19 and understand the associated implications for treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An online survey of RCC patients was conducted from March 22 to March 25, 2020, disseminated through social media and patient networking platforms. The survey comprised 45 items, including baseline demographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment-related information. Patients were additionally queried regarding their anxiety level related to COVID-19 and associated implications for their cancer diagnosis. INTERVENTION: An online survey study. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics with graphical outputs were used to characterize survey results. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: A total of 539 patients (male:female 39%:58%) from 14 countries responded. Of them, 71% felt that their risk of COVID-19 infection was higher than the general population, and 27% contacted their physician to establish this. Among patients with localized disease (40%), most (42%) had scheduled surveillance scans within 6 wkC65% were unwilling to delay scans. Among patients with metastatic disease, 76% were receiving active therapy. While most patients preferred not to defer therapy (51%), patients receiving immune therapy regimens were less amenable to deferring therapy than those receiving targeted treatment (20% vs 47%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite high levels of anxiety surrounding COVID-19, many patients with RCC were inclined to adhere to existing schedules of surveillance (localized disease) and systemic treatment (metastatic disease).

Given the importance of the patient voice in these strategies, we conducted a survey of patients with kidney cancer to determine their treatment preferences. Our survey highlighted that most patients prefer to continue their current strategies of kidney cancer treatment and monitoring.","output":"Counterbalancing COVID-19 with Cancer Surveillance and Therapy: A Survey of Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IMPORTANCE: Identifying undetected clinical signs is imperative in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. OBJECTIVE: To establish the prevalence of clinical gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical outcomes and recovery rates associated with gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions were also assessed. DESIGN: A prospective study was performed in 80 patients admitted to Hospital Clnic of Barcelona (Spain) for COVID-19 pneumonia. Patients were re-evaluated in the ward daily until discharge. Gustatory and olfactory dysfunction symptoms were retrospectively collected from emergency room (ER) charts after first assessments. Follow-up was performed in telemedicine consultation. SETTING: The single-centre study was performed in a hospitalisation ward at a university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients meeting hospitalisation criteria for COVID-19 pneumonia were eligible. Study exclusion criteria were patients who could not speak, had previous gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions or whose PCR tests for SARS-CoV-19 were negative. INTERVENTIONS: Systematic assessment of gustatory and olfactory symptoms with standardised questions. OUTCOME(S): Prevalence of gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: Of the 80 study subjects, 62.5% were male and the median age was 57 years. Half of the cohort (n=40) presented with comorbidities. The prevalence of chemosensitive disorder was 73.8% (n=59) (95% CI: 63.8 to 83.8), although self-reported symptoms were recorded in only 26.3% (n=21) of patients in the ER. Gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions were observed in 58.8% (n=47) and 55% (n=44) of cases, respectively. They were also the first symptoms in 25% (n=20) of patients. Anosmia was associated with ageusia, OR: 7, 95% CI: 2.3 to 21.8, p=0.001). No differences in clinical outcomes were observed when patients with and without gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions were compared. Recovery rates were 20% (n=10) and 85% (n=42) at days 7 and 45, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of gustatory and olfactory dysfunctions in COVID-19 pneumonia was much higher than in self-report.

There are multiple barriers to reducing perioperative AKI - the etiology is multi-factorial and the diagnosis is fraught with issues. We review the recent literature on perioperative AKI and some considerations for anesthesiologists that examine the far-reaching effects of AKI on multiple organ systems. RECENT FINDINGS This review will discuss recent literature that addresses the epidemiology, use of novel biomarkers in risk stratification, and therapeutic modalities for AKI in burn, pediatrics, sepsis, trauma, cardiac, and liver disease, contrast-induced AKI, as well as the evidence assessing goal-directed fluid therapy. SUMMARY Recent studies address the use of risk stratification models and biomarkers, more sensitive than creatinine, in the preoperative identification of patients at risk for AKI. Although exciting, these scores and models need validation. There is a need for research assessing whether early AKI detection improves outcomes. Enhanced recovery after surgery utilizing goal-directed fluid therapy has not been shown to make an appreciable difference in the incidence of AKI. Reducing perioperative AKI requires a multi-pronged and possibly disease-specific approach.","output":"Perioperative acute kidney injury: impact and recent update."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 with BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine plays a critical role in COVID-19 prevention. Although BNT162b2 is highly effective against COVID-19, a time-dependent decrease in neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is observed. The aim of this study was to identify the individual features that may predict NAbs levels after vaccination. Machine learning techniques were applied to data from 302 subjects. Principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD), k-means clustering, and random forest were used. PCA and FAMD showed that younger subjects had higher levels of neutralizing antibodies than older subjects. The effect of age is strongest near the vaccination date and appears to decrease with time. Obesity was associated with lower antibody response. Gender had no effect on NAbs at nine months, but there was a modest association at earlier time points. Participants with autoimmune disease had lower inhibitory levels than participants without autoimmune disease. K-Means clustering showed the natural grouping of subjects into five categories in which the characteristics of some individuals predominated. Random forest allowed the characteristics to be ordered by importance. Older age, higher body mass index, and the presence of autoimmune diseases had negative effects on the development of NAbs against SARS-CoV-2, nine months after full vaccination.","output":"Predictive Factors for Neutralizing Antibody Levels Nine Months after Full Vaccination with BNT162b2: Results of a Machine Learning Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Infants and young children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have acute progressive hypoxic respiratory failure caused by a variety of extrapulmonary pathogenic factors and cardiogenic factors. Diffuse alveolar injury and pulmonary fibrosis both are pathological features of ARDS. This study investigated the effect of Rehmannia Radix extract (RRE) on pulmonary fibrosis of infants with ARDS. MATERIAL AND METHODS The human lung fibroblasts cell line HFL1 was treated with various concentrations of Rehmannia Radix extract in different groups for different times. Flow cytometry and TUNEL assay were performed to detect cell apoptosis, and CCK8 assay was utilized to analyze cell proliferation. TGF-?1 expression was detected by real-time quantitative PCR, and protein-level expressions of Caspase3, TGF-?1, Bcl-2, and Smad3 were measured by western blot and immunohistochemical staining in cells or tissues. TGF-?1 was overexpressed by recombinant human TGF-?1 (2 ng/mL) and the treated cells and culture supernatant were harvested for analysis in each step. Bleomycin was used to induce a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and was confirmed by HE pathological sections. RESULTS Flow cytometry and TUNEL results showed that RRE promoted the apoptosis of HFL1 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and it inhibited the proliferation of HFL1 cells. Upregulation of TGF-?1 reversed the effects of RRE in HFL1 cells. RRE alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in mice through downregulating Bcl-2, TGF-?1, and Smad3 expression. CONCLUSIONS RRE promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HFL1, and then arrested the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. RRE had a significant inhibitory effect on TGF-?1 and Smad3. These results suggest that RRE directly prevents the development of pulmonary fibrosis by affecting the expression of TGF-?1 and Smad3.","output":"Rehmannia Radix Extract Relieves Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice via Transforming Growth Factor 1 (TGF-1)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) (connexin 26) variants are commonly implicated in non-syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI).

To date, in the African continent, GJB2-p.(Arg143Trp) has only been reported in Ghana. Using whole-exome sequencing data from 32 individuals from 16 families segregating NSHI, and 38 unrelated hearing controls with the same ethnolinguistic background, we investigated the date and origin of p.(Arg143Trp) in Ghana using linked markers. With a Bayesian linkage disequilibrium gene mapping method, we estimated GJB2-p.(Arg143Trp) to have originated about 9625 years (385 generations) ago in Ghana. A haplotype analysis comparing data extracted from Ghanaians and those from the 1000 Genomes project revealed that GJB2-p.(Arg143Trp) is carried on different haplotype backgrounds in Ghanaian and Japanese populations, as well as among populations of European ancestry, lending further support to the multiple independent origins of the variant. In addition, we found substantial haplotype conservation in the genetic background of Ghanaian individuals with biallelic GJB2-p.(Arg143Trp) compared to the GJB2-p.(Arg143Trp)-negative group with normal hearing from Ghana, suggesting a strong evolutionary constraint in this genomic region in Ghanaian populations that are homozygous for GJB2-p.(Arg143Trp).

In this respect, perceptual-cognitive factors like decision making have been proposed to be important predictor of talent but, however, assessing decision making in team sports remains a challenging endeavor. In particular, it is now known that decisions expressed by verbal reports or micro-movements in the laboratory differ from those actually made in on-field situations in play. To address this point, our study compared elite and amateur players decision-making behavior in a near-game test environment including sport-specific sensorimotor responses. Team-handball players (N = 44) were asked to respond as quickly as possible to representative, temporally occluded attack sequences in a team-handball specific defense environment on a contact plate system. Specifically, participants had to choose and perform the most appropriate out of four prespecified, defense response actions. The frequency of responses and decision time were used as dependent variables representing decision-making behavior. We found that elite players responded significantly more often with offensive responses (p < 0.05, odds ratios: 2.76C3.00) in left-handed attack sequences. Decision time decreased with increasing visual information, but no expertise effect was found. We suppose that expertise-related knowledge and processing of kinematic information led to distinct decision-making behavior between elite and amateur players, evoked in a domain-specific and near-game test setting. Results also indicate that the quality of a decision might be of higher relevance than the required time to decide. Findings illustrate application opportunities in the context of performance analyses and talent identification processes.","output":"Differences in Decision-Making Behavior Between Elite and Amateur Team-Handball Players in a Near-Game Test Situation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Since the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), patients with the illness have presented with considerable variation in severity. Some infected individuals present mild or no symptoms, while others present severe illness with some fatal outcomes. Multiple lines of management have been suggested for critically ill patients, such as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and steroids. IVIG is the main treatment for patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Multiple studies have reported that these patients have excellent outcomes when they contract COVID-19. This report describes the clinical course of COVID-19 pneumonia due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a 19-year-old man on IVIG replacement therapy for X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). CASE REPORT A patient with XLA receiving a monthly dose of IVIG and having bronchiectasis managed by prophylactic azithromycin presented with fever, shortness of breath, productive cough, and diarrhea. He was admitted to our hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection. His treatment course for COVID-19 was uncomplicated and had excellent results. He completed a 10-day course of piperacillin/tazobactam and his symptoms resolved 3 days after admission, without complications, oxygen supplementation, or intensive care unit admission. CONCLUSIONS Patients with XLA have weakened immunity and therefore may present with an infection as a first symptom. This report describes the mild course of COVID-19 pneumonia in an immunologically vulnerable patient with XLA who presented with SARS-CoV-2 infection while undergoing IVIG replacement therapy. Currently, IVIG is one of many supportive immune therapies undergoing clinical evaluation in patients with severe COVID-19.","output":"The Clinical Course of COVID-19 Pneumonia in a 19-Year-Old Man on Intravenous Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy for X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers is variable throughout the world.

To describe the characteristics of fake news about COVID-19 disseminated in Brazil from January to June 2020. METHOD. The fake news recorded until 30 June 2020 in two websites (Globo Corporation website G1 and Ministry of Health) were collected and categorized according to their content. From each piece of fake news, the following information was extracted: publication date, title, channel (e.g., WhatsApp), format (text, photo, video), and website in which it was recorded. Terms were selected from fake news titles for analysis in Google Trends to determine whether the number of searches using the selected terms had increased after the fake news appeared. The Brazilian regions with the highest percent increase in searches using the terms were also identified. RESULTS. In the two websites, 329 fake news about COVID-19 were retrieved. Most fake news were spread through WhatsApp and Facebook. The most frequent thematic categories were: politics (20.1%), epidemiology and statistics (e.g., proportion of cases and deaths) (19.5%), and prevention (16.1%).

This trend can increase and smooth the flow of social capital, which is a potential resource in supply chains and can affect supply chain performance in healthcare industry. However, such an issue has not been properly recognized as the best practice in healthcare industry. Thus, this study investigates empirically the relationship between digitalization and supply chain performance in healthcare manufacturing companies based on previous research that proposed a role for social capital.

We found that digitalization has a positive effect on the formation of social capital, which in turn has a positive effect on supply chain performance. The direct effect of digitalization on supply chain performance is small, and relatively large portions are mediated and influenced by social capital. The establishment of strategic relationships in the healthcare manufacturing industry is significant, as supply chain networks and production processes can influence the intended use of factory output. Companies should, therefore, secure timely and accurate information to manage the flow of products and services.

Also, modulation of FTO and STAT-3 mRNA expression by A. muricata was investigated in high fat diet induced obese rats (HFDR) using RT-PCR. RESULTS: A significant up-regulation of FTO gene was observed in HFDR when compared to control rats, while administration of A. muricata (200 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.05) down-regulated FTO gene expression when compared to HFDR group. The effect of obesity on STAT-3 gene expression was also reversed by A. muricata (200 mg/kg). In silico study revealed annonaine and annonioside (?9.2 kcal/mol) exhibited the highest binding affinity with FTO, followed by anonaine and isolaureline (?8.6 kcal/mol). Arg-96 is a critical amino acid enhancing anonaine, isolaureline-FTO binding. CONCLUSION: This study suggests the possible anti-obesity mechanism of A. muricata is via down-regulation of FTO with concomitant up-regulation of STAT-3 genes. This study confirmed the use of this plant in the management of obesity and the probable compounds responsible for its antiobesity effect are annonaine and annonioside.","output":"Involvement of fat mass and obesity gene (FTO) in the anti-obesity action of Annona muricata Annonaceae: in silico and in vivo studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The basic principle of graph rewriting is the stepwise replacement of subgraphs inside a host graph.

One of the serious concerns is developing loneliness and post-traumatic stress symptoms, which may contribute to cognitive decline at older ages. This study aimed to examine the psychological responses and loneliness in elderly patients diagnosed with dementia. METHODS: Twenty-one patients diagnosed with dementia, with ages older than 40, and 19 caregivers were enrolled in the study. The patients have undergone a comprehensive neuropsychiatric interview and were assessed with De Jong Gierveld Scale for loneliness and Impact of Event ScaleRevised (IES-R). The severity of dementia was assessed by Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST Scale) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). RESULTS: No significant difference was seen in patients and caregivers in the IES-R and loneliness scales. A higher level of avoidance and social and total loneliness were seen in higher FAST levels (p-value: 0.046). There was a negatively significant correlation between MoCA score and avoidance. Hyperarousal was significantly correlated with emotional loneliness in patients. CONCLUSION: We found a direct relationship between cognitive decline and the psychological impacts of COVID-19. Our results highlight the need for more comprehensive studies to further investigate the influence of the pandemic on the worsening of cognitive impairment and loneliness in patients with dementia.","output":"Relationship Between Psychological Impacts of COVID-19 and Loneliness in Patients With Dementia: A Cross-Sectional Study From Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE: Hydroxychloroquine has excellent anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects as one of the antimalarial drugs. In particular, hydroxychloroquine was once widely used as a treatment for the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in 2020. Retinopathy caused by hydroxychloroquine is normally irreversible, but little attention has been paid to it. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 38-year-old young Chinese woman was taking oral hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily to control lupus disease activity for six years after the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She did not have any history of eye disease and was admitted to the hospital with a sudden blurring of both eyes. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis of retinal macular degeneration caused by hydroxychloroquine was made after excluding other interfering diseases based on the patient's long-term use of hydroxychloroquine and the results of the eye examination. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was discontinued from hydroxychloroquine. To control the recurrence of SLE, she was given intravenous methylprednisolone, oral tacrolimus and mycophenolate. Meanwhile, she was asked to take extra care of her eyes and to come to the hospital every three months to have her vision checked. OUTCOMES: The patient's blurred vision improved one week later. Three months later, her vision examination showed no further decline (0.4 in the right eye and 0.6 in the left eye). Meanwhile, the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) decreased from six points to five points currently. LESSONS: Retinopathy caused by hydroxychloroquine is irreversible and there is no particularly effective treatment. Discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine, better daily eye protection, and regular vision checks are the keys to preventing retinopathy. Although hydroxychloroquine causing retinal toxicity was mentioned several years ago, the rate and severity of retinal toxicity require further research. How to get more patients to take care of their eyes requires continuous and increased education by doctors.","output":"Retinal toxicity caused by hydroxychloroquine in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Rapid data sharing can maximize the utility of data. In epidemics and pandemics like Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19, the case for such practices seems especially urgent and warranted. Yet rapidly sharing data widely has previously generated significant concerns related to equity. The continued lack of understanding and guidance on equitable data sharing raises the following questions: Should data sharing in epidemics and pandemics primarily advance utility, or should it advance equity as well? If so, what norms comprise equitable data sharing in epidemics and pandemics? Do these norms address the equity-related concerns raised by researchers, data providers, and other stakeholders? What tensions must be balanced between equity and other values? METHODS: To explore these questions, we undertook a systematic scoping review of the literature on data sharing in epidemics and pandemics and thematically analyzed identified literature for its discussion of ethical values, norms, concerns, and tensions, with a particular (but not exclusive) emphasis on equity. We wanted to both understand how equity in data sharing is being conceptualized and draw out other important values and norms for data sharing in epidemics and pandemics. RESULTS: We found that values of utility, equity, solidarity, and reciprocity were described, and we report their associated norms, including researcher recognition; rapid, real-time sharing; capacity development; and fair benefits to data generators, data providers, and source countries. The value of utility and its associated norms were discussed substantially more than others. Tensions between utility norms (e.g., rapid, real-time sharing) and equity norms (e.g., researcher recognition, equitable access) were raised. CONCLUSIONS: This study found support for equity being advanced by data sharing in epidemics and pandemics. However, norms for equitable data sharing in epidemics and pandemics require further development, particularly in relation to power sharing and participatory approaches prioritizing inclusion. Addressing structural inequities in the wider global health landscape is also needed to achieve equitable data sharing in epidemics and pandemics.

More specifically, publicly available datasets containing Chest X-Ray (CXR) of Pneumonia diseases (including COVID-19) usually have an imbalanced class distribution. This dataset imbalance causes automatic diagnosis systems to classify majority classes with much more accuracy than the minority ones. Several resampling algorithms were proposed in the past to deal with the class imbalance issue. Hierarchical classifiers have also been proposed to increase the predictive performance of classifiers, but there is little research in the literature verifying if using existing resampling algorithms with hierarchical classifiers are a good alternative to improve classification performance. This work proposes an experimental classification schema to investigate the effectiveness of using resampling algorithms in the identification of COVID-19 and other types of Pneumonia through CXR images. The proposed schema uses resampling algorithms to rebalance the class distribution, in a Local Hierarchical Classification scenario. The experimental evaluation, which is supported by inferential statistical analysis, showed that using specific resampling algorithms with Local Hierarchical Classifiers brings a statistically significant increase to the macro-averaged F1-Score, and improves the predictive performance for the minority classes.","output":"Analyzing the Impact of Resampling Approaches on Chest X-Ray Images for COVID-19 Identification in a Local Hierarchical Classification Scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a novel class of projected methods, to perform statistical analysis on a data set of probability distributions on the real line, with the 2-Wasserstein metric.

By carefully choosing the tangent point, we are able to derive fast empirical methods, exploiting a constrained B-spline approximation. As a byproduct of our approach, we are also able to derive faster routines for previous work on PCA for distributions. By means of simulation studies, we compare our approaches to previously proposed methods, showing that our projected PCA has similar performance for a fraction of the computational cost and that the projected regression is extremely flexible even under misspecification.

While infection numbers are monitored and measures adjusted, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and socioeconomic life in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. Methods: In a mathematical model, we determine the efficacy of regional containment strategies, where contact restrictions are triggered locally in individual regions upon crossing critical infection number thresholds. Our stochastic meta-population model distinguishes between contacts within a region and cross-regional contacts. We use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, including the effects of their individual national lockdowns, and county population sizes obtained from census data to define individual regions. As a performance measure, we determine the number of days citizens will experience contact restrictions over the next 5 years ('restriction time') and compare it to an equivalent national lockdown strategy. To extract crucial parameters, we vary the proportion of cross-regional contacts (between 0% and 100%), the thresholds for initiating local measures (between 5 and 20 active infections per 100,000 inhabitants) as well as their duration after infection numbers have returned below the threshold (between 7 and 28 days). We compare performance across the five different countries and test how further subdivision of large counties into independently controlled regions of up to 100,000 or 200,000 inhabitants affects the results. Findings: Our numerical simulations show a substantially reduced restriction time for regional containment, if the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 without restrictions, R 0, is only slightly larger than 1 and the proportion of cross-regional contacts (the so-called leakiness) is low. In Germany, specifically, for R 0=1.14, a leakiness of 1% is sufficiently low to reduce the mean restriction time from 468 days (s.d. 3 days) for the national containment strategy to 43 days (s.d. 3 days across simulations) for the regional strategy, when local measures are initiated at 10 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 7 days. For R 0=1.28, the allowed leakiness for minimal restriction time reduces to approximately 0.3%. The dependence of the restriction time on the leakiness is threshold-like only for regional containment, due to cooperative effects. It rises to levels similar to the national containment strategy for a leakiness > 10% (517 days national vs. 486 days regional for leakiness 32% and R 0=1.14). We find a strong correlation between the population size of each region and the experienced restriction time. For countries with large counties, this can result in only a mild reduction in restriction time for regional containment, which can only be partly compensated by lower thresholds for initiating local measures and increasing their duration. In contrast, further subdividing large counties into smaller units can ensure a strong reduction of the restriction time for the regional strategy. Interpretation: The leakiness, i.e. the proportion of cross-regional contacts, and the regional structure itself were crucial parameters for the performance of the regional strategy. Therefore, regional strategies could offer an adaptive way to contain the epidemic with fewer overall restrictions, if cross-regional infections can be kept below the critical level, which could be achieved without affecting local socioeconomic freedom. Maintaining general hygiene and contact tracing, testing should be intensified to ensure regional measures can be initiated at low infection thresholds, preventing the spread of the disease to other regions before local elimination. While such tight control could lead to more restrictions in the short run, restrictions necessary for long-term containment could be reduced by up to a factor of 10. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries.

Yet the impact of depression on social cognition and functioning is not well understood. Assessment of social cognition is crucial not only for a better understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD), but also for screening, intervention, and remediation. Here by applying a novel experimental tool, a Face-n-Food task comprising a set of images bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we assessed the face tuning in patients with MDD and person-by-person matched controls. The key benefit of these images is that single components do not trigger face processing. Contrary to common beliefs, the outcome indicates that individuals with depression express intact face responsiveness. Yet, while in depression face sensitivity is tied with perceptual organization, in typical development, it is knotted with social cognition capabilities. Face tuning in depression, therefore, may rely upon altered behavioral strategies and underwriting brain mechanisms. To exclude a possible camouflaging effect of female social skills, we examined gender impact. Neither in depression nor in typical individuals had females excelled in face tuning. The outcome sheds light on the origins of the face sensitivity and alterations in social functioning in depression and mental well-being at large. Aberrant social functioning in depression is likely to be the result of deeply-rooted maladaptive strategies rather than of poor sensitivity to social signals.

In the absence of a gold standard in France, the objective of our study was to validate our 5-level pediatric triage tool CpediaTRIC against the reference tool: the Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEWS) System. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively included 100,506 children who visited the Pediatric Emergency Department at Lenval Children's Hospital (Nice, France) in 2016 and 2017. The performance of pediaTRI to identify high-level emergencies (severity levels 1 and 2) was evaluated in comparison with a PEWS  4/9. Data from 2018C19 was used as an independent validation cohort. RESULTS: pediaTRI agreed with the PEWS score for 84,896 of the patients (84.5%): 15.0% (14.8C15.2) of the patients were over-triaged and 0.5% (0.5C0.6) under-triaged compared with the PEWS score. pediaTRI had a sensitivity of 76.4% (74.6C78.2), a specificity of 84.7% (84.4C84.9), and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 5.0 (4.8C5.1) and 0.3 (0.3C0.3), respectively, for the identification of high-level emergencies.

This paper describes an approach for doing this using the best available evidence combined with consultation to establish evidence priorities. We first reviewed PHC organisational interventions in Asia-Pacific LMICs and ascertained evidence gaps. The largest gaps related to interventions to promote access to essential medicines, patient management tools, effective health promotion strategies and service planning and accountability. Evidence from Pacific Island countries was particularly scant. We then engaged an expert panel of 22 PHC stakeholders from seven Asia-Pacific LMICs in a Delphi exercise to identify priority questions for future research. Research priorities were: (1) identifying effective PHC service delivery models for chronic diseases; (2) devising sustainable models of disease integration; (3) optimising task shifting; (4) understanding barriers to care continuity; (5) projecting future PHC needs; and (6) designing appropriate PHC service packages. Notably, stakeholder-determined priorities reflected large, context-dependent system issues, while evidence gaps centred on discrete interventions.

The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity, including admission to the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal and perinatal death, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. All outcomes were assessed in high- and low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered high risk in case of either preexisting chronic medical conditions in pregnancy or obstetrical disorders occurring in pregnancy. The Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data.

However, such association was mainly because of the higher incidence of miscarriage in high-risk pregnancies compared with that in low-risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, P=.008); furthermore, there was no difference in other explored outcomes between the 2 study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22; P=.023) and high-risk pregnancy (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-5.11; P<.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcomes.

We sought to determine whether bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from patients with lung injury contained mediators that would activate procollagen I promoter and if this activation predicted important clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study of ALI/ARDS. SETTING: Intensive care units and laboratory of a university hospital. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Acute lung injury/ARDS, cardiogenic edema (negative controls) and pulmonary fibrosis (positive controls) patients. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected within 48 h of intubation from ALI/ARDS patients. BALF was also collected from patients with pulmonary fibrosis and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Human lung fibroblasts were transfected with a procollagen I promoter-luciferase construct and incubated with BALF; procollagen I promoter activity was then measured. BALF active TGF-1 levels were measured by ELISA. RESULTS: Twenty-nine ARDS patients, nine negative and six positive controls were enrolled. BALF from ARDS patients induced 41% greater procollagen I promoter activation than that from negative controls (p<0.05) and a TGF-1 blocking antibody significantly reduced this activation in ARDS patients. There was a trend toward higher TGF-1 levels in the ARDS group compared to negative controls (?1.056 log(10)0.1415 vs ?1.505 log(10)0.1425) (p<0.09). Procollagen I promoter activation was not associated with mortality; however, lower TGF-1 levels were associated with more ventilator-free and ICU-free days. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from ALI/ARDS patients activates procollagen I promoter, which is due partly to TGF-1. Activated TGF-1 may impact ARDS outcome independent of its effect on procollagen I activation.

A key change in NBA rules was the implementation of the three-point (3PT) line in the 1979C1980 season. Recently a popular conception claims that NBA is passing through a 3PT revolution; however, few works have discussed the evolution of shot patterns in the NBA. Thus, in this article NBA shot data per 100 possessions for each player from all seasons since implementation of the 3PT line were gathered to compare 2PT and 3PT shot statistics, aiming to understand how the shot pattern evolved throughout the NBA history. The results show that the main differences in shot patterns happened due to modifications in the 3PT line distance. The only exception was the statistically significant increase of 3PT attempts (3PTA) in the 1986C1987 season, a likely result of the success of the first 3PT contest in the previous season, which probably led most players to attempt this kind of shot. Also, the results did not show any season-by-season statistically significant change in shot patterns after the 3PT line distance was returned to its original distance in the 1997C1998 season. Thus, the actual popularity and numbers of 3PTA gradually increased throughout the seasons.

This receptor, when complexed with interleukin-6, associates with the signalling receptor glycoprotein 130 kDa (gp130), which becomes dimerised and initiates intracellular signalling via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription and rat sarcoma proto oncogene/mitogen-activated protein kinase/phosphoinositide-3 kinase pathways. Physiologically, interleukin-6 is involved in the regulation of haematopoiesis and the coordination of the innate and acquired immune systems. Additionally, interleukin-6 plays an important role in the regulation of metabolism, in neural development and survival, and in the development and maintenance of various cancers.

The use of such observational clinical data for pharmacological hypothesis generation is appealing in the context of an emerging disease but particularly challenging due to the presence of drug indication bias. OBJECTIVE: With this study, our main objective was the development and validation of a fully data-driven pipeline that would address this challenge. Our secondary objective was to generate pharmacological hypotheses in patients with COVID-19 and demonstrate the clinical relevance of the pipeline. METHODS: We developed a pharmacopeia-wide association study (PharmWAS) pipeline inspired from the PheWAS methodology, which systematically screens for associations between the whole pharmacopeia and a clinical phenotype. First, a fully data-driven procedure based on adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) determined drug-specific adjustment sets. Second, we computed several measures of association, including robust methods based on propensity scores (PSs) to control indication bias. Finally, we applied the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure of the false discovery rate (FDR). We applied this method in a multicenter retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from 16 university hospitals of the Greater Paris area. We included all adult patients between 18 and 95 years old hospitalized in conventional wards for COVID-19 between February 1, 2020, and June 15, 2021. We investigated the association between drug prescription within 48 hours from admission and 28-day mortality. We validated our data-driven pipeline against a knowledge-based pipeline on 3 treatments of reference, for which experts agreed on the expected association with mortality. We then demonstrated its clinical relevance by screening all drugs prescribed in more than 100 patients to generate pharmacological hypotheses. RESULTS: A total of 5783 patients were included in the analysis. The median age at admission was 69.2 (IQR 56.7-81.1) years, and 3390 (58.62%) of the patients were male. The performance of our automated pipeline was comparable or better for controlling bias than the knowledge-based adjustment set for 3 reference drugs: dexamethasone, phloroglucinol, and paracetamol. After correction for multiple testing, 4 drugs were associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Among these, diazepam and tramadol were the only ones not discarded by automated diagnostics, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.51 (95% CI 1.52-4.16, Q=.1) and 1.94 (95% CI 1.32-2.85, Q=.02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our innovative approach proved useful in generating pharmacological hypotheses in an outbreak setting, without requiring a priori knowledge of the disease. Our systematic analysis of early prescribed treatments from patients hospitalized for COVID-19 showed that diazepam and tramadol are associated with increased 28-day mortality.

We aimed to assess native aortic valve disease activity and bioprosthetic valve durability in patients with TAVI in comparison with subjects with bioprosthetic surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). METHODS: In a multicenter cross-sectional observational cohort study, patients with TAVI or bioprosthetic SAVR underwent baseline echocardiography, computed tomography angiography, and (18)F-sodium fluoride ((18)F-NaF) positron emission tomography. Participants (n=47) were imaged once with (18)F-NaF positron emission tomography/computed tomography either at 1 month (n=9, 19%), 2 years (n=22, 47%), or 5 years (16, 34%) after valve implantation. Patients subsequently underwent serial echocardiography to assess for changes in valve hemodynamic performance (change in peak aortic velocity) and evidence of structural valve dysfunction. Comparisons were made with matched patients with bioprosthetic SAVR (n=51) who had undergone the same imaging protocol. RESULTS: In patients with TAVI, native aortic valves demonstrated (18)F-NaF uptake around the outside of the bioprostheses that showed a modest correlation with the time from TAVI (r=0.36, P=0.023). (18)F-NaF uptake in the bioprosthetic leaflets was comparable between the SAVR and TAVI groups (target-to-background ratio, 1.3 [1.2C1.7] versus 1.3 [1.2C1.5], respectively; P=0.27). The frequencies of imaging evidence of bioprosthetic valve degeneration at baseline were similar on echocardiography (6% versus 8%, respectively; P=0.78), computed tomography (15% versus 14%, respectively; P=0.87), and positron emission tomography (15% versus 29%, respectively; P=0.09).

However, in 2019, the French Hospitals Federation launched a pilot program to experiment PHM in five territories around five Territorial Hospital Groups (GHTs). In order to implement PHM, it is necessary to firstly define the population which healthcare facilities (hospitals) have responsibility for. In the French healthcare system, mapping of health territories however relies mainly on administrative data criteria which do not fit with the actual implementation of GHTs. Mapping for the creation of territorial hospital groups (GHTs) also did not include medical criteria nor all healthcare offers particularly in private hospitals and primary care services, who are not legally part of GHTs but are major healthcare providers. The objective of this study was to define the French population groups for PHM per hospital group. METHODS: A database study based on DRG (acute care, post-acute and rehabilitation, psychiatry and home care) from the French National Hospitals Database was conducted. Data included all hospital stays from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2017. The main outcome of this study was to create mutually exclusive territories that would reflect an accurate national healthcare service consumption.

Serum profile of 12 cytokines (IL-1, -2, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12, -13, -17, -18, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-), interferon-gamma (IFN-), and sIL-6R were assessed in these two groups. Although the increased IL-6 concentrations after TCZ infusion were expected, we observed an unexpected increase in IL-1, -2, -4, -10, -12p70, -18, and sIL-6R levels in the treated patients with maximal values reaching 2 to 4 days after TCZ. In contrast, no change in cytokine levels was observed in the control group. Our results suggested that some inflammatory pathways escape IL-6R blockade and even appeared amplified. This finding highlights an old observation of the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-6 as already suggested over 20 years ago.

However, little is known about the virus-host interaction of COVID-19 in sperm cells. We are the first to address the connection between changes in multiple seminal biomarkers and reproductive function in male patients recovering from COVID-19. In a prospective longitudinal cohort study, seminal ACE2 activity, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, apoptotic variables, and semen quality parameters were evaluated at 10-day intervals for a maximum follow-up time of 60 days among male patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 84) and healthy controls (CON; n = 105). At the baseline and the subsequent follow-ups, the COVID-19 group revealed significantly higher levels of seminal plasma ACE2 enzymatic activity, IL-1?, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGF-?, TNF-&#945;, IFN-&#945;, IFN-?3, ROS, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activity as well as lower levels of SOD activity than those in the CON group (P < 0.05). These perturbations tended to persist over time and were correlated with significant impairments in semen volume, progressive motility, sperm morphology, sperm concentration, and the number of spermatozoa. We provide the direct experimental evidence that the male reproductive system could be targeted and damaged by the COVID-19 infection. These findings go beyond our current understanding of the disease, suggesting that the reproductive function of the patients recovering from the disease should be precisely followed and evaluated to detect and avoid more serious reproductive problems in the future, as they may develop a transient state of male subfertility like those with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia.","output":"COVID-19 and male reproductive function: a prospective, longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current pandemic of COVID-19 has caused severe morbidity and mortality across the globe.

However, evidence of the efficacy of TENS treatment for neuropathic pain is lacking in humans. To further understand the efficacy of TENS under various intervention conditions and illuminate the current circumstance and future research directions, we systematically reviewed animal studies investigating the efficacy of TENS in relieving pain in neuropathic pain rodent models. We searched the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE (via PubMed), and Web of Science and identified 11 studies. Two meta-analyses were performed. The first meta-analysis showed that a single TENS treatment was capable of temporarily ameliorating neuropathic pain when compared to control groups with a significant effect (standardized mean difference: 1.54; 95% CI: 0.65, 2.42; p = 0.0007; I 2 = 58%). Significant temporary alleviation in neuropathic pain intensity was also observed in the meta-analysis of repetitive TENS (standardized mean difference: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.31, 1.40; p = 0.002; I 2 = 75%). Subgroup analysis showed no effect of the timing of the application of TENS (test for subgroup difference, p = 0.47). Leave-one-out sensitivity analyses suggested that no single study had an outsized effect on the pooled estimates, which may partly prove the robustness of these findings. Other stratified analyses were prevented by the insufficient number of included studies. Overall, current data suggest that TENS might be a promising therapy to ameliorate neuropathic pain. However, the high risk of bias in the included studies suggests that cautions must be considered when interpreting these findings and it is not reasonable to directly generalize the results obtained from animal studies to clinical practice. Future studies should pay more attention to improving the quality of study design and reporting, thereby facilitating the understanding of mechanisms underlying TENS treatment, reducing more potentially unsuccessful clinical trials, and optimizing the efficacy of TENS for people with neuropathic pain.","output":"Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation in Rodent Models of Neuropathic Pain: A Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is devoted to the analysis of procedural time limits transformation under pandemic conditions implemented in the legislation of Ukraine during the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, as well as the practice of their application in national courts.

Twenty-two members of the study team collaborated in protocol refinement and completed the PRECIS-2 ratings of study pragmatism. We discuss study design and refinements to achieve the desired level of pragmatism vs. experimental control for each of the nine PRECIS-2 dimensions. Study team members received training on PRECIS-2 scoring and were asked to rate the study protocol on the nine PRECIS-2 dimensions. Ratings are compared using descriptive statistics. Results: In general, the PRECIS-2 ratings revealed high levels of pragmatism, but somewhat less pragmatic ratings on the categories of Delivery and Organization (costs and resources). This variation was purposeful, and we provide the rationale for and steps taken to obtain the targeted level of pragmatism on each PRECIS-2 dimension, as well as detail design changes made to enhance pragmatism and address COVID-19 issues. There was general agreement among team members and across different types of stakeholders on PRECIS-2 ratings. Conclusions: We discuss lessons learned from use of PRECIS-2 and challenges in refining the study to be maximally pragmatic on some dimensions, yet well controlled on other dimensions.

Methods: Following epidemiological investigation, 1,429 patients preparing to undergo anti-tumor-treatment underwent CT scans between February 17 and April 16, 2020. When CT findings showed suspected COVID-19 pneumonia after the supervisor radiologist and the thoracic experience radiologist had double-read the initial CT images, radiologists would report the result to our hospital infection control staff. Further necessary examinations, including the RT-PCR test, in the assigned hospital was strongly recommended for patients with positive CT results. The CT examination room would perform sterilization for 30 min to 1 h. If the negative results of any suspected COVID-19 pneumonia CT findings were identified, the radiologists would upload the results to our Hospital Information Systems and inform clinicians within 2 h. Results: Fifty (0.35%, 50/1,429) suspected pneumonia cases, including 29 males and 21 females (median age: 59.5 years old;age range 27C79 years), were identified. A total of 34.0% (17/50) of the patients had a history of lung cancer and 54.0 (27/50) underwent chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Forty-six patients (92.0%) had prior CT scans, and 35 patients (76.1%) with suspected pneumonia were newly seen (median interval time: 62 days). Sub-pleura small patchy or strip-like lesions most likely due to fibrosis or hypostatic pneumonia and cluster of nodular lesions were the two main signs of suspected cases on CT images (34, 68.0%).

METHODS: The CONCEPTION study was a cohort, multidisciplinary study conducted at Conception University Hospital, in France, from March 17th to May 11th, 2020. Our study included all adult patients who underwent minor surgery in one of the seven surgical departments of our hospital: urology, digestive, plastic, gynecological, otolaryngology, gynecology or maxillofacial surgery. Preoperative self-isolation, clinical assessment using a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, nasopharyngeal RT-PCR and chest CT scan performed the day before surgery were part of our active prevention strategy. The main outcome was the occurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection within 21 days following surgery. The COVID-19 status of patients after discharge was updated during the postoperative consultation and to ensure the accuracy of data, all patients were contacted again by telephone. RESULTS: A total of 551 patients from six different specialized surgical Departments in our tertiary care center were enrolled in our study. More than 99% (546/551) of included patients underwent a complete preoperative Covid-19 screening including RT-PCR testing and chest CT scan upon admission to the Hospital. All RT-PCR tests were negative and in 12 cases (2.2%), preoperative chest CT scans detected pulmonary lesions consistent with the diagnosis criteria for COVID-19. No scheduled surgery was postponed. One patient (0.2%) developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 20 days after a renal transplantation. No readmission or COVID-19 -related death within 30 days from surgery was recorded.

Yet, data on workload dynamics concerning atrial fibrillation and electrical cardioversion whilst a national lockdown are scarce and may assist in future planning. Methods: Documented cases of atrial fibrillation and respective electrical cardioversion episodes at the Emergency Department of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria, from 01/01/2020 to 31/05/2020 were assessed. As reference groups, those incidences were calculated for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Inter- and intra-year analyses were conducted through Chi-square test and Poisson regression. Results: A total of 2,310 atrial fibrillation-, and 511 electrical cardioversion episodes were included. We found no significant incidence differences in inter-year analyses of the time periods from January to May, or of the weeks pre- and post the national lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the intra-year analysis of the year 2020 showed a trend toward decreased atrial fibrillation incidences (rate-ratio 0.982, CI 0.964C1.001, p = 0.060), and significantly increased electrical cardioversion incidences in the post-lockdown period (rate ratio 1.051, CI 1.008C10.96, p = 0.020). Conclusion: The decreased atrial fibrillation incidences are in line with international data. However, an increased demand of electrical cardioversions during the lockdown period was observed. A higher threshold to seek medical attention may produce a selected group with potentially more severe clinical courses. In addition, lifestyle modifications during isolation and a higher stress level may promote atrial fibrillation episodes to be refractory to other therapeutic approaches than electrical cardioversion.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Incidences of Atrial Fibrillation and Electrical Cardioversion at a Tertiary Care Emergency Department: An Inter- and Intra-year Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disproportionate negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Native communities is a result of transgenerational traumas-mental and physical-which have been ongoing and developing for centuries.

METHODS Patients who underwent endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFTR) for lower gastrointestinal tract lesions using the FTRD at 26 US tertiary care centers between 10/2017 and 12/2018 were included. Primary outcome was R0 resection rate. Secondary outcomes included rate of technical success (en bloc resection), achievement of histologic full-thickness resection (FTR), and adverse events (AE). RESULTS A total of 95 patients (mean age 65.5  12.6 year, 38.9% F) were included. The most common indication, for use of FTRD, was resection of difficult adenomas (non-lifting, recurrent, residual, or involving appendiceal orifice/diverticular opening) (66.3%), followed by adenocarcinomas (22.1%), and subepithelial tumors (SET) (11.6%). Lesions were located in the proximal colon (61.1%), distal colon (18.9%), or rectum (20%). Mean lesion diameter was 15.5  6.4 mm and 61.1% had a prior resection attempt.

Anticoagulation is now recommended to reduce the thrombotic risk. Ilio-psoas haematoma (IPH) is a potentially lethal condition that can arise during the hospitalization, especially in intensive care units (ICUs) and frequently reported as a complication of anticoagulation treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report a case series of seven subjects with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia complicated by Ilio-psoas haematomas (IPHs) at our COVID-Hospital in Rome, Italy. RESULTS: Over the observation period, 925 subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our COVID-hospital. Among them, we found seven spontaneous IPHs with an incidence of 7.6 cases per 1000 hospitalization. All the reported cases had a severe manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia, with at least one comorbidity and 5/7 were on treatment with low weight molecular heparin for micro or macro pulmonary thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Given the indications to prescribe anticoagulant therapy in COVID-19 and the lack of solid evidences on the optimal dose and duration, it is important to be aware of the iliopsoas haematoma as a potentially serious complication in COVID-19 inpatients.

Several vaccines have been authorized by WHO, FDA, or MOH of different countries. However, issues such as need for cold chain, price, and most importantly access problems have limited vaccine usage in some nations especially developing countries. Moreover, the vast global demand justifies further attempts for vaccine development. Multi-epitope polypeptide vaccines enjoy several key features including safety and lower production and transfer costs and could be designed by in silico tools. Spike protein (S), membrane protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N), the three major structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, are ideal candidates for epitope selection. ORF3a (open reading frame3a), a transmembrane protein with pro-apoptotic functions, could be another proper target. Thus, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed using these four proteins and LL37, a TLR3 agonist adjuvant, through different immunoinformatics and bioinformatics tools. The proposed multi-epitope vaccine is expected to induce robust humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with a population coverage of 76.92 % due to containing different immunodominant epitopes and LL37 adjuvant. Selecting epitopes derived from one functional and three structural proteins suggests the protective ability of the vaccine irrespective of probable virus mutations. The computationally observed proper interaction of LL37 with TLR3 implies its ability to induce immune responses effectively. Besides, it showed acceptable structural and physicochemical properties. The in-silico cloning results predicted its high efficiency production in Escherichia coli. Future experimental studies could further confirm its immunological efficacy.

This decontextualised vision of life as property works to exclude populations and patients from playing a significant role in determining the use of technologies and treatments.

We compared the ability of the hematological and biochemical features of 84 patients with NCIP at hospital admission and 316 patients with CAP. Parameters independently predictive of NCIP were calculated by multivariate logistic regression. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured to evaluate the discriminative ability. Results. Most hematological and biochemical indexes of patients with NCIP were significantly different from patients with CAP. Nine laboratory parameters were identified to be highly predictive of a diagnosis of NCIP by multivariate analysis. The AUCs demonstrated good discriminatory ability for red cell distribution width (RDW) with an AUC of 0.88 and Hemoglobin (HGB) with an AUC of 0.82. Red blood cell (RBC), albumin (ALB), eosinophil (EO), hematocrit (HCT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and white blood cell (WBC) had fair discriminatory ability.

At study admission, the patients with pneumonia had nearly 3-fold higher protein carbonyl concentrations relative to the patients with other sources of sepsis (435 vs 157 pmol/mg protein, p < 0.0001). The septic patients had deficient vitamin C status at baseline (9.8  1.4 mol/L). This increased to 456  90 mol/L following three days of intravenous vitamin C intervention. Vitamin C intervention did not attenuate the increase in protein carbonyl concentrations. CONCLUSIONS Circulating protein carbonyls are specifically elevated in critically ill patients with pneumonia relative to other sources of sepsis. The reasons for this are currently unclear and may indicate a mechanism unique to pulmonary sources of sepsis. Intravenous vitamin C administration did not attenuate the increase in protein carbonyls over time.","output":"Circulating protein carbonyls are specifically elevated in critically ill patients with pneumonia relative to other sources of sepsis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of autopsies in medicine has been declining. The COVID-19 pandemic has documented and rejuvenated the importance of autopsies as a tool of modern medicine. In this review, we discuss the various autopsy techniques, the applicability of modern analytical methods to understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19, the major pathological organ findings, limitations or current studies, and open questions. This article summarizes published literature and the consented experience of the nationwide network of clinical, neuro-, and forensic pathologists from 27 German autopsy centers with more than 1200 COVID-19 autopsies. The autopsy tissues revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can be found in virtually all human organs and tissues, and the majority of cells. Autopsies have revealed the organ and tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2, and the morphological features of COVID-19. This is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, combined with angiocentric disease, which in turn is characterized by endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, (micro-) thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and intussusceptive angiogenesis. These findings explained the increased pulmonary resistance in COVID-19 and supported the recommendations for antithrombotic treatment in COVID-19. In contrast, in extra-respiratory organs, pathological changes are often nonspecific and unclear to which extent these changes are due to direct infection vs. indirect/secondary mechanisms of organ injury, or a combination thereof. Ongoing research using autopsies aims at answering questions on disease mechanisms, e.g., focusing on variants of concern, and future challenges, such as post-COVID conditions. Autopsies are an invaluable tool in medicine and national and international interdisciplinary collaborative autopsy-based research initiatives are essential.

It has been associated with many extrapulmonary manifestations that can present even in the absence of pulmonary signs and symptoms. Rhabdomyolysis and central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are rare extrapulmonary manifestations. These are infrequently reported in adults. We present a case of a healthy 32-year-old male who initially presented with signs and symptoms of community-acquired pneumonia and was treated with antibiotics. However, he continued to have generalized malaise, night sweats, diffuse joint pain, and myalgias and was subsequently noted to have rhabdomyolysis with elevated creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels. Rhabdomyolysis was attributed to M. pneumoniae based on the recent history of upper respiratory tract infection and M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin M (IgM) serology positivity along with high M. pneumoniae IgG titer. The other causes of rhabdomyolysis were diligently excluded based on patient history and laboratory and clinical data. This immune-mediated rhabdomyolysis improved with intravenous hydration, doxycycline, and prednisone therapy. However, the patient developed progressive weakness with neuropathy, which required treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG). This case highlights the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for rare extrapulmonary manifestations of mycoplasma infection, which could be life-threatening or cause significant morbidity; and in cases of severe extrapulmonary manifestations, the appropriate use of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy may lead to a better outcome.","output":"Rhabdomyolysis and Neurological Manifestation With Progressive Weakness in a Young Adult: A Rare Extrapulmonary Presentation of Mycoplasma Pneumoniae"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wildlife-watching and ecotourism are effective approaches for improving public attitudes and raising awareness of wildlife conservation.

We sampled a total of 197 tourists in Monfort Bat Cave Sanctuary in the Philippines, the world's largest colony of Geoffroy's Rousette (Rousettus amplexicaudatus). Convenient pre/post-visit surveys were conducted to (a) explore the potential of bat-watching to raise tourists knowledge, attitudes towards bats, and determine how perceptions vary across demographic classes;and (b) determine potential predictors of conservation willingness among sampled urban tourists. Our study observed an increase in knowledge about bats and 61% of the tourists are willing to support conservation bat protection after the bat-watching visit to the cave site. Tourists conservation willingness was associated with age group, prior knowledge of bat ecosystem services, and perceptions about the conservation relevance of bat-watching as a conservation initiative. Our study highlights the effectiveness of short-term engagements such as bat-watching at improving human-bat interactions and suggests such programs should focus on highlighting ecosystem services and benefits of bats. However, it should be noted that we performed this study before the COVID-19 global pandemic and misinformation linking bats to the disease spread has increased since. We expect that public perception will change in the post-COVID-19 period and the conservation willingness survey should be repeated to understand how to counter misconceptions to develop effective bat conservation management in the post-COVID-19.","output":"The potential of bat-watching tourism in raising public awareness towards bat conservation in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection is a major global public health threat and in 2019 there were an estimated 58 million infected globally and 290,000 deaths.

Several viruses induce stress granules during the course of infection, but the exact function of these structures during virus replication is not well understood. In this study, we showed that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) induced host stress granules in epithelial cells during the course of infection. We also showed that stress granules are distinct from cytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies and that the RNA binding protein HuR, normally found in stress granules, also localized to viral inclusion bodies during infection. Interestingly, we demonstrated that infected cells containing stress granules also contained more RSV protein than infected cells that did not form inclusion bodies. To address the role of stress granule formation in RSV infection, we generated a stable epithelial cell line with reduced expression of the Ras-GAP SH3 domain-binding protein (G3BP) that displayed an inhibited stress granule response. Surprisingly, RSV replication was impaired in these cells compared to its replication in cells with intact G3BP expression. In contrast, knockdown of HuR by RNA interference did not affect stress granule formation or RSV replication. Finally, using RNA probes specific for RSV genomic RNA, we found that viral RNA predominantly localized to viral inclusion bodies but a small percentage also interacted with stress granules during infection. These results suggest that RSV induces a host stress granule response and preferentially replicates in host cells that have committed to a stress response.","output":"Respiratory syncytial virus induces host RNA stress granules to facilitate viral replication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Balancing work and family demands is often a challenge. Family and job responsibilities may affect many aspects of health, and sleep is an important issue. Work-family conflict (WFC) refers to situations where it is difficult to reconcile family and professional demands. WFC can act in two directions: work-to-family conflicts occur when job demands interfere in family life; family-to-work conflicts arise when family demands interfere with job performance. This study evaluated whether dimensions of WFCtime- and strain-related, work-to-family conflict; family-to-work conflict; and lack of time for self-care and leisure due to work and family demandswere cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with sleep complaints, by gender. Methods: The sample comprised 9,704 active workers (5,057 women and 4,647 men) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). Standardized questionnaires were used to collect data. WFC was measured at baseline (2008C2010), and sleep complaints were measured at baseline and approximately 4 years after the first visit (2012C2014). To test the association between the four WFC dimensions and sleep complaints, crude and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The adjusted model included age, education, marital status, hours worked and work schedule. Results: Mean age at baseline was 48.2 years. Most participants were educated to University degree level (54.5%), married (68.2%) and worked  40 h/week (66.1%). At baseline, 48.3% of women and 41.1% of men reported sleep complaints. Frequent WFC was reported by women and men, respectively, as follows: time-related work-to-family conflict (32.6 and 26.1%), strain-related work-to-family conflict (25.3 and 16.0%), family-to-work conflict (6.6 and 7.6%) and lack of time for self-care (35.2 and 24.7%). For both women and men, time- and strain-related work-to-family conflicts and conflicts for lack of time for self-care were cross-sectionally and longitudinally associated with sleep complaints. The findings also suggest a weaker and non-significant association between family-to-work conflict and sleep complaints. Conclusions: The statistically significant associations observed here underline the importance of reducing WFC.

The pangolin, a species threatened with extinction due to poaching for both culinary purposes and traditional Chinese pharmacopoeia, is now suspected of being the missing link in the transmission to humans of a virus that probably originated in a species of bat. Our predation of wild fauna and the reduction in their habitats have thus ended up creating new interfaces that favour the transmission of pathogens (mainly viruses) to humans. Domesticated animals and wild fauna thus constitute a reservoir for almost 80% of emerging human diseases (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola). These diseases are all zoonotic in origin. As if out of a Chinese fairy tale, the bat and the pangolin have taught us a lesson: within an increasingly interdependent world, environmental crises will become ever more intertwined with health crises. Questions relating to public health will no longer be confined to the secrecy of the physicians consulting room or the sanitised environment of the hospital. They are now being played out in the arena of international trade, ports and airports and distribution networks. Simply put, all human activity creates new interfaces that facilitate the transmission of pathogens from an animal reservoir to humans. This pluri-disciplinary article highlights that environmental changes, such as the reduction in habitats for wild fauna and the intemperate trade in fauna, are the biggest causes of the emergence of new diseases.

Top countries contributing to the dataset included Australia, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia. From 2015 through 2020, the worldwide RSV for the categories of pet, dog and cat adoption peaked between April and May 2020, the early epidemic phase of the pandemic.

RESULTS: Of 44 392 citations, 30 articles reporting on 25 approaches were included, addressing the following fields: health in general (n=9), clinical (n=10), health policy and systems (n=10), public health (n=6) and health service research (n=5) (10 addressed more than 1 field). The approaches proposed the following aspects to be addressed in the prioritisation process: situation analysis/ environmental scan, methods for generation of initial list of topics, use of prioritisation criteria, stakeholder engagement, ranking process/technique, dissemination and implementation, revision and appeal mechanism, and monitoring and evaluation. Twenty-two approaches proposed involving stakeholders in the priority setting process. The most commonly proposed stakeholder category was researchers/academia (n=17, 77%) followed by healthcare providers (n=16, 73%). Fifteen of the approaches proposed a list of criteria for determining research priorities. We developed a common framework of 28 prioritisation criteria clustered into nine domains.

Effective control of this infectious disease requires access to diagnostic techniques, for both case finding and epidemic size estimation. The molecular technique is routinely used worldwide. Although it is the \\"standard\\" case detection and management method, it has its own shortcomings. Thus, some easy-to-use rapid serological tests have been developed. METHODS One hundred and fourteen positive RT-PCR-diagnosed patients were tested by VivaDiag Kit, a brand of rapid serological kits available in hospitals affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. Frozen serum specimens taken from healthy people in summer and fall 2019 were also tested as negative controls. RESULTS Test sensitivity was 47.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 38.8-56.9) for IgM and 47.0% (95% CI: 38.0-56.0) for IgG. There was no difference between IgG and IgM seropositivity except in one case. Specificity was calculated as 99.0% (95% CI: 96.4-99.9) for IgM and of 100.0% (95% CI: 0.98.2-100.0) for IgG. Sensitivity was higher in men and older participants. CONCLUSION This test can be used for epidemiological investigations, especially for the estimation of the level of infection in the community, after it is properly corrected for sensitivity and specificity. The low sensitivity could be attributed to the technical limitations of the kit or low levels of antibodies after infection.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of a multi-strategy implementation strategy delivered at scale, to increase opportunities for outdoor free play in Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) services. METHODS: The study will employ a parallel-group randomised controlled trial design. One hundred ECEC services in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited and randomised to receive either a 6-month implementation strategy or usual care. The trial will seek to increase the implementation of an indoor-outdoor routine (whereby children are allowed to move freely between indoor and outdoor spaces during periods of free play), to increase their opportunity to engage in outdoor free play. Development of the strategy was informed by the Behaviour Change Wheel to address determinants identified in the Theoretical Domains Framework. ECEC services allocated to the control group will receive usual implementation support delivered as part of state-wide obesity prevention programs. The primary trial outcome is the mean minutes/day (calculated across 5 consecutive days) of outdoor free play opportunities provided in ECEC services measured at baseline, 6-months (primary end point) and 18-months post baseline. Analyses will be performed using an intention-to-treat approach with ECEC services as the unit of analysis, using a linear mixed effects regression model to assess between-group differences. A sensitivity analysis will be undertaken, adjusting for service characteristics that appear imbalanced between groups at baseline, and a subgroup analysis examining potential intervention effect among services with the lowest baseline outdoor free play opportunities. DISCUSSION: Identifying effective strategies to support the implementation of indoor-outdoor routines in the ECEC setting at scale is essential to improve child population health.

In agriculture, forestry and related sectors, multi-actor partnerships for co-innovation occur in many forms, from international projects to informal actor configurations. Common attributes are that they include actors with complementary forms of knowledge who collaborate in an innovation process, engage with a larger periphery of stakeholders in the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS) and are shaped by institutions. Using desk research and interviews, we reviewed, according to the Organisational Innovation Systems framework, the performance of 200 co-innovation partnerships from across Europe, selected for their involvement of various actors all along the process. Many of the reviewed partnerships were composed of actors that had previously worked together and most interviewees believed that no relevant actors had been excluded. In almost all cases, project targets and objectives were co-designed to a great or some extent, and the mechanisms applied to foster knowledge sharing between partners were considered to be very effective. Great importance was attached to communication beyond the partnership, not simply for dissemination but also for dialogue, and most interviewees evaluated the communication/outreach performance of their partnership very highly. Most partnerships received external funding, most did not use innovation brokers during the proposal writing process and two thirds had access to information they needed. We discuss the implications of these findings and question whether the AKIS concept as currently interpreted by many policy makers can adequately account for the regional differences encountered by co-innovation partnerships across Europe.","output":"Organisational Innovation Systems for multi-actor co-innovation in European agriculture, forestry and related sectors: Diversity and common attributes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in late 2019 caused many people worldwide to die or suffer from certain clinical complications even after the recovery. The virus has many social and economic adverse effects. Studies on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have specified that spike, surface glycoprotein antigen, is considered as a major target to stimulate the immune system. This glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 on the surface of human cells especially lung epithelial cells and facilitates the virus entry. Therefore, the immune response stimulated by vaccination targeting this antigen may cause immunity against the whole virus. Currently, many companies are working on SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. They include 'traditional' vaccines like attenuated or inactivated virus platforms as well as the brand-new generations of vaccines such as viral vector-based, subunit, nucleic acid-based, and virus-like particle vaccines.

With this in mind, several studies have indicated that glial cells play key roles in the development and progression of CNS diseases. In this sense, gliotoxicity can be referred as the cellular, molecular, and neurochemical changes that can mediate toxic effects or ultimately lead to impairment of the ability of glial cells to protect neurons and/or other glial cells. On the other hand, glioprotection is associated with specific responses of glial cells, by which they can protect themselves as well as neurons, resulting in an overall improvement of the CNS functioning. In addition, gliotoxic events, including metabolic stresses, inflammation, excitotoxicity, and oxidative stress, as well as their related mechanisms, are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of neurological, psychiatric and infectious diseases. However, glioprotective molecules can prevent or improve these glial dysfunctions, representing glial cells-targeting therapies. Therefore, this review will provide a brief summary of types and functions of glial cells and point out cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with gliotoxicity and glioprotection, potential glioprotective molecules and their mechanisms, as well as gliotherapy.

Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with 1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (1825C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37C and 56C, respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories.

METHODS: All patients presenting to the emergency department from 21March 2020 with a musculoskeletal injury or potential musculoskeletal infection deemed to require orthopaedic input were discussed using a secure messaging app. A definitive management plan was communicated by an on-call senior orthopaedic decision-maker. We analyzed the time to decision, if further information was needed, and the referral outcome. An analysis of the orthopaedic referrals for the same period in 2019 was also performed as a comparison. RESULTS: During the study period, 295 patients with mean age of 7.93 years (standard error (SE) 0.24) were reviewed.

Methods: A single center retrospective chart review of 80 heart transplant recipients transplanted between January 2020 and December 2020 was completed. From July 2020 - March 2021, pharmacists called patients within the first year of transplant prior to scheduled provider clinic visits. Patients were not called if they had been called within the prior 4 weeks. Activities from clinic visits before and after pharmacist involvement were compared at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-transplant. The goal of this analysis was to describe the number and types of interventions made by the pharmacist. Results: A total of 100 patients and 272 clinic visits were analyzed, baseline clinical characteristics did not differ in the two cohorts. Pharmacists performed 233 tele-health visits which resulted in 394 interventions from July 2020 - March 2021, summarized in Figure 1. The most common interventions included adverse effect management (34%) and renal dose adjustment (17.8%). An analysis of outpatient visits before and after pharmacist involvement found no significant difference in reported adherence, appropriate renal dosing of medications or reported neurotoxicity (Table 1). Conclusion: Close to 400 interventions were made by our transplant pharmacy team through tele-health visits over a period of 8 months. Use of pre-visit pharmacist tele-health assessments allowed for expansion of clinical pharmacy services while facilitating more focused provider clinic visits. more consistency in clinic may yield improved post-pharmacist outcomes, though further analysis is warranted.","output":"Pharmacist Expansion to Tele-Health Visits in Heart Transplant Clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex cascade that develops from acute lung injury (ALI). Ginseng can be used to treat ALI/ARDS. Studies have shown that some of ingredients in ginseng had anti-inflammation, antioxidative, and immune regulation effects and can protect alveolar epithelial cells in mice. However, the potential targets, biological processes, and pathways related to ginseng against ALI/ARDS have not been investigated systematically. We employed network pharmacology, molecular docking, and animal experiments to explore the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of action of ginseng against ALI/ARDS. We identified 25 compounds using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography Q-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and their 410 putative targets through database analyses. Sixty-nine of them were considered to be key targets of ginseng against ALI/ARDS according to overlapping with ALI/ARDS-related targets and further screening in a proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-AkT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways were recognized to have critical roles for ginseng in ALI/ARDS treatment. Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), MAPK1, and interleukin (IL) 2 were the top six nodes identified by analyses of a compoundCtarget-pathway network. Molecular docking showed that most of the ingredients in ginseng could combine well with the six nodes. Ginseng could reduce the pathologic damage, neutrophil aggregation, proinflammatory factors, and pulmonary edema in vivo and inhibit the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and MAPK signaling pathway through downregulating expressions of STAT3, VEGFA, FGF2, PIK3CA, MAPK1, and IL2.

Many contributors to bile acid synthesis and transport have previously been reported to be downregulated in patients with BA; yet, the driving factors of the abnormal bile acid synthesis and transport in regard to BA have not been previously studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wild type or Ig-&#945;-/- mice were injected with salt solution (control) or rotavirus on day of life 0, and analyses were performed on day of life 14. The mRNA levels of bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors and liver microRNAs (miRNAs) were compared between groups. A mouse hepatocyte cell line was used to examine the effects of innate cytokines on miRNA levels and bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression and miRNAs on bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression. RESULTS: BA mice had significantly increased mRNA expression of innate cytokines and miRNAs known to bind bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors (miRNAs -22-5p, -34a-5p, and -222-3p) and decreased mRNA expression of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. In vitro, TNF-&#945; and IL-1? decreased BSEP and CYP7A1 while increasing miRNA-34a-5p and miRNA 222-3p. LXR, SHP, CYP7A1, NTCP, and MRP2 were decreased by miRNA-34a-5p, whereas miRNA-222-3p decreased NTCP and MRP4. TNF-&#945; and IL-1? increased expression of miRNAs 34a-5p and 222-3p and these miRNAs then decrease expression of multiple bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors.

Therefore, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and EMA now recommend the use of the so-called booster dose, especially in at-risk groups. The purpose of the study was to assess the attitudes of Poles towards the recommendation to receive a booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and to evaluate the main reasons for refusing or delaying the decision. Material and methods: The study was based on a proprietary questionnaire distributed via the Internet. There were 1598 respondents, 54 of which did not consent to participate in the survey and/or did not complete the vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. As a result, 1528 surveys were included in the final analysis. The vast majority of the respondents, namely 1275 (83.4%), were female, and 772 (50.5%) were residents of cities with a population of over 250,000. Results: Out of all respondents, 38 (2.5%) had already received the COVID-19 vaccine booster dose and 1031 (67.4%) would like to receive it as soon as possible. Forty-five (2.9%) respondents reported that they were completely unwilling to take the booster dose. The occurrence of adverse events after primary vaccination were reported by 79.9% of the survey participants. The most common reasons why the respondents refused to be vaccinated are lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the booster dose and the occurrence of adverse events in them or their loved ones. Age, gender, residence, or relationship status were not shown to affect attitudes towards the expansion of the basic vaccination schedule. Conclusions: One in three respondents plans to delay or refrain from taking the COVID-19 vaccine booster dose.

Ensuring equitable immunization, vaccine empathy is needed to boost vaccine donations among capable countries. However, damaging narratives built around vaccine donations such as vaccine diplomacy could undermine nations willingness to donate their vaccines, which, in turn, further exacerbate global vaccine inequality. However, while discussions on vaccine diplomacy are on the rise, there is limited research related to vaccine diplomacy, especially in terms of its characteristics and effects on vaccine distribution vis--vis vaccine empathy. Thus, to bridge the research gap, this study aims to examine the defining attributes of vaccine diplomacy and its potential effects on COVID-19 immunization, particularly in light of vaccine empathy. Methods: A narrative review was conducted to shed light on vaccine diplomacys defining attributes and effects in the context of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and dissemination. Databases such as PubMed and Medline were utilized for literature search. Additionally, to ensure up-to-date insights are included in the review, validated reports and reverse tracing of eligible articles reference lists in Google Scholar have also been conducted to locate relevant records. Results: Vaccine empathy is an individual or a nations capability to sympathize with other individuals or nations vaccine wants and needs, whereas vaccine diplomacy is a nations vaccine efforts that aim to build mutually beneficial relationships with other nations ultimately. Our findings show that while both vaccine empathy and vaccine diplomacy have their strengths and weaknesses, they all have great potential to improve vaccine equality, particularly amid fast-developing and ever-evolving global health crises such as COVID-19. Furthermore, analyses show that, compared to vaccine empathy, vaccine diplomacy might be a more sustainable solution to improve vaccine donations mainly because of its deeper and stronger roots in multilateral collaboration and cooperation. Conclusion: Similar to penicillin, automated external defibrillators, or safety belts amid a roaring global health disaster, COVID-19 vaccines are, essentially, life-saving consumer health products that should be available to those who need them. Though man-made and complicated, vaccine inequality is nonetheless a solvable issuegaps in vaccine distribution and dissemination can be effectively addressed by timely vaccine donations. Overall, our study underscores the instrumental and indispensable role of vaccine diplomacy in addressing the vaccine inequality issue amid the COVID-19 pandemic and its potentials for making even greater contributions in forging global solidarity amid international health emergencies. Future research could investigate approaches that could further inspire and improve vaccine donations among capable nations at a global scale to advance vaccine equity further.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine DonationsVaccine Empathy or Vaccine Diplomacy?

The objectives were to analyse the prevalence of low serum testosterone (LT) and impaired fertility potential (Leydig and Sertoli cells dysfunction, respectively) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) male survivors and to evaluate acute infection-related associated factors. Also, we explore its association with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) and quality of life (QOL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male adults recovered from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 were offered a structured evaluation 8-12 weeks after recovery. The main outcome measure(s) were as follows: LT, defined as total testosterone (TT) < 2 ng/ml or if TT levels 2-4 ng/ml as calculated free testosterone < 6.36 ng/dl; Sertoli cell dysfunction was defined as inhibin-B < 89 pg/ml. Secondary outcome-associated factors were analysed by multiple logistic regression (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval [CI]). QOL was evaluated by SF-36 v.2. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-three patients were evaluated at a median (interquartile range) of 77 days (72-83) after disease onset; 72% of them recovered from severe pneumonia. LT was detected in 41 patients (28.7%; 95% CI: 21.8-36.5). Low levels of inhibin-B were detected in 25 patients (18.1%; 95% CI: 12.5-25.3). After multivariate adjustment, obesity and hypokalaemia were associated with LT, whereas age more than 65 was an independent predictor of Sertoli cell dysfunction. LT or Sertoli cell dysfunction was not associated with PCS. Patients with LT had a lower score in four domains of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of male LT and impaired fertility potential in COVID-19 survivors is high in the medium term.

However, policymakers have encountered difficulty in identifying the most effective policies under different circumstances. This study investigated the relative effectiveness of different NPIs and vaccination in prolonging COVID-19 case doubling time (DT). METHODS: The study sample consisted of observations from 137 countries during 1 January 2020 to 13 June 2021. DT was calculated on a daily basis per country. Data were retrieved from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, World Development Indicators, and Worldwide Governance Indicators. To capture policy intervention dynamics, we combined a random-effect growth-curve model with nonstandard interrupted time series analysis. We also evaluated the association of policy measures with DT for different outbreak stages and levels of government effectiveness. RESULTS: Vaccine rollouts, workplace closures, and school closures were relatively effective. For each day that these measures were implemented, the DT increased by 1.96% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.63 to 3.29; P = 0.004), 1.41% (95% CI = 0.88 to 1.95%; P < 0.001) and 1.38% (95% CI = 0.95 to 1.81%; P < 0.001), respectively. Workplace and school closures were positively associated with DT at all stages; however, the associations weakened in later stages, where vaccine rollouts appeared to be most effective in prolonging DT (95% CI = 1.51% to 3.04%; P < 0.05). For countries with a high level of government effectiveness, most of the containment measures evaluated were effective; vaccine rollouts had the greatest effect size. For countries with medium or low levels of government effectiveness, only the closure of workplaces was consistently associated with prolonged DT. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of vaccine rollouts outweighed that of NPIs, especially in the later outbreak stages. However, vaccination was not associated with prolonged case DT in countries with lower levels of government effectiveness, probably due to low vaccine coverage. Among the NPIs examined, workplace closures were highly effective across all outbreak stages and levels of government effectiveness. Our findings suggest that mass vaccination is critical to reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially in countries where NPIs are less effective.","output":"COVID-19 case doubling time associated with non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination: A global experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Lembolie pulmonaire (EP) est un accident grave pouvant mettre en jeu le pronostic vital.

The dynamic total connectedness ranges between 65% and 85% indicating a high degree of cross-market risk linkages. Furthermore, we find that the oil market is becoming more integrated with the financial markets since it tends to be materially impacted by abrupt fluctuations of the global financial markets volatilities. More specifically, the analysis shows that, throughout the period, OVX is a net receiver of shocks to the remaining implied volatilities. Finally, the net pairwise connectedness measures suggest that OVX is constantly at the net receiving end vis-a-vis the majority of the asset classes implied volatilities.

This study aims to investigate the correlation between the extent of lung infection and relevant clinical laboratory testing indicators in COVID-19 and to analyse its underlying mechanism. Methods: : Chest high-resolution computer tomography (CT) images and laboratory examination data of 31 patients with COVID-19 were extracted, and the lesion areas in CT images were quantitatively segmented and calculated using the deep learning (DL) system. A cross-sectional study method was used to explore the differences among the proportions of lung lobe infection and to correlate the percentage of infection (POI) of the whole lung in all patients with clinical laboratory examination values. Results: : No significant difference in the proportion of infection was noted among various lung lobes ( P > 0.05). The POI of total lung infection was negatively correlated with the peripheral blood lymphocyte percentage (L%) ( r = -0.633, P < 0.0001) and lymphocyte count (LY) ( r = -0.555, P = 0.001) but positively correlated with the neutrophil percentage (G%) ( r = 0.565, P = 0.001). Otherwise, the POI was not significantly correlated with the peripheral blood leukocyte count (WBC), monocyte percentage (M%) or haemoglobin content (HGB). In some patients, the G% increased continuously and was accompanied by a progressive decrease in the L% and LY.

Core ingredients and targets were screened according to ADME rules combined with Neighborhood, Co-occurrence, Co-expression, and other algorithms. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were performed using the R language. Finally, high-throughput molecular docking was used for verification. RESULTS: HDHs mainly acts on NOS3, EGFR, IL-6, MAPK8, PTGS2, MAPK14, NFKB1, and CASP3 through quercetin, luteolin, wogonin, indirubin alkaloids, -sitosterol, and isolariciresinol. These targets are mainly involved in the regulation of biological processes such as inflammation, activation of MAPK activity, and positive regulation of NF-B transcription factor activity. Pathway analysis further revealed that the pathways regulated by these targets mainly include: signaling pathways related to viral and bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, influenza A, Ras signaling pathways; inflammation-related pathways such as the TLR, TNF, MAPK, and HIF-1 signaling pathways; and immune-related pathways such as NOD receptor signaling pathways. These pathways play a synergistic role in inhibiting lung inflammation and regulating immunity and antiviral activity.

Methods: We analyzed electronic medical record data from infants born at less than 32 weeks gestational age (GA) cared for in the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in a COVID-19-affected period (March 8, 2020 to May 31, 2020) and the analogous period in 2019. Our final sample consisted of 52 infants ( n =27, 2019 cohort; n =25, 2020 cohort). Rates of family visitation and of family- and clinical staff-delivered developmental care were compared across cohorts, adjusting for GA at start of study period. Results: Results indicated that families of infants in the 2020 cohort visited less frequently (47% of available days) than those in the 2019 cohort (97%; p =0.001). Infants received developmental care activities less frequently in the 2020 cohort (3.51 vs. 4.72 activities per day; p =0.04), with a lower number of minutes per day (99.91 vs. 145.14; p =0.04) and a shorter duration per instance (23.41 vs. 29.65; p =0.03). Similar reductions occurred in both family- and staff-delivered developmental care activities. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted family visitation and preterm infant developmental care practices in the NICU, both experiences associated with positive health benefits. Hospitals should create programs to improve family visitation and engagement, while also increasing staff-delivered developmental care.

Patients were randomised to telemonitoring (daily body-weight measurement, daily recording of HF symptoms, and personalised education) (n = 482) or to SC (n = 455). Mean  standard deviation number of events for the primary outcome was 1.30  1.85 for telemonitoring and 1.46  1.98 for SC (rate ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.77-1.23; P = 0.80). In NYHA class III or IV HF, median time to all-cause death or first unplanned hospitalisation was 82 days in the telemonitoring group and 67 days in the SC group (P = 0.03). After adjustment for known predictive factors, telemonitoring was associated with a 21% relative risk reduction in first unplanned hospitalisation for HF (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.62-0.99; P = 0.044); the relative risk reduction was 29% in patients with NYHA class III or IV HF (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53-0.95; P = 0.02), 38% in socially isolated patients (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.39-0.98; P = 0.043), and 37% in patients who were  70% adherent to body-weight measurement (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.88; P = 0.006).

Here, an analysis at the metagenomic level from various habitats (6 types of habitats, 4572 samples) detects 2561 ARGs that collectively conferred resistance to 24 classes of antibiotics.

Our results demonstrate that 23.78% of the ARGs pose a health risk, especially those which confer multidrug resistance. We also calculate the antibiotic resistance risks of all samples in four main habitats, and with machine learning, successfully map the antibiotic resistance threats in global marine habitats with over 75% accuracy.

Recently, many high-resolution apo and inhibitor-bound structures of Mpro, a cysteine protease, have been determined, facilitating structure-based drug design. Mpro plays a central role in the viral life cycle by catalyzing the cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. In addition to the catalytic dyad His41CCys145, Mpro contains multiple histidines including His163, His164, and His172. The protonation states of these histidines and the catalytic nucleophile Cys145 have been debated in previous studies of SARS-CoV Mpro, but have yet to be investigated for SARS-CoV-2. In this work we have used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the structural stability of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as a function of the protonation assignments for these residues. We simulated both the apo and inhibitor-bound enzyme and found that the conformational stability of the binding site, bound inhibitors, and the hydrogen bond networks of Mpro are highly sensitive to these assignments. Additionally, the two inhibitors studied, the peptidomimetic N3 and an -ketoamide, display distinct His41/His164 protonation-state-dependent stabilities. While the apo and the N3-bound systems favored N (HD) and N? (HE) protonation of His41 and His164, respectively, the -ketoamide was not stably bound in this state. Our results illustrate the importance of using appropriate histidine protonation states to accurately model the structure and dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in both the apo and inhibitor-bound states, a necessary prerequisite for drug-design efforts.

Evidence of how this health crisis affected common conditions like blood pressure (BP) control is uncertain. METHODS: We used longitudinal BP data from an ongoing randomized clinical trial to examine variations in home BP monitored via a smartphone-based application (app) in a total of 7394 elderly patients with hypertension aged 60 to 80 years stratified by their location in Wuhan (n=283) compared with other provinces of China (n=7111). Change in morning systolic BP (SBP) was analyzed for 5 30-day phases during the pandemic, including preepidemic (October 21 to November 20, 2019), incubation (November 21 to December 20, 2019), developing (December 21, 2019 to January 20, 2020), outbreak (January 21 to February 20, 2020), and plateau (February 21 to March 21, 2020). RESULTS: Compared with non-Wuhan areas of China, average morning SBP (adjusted for age, sex, body mass index) in Wuhan patients was significantly higher during the epidemic growth phases, which returned to normal at the plateau. Between-group differences in &#916;SBP were +2.5, +3.0, and +2.1 mm Hg at the incubation, developing, and outbreak phases of COVID-19 (P<0.001), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed a similar trend in trajectory pattern of SBP in both the intensive and standard BP control groups of the trial. Patients in Wuhan also had an increased regimen change in antihypertensive drugs during the outbreak compared with non-Wuhan patients. Expectedly, Wuhan patients were more likely to check their BP via the app, while doctors were less likely to monitor the app for BP control during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a short-term increase in morning SBP among elderly patients with hypertension in Wuhan but not other parts of China. Further study will be needed to understand if these findings extended to other parts of the world substantially affected by the virus. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

These proteins also play a significant role in determining the shape and size of the newly formed virus particles. The lipid membrane and the embedded proteins affect each other in non-trivial ways during the course of the viral life cycle. Unraveling the nature of the proteinCprotein and proteinClipid interactions, under various environmental and physiological conditions, could therefore prove to be crucial in development of therapeutics. Here, we study the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 to understand the effect of temperature on the properties of the protein-membrane system. The membrane-embedded dimeric M proteins were studied using atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures ranging between 10 and 50 C. While temperature-induced fluctuations are expected to be monotonic, we observe a steady rise in the protein dynamics up to 40 C, beyond which it surprisingly reverts back to the low-temperature behavior. Detailed investigation reveals disordering of the membrane lipids in the presence of the protein, which induces additional curvature around the transmembrane region. Coarse-grained simulations indicate temperature-dependent aggregation of M protein dimers. Our study clearly indicates that the dynamics of membrane lipids and integral M protein of SARS-CoV-2 enables it to better associate and aggregate only at a certain temperature range (i.e., ~ 30C40 C). This can have important implications in the protein aggregation and subsequent viral budding/fission processes.

The strategies spread through imitation dynamics. Our model shows that cooperation among natives can emerge due to social contagion of good role-model agents that can provide better quality public goods. Only a small fraction of efficient cooperators, among immigrants, is enough to trigger cooperation across the native population.

Viral infections in the ICU have pleomorphic clinical presentations including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, central or peripheral nervous system manifestations, and viral-induced shock. Besides de novo infections, certain viruses fall into latency and can be reactivated in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent critically ill patients. Depending on the viral strain, transmission occurs either directly through contact with infectious materials and large droplets, or indirectly through suspended air particles (airborne transmission of droplet nuclei). Many viruses can efficiently spread within hospital environment leading to in-hospital outbreaks, sometimes with high rates of mortality and morbidity, thus infection control measures are of paramount importance. Despite the advances in detecting viral pathogens, limited progress has been made in antiviral treatments, contributing to unexpectedly high rates of unfavorable outcomes.

This paper proposes a method to estimate the share of these jobs. For each occupation, we obtain a WFH friendly measure by asking respondents from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to evaluate whether the corresponding tasks can be performed from home based on the descriptions from the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO-08) standard. The share of WFH friendly jobs in an economy can then be estimated by combining these measures with the labor statistics on occupational employments. Using Norway as an illustrating example, we find that approximately 38\\\\% of Norwegian jobs can be performed at home. The Norwegian results also suggest that the pandemic and the governments attempts to mitigate this crisis may have a quite uneven impact on the working population.

In lieu of this, models have been used to forecast occupational risk using various predictors, but no model heretofore has used data from actual case numbers. This study assesses the differential risk of COVID\\\\19 by occupation using predictors from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) database and correlating them with case counts published by the Washington State Department of Health to identify workers in individual occupations at highest risk of COVID\\\\19 infection. METHODS: The O*NET database was screened for potential predictors of differential COVID\\\\19 risk by occupation. Case counts delineated by occupational group were obtained from public sources. Prevalence by occupation was estimated and correlated with O*NET data to build a regression model to predict individual occupations at greatest risk. RESULTS: Two variables correlate with case prevalence: disease exposure (r = 0.66; p = 0.001) and physical proximity (r = 0.64; p = 0.002), and predict 47.5% of prevalence variance (p = 0.003) on multiple linear regression analysis.

In particular, acute kidney injury (AKI) is common among patients with sepsis and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of sepsis-related AKI. Plasma free thiols (R-SH) reflect systemic oxidative stress since they are readily oxidized by reactive species and thereby serve as antioxidants. Here, we aimed to assess the concentrations of serum free thiols in sepsis and associate these with major adverse kidney events (MAKE). Adult non-trauma patients who presented at the emergency department (ED) with a suspected infection were included. Free thiol levels and ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), a marker of oxidative stress, were measured in plasma at baseline, at the ward, and at three months, and one year after hospitalization. Plasma free thiol levels were lower at the ED visit and at the ward as compared to three months and one year after hospital admission (p < 0.01). On the contrary, plasma levels of IMA were higher at the ED and at the ward compared to three months and one year after hospital admission (p < 0.01). Furthermore, univariate logistic regression analyses showed that plasma free thiol levels at the ED were inversely associated with long-term renal function decline and survival at 90 days (MAKE90) and 365 days (MAKE365) (OR 0.43 per standard deviation [SD] [0.22C0.82, 95% CI], p = 0.011 and OR 0.58 per SD [0.34C0.96, 95% CI], p = 0.035, respectively).

Activation of L1 in senescent cells triggers a type I interferon response and age-associated inflammation. Two open reading frames encode an ORF1 protein functioning as mRNA chaperone and an ORF2 protein providing catalytic activities necessary for retrotransposition. No function has been identified for the conserved, disordered N-terminal region of ORF1. Using microscopy and NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that ORF1 forms liquid droplets in vitro in a salt-dependent manner and that interactions between its N-terminal region and coiled-coil domain are necessary for phase separation. Mutations disrupting blocks of charged residues within the N-terminus impair phase separation while some mutations within the coiled-coil domain enhance phase separation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in our emergency ward between January 01 and April 24, 2020 and elevated liver enzymes were included (Cohort 1). Additionally, the local radiology information system was screened for sonographies in COVID-19 patients at the intensive care unit in the same period (Cohort 2). Liver sonographies and histologic specimen were reviewed and suspicious findings recorded. Medical records were reviewed for clinical data. Ultrasound findings and clinical data were correlated with severity of liver enzyme elevation. RESULTS: Cohort 1: 126 patients were evaluated, of which 47 (37.3%) had elevated liver enzymes. Severity of liver enzyme elevation was associated with death (p<0.001). 8 patients (6.3%) had suspicious ultrasound findings, including signs of acute hepatitis (n = 5, e.g. thickening of gall bladder wall, hepatomegaly, decreased echogenicity of liver parenchyma) and vascular complications (n = 4).

Pathology was performed in 6 patients. Predominant findings were severe cholestasis and macrophage activation. CONCLUSION: For most hospitalized COVID-19 patients, elevated liver enzymes cause little concern as they are only mild to moderate. However, in severely ill patients bedside sonography is a powerful tool to reveal different patterns of vascular, cholestatic or inflammatory complications in the liver, which are associated with high mortality.

Theory indicates that the number of sites needed to accurately reconstruct a fully resolved tree grows at a rate proportional to the inverse square of the length of the shortest edge. However, when inferred trees are partially resolved due to short edges, accuracy should be defined as the rate of discovering false splits (clades on a rooted tree) relative to the actual number found. Thus, accuracy can be high even if short edges are common. Specifically, in a near-perfect parameter space in which trees are large, the tree length  (the sum of all edge lengths) is small, and rate variation is minimal, the expected false positive rate is less than ΨM3; the exact value depends on tree shape and sequence length. This expected false positive rate is far below the false negative rate for small  and often well below 5% even when some assumptions are relaxed. We show this result analytically for maximum parsimony and explore its extension to maximum likelihood using theory and simulations. For hypothesis testing, we show that measures of split support that rely on bootstrap resampling consistently imply weaker support than that implied by the false positive rates in near-perfect trees. The near-perfect parameter space closely fits several empirical studies of human virus diversification during outbreaks and epidemics, including Ebolavirus, Zika virus, and SARS-CoV-2, reflecting low substitution rates relative to high transmission/sampling rates in these viruses.","output":"Accuracy in near-perfect virus phylogenies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Wissen ist in der modernen Sozialp?dagogik in besonderem Ma?e mit Ungewissheiten konfrontiert, die jenseits blo?er Informationen liegen.

Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Comparing the interaction sites of ACE2 proteins known to serve or not serve as receptors allows the definition of residues important for binding. From the 20 amino acids in ACE2 that contact S, up to 7 can be replaced and ACE2 can still function as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. These variable amino acids are clustered at certain positions, mostly at the periphery of the binding site, while changes of the invariable residues prevent S binding or infection of the respective animal. Some ACE2 proteins even tolerate the loss or acquisition of N-glycosylation sites located near the S interface. Of note, pigs and dogs, which are not infected or are not effectively infected and have only a few changes in the binding site, exhibit relatively low levels of ACE2 in the respiratory tract. Comparison of the RBD of S of SARS-CoV-2 with that from bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV-RaTG13) and pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV) strain hCoV-19/pangolin/Guangdong/1/2019 revealed that the latter contains only one substitution, whereas Bat-CoV-RaTG13 exhibits five. However, ACE2 of pangolin exhibits seven changes relative to human ACE2, and a similar number of substitutions is present in ACE2 of bats, raccoon dogs, and civets, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not be especially adapted to ACE2 of any of its putative intermediate hosts.

The origin of the virus is still unclear, and whether pets and livestock can be infected and transmit SARS-CoV-2 are important and unknown scientific questions. Effective binding to the host receptor ACE2 is the first prerequisite for infection of cells and determines the host range. Our analysis provides a framework for the prediction of potential hosts of SARS-CoV-2. We found that ACE2 from species known to support SARS-CoV-2 infection tolerate many amino acid changes, indicating that the species barrier might be low. Exceptions are dogs and especially pigs, which revealed relatively low ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract. Monitoring of animals is necessary to prevent the generation of a new coronavirus reservoir.

METHODS The study population consisted of acute ischemic stroke patients who were admitted to PSCs participating in Get With The Guidelines-Stroke between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2012. Measures of care quality and outcomes were compared among the 4 different PSC certifications.

Composite care quality was generally similar among the 4 groups of hospitals, although State-based PSCs underperformed JC PSCs in a few key measures, including intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator use. The rates of tissue-type plasminogen activator use were higher in JC and Det Norske Veritas (9.0% and 9.8%) and lower in State and Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program certified hospitals (7.1% and 5.9%) (P<0.0001).

Early start of rehabilitation and its continuation at home once the patient is discharged are key factors for the success of the process. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a home-based telerehabilitation solution (ReHub) on improving functional capacity and clinical outcomes for patients who underwent TKA. Methods/design: The study is a randomized, open-label with blinded outcome assessor, parallel assignment clinical trial with a sample size of 52 patients that is conducted according to the SPIRIT recommendations. After the TKA intervention, the patients are randomly allocated to the control group or the experimental group with a 1:1 ratio. Both groups follow a Fast Track recovery protocol which includes discharge after 2-3 days from surgery, a daily plan of 5 exercises for autonomous rehabilitation and domiciliary visits by a physiotherapist starting approximately 2 weeks after surgery. The experimental group uses the sensor-based telerehabilitation system ReHub to perform the exercises. The primary outcome measure is the range of motion of the knee. Secondary outcomes include physical performance, quality of life, pain intensity, muscle strength, treatment adherence and satisfaction with the ReHub system. The outcomes assessment is performed at hospital discharge (baseline), at stitch removal (2 weeks after baseline) and 2 weeks after stitch removal (4 weeks after baseline). The study conforms to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the hospital's ethics committee.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may serve as a lead indicator of increased community transmission. Here, we monitored viral concentrations in samples collected from nine municipal wastewater facilities in New Hampshire (NH) and Vermont (VT).Twenty-four-h composite primary influent wastewater samples were collected from nine municipal wastewater treatment facilities twice per week for 5 months (late September 2020 to early February 2021). Wastewater was centrifuged for 30 min at 4600  g, then the supernatant was frozen until further analysis. Once thawed, samples were concentrated, extracted, and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcriptase-droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) detection methods. Active case counts for each municipality were tracked from the NH and VT state COVID-19 dashboards. We received a total of 283 wastewater samples from all sites during the study period. Viral RNA was detected in 175/283 (61.8%) samples using RT-qPCR and in 195/283 (68.9%) samples using RT-ddPCR. All nine sites showed positivity in the wastewater, with 8/9 (88.8%) sites having over 50% of their samples test positive over the course of the study. Larger municipalities, such as Nashua, Concord, and Lebanon, NH, showed that SARS-CoV-2 positivity in the wastewater can precede spikes in active COVID-19 case counts by as much as 7 days. Smaller municipalities, such as Woodsville, NH and Hartford, VT, showed sporadic SARS-COV-2 detection and did not always precede a rise in active case counts. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in samples from all 9 municipalities tested, including cities and small towns within this region, and showed wastewater positivity as an early indicator of active case count increases in some regions. Some of the smaller rural municipalities with low case counts may require more frequent sampling to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater before a case surge. With timely collection and analysis of wastewater samples, a community could potentially respond to results by increasing public health initiatives, such as tightening mask mandates and banning large indoor gatherings, to mitigate community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. IMPORTANCE Despite vaccination efforts, the delta and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 have caused global surges of COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it is important to find new ways of tracking early signs of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks. The manuscript outlines how to collect wastewater from treatment facilities, concentrate the virus in a dilute wastewater sample, and detect it using two sensitive PCR-based methods. It also describes important trends in SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater of a rural region of the United States from Fall 2020 C Winter 2021 and demonstrates the utility of wastewater monitoring as a leading indicator of active SARS-CoV-2 cases.

The primary objective of this study was to determine if the implementation of a designated COVID-19 cohort area (hot zone) within a busy ED mitigated the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the rest of the department. METHODS: In an ED of a tertiary academic medical center, with 64,000 annual visits, an eight room pod was designated for known COVID-19 or individuals with high suspicion for infection. There was a single entry and exit for donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE). Health care workers (HCW) changed gowns and gloves between patients, but maintained their N-95 mask and face shield, cleaning the shield with a germicidal wipe between patients. Staffing assignments designated nurses and technicians to remain in this area for 4 h, where physicians regularly moved between the hot zone and rest of the ED. Fifteen surface samples and four air samples were taken to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 contamination levels and the effectiveness of infection control practices. Samples were collected outside of patient rooms in 3 primary ED patient care areas, the reception area, the primary nurses station, inside the cohort area, and the PPE donning and doffing areas immediately adjacent. Samples were recovered and analyzed for the presence of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on any surface samples, including in and around the cohort area. All air samples outside the COVID-19 hot zone were negative for SARS-CoV-2, but air samples within the cohort area had a low level of viral contamination.

METHODS: The hospital-based study included subjects with T1 cancer at National Taiwan University Hospital from 2005 to 2014. Clinical, colonoscopy, and histopathology were reviewed for patients with a mean follow-up time of 7.1 (0.7-12.9) years. We conducted Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the risk of recurrence by cancer location and Cox-regression analysis to identify risk factors for T1 cancer recurrence. RESULTS: The final cohort included a total of 343 subjects with T1 cancer (mean age, 64.9  11.7 years; 56.1% males), of whom 25 underwent endoscopic resection alone. Of the subjects who underwent surgery, 50 had lymph node metastasis and 268 did not. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the risk of recurrence was higher in T1 rectal cancer than T1 colon cancer (p =0.022). Rectal location, and larger neoplasm size were independent risk factors for recurrence, with hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of 4.84 (1.18-19.92), and 1.32 (1.06-1.65), respectively.

Since 2005, when a case-control study demonstrated the association of a strain of human coronavirus with KD, several studies have provided evidence regarding the association of different strains of the human coronaviruses with KD. Thus, the emergence of the KD-like disease MIS-C in COVID-19 may not be an unprecedented phenomenon. KD and MIS-C share a range of similarities in pathophysiology and possibly even genetics. Both share features of a cytokine storm, leading to a systemic inflammatory response and oxidative stress that may cause vasculitis and precipitate multi-organ failure. Moreover, antibody-dependent enhancement, a phenomenon demonstrated in previous coronaviruses, and the possible superantigenic behavior of SARS-CoV-2, possibly may also contribute toward the pathogenesis of MIS-C. Lastly, there is some evidence of complement-mediated microvascular injury in COVID-19, as well as of endotheliitis.

Fortunately, recombinant interferons as therapeutic products have accumulated a long history of beneficial therapeutic results in the treatment of chronic and acute viral diseases and also in the therapy of some types of cancer. One of the first antiviral treatments during the onset of COVID-19 in China was based on the use of recombinant interferon alfa 2b, so many clinicians began to use it, not only as therapy but also as a prophylactic approach, mainly in medical personnel. At the same time, basic research on interferons provided new insights that have contributed to a much better understanding of how treatment with interferons, initially considered as antivirals, actually has a much broader pharmacological scope. In this review, we briefly describe interferons, how they are induced in the event of a viral infection, and how they elicit signaling after contact with their specific receptor on target cells. Additionally, some of the genes stimulated by type I interferons are described, as well as the way interferon-mediated signaling is torpedoed by coronaviruses and in particular by SARS-CoV-2. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene is one of the interferon response genes. Although for many scientists this fact could result in an adverse effect of interferon treatment in COVID-19 patients, ACE2 expression contributes to the balance of the renin-angiotensin system, which is greatly affected by SARS-CoV-2 in its internalization into the cell.

Seven birds were kept as controls. Six weeks later, pools of sera of each group were prepared and incubated at virus neutralization doses of 10 and 10(C1) with the Beaudette strain (GI-1) of AvCoV in VERO cells. Rescued viruses were then submitted to genome-wide deep sequencing for subconsensus variant detection. After treatment with serum from birds vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine at a titer of 10(C1), an F307I variant was detected in the spike glycoprotein that mapped to an important neutralizing region, which indicated an escape mutant derived from natural selection. Further variants were detected in nonstructural proteins and non-coding regions that are not targets of neutralizing antibodies and might be indicators of genetic drift. These results indicate that the evolution of AvCoV escape mutants after vaccination depends on the type of vaccine strain and the antibody titer and must be assessed based on quasispecies rather than consensus dominant sequences only because quasispecies may be otherwise undetected.

Methods: Three physical models of Newton's and Stokes's laws with(out) air resistance in the calm air are used to determine the falling time and velocity regimes of SARS-CoV-2 with(out) a respiratory water droplet of 1 to 2000 micrometers (m) in diameter of an infected person of 0.5 to 2.6 m in height. Results: The horizontal distance travelled by SARS-CoV-2 in free fall from 1.7 m was 0.88 m due to breathing or talking and 2.94 m due to sneezing or coughing. According to Newton's laws of motion with air resistance, its falling velocity and time from 1.7 m were estimated at 3.95  10-2 m s-1 and 43 s, respectively. Large droplets > 100 m reached the ground from 1.7 m in less than 1.6 s, while the droplets &#8805; 30 m fell within 4.42 s regardless of the human height.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A, which has antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. However, it is unknown whether ATRA can attenuate TGEV-induced IPEC-J2 cells apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of ATRA on TGEV-induced apoptosis of IPEC-J2 cells and explored the potential molecular mechanism. Our results indicated that TGEV infection caused IPEC-J2 cells damage and apoptosis. However, ATRA treatment attenuated TGEV-induced IPEC-J2 cells damage by upregulating the mRNA expressions of ZO-1, Occludin, and Mucin-1. ATRA treatment also attenuated TGEV-induced apoptosis in IPEC-J2 cells by downregulating the expression of Caspase-3, which is related to the inhibition of death receptor (Fas and Caspase-8) and mitochondrial (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase-9) pathways. Moreover, ATRA treatment prevented TGEV-induced ROS and MDA production and the upregulation of P(38)MAPK phosphorylation level, which is related to the increase in the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and T-AOC) and the mRNA abundance of antioxidant-related genes (GPX1, GPX2, SOD1, CAT, GCLC, and GCLM).

The first set, comprised daily reported cases of H1N1 obtained from local cities in accordance with government policy about mandatory reporting of all H1N1 cases during May 1 to August 19, 2009. The second set, including 372 confirmed imported H1N1 cases, identified from 13 National Quarantine Stations in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from May 24 to December 31, 2009. However, given the lack of information on the nature of the imported H1N1 cases from the two data sets during the over lapping period from May 24 to August 19, we express the number of imported cases as a range for this period. RESULTS: We estimated that the number of imported H1N1 cases from May 1 to August 19, 2009, was between 1,098 and 1,291 and the total number of cases was 2,409 to 2,580. We found the number of imported cases was beginning to diminish as of August. A analysis of the second data set showed that the distribution of sex was similar (males 50.7%, females 49.3%) and the age distribution from 20 to 59 was 61.5% and that of 60 and over was 0.8% of the 372 cases.

We aimed to develop and test an online tool for patient education on pregnancy-related issues and communication with epilepsy nurses during pregnancy for women with epilepsy. METHODS: An existing national platform for online communication (1177.se) was used, and an online tool was developed by two epilepsy nurses, two neurologists, and an IT technician. The tool was launched as a complement to standard care, and patients deciding to use it were invited to participate in a survey of user experiences and knowledge questions. RESULTS: The online tool consists of two modules: one for patient education and one for TDM during pregnancy. The latter module allows scheduling of automatic reminders of blood tests that are sent to patients at set intervals. The epilepsy nurse can communicate results and suggested dose changes in the tool. A total of 48 women answered the survey: 28 had been invited to use the information module and 20 to use the TDM module. Patient experiences were generally good, and most users of the TDM module would prefer an online means of communication in future pregnancies. For epilepsy nurses, the tool provided good overview of patients currently pregnant and administrative advantages compared with traditional means of communication.

Consequently, a high-quality cancer screening program should consider individuals' values and preferences when determining recommendations. In cervical cancer screening, offering women autonomy is considered a \\"person-centered\\" approach to health care services; however, it may impact the effectiveness of the program should women choose to not participate. As part of a larger project to investigate women's cervical screening preferences and correlates of these preferences, this systematic review will capture quantitative and qualitative investigations of women's cervical screening preferences and the methods used to elicit them. DESIGN AND METHODS This mixed methods synthesis will use a thematic analysis approach to synthesize qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods evidence. This protocol describes the methods that will be used in this investigation. A search strategy has been developed with a health librarian and peer reviewed using PRESS. Based on this strategy, five databases and the gray literature will be searched for studies that meet the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included individual studies will be examined using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Three reviewers will extract data from the primary studies on the tools or instruments used to elicit women's preferences regarding cervical cancer screening, theoretical frameworks used, outcomes measured, the outstanding themes from quantitative and qualitative evidence, and the identified preferences for cervical cancer screening. We will describe the relationships between study results and the study population, \\"intervention\\" (e.g., tool or instrument), and context. We will follow the PRISMA reporting guideline. We will compare findings across studies and between study methods (e.g., qualitative versus quantitative study designs). The strength of the synthesized findings will be assessed using the validated GRADE and CERQual tool. DISCUSSION This review will inform the development of a tool to elicit women's cervical screening preferences. Understanding the methods used to elicit women's preferences and what is known about women's cervical screening preferences will be useful for guideline developers who wish to incorporate a woman-centered approach specifically for cervical screening guidelines.

METHODS: A total of 122 blebs in 270 IAs selected for surgery were studied using patient-specific vascular reconstructions from 3D angiographic images. Bleb geometry, location on the aneurysm, and frequency of occurrence in aneurysms at different locations were analyzed. Associations between gender, age, smoking, hypertension, hormone therapy, dental infection, and presence of blebs were investigated. RESULTS: Of all aneurysms with blebs, 77% had a single bleb and 23% had multiple blebs. Only 6% of blebs were at the neck, while 46% were in the body and 48% in the dome. Aneurysms with blebs were larger (p<0.0001), more elongated (p=0.0002), and with wider necks than aneurysms without blebs. Bleb presence was associated with dental infection (p=0.0426) and negatively associated with hormone therapy (p=0.0426) in women. Anterior and posterior communicating arteries had larger percentages of aneurysms with blebs than internal carotid arteries. Patients with a history of hypertension tended to have a larger percentage of aneurysms with blebs. However, these trends did not reach significance in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: Blebs are common in IAs, and most aneurysms harboring blebs have a single bleb. Blebs in the aneurysm neck are rare, but they are equally common in the body and dome.

Demographics, comorbidities, and select medications were collected by chart abstraction. Missing height for calculating body mass index (BMI) was imputed using the median height for patients sex and race/ethnicity. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression and a minimax concave penalty (MCP) regularized logistic regression explored prediction. RESULTS: Participants had a mean(SD) age 55(17), BMI 30.9(8.2), 55% were male and 80% were ethnic/racial minorities. Unadjusted comparisons by outcome are shown (Table 1). Male sex (aOR: 1.60, 95% CI (1.02, 2.54)), increasing age (aOR: 1.25(1.08, 1.47); per 10 years), higher BMI (aOR 1.03(1.00, 1.06) and poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C 8) (aOR 2.33(1.27, 4.27) were significantly (p< 0.05) associated with greater odds of intubation or death.

METHODS: After taking history, clinical examination and appropriate investigations, nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 600 infants and children with symptoms and signs of respiratory infections. Samples were examined by RT-PCR for hMPV. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hMPV infection among studied patients was 8% (95% = 6.1C10.4). The rate was significantly higher among children aged 2C24 mo compared to other age groups (11.9% vs. 3.7% and 4.0% for 2C24, 25C60, 61C108 mo respectively). Also it was significantly higher among females than males (12.6% vs. 6.6%). Cough, wheezing, rhinorrhea, fever and chest wall retraction were the most frequent presentations (81.2%, 68.8%, 66.7%, 64.6% and 56.3%; respectively). Antibiotics, bronchodilators and oxygen administration were the most common treatments offered (60.4%, 31.2% and 27.1%; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: hMPV is an emerging cause of acute respiratory infection in Mansoura University Children Hospital (MUCH), and may have a significant clinical impact on infants and children and thus, must be considered in etiological diagnosis.","output":"Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) in Acute Respiratory Infection: A Clinic-Based Study in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed types of surgery. Most patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of only one eye is effective in restoring functional vision, second-eye surgery leads to further improvements in health-related quality of life, and is cost-effective. At present, most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as recommended in national guidelines, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves operating both eyes on the same day, but as separate procedures, known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and costs of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, in order to test the hypothesis that ISBCS is non-inferior to DSBCS in terms of effectiveness and superior to ISBCS in terms of cost-effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: Multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients (18 years or older) with bilateral cataract and an indication for bilateral cataract surgery with an expected uncomplicated intraoperative and postoperative course are included in the study. Patients are randomly assigned to either ISBCS or DSBCS. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with a refractive outcome in the second eye within 1.0 dioptre from the target refraction, at 4 weeks after surgery. Secondary outcomes include corrected and uncorrected distance visual acuity, complications, patient reported outcomes (PROMs), cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Follow-up visits are planned at 1 week after first-eye surgery and 4 weeks after second-eye surgery. At 3 months after first-eye surgery, the occurrence of complications is checked and patients fill in a final questionnaire. DISCUSSION: This study protocol describes the design of a multicenter non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. Current studies on ISBCS often lack information on safety regarding refractive outcomes. In addition, there is a lack of well-designed cost-effectiveness studies using established methods. The BICAT-NL study will provide more insight in refractive and cost-effectiveness outcomes for ISBCS compared to DSBCS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered at Clinicaltrials.gov on January 17th 2018.

Methods: The information of new symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in Chinese mainland was collected. The location distribution, epidemic course, infection routes and patients' characteristics of outbreaks were described and analyzed. Results: There were 43 new outbreaks with 3,795 symptomatic patients in Chinese mainland from March 21, 2020 to June 13, 2021. These outbreaks mainly occurred in central, border and coastal port cities. The main infection route of first generation indigenous patients was contact with imported cases and contaminated goods or environments. The infection routes of secondary generation patients mainly included family transmission, indoor social gathering infection, nosocomial infection and other infection routes. Family transmission was the most common infection route, and indoor social gathering was the most important reason for the large-scale outbreaks. Conclusions: Strengthen the management of imported patients and staff in high-risk posts was the key point to avoid the first generation indigenous patients. Adequate family isolation, prompt management policies for indoor public place and monitor of population at risk of infection were key strategies for preventing COVID-19 resurgence in areas initially under control.","output":"Epidemiological Characteristics of COVID-19 Resurgence in Areas Initially Under Control"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Throughout the global COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants of concern (VOCs) have repeatedly and independently arisen. VOCs are characterized by increased transmissibility, increased virulence, or reduced neutralization by antibodies obtained from prior infection or vaccination. Tracking the introduction and transmission of VOCs relies on sequencing, typically whole-genome sequencing of clinical samples. Wastewater surveillance is increasingly used to track the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants through sequencing approaches. Here, we adapt and apply a rapid, high-throughput method for detection and quantification of the frequency of two deletions characteristic of the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 VOCs in wastewater. We further develop a statistical approach to analyze temporal dynamics in drop-off RT-dPCR assay data to quantify transmission fitness advantage, providing data similar to that obtained from clinical samples. Digital PCR assays targeting signature mutations in wastewater offer near real-time monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and potentially earlier detection and inference on transmission fitness advantage than clinical sequencing.","output":"Inferring Transmission Fitness Advantage of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern in Wastewater Using Digital PCR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To better understand COVID-19 infection in patients receiving biologic and immunomodulatory therapies, we evaluated prevalence and outcomes for symptomatic cases of COVID-19 at a large therapeutic infusion center in New York City during the height of the pandemic. 2074 patients received treatment with biologic infusions at our center between March and May 2020, and 34 patients developed symptomatic COVID-19 infection, for an overall low rate of 1.64%.

Utilization of the internet has increased dramatically over the last 10 years and in 2016, we added an online seminar. With the emergence of COVID-19 and new rules regarding social distancing, we are currently relying exclusively on web-based orientation. Research suggests there are racial and socioeconomic disparities in the utilization of internet health resources in the general population. To our knowledge this has not been studied in regard to the bariatric population. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients who attended online (OS) and in-person seminars (IPS). Our primary endpoint was to compare the percentage of patients who underwent surgery. Secondary outcomes included differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the patients who attended the OS versus the IPS. RESULTS: Of the 1152 patients who attended a bariatric orientation, 71.2% scheduled an office visit. The IPS patients had a higher rate of office visits and shorter time between orientation and first visit. Of patients eligible for surgery, there was a higher percentage of Caucasians in the OS group while the IPS group had higher rates of Hispanic and African Americans. Patients from the OS group had higher rates of marriage and employment, and lower rates of medical co-morbidities. When controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, employment status and medical co-morbidities, there was no significant impact of type of orientation on progression to surgery. CONCLUSION: We found that there was no difference in progression to surgery between the two orientation groups. Importantly, however, we detected marked demographic and clinical differences between the two patient populations. There is an urgent need to address these disparities as we are now heavily relying on patient outreach and education via the internet.
