Samples of blood serum from 10 patients positive and 10 patients negative for COVID-19 by RT-PCR RNA and ELISA tests were analyzed. Raman spectra were obtained with a dispersive Raman spectrometer (830 nm, 350 mW) in triplicate, being submitted to exploratory analysis with principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the spectral differences and discriminant analysis with PCA (PCA-DA) and partial least squares (PLS-DA) for classification of the blood serum spectra into Control and COVID-19. The spectra of both groups positive and negative for COVID-19 showed peaks referred to the basal constitution of the serum (mainly albumin). The difference spectra showed decrease in the peaks referred to proteins and amino acids for the group positive. PCA variables showed more detailed spectral differences related to the biochemical alterations due to the COVID-19 such as increase in lipids, nitrogen compounds (urea and amines/amides) and nucleic acids, and decrease of proteins and amino acids (tryptophan) in the COVID-19 group. The discriminant analysis applied to the principal component loadings (PC2, PC4, PC5, and PC6) could classify spectra with 87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity indicated in the RT-PCR kit leaflet, demonstrating the possibilities of a rapid, label-free, and costless technique for diagnosing COVID-19 infection.

While preliminary choices were essentially based on in vitro potency, clinical translation into effective therapies may be challenging due to unfavorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties at the doses chosen for this new indication of COVID-19 infection. However, available pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies suffer from severe limitations leading to unreliable conclusions, especially in term of dosing optimization. In this paper we propose to highlight these limitations and to identify some of the major requirements that need to be addressed in designing PK and PK-PD studies in this era of COVID. A special attention should be paid to pre-analytical and analytical requirements and to the proper collection of covariates affecting dose-exposure relationships (co-medications, use of specific organ support techniques and other clinical and para-clinical data). We also promote the development of population PK and PK-PD models specifically dedicated to COVID-19 patients since those previously developed for other diseases (SEL, malaria, HIV) and clinical situations (steady-state, non-ICU patients) are not representative of severe patients. Therefore, implementation of well-designed PK and PD studies targeted to COVID-19 patients is urgently needed. For that purpose we call for multi-institutional collaborative work and involvement of clinical pharmacologists in multidisciplinary research consortia.","output":"Concerns about pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) studies in the new therapeutic area of COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Entre as doen?as que acometem bovinos em sistemas de alta produtividade est?o a acidose ruminal e a laminite.

This case series describes a method of performing open tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients while minimizing potential aerosolization of the virus using typically available equipment and supplies. METHODS: This is a case series of 18 patients who were COVID-19 positive and underwent open tracheostomy in the operating room under a negative pressure plastic hood created using readily available equipment and supplies. Patients had to be intubated for at least 14 days, be convalescing from their cytokine storm, and deemed to survive for at least 14 more days. Other indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning, respiratory failure and failed extubation attempts. RESULTS: There were 14 men and 4 women with severe SARS-CoV2 infection requiring long-term intubation since March 23 or later. The mean age was 61.7, BMI was 32.6, and the pre-tracheostomy ventilator day was 20.4. The indications for tracheostomy were altered mental status, severe deconditioning and continued respiratory with hypoxia. Failed extubation attempt rate was 16.7% and hemodialysis rate was 38.9%. All patients were hemodynamically stable, without any evidence of accelerating cytokine storm. To date there was one minor bleeding due to postoperative therapeutic anticoagulation.

The simplicity of the procedure and the decreased long-term risk profile make this surgery more appealing. Nonetheless, the ever present risk of a staple-line leak is still of great concern and needs further investigation. METHODS An electronic literature search of MEDLINE database plus manual reference checks of articles published on laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity and its complications was completed. Keywords used in the search were \\"sleeve gastrectomy\\" OR \\"gastric sleeve\\" AND \\"leak.\\" We analyzed 29 publications, including 4,888 patients. We analyzed the frequency of leak after sleeve gastrectomy and its associated risks of causation. RESULTS The risk of leak after sleeve gastrectomy in all comers was 2.4%. This risk was 2.9% in the super-obese [body mass index (BMI) > 50 kg/m(2)] and 2.2% for BMI < 50 kg/m(2). Staple height and use of buttressing material did not affect leak rate. The use of a size 40-Fr or greater bougie was associated with a leak rate of 0.6% compared with those who used smaller sizes whose leak rate was 2.8%. Leaks were found at the proximal third of the stomach in 89% of cases. Most leaks were diagnosed after discharge. Endoscopic management is a viable option for leaks and was documented in 11% of cases as successful. CONCLUSIONS Sleeve gastrectomy has become an important surgical option for the treatment of the ever growing morbidly obese population. The risk of leak is low at 2.4%. Attention to detail specifically at the esophagogastric junction cannot be stressed enough. Careful patient selection (BMI < 50 kg/m(2)) and adopting the use of a 40-Fr or larger bougie may decrease the risk of leak. Vigilant follow-up during the first 30 days is critical to avoid catastrophe, because most leaks will happen after patient discharge.","output":"Sleeve gastrectomy and the risk of leak: a systematic analysis of 4,888 patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The potential role of accumulation of chondroitin sulfates (CSs) in the pathobiology of COVID-19 has not been examined. Accumulation may occur by increased synthesis or by decline in activity of the enzyme arylsulfatase B (ARSB; N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase) which requires oxygen for activity. METHODS: Immunostaining of lung tissue from 28 patients who died due to COVID-19 infection was performed for CS, ARSB, and carbohydrate sulfotransferase (CHST)15. Measurements of mRNA expression of CHST15 and CHST11, sulfotransferase activity, and total sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) were determined in human vascular smooth muscle cells following angiotensin (Ang) II treatment. RESULTS: CS immunostaining showed increase in intensity and distribution, and immunostaining of ARSB was diminished in COVID-19 compared to normal lung tissue. CHST15 immunostaining was prominent in vascular smooth muscle cells associated with diffuse alveolar damage due to COVID-19 or other causes. Expression of CHST15 and CHST11 which are required for synthesis of CSE and chondroitin 4-sulfate, total sulfated GAGs, and sulfotransferase activity was significantly increased following AngII exposure in vascular smooth muscle cells. Expression of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a mediator of cytokine storm in COVID-19, was inversely associated with ARSB expression. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Decline in ARSB and resulting increases in CS may contribute to the pathobiology of COVID-19, as IL-6 does. Increased expression of CHSTs following activation of Ang-converting enzyme 2 may lead to buildup of CSs.","output":"Increase in Chondroitin Sulfate and Decline in Arylsulfatase B May Contribute to Pathophysiology of COVID-19 Respiratory Failure"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The controversy surrounding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an antimalarial drug, for COVID-19 has raised numerous ethical and policy problems.

In this article, we argue that the concept of disease public profile has become a prominent, if not the sole, determinant in decision-making across various healthcare responses to the pandemic. In the case of COVID-19, the diseases public profile is based on clinical and non-clinical factors that include contagiousness, clinical presentation and media coverage.

Follow up care is often suboptimal leaving these children at risk of a future attacks. We report on the development, implementation and evaluation of a safe asthma discharge care pathway (SADCP). METHODS: This is a retrospective report on the development, implementation and evaluation of outcomes of a SADCP. The pathway was based on the Teach-to-goal educational methodology that supported the mastery correct inhaler technique and ability to action the personalized asthma action plan (PAAP). Children with frequent asthma attacks were entered as they were discharged from the Emergency Department or ward. The first training session occurred within 1C3 weeks of the index asthma attack with 2 further sessions in the following 8 weeks. Children exiting the pathway were discharged either back to primary care or to a hospital clinic. RESULTS: 81 children entered the pathway (median age 5 years) with 72 discharged from the ED and 9 from the medical wards of the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children. At pathway entry 13% had correct inhaler technique, 10% had a Personalized Asthma Action Plan (PAAP), and 5% had >80% (45% >50%) repeat refill evidence of adherence to inhaled corticosteroid over the previous 12 months. On pathway exit all children demonstrated correct inhaler technique and were able to action their PAAP. One year later 51% and 95% had refill evidence of >80% and >50% adherence. Comparisons of the 12 months before and 12 months after exit from the pathway the median number of emergency ED or OoH asthma attendances and courses of oral corticosteroids reduced to zero with >75% having no attacks requiring this level of attention. Similar findings resulted when the SADCP was implemented in a district general hospital pediatric unit.

An increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections which can lead to serious complications and death, has been identified in severe coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) patients or immunocompromised individuals with underlying disease. Studies demonstrated an increase in the frequency of C.auris isolation in COVID-19 patients with candidemia. In this report, the first case of COVID-19 positive C.auris fungemia detected in Turkey was presented. A 71-year-old male patient with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, donation of a single kidney and lobectomy surgery due to lung cancer was hospitalized in the pandemic thoracic surgery service due to the findings consistent with viral pneumonia on thoracic computed tomography. Favipiravir 2 x 600 mg and intravenous dexamethasone 1 x 6 mg therapy was administered. The patient tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction, and severe involvement of the left lung was detected in the following days. Antibiotics were administered, followed by insertion of a right jugular vein catheter and initation of tocilizumab.

OBJECTIVE To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based antigen testing. DESIGN A simple compartmental epidemic model that estimated viral transmission, portrayed disease progression, and forecast resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES Parameter values and ranges as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION U.S. population. TIME HORIZON 60 days. PERSPECTIVE Societal; costs included testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES Cumulative infections and deaths, number of persons isolated and hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 11.6 million infections, 119 000 deaths, and $10.1 billion in costs ($6.5 billion in inpatient care and $3.5 billion in lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing would avert 2.8 million infections and 15 700 deaths, increasing costs by $22.3 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.5 billion) and workdays lost ($14.0 billion), yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $7890 per infection averted and $1 430 000 per death averted. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios, with large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations. Costs per death averted are roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5 to $17 million). LIMITATIONS Analysis was restricted to at-home testing. There are uncertainties concerning test performance. CONCLUSION High-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 with an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

Since parenteral vaccination of free-roaming Kudus is virtually impossible, oral rabies vaccination using modified life virus vaccines with a high safety profile would be the ultimate solution to the problem. In a proof-of-concept study using a 3rd generation oral rabies virus vaccine construct (SPBN GASGAS) we found evidence that Kudus can be vaccinated by the oral route and protected against a subsequent rabies infection.

METHODS AND MATERIALS Fifty-two patients at 4 institutions were enrolled into a prospective pilot clinical trial. Patients underwent baseline scans and then were injected with perirectal spacing hydrogel and rescanned. Intensity modulated radiation therapy plans were created on both scans for comparison. The objectives were to establish rates of creation of  7.5 mm of prostate-rectal separation, and decrease in rectal V70 of  25%. Multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between preinjection and postinjection changes in rectal V70 and changes in plan conformity, rectal volume, bladder volume, bladder V70, planning target volume (PTV), and postinjection midgland separation, gel volume, gel thickness, length of PTV/gel contact, and gel left-to-right symmetry. RESULTS Hydrogel resulted in 7.5-mm prostate-rectal separation in 95.8% of patients; 95.7% had decreased rectal V70 of  25%, with a mean reduction of 8.0 Gy. There were no significant differences in preinjection and postinjection prostate, PTV, rectal, and bladder volumes. Plan conformities were significantly different before versus after injection (P=.02); plans with worse conformity indexes after injection compared with before injection (n=13) still had improvements in rectal V70. In multiple regression analysis, greater postinjection reduction in V70 was associated with decreased relative postinjection plan conformity (P=.01). Reductions in V70 did not significantly vary by institution, despite significant interinstitutional variations in plan conformity. There were no significant relationships between reduction in V70 and the other characteristics analyzed.

These pools were tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 were then de-convoluted and each sample was tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 1580 samples in 158 pools of 10 and 17,515 samples in 3503 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 11 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 11 pools (110 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 10 individual samples came positive. Among 5 samples pool, 164 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 164 pools (820 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 171 individual samples came positive. The pooled sample testing strategy saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76%-93% fewer tests in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSION: Pooled sample RT- PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the quality of outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early asymptomatic stages of COVID-19 infections.","output":"Evaluating the efficiency of specimen (sample) pooling for real-time PCR based diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The two goals of this study were: (1) to explore the relationship of a parents experience in prison in combination with a range of characteristics relating to the parent in prison, to the children, and to the caregiver, and (2) to explore the role of sex and nationality in this relationship.

Pre-existing comorbidities have been found to have a dramatic effect on the disease course. We sought to analyze the effect of asthma on the disease progression and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a multi-center retrospective study of positively confirmed COVID-19 patients. The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 502 COVID-19 adult patients (72 asthma and 430 non-asthma cohorts) with mean age of 60.7 years were included in the study. The frequency of asthma in hospitalized cohorts was 14.3%. Univariate analysis revealed that asthma patients were more likely to be obese (75% versus 54.2%, p = 0.001), with a higher frequency of intubation (40.3% versus 27.8%, p = 0.036), and required a longer duration of hospitalization (15.1  12.5 versus 11.5  10.6, p = 0.015). After adjustment, multivariable analysis showed that asthmatic patients were not associated with higher risk of ICU admission (OR = 1.81, 95%CI = 0.98-3.09, p = 0.06), endotracheal intubation (OR = 1.77, 95%CI = 0.99-3.04, p = 0.06) or complications (OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 0.82-2.31, p = 0.23). Asthmatic patients were not associated with higher odds of prolonged hospital length of stay (OR = 1.48, 95%CI = 0.82-2.66, p = 0.20) or with ICU stay (OR = 0.76, 95%CI = 0.28-2.02, p = 0.58).

The performance of compartmental models is highly dependent on the accuracy of their assumptions about disease dynamics within a population; thus, such models are susceptible to human error, unexpected events, or unknown characteristics of a novel infectious agent like COVID-19. We present a relatively non-parametric random forest model that forecasts the number of COVID-19 cases at the U.S. county level. Its most prioritized training features are derived from easily accessible, standard epidemiological data (i.e., regional test positivity rate) and the effective reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) from compartmental models. A novel input training feature is case projections generated by aligning estimated effective reproduction number (pre-computed by COVIDActNow.org) with real time testing data until maximally correlated, helping our model fit better to the epidemics trajectory as ascertained by traditional models. Poor reliability of [Formula: see text] is partially mitigated with dynamic population mobility and prevalence and mortality of non-COVID-19 diseases to gauge population disease susceptibility. The model was used to generate forecasts for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks into the future for each reference week within 11/01/2020 - 01/10/2021 for 3068 counties. Over this time period, it maintained a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 300 weekly cases/100,000 and consistently outperformed or performed comparably with gold-standard compartmental models.

With vaccination scepticism rising in many countries, assessing the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 is of crucial global health importance. Objective: The goal of this study was to examine how personal and family COVID-19 risk and ICU (intensive care unit) availability just before the pandemics influence the acceptance of future COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: A two-leg survey was carried out for comparing vaccination attitudes pre-and post-COVID-19. UK residents were surveyed in October 2019 about their vaccination attitudes, and again in a follow-up survey in April 2020, containing the previous questions and further ones related to COVID-19 exposure and COVID-19 vaccine attitudes. The study combined survey results with local COVID-19 incidence and pre-COVID-19 measures of ICU capacity and occupancy. Regression analysis of the impact of individual and public health factors on attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination was performed. Results: The October 2019 survey included a nationally representative sample of 1,653 UK residents. All of them were invited for the follow-up survey in April 2020, and 1,194 (72%) participated. The April 2020 sample remained nationally representative. Overall, 85% of respondents (and 55% of vaccine sceptics) would be willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Higher personal and family risk for COVID-19 was associated with stronger COVID-19 vaccination willingness, whereas low pre-COVID-19 ICU availability was associated with lower trust in medical experts and lower COVID-19 vaccine support. Further, general vaccination support has risen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Support for COVID-19 vaccination is high amongst all groups, even vaccine sceptics, boding well for future vaccination take-up rates. Vaccination willingness is correlated with health care availability during the COVID-19 crisis, suggesting a powerful synergy between health care system performance during crisis and the general population's trust in the medical profession - as reflected in vaccination support.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 and ICU capacity on vaccination support: Evidence from a two-leg representative survey in the UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Due to the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, particularly severe or critical ones, overwhelming of health systems has become a worldwide concern Therefore, identifying high-risk COVID-19 patients can help service providers with setting priorities and allocating medical resource Methods: The herein research was designed as a retrospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients 4542 confirmed COVID-19 adult patients admitted to 15 hospitals in Tehran, Iran, from February 20 to April 18, 2020 were included in this study Demographic features including age and sex, clinical outcome (survived or died) and laboratory data were extracted This laboratory data included Complete Blood Count (CBC) tests, liver function tests (LFT), muscle injury enzymes, arterial blood gases (ABG), creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, 25-hydroxy vitamin D level, fasting blood sugar (FBS), D-Dimer, and C-reactive protein (CRP), which were recorded on admission, and compared for both recovered and deceased patients Data analysis was performed using the SPSS modeler software through data mining and machine learning methods Findings: Of the 4542 hospitalized adult patients, 822 (1809%) died during hospitalization, and 3720 (8190%) were discharged from the hospitals Many laboratory tests show significant differences between survived and deceased patients These differences are considered as predictors in this study Based on logistic regression (LR) models, older age, and liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT)  55 IU/ (RR=220, CI: 169-286), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) reference range especially above 100 IU/L (RR=593, CI: 475-739), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) above 200 IU/L (RR=246, CI: 180-337) are associated with a higher COVID-19 Mortality Rate (MR) Serum electrolytes including sodium below 135 mEq/l (RR=169, CI: 135-211), and above 145 mEq/l (RR=724, CI: 507-1033), potassium  550 mEq/l (RR=753, CI: 415-1364), and calcium below 850 mEq/l (RR=339, CI: 281-409) are also connected to an increased COVID-19 MR Also, elevated CPK range 307-600 IU/L (in male patients), and 192-400 IU/L (in female patients) (RR=273, CI: 212-353), and above 600 IU/L (in male patients) and above 400 (RR=441, CI: 340-571) (in female patients), CRP higher than the reference range, specially above 100 mg/l (RR=322, CI: 199-520), and creatinine more than 15 mg/l (RR=637, CI: 530-766) were found to be associated with COVID-19 MR Interpretation: Risk-factor evaluation of COVID-19 patients upon admission into hospitals can lead to a better resource allocation, allowing healthcare providers to offer better and more prompt care to those with severe conditions In this study, the most critical risk factors associated with high-risk patients in different age groups, were elevated creatinine, AST, ALP, and CPK, abnormal sodium level, and hypocalcemia","output":"Identifying High-Risk COVID-19 Patients Based on Laboratory Tests Using Data Mining Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Chest CT screening as supplementary means is crucial in diagnosing novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) with high sensitivity and popularity. Machine learning was adept in discovering intricate structures from CT images and achieved expert-level performance in medical image analysis. Methods: : An integrated machine learning framework on chest CT images for differentiating COVID-19 from general pneumonia (GP) was developed and validated. Seventy-three confirmed COVID-19 cases were consecutively enrolled together with twenty-seven confirmed general pneumonia patients from Ruian Peoples Hospital, from January 2020 to March 2020. To accurately classify COVID-19, region of interest (ROI) delineation was implemented based on ground glass opacities (GGOs) before feature extraction. Then, 34 statistical texture features of COVID-19 and GP ROI images were extracted, including 13 gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, 15 gray level-gradient co-occurrence matrix (GLGCM) features and 6 histogram features. High dimensional features impact the classification performance. Thus, ReliefF algorithm was leveraged to select features. The relevance of each features was the average weights calculated by ReliefF in n times. Features with relevance lager than the empirically set threshold T were selected. After feature selection, the optimal feature set along with 4 other selected feature combinations for comparison were applied to the ensemble of bagged tree (EBT) and four other machine learning classifiers including support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and K-nearest neighbor with Minkowski distance equal weight (KNN) using 10-fold cross-validation.

METHODS A proximal femur model was established based on CT data of a lower extremity from a voluntary healthy man. Garden type III femoral neck fracture was constructed and fixed with DMBCS, TBCS, and TTCS, respectively. Biomechanical effect which three type of CS models have on femoral neck fracture was evaluated and compared using von Mises stress distribution and displacement. RESULTS In the normal model, the maximum stress value of cortical bone and cancellous bone was 76.18 and 6.82 MPa, and the maximum displacement was 5.52 mm. Under 3 different fracture healing status, the stress peak value of the cortical bone and cancellous bone in the DMBCS fixation model was lower than that in the TTCS and TBCS fixation, while the maximum displacement of DMBCS fixation model was slightly higher than that of TTCS and TBCS fixation models. As the fracture heals, stress peak value of the screws and cortical bone of intact models are decreasing, while stress peak value of cancellous bone is increasing initially and then decreasing. CONCLUSIONS The DMBCS exhibits the superior biomechanical performance than TTCS and TBCS, whose fixation model is closest to the normal model in stress distribution. DMBCS is expected to reduce the rates of post-operative complications with traditional internal fixation and provide practical guidance for the structural design of CS for clinical applications.","output":"Titanium alloy cannulated screws and biodegradable magnesium alloy bionic cannulated screws for treatment of femoral neck fractures: a finite element analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Infection control and hand hygiene are taught at different points in the undergraduate medical curriculum. We conducted a survey on fifth year medical (M5) students pre- and peri-influenza A (H1N1-2009) pandemic, attempting to ascertain whether the pandemic had affected their knowledge, perception and practice of hand hygiene and other aspects of infection control. METHODS A self-administered anonymous survey of M5 students was performed between August 2008 and February 2010, corresponding to two successive classes: M5-2008 (Class of 2004/09) and M5-2009 (Class of 2005/10). Completed survey forms were collated and analysed centrally. RESULTS There were 191 and 123 respondents for M5-2008 and M5-2009, respectively, corresponding to 74.9% and 47.3% of the respective classes. More M5-2009 respondents recognised alcohol hand rub as the preferred mode of hand hygiene practice and felt that there were insufficient isolation facilities in hospitals. Otherwise, survey responses were consistent. The majority felt that few doctors practiced hand hygiene appropriately, with the major obstructing factor being lack of time during ward rounds. The most important factor for improving hand hygiene compliance among junior doctors and students was for senior clinicians to lead by example. A significant minority believed that it was necessary to isolate patients with chikungunya, malaria or HIV. CONCLUSION The 2009 H1N1 pandemic made little impact on medical students' knowledge and practice of infection control.

METHODS: Two hundred and three students (76.4% women, mean age 24.3, SD  4.9) responded to an anonymous online cross-sectional survey between July 15 and September 30, 2020, on DE experience and cognitive and social-cognitive variables. A short version of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, ten images from the Eyes Task, and five memory vignette stimuli were included in the survey. Descriptive, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and logistic regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Half of the student sample reported significant impairment in concentration and learning abilities during DE. Regarding psychological health, 19.7%, 27.1%, and 23.6% of the sample reported mild, moderate, and severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Correlation analyses showed a statistically significant negative association between depression and the overall subjective evaluation of DE (r = ? 0.359; p < 0.000). Changes in ones study context and habits, i.e., studying alone at ones parents home instead of studying with colleagues or alone in a university social place (e.g., the university library), seemed to increase the likelihood of poor academic performance by almost 3 times (O.R. 3.918; p = 0.032). This predictor was no longer statistically significant in the subsequent step when the individual impairment predictors were entered. Learning concentration impairment during DE (O.R. 8.350; p = 0.014), anxiety about COVID-19 contagion for oneself or others (O.R. 3.363; p = 0.022), female gender (O.R. 3.141; p = 0.045), and depressive symptomatology (O.R. 1.093; p = 0.047) were ultimately determined to be the strongest predictors of poor academic performance, whereas the appreciation of DE represented a protective variable (O.R. 0.610; p < 0.000).

We describe a novel, innovative 2-port laparoscopic technique, in which intracorporeal appendectomy can be completed safely with standard instrumentation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eight consecutive patients were prospectively assigned to undergo 2-port laparoscopic appendectomies for presumed appendicitis. The technique involves the placement of one 12-mm infraumbilical port for the working instruments and one 5-mm left lower quadrant port for the camera. A suture is tied in a loop to the anterior abdominal wall in the right lower quadrant, which is subsequently used as an axle. A pretied suture placed on the appendix is passed through the loop suture and then through the port to the outside of the abdomen. This technique allows exposure of the base of the appendix and compensates for the lack of the third port usually required for the retraction of the appendix. The mesoappendix and appendix are stapled and removed from the abdomen in an extrication bag. RESULTS All 8 laparoscopic procedures were completed without difficulty. The mean operative time was 64.1 min. Length of hospitalization was 1 d or less. No major complications were encountered.

Collected data were analyzed by applying the structural equation modeling through Smart PLS and Process Macro. The results indicate that ethical leadership and meaningful work (MW) reduce knowledge-hiding behavior of employees at work, while ethical leadership positively impacts the influential work of employees at the workplace. Further, the relationship between ethical leadership and knowledge-hiding behavior is partially mediated by MW. Similarly, ethical climate moderated the relationship between ethical leadership and knowledge-hiding behavior. This research makes valuable contributions to the existing literature on leadership and knowledge management. From a practical point of view, this study stresses that managers at work should promote ethical leadership styles to promote MW, which will reduce knowledge hiding.

However, the need for several reagents and steps and the high cost of PCR hinder its worldwide implementation to contain the outbreak. Here, we report a cotton-tipped electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus antigen. Unlike the reported approaches, we integrated the sample collection and detection tools into a single platform by coating screen-printed electrodes with absorbing cotton padding. The immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the virus nucleocapsid (N) protein on carbon nanofiber-modified screen-printed electrodes which were functionalized by diazonium electrografting. The detection of the virus antigen was achieved via swabbing followed by competitive assay using a fixed amount of N protein antibody in the solution. A square wave voltammetric technique was used for the detection. The limit of detection for our electrochemical biosensor was 0.8 pg/mL for SARS-CoV-2, indicating very good sensitivity for the sensor. The biosensor did not show significant cross-reactivity with other virus antigens such as influenza A and HCoV, indicating high selectivity of the method. Moreover, the biosensor was successfully applied for the detection of the virus antigen in spiked nasal samples showing excellent recovery percentages. Thus, our electrochemical immunosensor is a promising diagnostic tool for the direct rapid detection of the COVID-19 virus that requires no sample transfer or pretreatment.","output":"Development of a Low-Cost Cotton-Tipped Electrochemical Immunosensor for the Detection of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of the interleukin-6 receptor, may decrease the inflammatory response and control the symptoms of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the evidence is scarce.

METHODS A retrospective nursing method was implemented. A total of 280 cases of patients were diagnosed with coronavirus pneumonia in the isolation ward of our hospital. The 280 cases of newly diagnosed pneumonia were divided into two groups: the nursing crisis management system group (n=150, the nursing crisis management was given) and the non-nursing crisis management system (n=130, routine nursing management was given). The psychological status (profile of mood states (POMS) score) of nursing staff before and after the implementation of the nursing crisis management, the psychological status of patients after the implementation of nursing crisis management (POMS score), emotion, cognition, behavior severity, patients' satisfaction with nursing, treatment compliance (Morisky Medication Compliance Scale (MMAS) score) of patients, the rate of cure of patients and the infection rate of nursing staff were compared. RESULTS Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the POMS scores of patients and nurses in the nursing crisis management system group decreased (all P<0.05). Compared with the non-nursing crisis management system group, the emotional, cognitive and behavioral scores of patients in the nursing crisis management system group were lower, while the MMAS score, satisfaction with nursing and cure rate were significantly increased (all P<0.05).

COVID-19 policies restrict their access to care, but it is unknown how these policies have affected them. The aim of this study is to explore the perinatal care given to and wanted by expectant and new fathers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. METHODS: The current study used an inductive qualitative design where 14 expectant or new fathers participated in a video- or telephone-based semi-structured interview. Interviews lasted 20 minutes, on average. The collected data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Two main themes were reported: 1) Being left out, but trying to remain positive, and 2) immediate consequences related to restrictions. Expectant fathers were not able to attend as many perinatal visits as they wanted to, due to the COVID-19 restrictions on non-birthing parents. Expectant fathers regretted and felt discouraged that they could not support their partner during visits and not follow their babys growth and development. Furthermore, they faced uncertainties and stress regarding whether or not they could attend the birth of their child. Fathers reported how their exclusion negatively impacted the entire family. CONCLUSIONS: Expectant and new fathers felt that their level of participation in prenatal care was negatively impacted by the Swedish policies imposed on them during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fathers were physically and emotionally excluded, resulting in receiving little direct care support, and lacked companionship with other parents.

STUDY DESIGN: Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. SETTINGS: Dedicated surgical laboratory. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 m. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. RESULTS: The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols &#8804;3.30 m, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols &#8804;14.1 m. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols &#8804;14.1 m, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares.

SOC is a generalized orientation which allows one to perceive the world as comprehensible, manageable, and meaningful. In an attempt to understand how does the SOC work we employed the salutogenic assumption that a strong SOC allows one to reach out in any given situation and find those resources appropriate to the specific stressor. Thus, we hypothesized that the positive impact of SOC on mental health outcomes would be mediated through coping resources that are particularly salient in times of crisis. One resource is related to the micro level (perceived family support) and the other concerns the macro level (trust in leaders and social-political institutions). Data collection was conducted in different countries during MayCJune 2020 via online platforms. The data included 7 samples of adult participants (age 18C90) from Israel (n ?= ?669), Italy (n ?= ?899), Spain (n ?= ?476), Germany (n ?= ?708), Austria (n ?= ?1026), Switzerland (n ?= ?147), and the U.S. (n ?= ?506). The questionnaires included standard tools (MHC-SF, SOC-13) as well as questionnaires of perceived family support and trust that were adapted to the pandemic context. As expected, SOC was associated with mental health in all the samples. Perceived family support and trust in leaders and social-political institutions mediated the relationships between SOC and mental health, controlling for age, gender, and level of financial risk. It appears that SOC has a universal meaning, not limited by cultural and situational characteristics. The discussion focuses on the theoretical, social, and political applications of the salutogenic model C and its core concept of SOC C in the context of coping with a global pandemic across different cultural contexts and countries.","output":"Order out of chaos: Sense of coherence and the mediating role of coping resources in explaining mental health during COVID-19 in 7 countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lower gastrointestinal cancer patients, like other immunosuppressed patients, are vulnerable to develop more severe infections.

The limited effectiveness of conventional medication has prompted the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as alternative or adjunctive therapy for the management of bronchiolitis. AIMS: To determine the effectiveness and safety of CAM for the treatment of bronchiolitis in infants aged less than 2 years. METHODS: A systematic electronic search was performed in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their respective inception to June 30, 2016 for studies evaluating CAM as an intervention to treat bronchiolitis in infants (1 month to 2 years of age). The CAM could be any form of treatment defined by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) and was utilized either as a single agent or adjunctive therapy. The predefined primary outcome was length of hospital stay. Secondary outcomes were time to resolution of bronchiolitis symptoms, adverse events, and all other clinical outcomes reported by the included studies. RESULTS: The review identified 11 studies (8 randomized controlled trials and 3 cohort studies) examining four herbal preparations and four supplements used either as adjunctive or alternative therapy for bronchiolitis in 904 infants. Most studies were of moderate quality. Among six studies reporting on length of stay, a significant benefit was found for Chinese herbal medicine compared to ribavirin in one cohort study (n = 66) and vitamin D compared to placebo in one randomized controlled trial (n = 89). Studies of Chinese herbal medicine (4 studies, n = 365), vitamin D (1 study, n = 89), N-acetylcysteine (1 study, n = 100), and magnesium (2 studies, n = 176) showed some benefits with respect to clinical severity scores, oxygen saturation, and other symptoms, although data were sparse for any single intervention and the outcomes assessed and reported varied across studies. Only five studies reported on adverse events; no serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among 11 studies examining the effect of CAM on inpatients with bronchiolitis, six reported on the reviews primary outcome of length of hospital stay. In general, findings did not show a significant benefit associated with the primary outcome. Preliminary evidence indicated that Chinese herbal medicine mixtures, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and magnesium might be useful in managing the symptoms of bronchiolitis.

Selective, intracarotid blood cooling may initiate rapid and early brain hypothermia, reduce systemic effects, and allow combined endovascular mechanical thrombectomy. For this approach, a balloon cooling catheter system was designed and studied in vitro to optimize its cooling performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS Computational fluid dynamics of blood cooling was performed within the common carotid artery lumen by using 3 different catheter designs (1-, 2-, and 4-balloon array). On the basis of these results, a first catheter prototype was manufactured, and its heat-exchange performance was tested in an artificial in vitro circulation simulating the common carotid artery lumen at different flow rates (inflow temperature of 37C). RESULTS In the computational fluid dynamics model, the catheter with the 4-balloon array achieved the highest cooling rate of -1.6C, which may be attributed to disruption of the thermal boundary layers. In the in vitro study, cooling of the blood substitute at flow rates of 400 mL/min (normal common carotid artery flow) and 250 mL/min (reduced common carotid artery flow due to distal MCA occlusion) achieved a temperature drop inside the blood substitute along the cooling balloons of -1.6C and -2.2C, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The feasibility of intracarotid blood cooling using a new catheter system was demonstrated in vitro. A serial 4-balloon array led to an optimized cooling capacity approaching optimum target temperatures of mild therapeutic hypothermia. To determine the therapeutic efficacy of combined selective therapeutic hypothermia and mechanical thrombectomy, further in vivo studies by using a model of temporary ischemia with large-vessel occlusion and recanalization are required.","output":"Combined Selective Cerebral Hypothermia and Mechanical Artery Recanalization in Acute Ischemic Stroke: In Vitro Study of Cooling Performance."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is mainly associated with pneumonia, several non-respiratory complications may also occur.

Prime/boost vaccination of guinea pigs with MVACMARVCVLP-elicited MARV-specific binding and neutralizing antibody responses. Vaccination also induced Fc-mediated innate immune effector functions including activation of NK cells and antibody-dependent phagocytosis by neutrophils and monocytes. Inoculation of vaccinated animals with guinea pig-adapted MARV demonstrated 100% protection against death and disease with no viremia. Therefore, our vaccine platform, expressing two antigens resulting in assembly of VLPs in the native conformation in vaccinated hosts, can be used as a potent vaccine against MARV.","output":"Modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine expressing Marburg virus-like particles protects guinea pigs from lethal Marburg virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: An autopsy case of a two-month-old male infant who suddenly and unexpectedly died during his sleep, eight days after the onset of benign varicella.

DESIGN Meta-analysis. METHODS This review was conducted and reported in accordance with PRISMA and pre-registered with PROSPERO. Articles were retrieved via online database search engines, with no date or language restriction. Studies investigating current field-based athletes (>18years) for CVD risk factors according to the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association were screened. Full texts were screened using Covidence and Cochrane criteria. Eligible articles were critically appraised using the AXIS tool. Individual study estimates were assessed by random-effect meta-analyses to examine the overall effect. RESULTS This study was ascribed a 1b evidence level, according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine. 41 studies were identified, including 5546 athletes from four sports; American football; soccer; rugby and baseball mean ages: 18-28. Despite participation in sport, increased body mass was associated with increased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, and decreased high-density lipoprotein. Linemen had increased prevalence of hypertension compared to non-athletes. Conflicting findings on fasting glucose were prevalent. There were inconsistencies in screening and reporting of CVD risk factors. Sport specific anthropometric demands were associated with elevated prevalence of CVD risk factors, most notably: elevated body mass; dyslipidemia; elevated systolic blood pressure and; glucose. CONCLUSIONS There are elevated levels of risk for CVD in some athletes, primarily football players. Lifestyle behaviours associated with elite athleticism, particularly football linemen potentially expose players to greater metabolic and CVD risk, which is not completely offset by sport participation.","output":"A career in sport does not eliminate risk of cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the cardiovascular health of field-based athletes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has triggered serious disruption in economic, social and cultural dynamics around the globe. Higher education has also suffered undeniable challenges as a result of the pandemic, with thousands of university students all over the world experiencing displacement, disconnect and disengagement from formal learning. In the Global South, online and distance education programmes tend to be concentrated in urban centres. In Nepal, students from rural areas, low socio-economic and gendered spaces, and those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills are experiencing inequalities in access to and participation in online and distance education. This article outlines how universities' shift to online teaching and learning modes due to the COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced social inequalities in Nepal. For the study presented here, the author collected data through netnographic research methods. These included online interviews with university executives, online focus group discussions (FGDs) with university teachers and students, observation of and participation in online classes and policy conferences and reviews of online documents. The article analyses three overriding mechanisms which are reinforcing social inequalities in higher education: (1) universities policy trajectories in shifting teaching/learning from face-to-face to online mode; (2) infrastructural limitations challenging effective implementation of online teaching/learning; and (3) a lack of strong pedagogic support for students from disadvantaged and marginalised spaces, including those with low proficiencies in English and technological skills. The author presents a number of tangible strategies for universities to implement in order to mitigate social inequalities. He recommends the adoption of policies and practices that optimise the inclusive use of online and distance education programmes for best effect, both now and in the post-pandemic era.","output":"Inequalities reinforced through online and distance education in the age of COVID-19: The case of higher education in Nepal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although povidone-iodine (PVP-I) has been used as a gargle since 1956, its effectiveness and material safety have been remained controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the toxicity of PVP-I to epithelial cells in a concentration range significantly lower than that used clinically. Study design was in vitro laboratory investigations and in vivo histological and immunologic analysis. We examined the effects of PVP-I at concentrations of 1  10(-2) to 1  10(3) M and 1  10(-4) to 1  10 M on HeLa cells as a model of epithelial cells and rat oral mucosa, respectively, after 1 or 2 days of exposure. Annexin V/FLUOS was used to distinguish live, apoptotic and necrotic cells. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method was also used to observe whether apoptotic epithelial cells exist in rat oral mucosa after 1 day of exposure of PVP-I. HeLa cells developed concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, and epithelium of rat oral mucosa was thinned in a concentration-dependent manner. HeLa cell apoptosis increased after 1  10(0) M of PVP-I exposure for 2 days. In the TUNEL method, many apoptotic epithelial cells were observed in the rat oral mucosa after 1 day of exposure to diluted 1  10(-2) M of PVP-I, but minimal apoptotic epithelial cells were observed using 1  10(-3) M of PVP-I. Our findings suggest that exposure to PVP-I, of which concentrations are even lower than those used clinically, causes toxicity in epithelial cells.

These applications usually have semi-structured work environment. The use of a fully autonomous mobile manipulator for such applications can be risky, as an inaccurate model of the workspace may result in damage to expensive equipment. On the other hand, the use of a fully teleoperated mobile manipulator may require a significant amount of operator time. In this paper, a semi-autonomous mobile manipulator is developed for safely and efficiently carrying out machine tending tasks under human supervision. The robot is capable of generating motion plans from the high-level task description and presenting simulation results to the human for approval. The human operator can authorize the robot to execute the automatically generated plan or provide additional input to the planner to refine the plan. If the level of uncertainty in some parts of the workspace model is high, then the human can decide to perform teleoperation to safely execute the task.

Yet, the role of mucus layers on evaporation times has not been considered even though the formation of mucus shells around liquid cores of respiratory droplets has been shown experimentally. Here we show that mucus shells increase the drying time by orders of magnitude so that enveloped virions may remain well hydrated and, thus, fully infective at substantial distances. This provides a mechanism by which infective enveloped virus particles can transmit as aerosols within buildings and between buildings over extended distances. This analysis is important because public health agencies typically follow the Wells model to establish health policies including social/physical distancing guidelines.","output":"The missing layer in COVID-19 studies: Transmission of enveloped viruses in mucus-rich droplets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019-2020 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Traditional culture techniques take time that may delay treatment. We hypothesized that a rapid multiplex molecular assay could improve time to diagnosis and appropriate clinical decision making. METHODS In a prospective observational study of recipients undergoing bronchoscopy, we assessed the BioFire? FilmArray? Pneumonia Panel (BFPP) in parallel to standard of care (SOC) diagnostics. Research clinicians performed shadow (research only) clinical decision making in real time. Time to report and interpretation were reported as median and interquartile ranges and compared by Wilcoxon signed-ranked test. Agreement was defined based on detection of any species targeted in the molecular assay. RESULTS For the 150 enrolled subjects, BFPP results were available 3.8 hours (IQR 2.8-5.1) following bronchoscopy, compared to 13 hours for viral SOC (IQR 10-34, P <0.001) results and 48 hours for bacterial SOC (IQR 46-70, P <0.001) results. Positive BFPP were interpreted in 9 hours (IQR 5-20) following bronchoscopy, compared to 74 hours for SOC (IQR 37-110, P <0.001). Assays agreed for 138 (92%) of the 150 subjects. Of 22 BFPP diagnoses, 5 (23%) resulted in a shadow antibiotic recommendation. Notable BFPP deficiencies included fungal species and H. parainfluenzae, accounting for 15 (27%) and 13 (23%) of the 56 actionable SOC results, respectively.

Such antibodies provide protection against reinfection by the same strain of a pathogen. A highly mutable virus, like HIV or influenza, evades recognition by these strain-specific antibodies via the emergence of new mutant strains. A vaccine that elicits antibodies that can bind to many diverse strains of the virus C known as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) C could protect against highly mutable pathogens. Despite much work, the mechanisms by which bnAbs emerge remain uncertain. Using a computational model of affinity maturation, we studied a wide variety of vaccination strategies. Our results suggest that an effective strategy to maximize bnAb evolution is through a sequential immunization protocol, wherein each new immunization optimally increases the pressure on the immune system to target conserved antigenic sites, thus conferring breadth. We describe the mechanisms underlying why sequentially driving the immune system increasingly further from equilibrium, in an optimal fashion, is effective. The optimal protocol allows many evolving B cells to become bnAbs via diverse evolutionary paths. Significance Statement The global health burden could be substantially alleviated by the creation of universal vaccines against highly mutable pathogens like HIV and influenza. Broadly-neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are encouraging targets for such vaccines, because they can bind to diverse strains of highly mutable pathogens. BnAbs typically develop only rarely upon natural infection, after the immune system has been exposed to many mutated versions of a pathogen. Thus, sequentially administering multiple different pathogen-like proteins (antigens) is a promising strategy to elicit bnAbs through vaccination. However, it remains unclear how best to design and administer these antigens. We explore this matter using physics-based simulations, and provide new mechanistic insights into antibody evolution that could guide the creation of universal vaccines against highly mutable pathogens.","output":"Optimizing immunization protocols to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction There is no clear unified definition of \\"county programs\\" in emergency medicine (EM).

The majority defined county programs by commitment to care for the underserved, funding from the city or state, low-resourced, and urban setting. Major qualitative themes included mission, clinical environment, research, training, and applicant recommendations. Comparing the attributes of programs by self-described type of training environment, county programs are typically larger, older, in central metro areas, and more likely to be 4 years in duration and have higher patient volumes when compared to community or university programs. When comparing hospital-level attributes of primary training sites county programs are more likely to be owned and operated by local governments or governmental hospital districts and authorities and see more disproportionate-share hospital patients. Implications for education and training in EM To be considered a county program we recommend some or most of the following attributes be present: a shared mission to medically underserved and vulnerable patients, an urban location with city or county funding, an ED with high patient volumes, supportive of resident autonomy, and research expertise focusing on underserved populations.","output":"Defining \\"county\\": A mixed-methods inquiry of county emergency medicine residency programs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] The COVID-19 pandemic is among the greatest health and socioeconomic crises in recent history.

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March, 2020 and since then, it has caused a number of deaths in over 200 countries around the world. Extensive researches have continued in the search of effective vaccines or drug compounds against SARS-CoV-2 and a total of 64 vaccines are currently in clinical trials with 12 currently approved for use by different regulatory bodies, depending on the country. Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, many countries have utilised traditional herbal medicines alongside conventional drugs for the treatment of infected patients. In this review, traditional medicines used to prevent or treat SARS-CoV-2 infection are listed along with the plant parts as used by the traditional healers. Additionally, the possible mechanisms responsible for this preventive or therapeutic outcome are also identified and listed. Our literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus and WHO website. Unpublished reports such asdissertations and theses are not included. Plant parts including roots, leaves, flowers, seeds and so on have been used in the treatment of COVID-19. These traditional medicinal herbs may exert their anti-COVID-19 activity by direct inhibition of the virus replication or entry. Some may act by blocking the ACE-2 receptor, SARS-CoV helicase, Type II Transmembrane Serine Protease (TMPRSS2) and which are required by SARS-CoV-2 in order to infect human cells. Others act by inhibiting the SARSCoV-2 life-cycle related proteins, namely chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL-pro) and Papain-like protease (PL-pro). Medicinal plants are promising alternative medicines for the treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Epidemiologists and researchers worldwide are invariably trying to understand and combat this precarious new disease. Scrutinizing available drug options and developing potential new drugs are urgent needs to subdue this pandemic. Several intervention strategies are being considered and handled worldwide with limited success, and many drug candidates are yet in the trial phase. Despite these limitations, the development of COVID-19 treatment strategies has been accelerated to improve the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19, and some countries have efficiently kept it under control. Recently, the use of natural and traditional medicine has also set the trend in coronavirus treatment. This review aimed to discuss the prevailing COVID-19 treatment strategies available globally by examining their efficacy, potential mechanisms, limitations, and challenges in predicting a future potential treatment candidate and bridging them with the effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).

The aim of the present study was to report our experience treating basilar apex aneurysms with flow-diverter stents and to evaluate their efficacy and safety profile in this specific anatomic condition. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed data from all consecutive patients treated with flow-diverter stents at our institution between January 2011 and January 2015. Patients with large basilar apex aneurysms treated with a flow-diverter stent were included in the study. Clinical presentations, technical details, intra- and perioperative complications, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were recorded, with a midterm follow-up. RESULTS Of the 175 aneurysms treated with flow-diverter stents at our institution, 5 patients (2 women and 3 men; age range, 44-58 years) received flow-diverter stent for basilar apex aneurysms. The mean follow-up after stent deployment was 21 months (range, 15-24 months). One patient died on day 31 from an early postprocedural midbrain hemorrhage. One patient had a right cerebellar hemispheric ischemic lesion with a transient cerebellar syndrome resolved within 24 hours without neurologic sequelae at the latest follow-up. The mRS was 0 in 4 patients and 6 in 1 patient at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion is a feasible technique with an efficacy demonstrated at a midterm follow-up, especially in the case of basilar apex aneurysm recurrences after previous endovascular treatments.

Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission-successfully reducing the reproductive number R below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses.

The virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets and physical contact from contaminated surfaces to the mucosa. Hand hygiene and oral decontamination among other measures are key to preventing the spread of the virus. We report the in vitro virucidal activity of topical and oral povidone-iodine (PVP-I) products against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Suspension assays were used to assess the virucidal activity of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2. Products were tested at a contact time of 30 s for virucidal activity. Viral titres were calculated using the Spearman-K?rber method and reported as median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50)/mL. RESULTS: All four products [antiseptic solution (PVP-I 10%), skin cleanser (PVP-I 7.5%), gargle and mouth wash (PVP-I 1%) and throat spray (PVP-I 0.45%)] achieved &#8805; 99.99% virucidal activity against SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to &#8805; 4 log10 reduction of virus titre, within 30 s of contact. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence of rapid and effective virucidal activity of PVP-I against SARS-CoV-2.

Boswellia sacra oleoresin (frankincense) was used to treat bacterial infections in traditional Arabian and Asian healing systems for at least 1000 years. Despite this, B. sacra extracts have not been rigorously tested for inhibitory activity against gastrointestinal pathogens or bacterial triggers of autoimmune diseases. Solvent extracts were prepared from Boswellia sacra oleoresins obtained from three regions near Salalah, Oman. MIC values were quantified against gastrointestinal pathogens and bacterial triggers of selected autoimmune diseases by disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. The antibacterial activity was also evaluated in combination with conventional antibiotics, and the class of interaction was determined by FIC analysis. Isobolograms were used to determine the optimal ratios for synergistic combinations. Toxicity was evaluated by ALA and HDF cell viability bioassays. The phytochemical composition of the volatile components of all extracts was identified by nontargeted GC-MS headspace analysis. All methanolic extracts inhibited the growth of all of the bacteria tested, although the extracts prepared using Najdi oleoresin were generally more potent than the Sahli and Houjari extracts. Combinations of the methanolic B. sacra extracts and conventional antibiotics were significantly more effective in inhibiting the growth of several bacterial pathogens. In total, there were 38 synergistic and 166 additive combinations. Approximately half of the synergistic combinations contained tetracycline. All B. sacra extracts were nontoxic in the ALA and HDF cell viability assays. Nonbiased GC-MS headspace analysis of the methanolic extracts putatively identified a high diversity of monoterpenoids, with particularly high abundances of -pinene. The antibacterial activity and lack of toxicity of the B. sacra extracts indicate their potential in the treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal and autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, the extracts potentiated the activity of several conventional antibiotics, indicating that they may contain resistance-modifying compounds.","output":"Chemical Composition, Antibacterial Activity, and Antibiotic Potentiation of Boswellia sacra Flueck.

Aim Primary objective of the study is to establish the role of hematological, coagulation and inflammatory biomarkers in early identification of clinically severe covid-19 cases. Materials and Methods This study was conducted from July 2020 to August 2020 at a dedicated COVID-19 referral hospital in central India. Only RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 positive 300 cases admitted in the hospital were included in this study. Based on the clinical assessment, patients were categorised as mild, moderate, and severe groups as per ICMR guidelines. Blood samples of all cases were tested for haematological, coagulation and inflammatory biomarkers and mean values were compared among the three groups of patients. Results 46% patients belonged to >60 years of age group. Hematological parameters like total leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, Neutrophil: Lymphocyte ratio, Platelet: Lymphocyte ratio significantly increased with lymphocytopenia (P=0.001).

The thermal denaturation free energy change G value calculated for the long-lived structure at higher temperatures of 348 and 363 K ranges from 2.58 to 2.78 kcal/mol for the SPC/E water model, which agrees well with the experimentally reported thermal denaturation free energy range of 2.874 kcal/mol of SARS CoV-NP at normal pH. At higher temperatures, the stability of RNA conformation is found to be due to the existence of non-native base pairs in the SPC/E water model.","output":"Temperature-Dependent Conformational Evolution of SARS CoV-2 RNA Genome Using Network Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe the clinical presentation of individuals presenting with prolonged recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), known as long COVID.

We performed a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) on the most common self-reported symptoms and hierarchical clustering on the results of the MCA to identify symptom clusters. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-three individuals were included in the analysis; the median age of the cohort was 43 (interquartile range [IQR], 36C54) years, 74% were women, and 77.3% reported a mild initial illness. MCA and hierarchical clustering revealed 3 clusters. Cluster 1 had predominantly pain symptoms with a higher proportion of joint pain, myalgia, and headache; cluster 2 had a preponderance of cardiovascular symptoms with prominent chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations; and cluster 3 had significantly fewer symptoms than the other clusters (2 [IQR, 2C3] symptoms per individual in cluster 3 vs 6 [IQR, 5C7] and 4 [IQR, 3C5] in clusters 1 and 2, respectively; P < .001).

Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. METHODS: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. RESULTS: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days.

PURPOSE: Automatic therapeutic substitution (ATS) protocols are formulary tools that allow for provider-selected interchange from a nonformulary preadmission medication to a formulary equivalent. Previous studies have demonstrated that the application of clinical decision support (CDS) tools to ATS can decrease ATS errors at admission, but there are limited data describing the impact of CDS on discharge errors. The objective of this study was to describe the impact of CDS-supported interchanges on discharge prescription duplications or omissions. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study conducted at an academic medical center. Patients admitted between June 2017 and August 2019 were included if they were 18 years or older at admission, underwent an ATS protocolCapproved interchange for 1 of the 9 included medication classes, and had a completed discharge medication reconciliation. The primary outcome was difference in incidence of therapeutic duplication or omission at discharge between the periods before and after CDS implementation. RESULTS: A total of 737 preimplementation encounters and 733 postimplementation encounters were included. CDS did not significantly decrease the incidence of discharge duplications or omissions (12.1% vs 11.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], C2.3% to 4.2%) nor the incidence of admission duplication or inappropriate reconciliation (21.4% vs 20.7%; 95% CI, C3.4% to 4.8%) when comparing the pre- and postimplementation periods. Inappropriate reconciliation was the primary cause of discharge medication errors for both groups.

To explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown (LCD) on organic aerosols, the mixing states and evolution processes of amine-containing particles were studied using a single particle aerosol mass spectrometer from January to March 2020 in Liaocheng, which is a seriously polluted city in North China. The counts and percentages of amine-containing particles in total obtained particles during the pre-LCD (547832, 29.8 %) were higher than those during the LCD (283983, 20.7 %) and post-LCD (102026, 18.4 %), mainly due to the reduced emission strength of amines and suppressed gas-to-particle partitioning of amines during the LCD and post-LCD. (74)(C(2)H(5))(2)NH(2)(+) was the most abundant amine marker, which accounted for 98.2 %, 98.4 %, and 96.7 % of all amine-containing particles during the pre-LCD, LCD, and post-LCD, respectively. Correlation analysis and temporal variations indicated that the gas-to-particle partitioning of amines was facilitated by the stronger acidic environment and lower temperature, while the effect of RH and aerosol liquid water content was minor. The A-OC particles were the most abundant type (accounting for 40 %) throughout the observation period. The temporal profiles and correlation analysis suggested that the impact of the increased O(3) on the amines and their oxidation products (e.g., trimethylamine oxide) was minor. The identified particle types, correlation analysis, and the potential source contribution function results implied that the amine-containing particles were mainly derived from local and surrounding sources during the LCD, while those were mainly affected by long-range transport during the pre-LCD and post-LCD.

CIN's aim was to examine important outcomes of hospitalisation at scale, identify and ultimately solve practical problems of service delivery, drive improvements in quality and test interventions. By including multiple routine settings in research, we aimed to promote generalisability of findings and demonstrate potential efficiencies derived from LHS. We illustrate the nature and range of research CIN has supported over the past 7 years as a form of LHS. Clinically, this has largely focused on common, serious paediatric illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea with dehydration with recent extensions to neonatal illnesses. CIN also enables examination of the quality of care, for example that provided to children with severe malnutrition and the challenges encountered in routine settings in adopting simple technologies (pulse oximetry) and more advanced diagnostics (eg, Xpert MTB/RIF). Although regular feedback to hospitals has been associated with some improvements in quality data continue to highlight system challenges that undermine provision of basic, quality care (eg, poor access to blood glucose testing and routine microbiology). These challenges include those associated with increased mortality risk (eg, delays in blood transfusion).

SETTING: This study was conducted in a rural community in Southern Nigeria. METHODS: This study employed a mixed method comprising seven focus group discussions (FGDs) and quantitative components. The cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst 209 ever married or cohabited females in 2018 using the World Health Organization (WHO) multi-country survey questionnaire adapted to the study objectives. Data analysis was conducted by using IBM SPSS v21.0. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The overall IPV prevalence was 79.4%. The prevalence of partners controlling behaviour, emotional IPV, physical IPV and sexual IPV was 62.6%, 55.98%, 49.3% and 2.6%, respectively.

A cross-sectional survey was completed by 1,059 adults with non-malignant chronic pain conditions (M(age) 43 years, 88% identified as women) and collected measures related to pain severity, pain interference, sleep quality, and depression. Multiple regression analyses found that pain severity, pain interference, and sleep quality are all significantly associated with depression. Secondly, moderated regression analyses revealed that sleep quality moderates the relationship between pain interference and depression among individuals with chronic pain such that good sleep quality attenuates the effect of pain interference on depression, and poor sleep quality amplifies the effect of pain interference on depression. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be a relevant therapeutic target for individuals with chronic pain and co-existing depression.","output":"Good Sleep Quality Improves the Relationship Between Pain and Depression Among Individuals With Chronic Pain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For tiling of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, the ARTIC Network provided a V4 protocol using 99 pairs of primers for amplicon production and is currently the widely used amplicon-based approach. However, this technique has regions of low sequence coverage and is labour-, time-, and cost-intensive. Moreover, it requires 14 pairs of primers in two separate PCRs to obtain spike gene sequences. To overcome these disadvantages, we proposed a single PCR to efficiently detect spike gene mutations. We proposed a bioinformatic protocol that can process FASTQ reads into spike gene consensus sequences to accurately call spike protein variants from sequenced samples or to fairly express the cases of missing amplicons. We evaluated the in silico detection rate of primer sets that yield amplicon sizes of 400, 1200, and 2500 bp for spike gene sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to be 59.49, 76.19, and 92.20%, respectively. The in silico detection rate of our proposed single PCR primers was 97.07%. We demonstrated the robustness of our analytical protocol against 3000 Oxford Nanopore sequencing runs of distinct datasets, thus ensuring high-integrity sequencing of spike genes for variant SARS-CoV-2 determination. Our protocol works well with the data yielded from versatile primer designs, making it easy to determine spike protein variants.","output":"High-Integrity Sequencing of Spike Gene for SARS-CoV-2 Variant Determination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Information and communication technology is playing a major role in ensuring continuity of healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has also disrupted healthcare quality improvement (QI) training and education for healthcare professionals and there is a need to rethink the way QI training and education is delivered. The purpose of this rapid evidence review is to quickly but comprehensively collate studies to identify what works and what does not in delivering QI training and education using distance-learning modalities. Three healthcare databases were searched along with grey literature sources for studies published between 2015 and 2020. Studies with QI training programmes or courses targeting healthcare professionals and students with at least one component of the programme being delivered online were included. A total of nineteen studies were included in the review. Most studies had a mixed methods design and used blended learning methods, combining online and in-person delivery modes. Most of the included studies reported achieving desired outcomes, including improved QI knowledge, skills and attitudes of participants and improved clinical outcomes for patients. Some benefits of online QI training delivery include fewer required resources, reducing the need for on-site instructors, increased programme reach, and more control and flexibility over learning time for participants. Some limitations of online delivery modes include limited learning and networking opportunities, functional and technical problems and long lead time for content adaptation and customization. The review highlights that distance learning approaches to QI help in overcoming barriers to traditional QI training. Virtual training environment holds great potential in delivering standardised training and distance collaborations which will be of utmost importance in the post-COVID environment. The review offers guidance on important questions to be considered in delivering QI programmes through distance learning modes.","output":"Virtual adaptation of healthcare quality improvement training programmes in response to COVID-19: A rapid narrative review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To compare spinal anesthesia (SA) with general anesthesia (GA) in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery regarding anesthetic parameters and patient satisfaction together with an assessment of total oxidant, antioxidant levels, and Oxidative Stress index (OSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients who were planned to undergo gynecologic laparoscopy were randomized into group G (GA) and group S (SA). Demographics, adverse events and anesthetic parameters were recorded before induction, after induction, and at the 5(th), 10(th), 15(th), 30(th), 60(th), 90(th), and 120(th) minutes. Patients and surgeons completed questionnaires. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total oxidant level (TOL), and OSI were measured. RESULTS: There was no difference between the groups in terms of hemodynamic parameters except heart rate at 30(th) minute and mean arteral pressure at 10(th), 15(th), 30(th), and 60(th) minute (p<0.05). The postoperative arterial blood pH value was lower in group S (p=0.021). Intraoperative hypotension was lower in group S (p=0.038). There was more intraoperative hypotension in group S when compared with group G (p=0.038). Postoperative analgesic consumption was higher and onset of postoperative pain was shorter in group G (p=0.001 for both). There was no difference between the groups in terms of patient and surgeon satisfaction. There was no difference in terms of TAC, TOL, and OSI between the groups (p=0.862, p=0.940, and p=0.728, respectively).

Targeting these receptors with a dedicated peptide containing the RGD sequence may provide information about the receptor status in and around the tumour and about the angiogenesis process involved. The aim of this study was to compare the uptake of [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD in two types of tumours that either express or do not express the v3 receptor (NTERA-2 and MDA-MB-231, respectively) and discuss the use of this tracer in experimental models of angiogenesis. PROCEDURES Uptake of intravenously injected [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was studied ex vivo and in vivo. Histological analysis of excised tumours was carried out. Percentages of the injected dose uptake per gram of tissue were compared between the two types of tumours and in the periphery and centre of each tumour. RESULTS [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was rapidly cleared from blood circulation and excreted through the kidneys. Residual activity was retained in the intestine. Tumour uptake of [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was high and homogeneous for v3-positive cell lines (1.940.26%ID/g). Tumour uptake was weak and distributed only in the tumour periphery for v3-negative cell lines (0.100.02%ID/g, tumour periphery; 0.060.01%ID/g, tumour core; P=0.01). These results correlated with vessel distribution. CONCLUSION Uptake of [Tc]-HYNIC-RGD was more intense in v3-positive cell lines than in v3-negative cell lines, but tracer distribution was more representative of angiogenic locations in v3-negative cell lines.

The number of news on newspapers and on media was massive, however, this communication did not take into account properly the level of comprehension of general public of health related issues, which in turns can have a huge impact on public health and related policies. In the light of above this study aims to analyze press coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic/epidemic in Italy. METHODS: An analysis of the press and related online journal coverage during CoVID-19 was conducted. A total of 1512 articles in two months were analyzed. Two main analyses were carried out, a coding quantitative content analysis of newspapers article data and a textual analysis and a sentiment analysis using Taltac 2.10 and Voyant Tools. RESULTS: There was an overall similar idea among different newspapers, this means that both tabloids and broadsheet newspapers show an overall similar content, with a small difference on quality and tone. Results, moreover, displayed two different chronologically lead trends during the COVID-19 crisis. The first two week articles were mainly focused on the illness per se, in terms of prevention, care, cure but also fear, and anxiety; while after a while, around 2 months later newspapers were much more focused on the socio-political-economic impact that COVID-19 had on Italy and potentially could have in the closer future, also for the health organizations. CONCLUSIONS: Newspaper attitude in publishing sensationalistic articles and titles show to take small account of the effect that could potentially have on general public understanding of the issues connected to the virus. This both in the outbreak in terms of what could be the effect of the virus on their health and later on the economy of the country.

We sought to explore the prevalence of, contributors to, and consequences of burnout among GCs. We performed a secondary data analysis of baseline data from Me-GC, a randomized controlled trial of meditation for GCs. We applied a systems model of burnout proposed by the National Academy of Medicine (NAM), which depicts burnout arising from a combination of contributors that include both work system and individual mediating factors, and then leading to consequences. Validated self-report scales were used to measure burnout and most contributors and consequences. Female and white GCs were over-represented in our sample. Over half (57.2%) of the 397 participants had Professional Fulfillment Index scores indicative of burnout. Multiple potential contributors were associated with burnout, consistent with its known multifactorial nature. Among work system factors, higher levels of burnout were associated with insufficient administrative support, lack of autonomy, and not feeling valued by non-GC colleagues. Individual mediating factors associated with greater burnout included higher levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. Participants with lower levels of burnout reported greater mindfulness, resilience, and use of professional self-care behaviors. Among variables categorized as consequences, higher levels of burnout were associated with lower levels of empathy, counseling alliance, and positive unconditional regard, as well as higher reactive distress, and a greater desire to reduce the amount of time spent on clinical care. Given the prevalence and potential consequences of burnout observed here, it is imperative that the field take steps to mitigate burnout risk.","output":"Contributors to and consequences of burnout among clinical genetic counselors in the United States."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kids are people who consume content on the Internet very frequently and actively participate in social networks, so it is necessary to know the risks of their use by children and adolescents, in order to propose a critical analysis of them.

Despite the benefits, there are risks associated with ventilator-induced lung injuries and death, driving investigations for alternative ventilation techniques to improve mechanical ventilation, such as multi-oscillatory and high-frequency ventilation; however, few studies have evaluated fundamental lung mechanical local deformations under variable loading. METHODS: Porcine whole lung samples were analyzed using a novel application of digital image correlation interfaced with an electromechanical ventilation system to associate the local behavior to the global volume and pressure loading in response to various inflation volumes and breathing rates. Strains, anisotropy, tissue compliance, and the evolutionary response of the inflating lung were analyzed. RESULTS: Experiments demonstrated a direct and near one-to-one linear relationship between applied lung volumes and resulting local mean strain, and a nonlinear relationship between lung pressures and strains. As the applied air delivery volume was doubled, the tissue surface mean strains approximately increased from 20 to 40%, and average maximum strains measured 70C110%. The tissue strain anisotropic ratio ranged from 0.81 to 0.86 and decreased with greater inflation volumes. Local tissue compliance during the inflation cycle, associating evolutionary strains in response to inflation pressures, was also quantified. CONCLUSION: Ventilation frequencies were not found to influence the local stretch response. Strain measures significantly increased and the anisotropic ratio decreased between the smallest and greatest tidal volumes. Tissue compliance did not exhibit a unifying trend. The insights provided by the real-time continuous measures, and the kinetics to kinematics pulmonary linkage established by this study offers valuable characterizations for computational models and establishes a framework for future studies to compare healthy and diseased lung mechanics to further consider alternatives for effective ventilation strategies.","output":"Examining lung mechanical strains as influenced by breathing volumes and rates using experimental digital image correlation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data describing the effects of coronavirus disease 2019 on placental pathology, especially in asymptomatic patients.

The placental histopathologic findings of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (n=77) who delivered a singleton gestation at term were compared with a control group of term patients without coronavirus disease 2019 (n=56). Controls were excluded if they had obstetrical or medical complications including fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathy, or thrombophilia. Multivariable logistic regression models were performed for variables that were significant (P<.05) in univariable analyses. A subgroup analysis was also performed comparing asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases with negative controls. RESULTS: In univariable analyses, coronavirus disease 2019 cases were more likely to have evidence of fetal vascular malperfusion, that is, presence of avascular villi and mural fibrin deposition (32.5% [25/77] vs 3.6% [2/56], P<.0001) and villitis of unknown etiology (20.8% [16/77] vs 7.1% [4/56], P=.030). These findings persisted in a subgroup analysis of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 cases compared with coronavirus disease 2019-negative controls. In a multivariable model adjusting for maternal age, race and ethnicity, mode of delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and oligohydramnios, the frequency of fetal vascular malperfusion abnormalities remained significantly higher in the coronavirus disease 2019 group (odds ratio, 12.63; 95% confidence interval, 2.40-66.40). Although the frequency of villitis of unknown etiology was more than double in coronavirus disease 2019 cases compared with controls, this did not reach statistical significance in a similar multivariable model (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-8.97). All neonates of mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that all neonates born to mothers with coronavirus disease 2019 were negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, we found that coronavirus disease 2019 in term patients admitted to labor and delivery is associated with increased rates of placental histopathologic abnormalities, particularly fetal vascular malperfusion and villitis of unknown etiology. These findings seem to occur even among asymptomatic term patients.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019 infection and placental histopathology in women delivering at term"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic that has hit all countries in the world is a sudden humanitarian disaster.

The focus of SCOPE is the application of scientific principles in the development of prevention and educational strategies for reducing substance use disorder (SUD). One area of focus for SCOPE was SUD education of healthcare professionals. The objective of the present was to identify the content and extent to which future healthcare professionals are trained in pain management, SUD, and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). METHODS: In December of 2019, a survey was distributed to 49 healthcare professional schools in Ohio that included the following disciplines: medicine, pharmacy, advanced practice registered nurse (APRN), physician assistant, dentistry, and optometry. The survey included four domains: initial screening of patients, training in SUD, training in care for patients at high risk for SUD, and education in evaluating patients for ACEs. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: Thirty one of the forty-nine schools completed the survey. Most disciplines indicated that some form of basic training in the principles of SUD were taught in their core curriculum. The training on ethical issues surrounding SUD were not as widely covered (range 0-62.5%). Medicine, APRN, physician assistant, and pharmacy schools had a moderate to great extent of pharmacologic therapy curriculum integration. Other pain management strategies were somewhat to moderately integrated. There were variations seen in training on risk of medication misuse based on various contributors to health. At least 67.7% of medicine, APRN, physician assistant, and pharmacy programs included motivational interviewing training. The extent to which schools integrated education regarding ACEs into their curriculum varied from 0 to 66.7%. CONCLUSIONS: The study finding suggests a need for a unified, consistent, and expanded training requirement in the foundations of pain management, SUD, and ACEs in professional healthcare education.","output":"HealthCare educational differences in pain management, adverse childhood experiences and their relationship to substance use disorder education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: Air pollution has worsened as a result of increased traffic congestion in cities. Using air pollution caused by motor vehicle emissions (mainly by carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter) as an example, in this study, we applied an integrated algorithm comprising system dynamics, entropy weight method, and gray system theory to establish a weighted logic function. A vehicle pollutant control model (including the transport, health, and environmental subsystems) was established by VENSIM software. The medium- and long-term key variable analysis showed that the integrated algorithm, fully reflecting the advantages of system dynamics and gray system theory, more accurately described air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. Our research results also revealed that the combined strategy of penalties and air pollution charging fee had a threefold effect: reduced congestion and emissions, improved health impact index, and reduced number of illegal trips. Specifically, the degree of traffic congestion, number of illegal trips, and the degree of air pollution decreased by approximately 82.40%, 69.35%, and 68.91%, respectively, whereas the health impact index increased by about 279.03%. This finding provides guidance for improving policy and optimizing management and control modes.

This study leverages the infrastructure across the University of California (UC) Cancer Consortium, pooling electronic health record (EHR) data to assess the relationship between active cancer diagnoses (n=151,392) and COVID-19 positivity. Methods: In this cohort study, patients with COVID-19 test results and active cancer diagnoses were identified from the UC Health System COVID Research Data Set (CORDS). This data set collects COVID-19 test results from the 5 academic medical centers in the UC Health System and their NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. COVID-19 test results were identified by Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). Active cancer was defined as an EHR-based malignant diagnosis within 9 months of testing, irrespective of active therapy. Total daily positivity rates were aggregated, and overall rates were compared across patients with and without active cancer using the Pearsons Chi-squared test. Results: We identified 1,032,588 COVID-19 tests from March 3, 2020 to April 15, 2021, with 151,392 tests (14.7%) associated with an active cancer diagnosis. Monthly trends in positivity rates throughout the pandemic were similar between patients with and without cancer (Table). Overall positivity was lower in patients with active cancer (2.0% versus 4.4%;p<0.001). This was consistent across individual UC sites. [Formula presented] Conclusions: COVID-19 positivity rates were not increased for individuals with active cancer diagnoses in the UC Cancer Consortium. A lower positivity rate amongst cancer patients may be due to demographic, behavioral, occupational or environmental factors, as well as greater asymptomatic testing of cancer patients at some UC sites. Interactions with local prevalence and patient and cancer characteristics will be presented. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding.

METHODS: In a multicenter case-control analysis of US adults hospitalized March 11 - May 5, 2021, we evaluated vaccine effectiveness to prevent Covid-19 hospitalizations by comparing odds of prior vaccination with an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) between cases hospitalized with Covid-19 and hospital-based controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 1210 participants, median age was 58 years, 22.8% were Black, 13.8% were Hispanic, and 20.6% had immunosuppression. SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7 was most common variant (59.7% of sequenced viruses). Full vaccination (receipt of two vaccine doses 14 days before illness onset) had been received by 45/590 (7.6%) cases and 215/620 (34.7%) controls. Overall vaccine effectiveness was 86.9% (95% CI: 80.4 to 91.2%). Vaccine effectiveness was similar for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and highest in adults aged 18C49 years (97.3%; 95% CI: 78.9 to 99.7%). Among 45 patients with vaccine-breakthrough Covid hospitalizations, 44 (97.8%) were 50 years old and 20 (44.4%) had immunosuppression. Vaccine effectiveness was lower among patients with immunosuppression (59.2%; 95% CI: 11.9 to 81.1%) than without immunosuppression (91.3%; 95% CI: 85.5 to 94.7%).

We report a case of bilateral asymmetric MEWDS that developed following the first vaccination for coronavirus-19 and worsened after a second vaccination. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 30-year-old Japanese woman was examined in an eye clinic for blurred vision in her left eye for 1 week duration. Thirteen days before her examination, she had received her first BNT162b2 mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes. Fundus examination revealed multiple yellowish-white spots in the perifoveal area of both eyes. Visibility of the spots gradually decreased during the following week. She was then vaccinated with a second dose, and 3 days later, her vision worsened in her left eye. She was then referred to our hospital because of worsened vision and the appearance of white spots on other parts of the retina. Ophthalmological examination revealed a best-corrected visual acuity of 30/20 both eyes. DIAGNOSIS: The flare value in the anterior chamber was elevated in both the eyes. Fundus examination showed multiple white spots in the perifoveal area of both eyes, but they were more prominent in the left eye. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed early hyperfluorescent spots located circumferentially around the fovea in both eyes. We concluded that the patient had MEWDS, which was most likely due to mRNA COVID-19 immunization. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with topical betamethasone sodium phosphate/fradiomycin sulfate 0.1% thrice daily for 2 months. OUTCOMES: Two months after treatment, her blurry vision resolved with the disappearance of the fundus lesions.

The objective of this study was to assess the impact COVID-19 on food access in Rhode Island (RI), document challenges encountered, and identify promising practices and policy solutions by conducting individual, 1-hour key stakeholder interviews from September-November 2020. Virtual qualitative interviews (n = 25) were conducted with 33 key stakeholders from 25 community organizations located throughout RI. This includes state/city agencies (n = 9), nonprofit organizations (n = 5), Health Equity Zone representatives (n = 5), food pantries/food bank (n = 4), a home-delivered meal program (n = 1), and a FQHC (n = 1) that primarily serve low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations. A structured interview guide was developed to capture scope of work, successes and challenges, and impact on health disparities including how organizations adjusted during COVID-19 to provide access to food safely. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded in NVivo with a priori codes to guide the analysis. An inductive and deductive approach was used to identify themes. Preliminary findings suggest that organizations struggled to meet food needs due to unemployment, lack of culturally relevant foods, insufficient resources (ie, funding, personal protective equipment, technology), and exacerbation of existing food access challenges connected to transportation and food storage needs. Despite these challenges, reported successes included enhanced collaboration between new and existing partnerships among stakeholders, increased effective communication among community stakeholders and the populations they serve, and increases in new initiatives to support food access needs. Our findings highlight the need to ensure a coordinated response through strategic leadership that has a focus on vulnerable racial/ethnic populations to ensure access to culturally appropriate food during emergency situations.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on the reviews of relevant reports, articles and semi-structured interviews of the construction experts working in the Pakistan construction industry during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The primary data for this study were collected through semi-structured interviews with the construction experts and analysed them using thematic analysis. A total of 15 semi-structured interviews were conducted in this study. Findings Through thematic analysis, this study identified approximately 55 initial raw data themes, 15 first-order themes, 11 second-order themes and 4 general dimensions of the impact of COVID-19 on the construction sector. The authors identified working style and behavioural changes, challenges and risks, stakeholders and new directions for the construction sector in the post-pandemic world as the four main dimensions of the effect of the pandemic on the construction sector. Further, least digitalisation, complex cash flow, abundance of labour-intensive methods, diverse stakeholders, and dependencies on foreign expertise, imported material and machineries were identified as the most important reasons for poor resiliency of the construction sector during COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan.

COVID-19 manifests as severe illness exhibiting systemic inflammatory response syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), thrombotic events, and shock, exacerbated further by co-morbidities and age. Recent clinical evidence suggests that the development of ARDS and subsequent pulmonary failure result from a complex interplay between cell types (endothelial, epithelial and immune) within the lung promoting inflammatory infiltration and a pro-coagulative state. How the complex molecular events mediated by SARS-CoV-2 in infected lung epithelial cells lead to thrombosis and pulmonary failure, is yet to be fully understood.

Thus, the development of vaccines capable of eliciting long-lasting protective immunity to those pathogens is a major public health priority. CD8(+) Tissue-resident memory T (T(RM)) cells are a newly defined population that resides permanently in the nonlymphoid tissues including the lung. These cells are capable of providing local protection immediately after infection, thereby promoting rapid host recovery. Recent studies have offered new insights into the anatomical niches that harbor lung CD8(+) T(RM) cells, and also identified the requirement and limitations of T(RM) maintenance.

Critically, this cue was either presented at a peripheral target location or from the center of the screen, allowing us to isolate spatially specific attentional activity. We find that both behavior and attention-mediated changes in visual-cortical activity are enhanced at the location of a cue prior to the onset of a target, but that behavior and neural activity at an unattended target location is equivalent to that following a central cue that does not direct attention (i.e., baseline).

This resulted in constraints on healthcare resources, and the attention was shifted to reduce cross contamination and prevent spreader events. Maxillofacial trauma care was also affected similarly, and most of the cases were managed by closed reduction whenever possible. This paper is an endeavor to document our experience in treating maxillofacial trauma cases before and after nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in India.Material and MethodsThe retrospective comparative study was conducted in Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Maulana Azad institute of Dental Sciences, Delhi, for a period of 20 months, that is, 10 months before and after nationwide lock down which was effective from 23rd March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. The cases were grouped into Group A (those reporting from 1st June 2019 to 31st March 2020) and Group B (those reporting from 1st April 2020 to 31st January 2021). Primary objective were assessed and compared according to etiology, gender, location of the mandibular fractures, and treatment provided. Quality of life (QoL) associated with the treatment outcome by closed reduction was assessed after 2 months as a secondary objective using General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) in Group B.ResultA total of 798 patients sought treatment for mandibular fractures and included 476 patients in Group A and 322 in Group B. The groups showed similar age and male:female ratio. Cases showed a steep fall during first wave of pandemic, and most of the cases occurred as result of RTA followed by fall and assault. The fractures due to fall and assault showed an obvious rise during the lockdown period. There was 718 (89.97%) patients having exclusive mandibular fractures and 80 (10.03%) patients having involvement of both mandible and maxilla. Single fractures of mandible constituted of 110 (23.11%) and 58 (18.01%) in Group A and B, respectively. 324 patients (68.07%) and 226 patients (70.19%) had multiple fractures involving mandible in respective groups. Parasymphysis of mandible was most commonly involved (24.31%) followed closely by unilateral condyle (23.48%) then Angle and Ramus of mandible (20.71%) with coronoid being the least fractured. During the initial 6 months after lockdown, all the cases were treated successfully using closed reduction. GOHAI QoL assessment conducted in cases having exclusive mandibular fracture (210 Multiple, 48 Single) showed favorable results with significant (P < .05) difference between the single and multiple fractures.ConclusionAfter one and half years and recovering from the second wave of pandemic that hit the country, we have come to understand COVID-19 better and embraced better management protocol. The study reveals that IMF remains as the gold standard for the management of most of the facial fractures in pandemic situation. It was evident from the QoL data that most of the patients were able to carry out their day to day functions adequately.

Economic impacts of ILI (temperature 378C or parental report of fever, plus 1 respiratory symptoms) were collected at 2 and 4 weeks after ILI onset by telephone interview. Parent\\\\collected respiratory specimens were tested for respiratory viruses using real\\\\time PCR (RT\\\\PCR). Costs associated with healthcare visits, medication usage, carer time lost (work or recreation) and home care and/or additional childcare were collected. Influenza\\\\like illness costs were described and further analysed using a Tobit model. Zero\\\\inflated Poisson regression was employed to compare the numbers of healthcare visits for each ILI. RESULTS: Of 381 children enrolled and analysed, 105 developed 124 ILIs. Specimens were available for 117 ILIs: five were positive by RT\\\\PCR for A(H1N1)pdm09, 39 for adenovirus, 39 for rhinovirus, 15 for a coronavirus and 27 for a polyomavirus. The mean cost of all ILIs was AU$626 (95% confidence interval: AU$484C768) per ILI with no significant differences observed between viruses. Carers lost on average 13 hours of work and 3 hours of leisure time per ILI. Independent drivers of ILI costs were having both parents in employed work and longer duration of ILI. In multivariate analyses, four variables were significantly associated with an increased number of healthcare visits per ILI: non\\\\Caucasian child, living in a detached house, both parents in employed work and having an ILI with one or more viruses identified. CONCLUSIONS: For families with a child attending childcare, ILIs cause a substantial economic burden. An ILI in a child with working parents and/or with longer duration appears to cost more in monetary terms. Healthcare visits were increased if the child was non\\\\Caucasian, lived in a detached house, had working parents or had a virus\\\\positive ILI. Our findings on the estimates and determinants of economic impacts from respiratory virus infection highlight the importance and feasibility of an interdisciplinary (epidemiology/health economics) approach to such research.","output":"Estimates and determinants of economic impacts from influenza\\\\like illnesses caused by respiratory viruses in Australian children attending childcare: a cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has left many people isolated within their homes; these people are turning to social media for news and social connection, which leaves them vulnerable to believing and sharing misinformation. Health-related misinformation threatens adherence to public health messaging, and monitoring its spread on social media is critical to understanding the evolution of ideas that have potentially negative public health impacts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use Twitter data to explore methods to characterize and classify four COVID-19 conspiracy theories and to provide context for each of these conspiracy theories through the first 5 months of the pandemic. METHODS: We began with a corpus of COVID-19 tweets (approximately 120 million) spanning late January to early May 2020. We first filtered tweets using regular expressions (n=1.8 million) and used random forest classification models to identify tweets related to four conspiracy theories. Our classified data sets were then used in downstream sentiment analysis and dynamic topic modeling to characterize the linguistic features of COVID-19 conspiracy theories as they evolve over time. RESULTS: Analysis using model-labeled data was beneficial for increasing the proportion of data matching misinformation indicators. Random forest classifier metrics varied across the four conspiracy theories considered (F1 scores between 0.347 and 0.857); this performance increased as the given conspiracy theory was more narrowly defined. We showed that misinformation tweets demonstrate more negative sentiment when compared to nonmisinformation tweets and that theories evolve over time, incorporating details from unrelated conspiracy theories as well as real-world events. CONCLUSIONS: Although we focus here on health-related misinformation, this combination of approaches is not specific to public health and is valuable for characterizing misinformation in general, which is an important first step in creating targeted messaging to counteract its spread. Initial messaging should aim to preempt generalized misinformation before it becomes widespread, while later messaging will need to target evolving conspiracy theories and the new facets of each as they become incorporated.","output":"\\"Thought I'd Share First\\" and Other Conspiracy Theory Tweets from the COVID-19 Infodemic: Exploratory Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Pancreatic cancer has a poor 5-year survival and carries significant morbidity. Pain is a commonly studied symptom in pancreatic cancer; however, few studies examine the frequency of multiple patient-reported symptoms. Our aim is to ascertain patient-reported symptom burden at initial consultation with a palliative care provider and compare patient prognostic awareness to provider estimation of prognosis. METHODS Data were extracted from the standardized Quality Data Collection Tool (QDACT). Adults with pancreatic cancer seen by a palliative care provider were included. Descriptive statistics were used to describe demographic features, symptom prevalence and burden, as well as assess patient prognosis awareness defined by congruence or incongruence with provider estimated prognosis. RESULTS 285 patients were included in our analysis. The average age was 68 years (SD: 12.4), 87.2% were white, 50% male. The mean number of moderate/severe symptoms was 2.6 (SD: 2) out of 9 symptoms. Tiredness (66.7%), appetite (64.5%) and pain (46.2%) had the highest rates of moderate/severe symptom burden. Patients with a prognosis of 1-6 months had the lowest proportion of congruence with provider estimation (56.5%). CONCLUSION Our study suggests targets to improve patient-centered care of pancreatic cancer. Patients commonly have multiple symptoms that are moderate/severe at time of palliative care referral. While pain has been well-reported, tiredness and decreased appetite are more prevalent at initial visit. This emphasizes the importance of assessing multiple symptoms and working closely with palliative care for early referral. Overall, one third of patient prognosis estimates differed from the provider assessment of prognosis. Our data support the importance of early referral to palliative care to manage symptoms and better prepare patients for end-of-life care.","output":"Index Symptoms and Prognosis Awareness of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer: A Multi-Site Palliative Care Collaborative."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 21-year-old man presented with nasal obstruction of the right nasal fossa of 1 year duration.

The lack of an established vaccine for this disease has caused millions of illnesses and hundreds of thousands of deaths globally. Mathematical models have become crucial tools in determining the potential and seriousness of the disease and in helping the types of strategic intervention measures to be taken to prevent and control the intensity of the spread of the disease. In this study, a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 is proposed and analyzed to predict the transmission dynamics of the disease in Ethiopia. Analytically, the basic reproduction number is determined. To observe the dynamics of the system, a detailed stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the proposed model is carried out. Our result shows that the DFE is stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable otherwise. Also, the parameters of the assumed model are estimated using the actual data of COVID-19 from Ethiopia reported for three months between March and June 2020. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number and found that reducing the rate of transmission is the most important factor in achieving disease control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model for the actual COVID-19 data in Ethiopia. In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. Thus, results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with the sensitivity results of the system. The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease. Numerical simulations are also performed to forecast the disease prevalence in the community.","output":"Mathematical Modelling and Analysis of COVID-19 Epidemic and Predicting its Future Situation in Ethiopia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is critical for both initiating appropriate treatment and preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent.

Countries initiate public health measures to slow virus transmission, ranging from stringent quarantines including city lockdown to simpler social distancing recommendations. We use satellite readings of NO2, a pollutant emitted from socioeconomic activities, as a proxy for the level of social-economic restrictions, and discuss the implications under the influences of weather. We found that restricting SA has a leading contribution to lowering the reproductive number of COVID-19 by 18.3%  3.5%, while air temperature, the highest contributor among all weather-related variables only contributes 8.0%  2.6%. The reduction effects by restricting SA becomes more pronounced (23%  3.0%) when we limited the data to China and developed countries where the indoor climate is mostly controlled. We computed the spared infectees by restricting SA until mid-April. Among all polities, China spared 40,964 (95% CI 31,463-51,470) infectees with 37,727 (95% CI, 28,925-47,488) in the Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak.

The challenge in treating rectal cancer is selecting the proper approach for the appropriate patient. In a small number of rectal cancer patients local excision may be the best approach. In an attempt to achieve two goals-cure of disease with a low rate of local failure and maintenance of function and quality of life-multiple approaches can be utilized. The key to obtaining a good outcome for any one patient is balancing the competing factors that impact on these goals. Any effective treatment aimed at controlling rectal cancer in the pelvis must take into account the disease in the bowel wall itself and the disease, or potential disease, in the mesorectum. The major downside of local excision techniques is the potential of leaving untreated disease in the mesorectum. Local management techniques avoid the potential morbidity, mortality, and functional consequences of a major abdominal radical resection and are thus quite effective in achieving the maintenance of function and quality of life goal. The issue for the transanal techniques is how they fare in achieving the first goal-cure of the cancer while keeping local recurrence rates to an absolute minimum. Without removing both the rectum and the mesorectum there is no completely accurate way to determine whether a rectal cancer has moved outside the bowel wall, so any decision on local management of a rectal neoplasm is a calculated risk.

The frequent handwashing and use of sanitizers resulted in notable skin changes among some individuals. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of the new onset of dermatitis during the COVID-19 pandemic in a university population from Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered online questionnaire by sending an invitation link to students and employees of Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University in June 2020. A chi-squared test was used to note differences regarding hand and face dermatitis. RESULTS: Of the total 2356 participants, 34.8% reported skin changes or symptoms over hands, and 15.3% reported skin changes on their face during this pandemic. 88.7% of the participants reported a change in handwashing habits during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 62.2% of participants were not using any hand sanitizers before COVID-19 but began using them during the pandemic. There were significantly higher percentage of skin conditions in females (on hands (ScH): 42.6% and face (ScF):19.2%), individuals working in environments requiring frequent handwashing (ScH: 40.3% vs. ScF: 17.2%), those working in facilities where they have to interact with people during the pandemic (ScH: 41.1% vs. ScF: 18.7%), those encountering COVID-19 patients (ScH: 48.6% vs. ScF: 24.8%), those exposed to chemicals (ScH: 48.6% vs. ScF: 24.8%), and healthcare workers (ScH: 51.3% vs. ScF: 24.3%).

Smell impairment affects physical and mental health, and dietary behavior. Thus, it is critical to understand the rate and time course of smell recovery. Objective: To characterize smell function and recovery up to 11 months post COVID-19 infection. Settings, Participants: This longitudinal survey of individuals suffering COVID-19-related smell loss assessed disease symptoms and gustatory and olfactory function. Participants (n=12,313) who completed an initial respiratory symptoms, chemosensory function, and COVID-19 diagnosis survey (S1) between April and September 2020 and completed a follow-up survey (S2) between September 2020 and February 2021; 27.5% participants responded (n=3,386), with 1,468 being diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffering co-occurring smell and taste loss at the beginning of their illness. Main Outcomes & Measures: Primary outcomes are ratings of smell and taste function on a visual analog scale, and self-report of parosmia (smell distortions) and phantosmia (unexplained smells). Secondary outcomes include a checklist of other COVID-19 symptoms. Results: On follow-up (median time since COVID-19 onset ~200 days), ~60% of women and ~48% of men reported less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability. Taste typically recovered faster than smell, and taste loss rarely persisted if smell recovered. Prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia was ~10% of participants in S1 and increased substantially in S2: ~47% for parosmia and ~25% for phantosmia. Persistent smell impairment was associated with more symptoms overall, suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID. During COVID-19 illness, the ability to smell was slightly lower among those who did not recover their pre-illness ability to smell at S2. Conclusions and Relevance: While smell loss improves for many individuals who lost it due to COVID-19, the prevalence of parosmia and phantosmia increases substantially over time. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with wider COVID-19 symptoms and may persist for many months after COVID-19 onset. Taste loss in the absence of smell loss is rare. Persistent qualitative smell symptoms are emerging as common long-term sequelae; more research into treatment options is strongly warranted given that conservative estimates suggest millions of individuals may experience parosmia following COVID-19.

METHODS This retrospective study evaluated 484 nonfocal renal biopsies performed with 18-gauge side-notch biopsy needles. Number of biopsy passes, serum creatinine, body mass index, needle type, transplant age, kidney size, diabetic status, and operator were evaluated as predictors of the number of biopsy passes. RESULTS Four hundred seventy-four biopsies (338 transplant, 136 native) were included with mean number of passes 2.87 (3.1 native vs 2.78 transplant; P = 0.002). Mean number of glomeruli yielded per pass was 6.9 (7.2 transplant vs 6.1 native; P = 0.0002) with 3 passes adequate for histological diagnosis in 84% of biopsies. Native kidney, increasing serum creatinine level, trainee biopsy operator, and use of a Temno needle were found to be independent predictors of having more than 3 biopsy passes on multivariate analysis. Age, sex, body mass index, diabetic status, and kidney size were not associated with the number of biopsy passes. CONCLUSIONS The success of a nonfocal renal biopsy has many influencing variables, and in the absence of an on-site electron microscopy technologist to immediately evaluate biopsy samples, 3 passes with an 18-gauge needle would be adequate in 84% of kidneys to achieve a histological diagnosis, with 2 passes needed for transplant kidneys to meet the Banff 97 criteria.","output":"Nonfocal renal biopsies: adequacy and factors affecting a successful outcome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study analyses the role of long-distance travel behaviours on the large-scale spatial spreading of directly transmitted infectious diseases, focusing on two different travel types in terms of the travellers travelling to a specific group or not. For this purpose, we have formulated and analysed a metapopulation model in which the individuals in each subpopulation are organised into a scale-free contact network. The long-distance travellers between the subpopulations will temporarily change the network structure of the destination subpopulation through the merging effects (MEs), which indicates that the travellers will be regarded as either connected components or isolated nodes in the contact network. The results show that the presence of the MEs has constantly accelerated the transmission of the diseases and aggravated the outbreaks compared to the scenario in which the diversity of the long-distance travel types is arbitrarily discarded. Sensitivity analyses show that these results are relatively constant regarding a wide range variation of several model parameters.

Methods Female dancers from a ballet company completed a published online dance-specific health questionnaire. Over the study period, dancers recorded wellbeing and training metrics, with menstrual cycle tracking and blood tests. For menstrual cycle hormones AI-based techniques modelled hormone variation over a cycle, based on capillary blood samples taken at two time points. At regular, virtual, clinical interviews with each dancer, findings were discussed, and personalised advice given. Results 14 female dancers (mean age 25.5 years, SD 3.7) participated in the study. 10 dancers recorded positive scores on the dance health questionnaire, suggesting a low risk of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). 2 dancers were taking hormonal contraception. Apart from 1 dancer, those not on hormonal contraception reported current eumenorrhoeic status. The initiative of monitoring menstrual cycles and application of AI to model menstrual cycle hormones found that subclinical hormone disruption was occurring in 6 of the 10 dancers reporting regular cycles. 4 of the 6 dancers who received personalised advice, showed improved menstrual hormone function, including one dancer who had planned pregnancy. Conclusions Multimodal monitoring facilitated delivery of prompt personalised clinical medical feedback specific for dance. This strategy enabled the early identification and swift management of emergent clinical issues.

In the late 1980s and in the 1990s, well-designed randomized trials established a definite advantage for carotid endarterectomy in reducing the risk of ipsilateral stroke when compared with medical therapy alone. However, medical treatment of cardiovascular disease has improved significantly over the past 2 decades, and this has, in turn, resulted in a decline of the stroke risk in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis treated medically. This improvement in medical therapy casts doubts on the effectiveness of large-scale invasive treatment in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Several studies have been conducted to identify possible subgroups of patients with asymptomatic stenosis who are at higher risk of stroke in order to maximize the potential benefits of invasive treatment. Ongoing large-scale trials comparing best current medical therapy to available invasive treatments, such as carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting, are likely to shed some light on this debated topic in the near future.

RECENT FINDINGS Gastric acid facilitates the digestion of protein as well as the absorption of iron, calcium, vitamin B12, and certain medications. High gastric acidity, in combination with pepsin and lipase, kills ingested microorganisms and may play a role in preventing bacterial overgrowth, enteric infection, and possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Stimulants of acid secretion include histamine, gastrin, acetylcholine, and ghrelin. Inhibitors include somatostatin, gastric inhibitory polypeptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and adrenomedullin. Helicobacter pylori stimulates or inhibits depending upon the time course of infection and the area of the stomach predominantly infected. Proteins implicated in H-K-ATPase membrane trafficking include myosin IIB, F-actin, ezrin, and Rab GTPases. SUMMARY Our understanding of the regulation of gastric acid secretion continues to advance.

There has been much interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds (PLA) complexed with human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) as a new therapeutic strategy to improve bone tissue regeneration. These devices can mimic a more favorable endogenous microenvironment for cells in vivo by providing 3D substrates which are able to support cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The present study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo capability of bone defect regeneration of 3D PLA, hGMSCs, extracellular vesicles (EVs), or polyethyleneimine (PEI)-engineered EVs (PEI-EVs) in the following experimental groups: 3D-PLA, 3D-PLA + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + EVs, 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs. METHODS The structural parameters of the scaffold were evaluated using both scanning electron microscopy and nondestructive microcomputed tomography. Nanotopographic surface features were investigated by means of atomic force microscopy. Scaffolds showed a statistically significant mass loss along the 112-day evaluation. RESULTS Our in vitro results revealed that both 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs showed no cytotoxicity. However, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs exhibited greater osteogenic inductivity as revealed by morphological evaluation and transcriptomic analysis performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, in vivo results showed that 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs scaffolds implanted in rats subjected to cortical calvaria bone tissue damage were able to improve bone healing by showing better osteogenic properties. These results were supported also by computed tomography evaluation that revealed the repair of bone calvaria damage.

In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the host immune response is thought to play a key role in the pathophysiological effects of lung damage. Therefore, corticosteroid therapy could modulate inflammation-mediated pulmonary injury and thereby reduce progression to severe respiratory failure and death. The aim of this study was to analyse the safety and clinical efficacy of corticosteroid therapy in older adults with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHOD: We reviewed the clinical records of confirmed COVID-19 patients aged 75 years or older admitted to our hospital over a three months period (March 1, to May 31, 2020). A total of 143 patients were included in the study cohort. From 2 April, 2020, in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidance on COVID-19, our hospital protocol added corticosteroid for COVID-19 treatment. We compared in-hospital mortality among patients with critical COVID-19 who received corticosteroids therapy and those who did not. RESULTS: 88 patients (61.5%) were treated with corticosteroids, and 55 patients (38.4%) were not. Both groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The median age was 85 years (IQR, 82-89), and 61.5% (88/143) were male. In-hospital mortality was lower in the corticosteroid group (68.2%) compared with patients in the non-corticosteroid group (81.8%). Treatment with corticosteroids was an independent survival factor (HR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93; P=0.006).

Moreover, little is known about the effects that on-campus students may have on local higher-risk communities. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the range of potential community and campus COVID-19 exposures, infections, and mortality under various university reopening plans and uncertainties. METHODS: We developed campus-only, community-only, and campus  community epidemic differential equations and agent-based models, with inputs estimated via published and grey literature, expert opinion, and parameter search algorithms. Campus opening plans (spanning fully open, hybrid, and fully virtual approaches) were identified from websites and publications. Additional student and community exposures, infections, and mortality over 16-week semesters were estimated under each scenario, with 10% trimmed medians, standard deviations, and probability intervals computed to omit extreme outliers. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to inform potential effective interventions. RESULTS: Predicted 16-week campus and additional community exposures, infections, and mortality for the base case with no precautions (or negligible compliance) varied significantly from their medians (4- to 10-fold). Over 5% of on-campus students were infected after a mean of 76 (SD 17) days, with the greatest increase (first inflection point) occurring on average on day 84 (SD 10.2 days) of the semester and with total additional community exposures, infections, and mortality ranging from 1-187, 13-820, and 1-21 per 10,000 residents, respectively. Reopening precautions reduced infections by 24%-26% and mortality by 36%-50% in both populations. Beyond campus and community reproductive numbers, sensitivity analysis indicated no dominant factors that interventions could primarily target to reduce the magnitude and variability in outcomes, suggesting the importance of comprehensive public health measures and surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Community and campus COVID-19 exposures, infections, and mortality resulting from reopening campuses are highly unpredictable regardless of precautions.

This contrasts with the preceding epidemics of the closely related SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both of which evolved adaptively. It is possible that the SARS-CoV-2 exhibits a unique or adaptive feature which deviates from other coronaviruses. Alternatively, the virus may have been cryptically circulating in humans for a sufficient time to have acquired adaptive changes for efficient transmission before the onset of the current pandemic. In order to test the above scenarios, we analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 sequences from minks (Neovision vision) and parenteral human strains. In the early phase of the mink epidemic (April to May 2020), nonsynonymous to synonymous mutation ratios per site within the spike protein was 2.93, indicating a selection process favoring adaptive amino acid changes. In addition, mutations within this protein concentrated within its receptor binding domain and receptor binding motif. Positive selection also left a trace on linked neutral variation. An excess of high frequency derived variants produced by genetic hitchhiking was found during middle (June to July 2020) and early late (August to September 2020) phases of the mink epidemic, but quickly diminished in October and November 2020. Strong positive selection found in SARS-CoV-2 from minks implies that the virus may be not unique in super-adapting to a wide range of new hosts. The mink study suggests that SARS-CoV-2 already went through adaptive evolution in humans, and likely been circulating in humans at least six months before the first case found in Wuhan, China.

The fields under study were as follows: (1) Planning of a multidisciplinary project; (2) Organization of the infrastructure; (3) Screening, management and treatment of SARS-COV-2; (4) Diagnostic tests for SARS-COV-2; (5) Surgical priorization and (6) Context of patients during health-care assistance. We applied a risk bias measurement to obtain a consensus among humanitarian health-care providers with experience in this field. RESULTS: A total of 94.36% of agreement were reached for the approval of the recommendations. Emergency surgery must be a priority, and elective surgery adapted. For emergency surgery, we established a priority level 1a (< 24 h) and 1b (< 72 h). For an elective procedure, according our American College of Surgeon adaptation score, process with more than 60 points should be reconsidered.

Early discharge would allow for more single-bedded rooms, limiting exposure to other patients and their support persons. During the pandemic, patients were discharged to home on postpartum day 1 or 2 after vaginal or cesarean delivery, respectively, instead of day 2 or 3, unless longer hospitalization was needed for medical indications. We aim to determine if the readmission rate was increased in the setting of earlier discharge during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study comparing the readmission rate in SARS-CoV-2 negative women who presented to Mount Sinai Hospital for delivery admission from March to May 2019 versus March to May 2020. The primary outcome was readmission rate within 6 weeks of discharge day. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and outcomes were compared between groups using t-tests or Wilcoxon-Rank Sum test for continuous measures and chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical measures, as appropriate. Primary and secondary outcomes were assessed using linear and logistic univariable and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Patients in the 2020 cohort (n = 1,078) were significantly less likely to have public/state insurance (p = 0.02), more likely to have pregestational diabetes (p = 0.02), gestational diabetes (p = 0.04), gestational hypertension (p < 0.01), and an operative vaginal or cesarean delivery (vs. spontaneous vaginal delivery, p = 0.01) compared with 2019 cohort patients (n = 1,910). Patients in the 2020 cohort were significantly more likely to have an earlier postpartum day of discharge and a shorter median length of stay compared with 2019 cohort patients (both p < 0.01). Despite differences in length of stay, the rate of readmission was similar between the two groups (p = 0.45). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no difference in readmission rate despite shorter hospital stays. KEY POINTS:  Maternal length of stay during COVID-19 was shorter..  Earlier maternal discharge occurred during COVID-19..  Shorter maternal postpartum stay did not increase readmission rate..","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Postpartum Readmission Rates at a Single Tertiary Care Center in New York City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background & objectives: A cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among Italian tourists visiting India.

This lectin family shows unique carbohydrate binding properties with exclusive high specificity for HM glycans with core trisaccharide comprising Man(1-3)Man(1-6)Man at the D2 arm. At low nanomolar levels, these lectins exhibit potent antiviral activity against HIV and influenza viruses through the recognition of HM glycans on virus spike glycoproteins. In addition, some of these lectins, such as bacterial PFL, show cytotoxicity for various cancer cells at low micromolar levels. Cell surface molecules to which PFL bound were identified as integrin alpha 2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by peptide mass finger printing with MALDI-TOF MS. Upon PFL binding, these molecules were rapidly internalized to cytoplasm. EGFR was time dependently degraded in the presence of PFL, and this process was largely responsible for autophagy. Furthermore, PFL sensitizes cancer cells to the EGFR kinase inhibitor, gefitinib. In vivo experiments showed that intratumoral injection of PFL significantly inhibited the growth of tumors in nude mice. PFL-mediated down regulation of integrin/EGFR ultimately contributed to the inhibition of tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the novel anti-cancer mechanism of PFL suggests that this lectin is potentially useful as an anti-cancer drug or as an adjuvant for other drugs.

In this context and to serve as many guests as possible the quality of accommodation services was sacrificed on the altar of the ephemeral. Huge hotel units were built and areas of natural beauty were destroyed. Also, the primary sector was abandoned and rural areas were turned into tourist destinations. The need to move from mass tourism to quality tourism has been highlighted for many years and for many different reasons. The failure of this model and the shift to quality or alternative tourism has already begun.

It augments the Hypothetical Extraction Method by replacing traditional Input-Output analysis with a Computable General Equilibrium analysis. The estimation results demonstrate that in both exports and imports, a trade embargo between Australia and China C despite being compensated for by alternative supply chainswill cause gross domestic production losses and emissions increases for both countries and the world overall. Moreover, even though all other economies gain from the markets left by China, many of them incur overall gross domestic production losses and emission increases. The finding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and India may also suffer from an Australia-China trade embargo, despite a gain in trade volume, suggests that no country should add fuel to the fire.

METHODS: We assessed 180-day mortality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using EuroQoL (EQ)-5D-5L index values and EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) in the international, stratified, blinded COVID STEROID 2 trial, which randomised 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 receiving at least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation in 26 hospitals in Europe and India. In the HRQoL analyses, higher values indicated better outcomes, and deceased patients were given a score of zero. RESULTS: We obtained vital status at 180 days for 963 of 982 patients (98.1%) in the intention-to-treat population, EQ-5D-5L index value data for 922 (93.9%) and EQ VAS data for 924 (94.1%).

Bayesian methods exhibit useful properties for approaching inverse tasks, such as tomographic reconstruction or image denoising. A suitable prior distribution introduces regularization, which is needed to solve the ill-posed problem and reduces overfitting the data. In practice, however, this often results in a suboptimal posterior temperature, and the full potential of the Bayesian approach is not being exploited. In POTOBIM, we optimize both the parameters of the prior distribution and the posterior temperature with respect to reconstruction accuracy using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian process regression. Our method is extensively evaluated on four different inverse tasks on a variety of modalities with images from public data sets and we demonstrate that an optimized posterior temperature outperforms both non-Bayesian and Bayesian approaches without temperature optimization. The use of an optimized prior distribution and posterior temperature leads to improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation and we show that it is sufficient to find these hyperparameters per task domain.

The data were analysed using a thematic content analysis and a constant comparison method. The results show, among other aspects, that future teachers understand that the teaching of PE has to be carried out face-to-face in order not to lose its meaning, that there are implicit shortcomings in the virtual teaching model, and that there is a greater probability of suffering from teacher stress and disenchantment with the profession when following an online teaching methodology.

Although no exception, Tokyo, Japan was affected at first by only a small epidemic. Medical collapse nevertheless nearly happened because no predictive method existed for counting patients. A standard SIR epidemiological model predicts susceptible, infectious, and removed (recovered /deaths) cases and has been widely used but its applicability is limited often to an early phase of epidemic in the case of a large collective population. Full numerical simulation of entire period from beginning till end-point would be helpful in understanding COVID-19 trends with in-patient and infectious at large separately and also in preparing beds and develop quarantine strategies. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to develop an isolation considered epidemiological model to simulate a whole trend of the first epidemic in Tokyo and allow to count in-patient and those of infectious at large separately. It was also intended to induce important corollaries of governing equation i.e. effective reproductive number and the final size equation. METHODS: Time-series SARS-COV-2 data from February 28 to May 23, 2020 in Tokyo and antibody test conducted by Japan Government were adopted for this study. A novel epidemiological model based on discrete delay differential equation (ATLM) was introduced. The model can predict trends of in-patient and infectious cases in the field. Various data such as daily new confirmed cases, cumulative infections, in-patient, and PCR test positivity ratios were used to examine the model. This approach also derived an alternative formulation equivalent to the standard SIR model. RESULTS: In a typical parameter setting the present ATLM gave 20% less infectious cases in field than that of standard SIR model prediction owing to isolation. The basic reproductive number was inferred as 2.30 under the condition that time lag T from infected till detected and isolated is 14 days. Based on this, adequate vaccine ratio to avoid outbreak was evaluated 57% of population. The date of release of a statement of emergency was 23rd May was assessed. Taking into consideration of infectious cases in field, 30th May should have been most effective. Furthermore, simulation results with shorter time lag of T=7 and larger transmission rate &#945;=1.43&#945;0 suggest that infectious at large should reduce to by half and in-patient be much the same of those of the 1st wave of SARS-COV-2 epidemic while public health intervention is applied to enhance social contact by 43% . CONCLUSIONS: A novel mathematical model was proposed and examined using SARS-COV-2 data for Tokyo. Simulation agreed with data from beginning to endemic.

The most prevalent form is TAI owing to exogenous glucocorticoid use. Symptoms of AI are non-specific, often overlooked or misdiagnosed, and are related to the lack of cortisol, adrenal androgen precursors and aldosterone (especially in PAI). Diagnosis is based on measurement of the adrenal corticosteroid hormones, their regulatory peptide hormones and stimulation tests. The goal of therapy is to establish a hormone replacement regimen that closely mimics the physiological diurnal cortisol secretion pattern, tailored to the patient's daily needs.

The FDA Emergency Use Authorization restricts use of CCP to high-titer units only. The purpose of this study was to determine if donor ABO blood group was associated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, and subsequent qualification as high-titer CCP. METHODS: All CCP donations collected from April 21, 2020 to September 1, 2020 were included. The Abbott ARCHITECT semi-quantitative chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to assess IgG antibodies to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. Units with a S/C value &#8805;4.5 were considered high titer. RESULTS: A total of 232 CCP donations were evaluated. There were no significant differences in the distribution of sex, age, and interval from symptom resolution to donation by ABO blood group. The mean SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody S/C value was significantly lower in blood group O donations (3.6), compared to blood group A (5.0) donations (p < .001). There was no difference in antibody response between the other blood group pairings. Blood group O donations resulted in a lower percentage of high-titer units (35%), compared to blood group A (60%), B (58%), and AB (65%) donations. CONCLUSION: Blood group O donations were found to have significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG nucleocapsid antibodies compared to blood group A donations and were less likely to produce CCP units that qualified as high titer. These findings may aid donor recruitment to promote availability of high-titer CCP to meet patient needs.","output":"Blood group O convalescent plasma donations have significantly lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies compared to blood group A donations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common disease, which can cause low back pain, sciatica, and even disability. The treatment of LDH is a global challenge. Conservative therapy with non-drugs is considered to be the first choice for patients with LDH. In recent years, an increasing number of systematic reviews and meta analyses on Daoyin and massage interventions in lumbar disc herniation have been implemented. However, the evidence quality and methodological quality of these systematic reviews/meta analyses are unknown and need to be systematically evaluated. This overview aims to systematically summarize and critically appraise the current evidence on Daoyin and massage for LDH. METHODS: Eight electronic data will be retrieved, including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang database (WF), China Biomedical database (CBM), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science (WOS), and EMBASE from their inception to March 1, 2022.

METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey of 30,375 adults in the UK from 21st March to 4th April 2020 (sample weighted). Logistic regression models were used to examine sociodemographic, drinking and COVID-19 factors associated with i) drinking less and ii) drinking more (versus same as usual). RESULTS: Of 22,113 drinkers, 48.1 % reported drinking about the same, 25.7 % reported drinking less, and 26.2 % reported drinking more than usual over the past week. Drinking less was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.88, p < .001), male (OR = 0.76, p < .001), BAME (OR = 0.76, p = .028), low income (OR = 0.74, p < .001), having COVID-19 (OR = 2.04, p < .001), adhering to COVID-19 protective behaviours (OR = 1.58, p = .020), stress about becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.26, p = .004) and not being a key worker (OR = 0.87, p = .030). Drinking more was independently associated with being younger (OR = 0.73, p < .001), female (OR = 1.36, p < .001), post-16 qualifications (OR = 1.21, p = .012), high income (OR = 1.43, p < .001), stress about catching (OR = 1.22, p = .020) or becoming ill from COVID-19 (OR = 1.28, p < .001), stress about finances (OR = 1.43, p < .001), and having an anxiety disorder (OR = 1.24, p = .011). CONCLUSIONS: In a large, population sample of adults in the UK, around a quarter of drinkers reported drinking more alcohol and a quarter drinking less than usual during the COVID-19 related lockdown.

Although various results have been reported on the subject, it is still unknown whether patients with rheumatic disease, many of whom are on immune-suppression, are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. Objectives: We aim to share our clinical SARS-CoV-2 experience in patient with the childhood rheumatic disease during pandemic. Methods: We evaluated 4470 patients at our pediatric-rheumatology clinic during the pandemic, from 11-March to 15-October-2020. Demographic and clinical features, treatments, laboratory results, imaging findings, and clinical outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and/or multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were review from the medical records. The data of all these patients were compared between groups and presented. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Among 4470 patients, 87 COVID-19 suspected patients were included in the study. Fifty six (64.4%) patients were hospitalized and 31 were followed without hospitalization. The most common rheumatic diseases among them were juvenile idiopathic arthritis and familial Mediterranean fever (35.6% and 34.5%). The primary disease status of these patients were;78 (89.6%) were in remission, while 9 (10.3%) had active disease at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Twenty six of these patients were treated with biologic DMARDs. SARS-CoV-2 infection (RT-PCR and/or antibody test) was found positive in 84 patients (96.5%). Also, fifty one (58.6%) patients had an epidemiologic contact to a person with COVID-19. Fifty six of 87 (64.3%) had a fever and 20 (23%) had a fever for five or more days. Gastrointestinal system involvement was in 11 (12.6%), the respiratory system was in 40 (46%) and fatigue was in 57 (65.5%) patients. Cutaneous involvement was seen in 5 patients including maculopapular rash in two, vasculitic rash in two, and chilblain in one patient. 63.2% of patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP), 40.2% had lymphocytopenia (<1500/mm3) and 26.4 % had elevated D-dimer level. SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed in 84 patients (96.5%). The diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR in 74 patients and by antibody test in 10. 18 patients met the clinical criteria and diagnosed with MIS-C. Nine of them had also hypotension and seven patients admitted the intensive care unit because of shock and severe end-organ illness. COVID-19 outbreak also caused exacerbation of systemic disease in 56 children due to a discontinue of medication, postponed drug switch, or viral infection triggered. Conclusion: In conclusion, children with rheumatic disease do not appear to present a higher risk of severe COVID-19. Whether these patients receive biological treatment does not affect the severity of the disease, but it is still not true to say that these drugs are protective. The immunosuppressive treatments can be adjusted in case of infection, otherwise it is not recommended interrupt the treatments.

This pilot study aimed to quantify total personal exposure to VOCs and to assess biomarkers of inflammation and pulmonary oxidative stress in 15 predominantly Hispanic women working as domestic cleaners in San Antonio, Texas, between November 2019 and July 2020. In partnership with a community organization, Domsticas Unidas, recruited women were invited to attend a training session where they were provided 3M 3500 passive organic vapor monitors (badges) and began a 72-hour sampling period at which time they were instructed to wear one badge during the entire period (\\"AT\\", for A ll the Time), a second badge only while they were inside their home (\\"INS\\", for INSide), and a third badge only when they were outside their home (\\"OUT\\", for OUTside). At the end of the sampling period, women returned the badges and provided blood and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples. From the badges, 30 individual VOCs were measured and summed to inform total VOC (TVOC) concentrations, as well as concentrations of the following VOC groups: aromatic hydrocarbons, alkanes, halogenated hydrocarbons, and terpenes. From the blood and EBC samples, concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and EBC 8-isoprostane (8-ISP) and pH were quantified. Data analyses included descriptive statistics. The 72-hour average of personal exposure to TVOC was 34.4 ppb and ranged from 9.2-219.5 ppb. The most prevalent class of VOC exposures for most women (66.7%) was terpenes, specifically d-limonene. Overall, most women also experienced higher TVOC concentrations while outside their home (86.7%) as compared to inside their home.

Execution of many such analyses can be accelerated by applying the cloud computing paradigm, which provides scalable resources for storing data of different types and parallelizing data analysis computations. Moreover, these resources can be reused for different multi-omics analysis scenarios. Traditionally, developers are required to manage a cloud platforms underlying infrastructure, configuration, maintenance and capacity planning. The serverless computing paradigm simplifies these operations by automatically allocating and maintaining both servers and virtual machines, as required for analysis tasks. This paradigm offers highly parallel execution and high scalability without manual management of the underlying infrastructure, freeing developers to focus on operational logic. This paper reviews serverless solutions in bioinformatics and evaluates their usage in omics data analysis and integration. We start by reviewing the application of the cloud computing model to a multi-omics data analysis and exposing some shortcomings of the early approaches.

Here, we evaluated the effects of a heterologous BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine booster on the humoral immunity of participants that had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine used globally. We found that heterologous CoronaVac prime followed by BNT162b2 booster regimen induces elevated virus-specific antibody levels and potent neutralization activity against the ancestral virus and Delta variant, resembling the titers obtained after two doses of mRNA vaccines. While neutralization of Omicron was undetectable in participants that had received a two-dose regimen of CoronaVac vaccine, BNT162b2 booster resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in neutralization activity against Omicron, compared to two-dose mRNA vaccine. Despite this increase, neutralizing antibody titers were reduced by 6.3-fold and 2.7-fold for Omicron compared to ancestral and Delta variant, respectively. Surprisingly, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection did not affect the neutralizing titers for Omicron in participants that received the heterologous regimen.

As vaccine hesitancy occurs along multiple dimensions, we used a social-ecological framework to guide the examination of COVID-19 vaccine intentions. METHODS: Using an online survey in the US conducted in July 2020, we examined intentions to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine, once available. 592 respondents provided data, including measures of demographics, vaccine history, social norms, perceived risk, and trust in sources of COVID-19 information. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial models were used to compare respondents who intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to respondents who did not intend or were ambivalent about COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: Only 59.1% of the sample reported that they intended to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine.

METHODS: A total of 113 baseline and follow-up CT scans from 24 January 2020 to 18 February 2020 were longitudinally collected from 29 confirmed COVID-19 patients in a single center. The changes in the clinical and laboratory characteristics, imaging features, lesion-to-muscle ratio (LMR), and pulmonary inflammation index (PII) at baseline, 1-6 days, 7-13 days, and &#8805; 14 days were compared. RESULTS: Of the 29 COVID-19 patients enrolled, the baseline chest CT scan was obtained 3  2 (0-9) days after the onset of symptoms, and each patient had an average of 4  1 (3-5) CT scans with a mean interval of 5  2 (1-14) days. The percentage of patients with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia obviously decreased at 7-13 days with regular treatment (p < 0.05). The lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and oxygenation index worsened within 1-6 days but improved sharply at 7-13 days. Compared with those at the other three time points, the LMR, PII, and number of involved lobes at 1-6 days were the highest, and gradually improved after 7-13 days. CONCLUSIONS: Lung lesion development on chest CT reflects the clinical time course of COVID-19 progression over 1-6 days, followed by clinical improvement and the resorption of lesions. CT imaging may be indicated when patients fail to improve within a week of treatment, but repeated chest CT may be unnecessary when the patients show improvements clinically. KEY POINTS: a? Chest CT reflects the development of coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia (COVID-19). a? COVID-19 usually shows progressive lesions over up to 9 days with subsequent resorption. a?

Medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT), X-ray, etc., plays a significant role in diagnosing the patients by presenting the visual representation of the functioning of the organs. However, for any radiologist analyzing such scans is a tedious and time-consuming task. The emerging deep learning technologies have displayed its strength in analyzing such scans to aid in the faster diagnosis of the diseases and viruses such as COVID-19. In the present article, an automated deep learning based model, COVID-19 hierarchical segmentation network (CHS-Net) is proposed that functions as a semantic hierarchical segmenter to identify the COVID-19 infected regions from lungs contour via CT medical imaging using two cascaded residual attention inception U-Net (RAIU-Net) models. RAIU-Net comprises of a residual inception U-Net model with spectral spatial and depth attention network (SSD) that is developed with the contraction and expansion phases of depthwise separable convolutions and hybrid pooling (max and spectral pooling) to efficiently encode and decode the semantic and varying resolution information. The CHS-Net is trained with the segmentation loss function that is the defined as the average of binary cross entropy loss and dice loss to penalize false negative and false positive predictions. The approach is compared with the recently proposed approaches and evaluated using the standard metrics like accuracy, precision, specificity, recall, dice coefficient and Jaccard similarity along with the visualized interpretation of the model prediction with GradCam++ and uncertainty maps. With extensive trials, it is observed that the proposed approach outperformed the recently proposed approaches and effectively segments the COVID-19 infected regions in the lungs.","output":"CHS-Net: A Deep Learning Approach for Hierarchical Segmentation of COVID-19 via CT Images"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inborn errors of immunity (IEI), also referred to as primary immunodeficiencies (PID), are disorders that, for the most part, result from mutations in genes involved in immune host defense and immune regulation.

In this study, our aim was to investigate the ECG changes as prognostic indicators of in-hospital mortality. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, the findings of the first and the second ECGs of COVID-19 patients were extracted and changes in the ECGs were examined. Any abnormal finding in the second ECG that wasnt present in the initial ECG at the time of admission was defined as an ECG change. ECGs were interpreted by a cardiologist and the prognostic value of abnormal ECG findings for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients was evaluated using multivariate analysis and the report of the relative risk (RR). RESULTS: Data of the ECGs recorded at the time of admission were extracted from the files of 893 patients; likewise, the second ECGs could be extracted from the records of 328 patients who had an initial ECG. The presence of sinus tachycardia (RR = 2.342; p <0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.688; p = 0.001), ventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.854; p = 0.011), interventricular conduction delays (RR = 1.608; p = 0.009), and abnormal R wave progression (RR = 1.766; p = 0.001) at the time of admission were independent prognostic factors for in-hospital mortality. In the second ECG, sinus tachycardia (RR = 2.222; p <0.001), supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.632; p <0.001), abnormal R wave progression (RR = 2.151; p = 0.009), and abnormal T wave (RR = 1.590; p = 0.001) were also independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, by comparing the first and the second ECGs, it was found that the incidence of supraventricular arrhythmia (RR = 1.973; p = 0.005) and ST segment elevation/depression (RR = 2.296; p <0.001) during hospitalization (ECG novel changes) are two independent prognostic factors of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients.

We devised a simplified but effective laparoscopic procedure that provides a better visual field to perform safe lymph node dissection more quickly. First, a mini-laparotomy is done and a clear visual field is created by pulling a mini-retractor to the right or left. The laparoscopic procedure is made easier and safer by taping the stomach body, and by using the fringe of an abdominal wall sealing device (Lapdisk) placed behind the stomach, and a scope holder for the snake-retractor. The lymph nodes along the common hepatic vessels, left gastric vessels, and celiac artery (extraperigastric lymph nodes) are then dissected laparoscopically. The suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes are dissected through the mini-laparotomy incision and gastroduodenostomy is done using an anastomotic device. We performed laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) in 70 patients with gastric carcinomas located in the distal stomach (mean body mass index: 24.3). The mean operating time was 170 min and blood loss was minimal. All patients recovered well with minimal pain and good postoperative quality of life.

IL-35 mediates immunological functions and plays a protective role in several diseases such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the role of IL-35 in gingivitis and periodontitis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and collecting the available evidence regarding the role of IL-35 in pathogenesis of periodontal disease. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases including MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted in November 2020 to identify studies addressing the Interleukin-35 pathobiology in periodontal disease. The identified studies were subjected to pre-identified inclusion criteria. The retrived papers were assessed by the authours independently and consensus was reached in cases where disagreement occurred. Articles written in languages other than English, case reports, letters to editors, conference abstracts, theses, and dissertations were excluded from the review. RESULTS: A total of 176 possibly relevant articles were identified through the search strategy. Finally, 15 papers which met the criteria of eligibility were included in this review by consensus. The included articles were classified based on their design and level of evidence.Three subclinical study, ten cross sectional investigation and two randomized clinical trials constituted the final set of studies in this review. At preclinical level, Il-35 showed inhibitory characteristics regarding alveolar bone resorption of animal periodontitis models. The results of observatory human studies confirmed the presence of high levels of IL-35 in saliva, GCF, serum, and gingival biopsies of patients suffering from inflammatory periodontal disease. Moreover, two included clinical trials showed that non-surgical periodontal therapy could downregulate IL-35 production in chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: Interleukin-35 has an undeniable role in pathobiology of inflammatory periodontal disease. Further well-controlled studies are needed to better elucidate the functional pattern of IL-35 in pathogeneisis of gingival and periodontal disease.

However, the degree of impact on patient management and prescribing strategy in the fields of rheumatology, dermatology and gastroenterology is unclear. Objectives: Assess the impact of COVID-19 on patient management and prescribing strategy across the EU and US, as described by rheumatologists, dermatologists, and gastroenterologists. Methods: Data were drawn from physician surveys in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK and US between July and December 2020. Physicians completed an online or telephone survey assessing how COVID-19 has impacted type and frequency of consultations;choice and prescription of medication. Results: 847 physicians took part;355 rheumatologists, 200 dermatologists (Germany, Spain, UK, and US only), and 282 gastroenterologists. As a result of COVID-19, most physicians stated they have moved at least some patients to video or telephone consultations (70% rheumatologists;55% dermatologists;60% gastroenterologists) and reduced overall frequency of consultations with patients (59% rheumatologists;64% dermatologists;51% gastroenterologists) (Table 1). 35% of rheumatologists, 22% of dermatologists, and 14% of gastroenterologists described COVID-19 as changing the way they choose and prescribe medication, with differences observed between countries (Figure 1). Of those who stated they have made medication changes, rheumatologists stated changing medication to self-administration (62%) and not starting new patients on an advanced therapy (biologic DMARD or targeted synthetic DMARD) (58%) as most frequent. Dermatologists stated changes include changing treatment to more COVID-appropriate treatment (71%) and prescribing repeat prescriptions more regularly without consultation (56%). Gastroenterologists stated changes include changing medication to self-administration (55%) and prescribing a longer course of medication (48%). Comparing across countries, for all specialties, the greatest changes were observed in the UK followed by Spain, with least changes in Germany and Italy. Conclusion: There have been changes in the process of how healthcare is delivered, although treatment prescription was impacted to a lesser extent than consultation type and frequency. This varies across geographies, which may be due to differences in reported prevalence of COVID-19. Differences are also observed across specialities, which may be due to guidance received from specialty bodies.

Direct detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acids in respiratory tract specimens informs patient, healthcare institution and public health level decision-making. The numbers of available SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection tests are rapidly increasing, as is the COVID-19 diagnostic literature. Thus, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recognized a significant need for frequently updated systematic reviews of the literature to inform evidence-based best practice guidance. OBJECTIVE: The IDSAs goal was to develop an evidence-based diagnostic guideline to assists clinicians, clinical laboratorians, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests. In addition, we provide a conceptual framework for understanding molecular diagnostic test performance, discuss the nuance of test result interpretation in a variety of practice settings, and highlight important unmet research needs in the COVID-19 diagnostic testing space. METHODS: IDSA convened a multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists, and experts in systematic literature review to identify and prioritize clinical questions and outcomes related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostics. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on 15 diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Universal access to accurate SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing is critical for patient care, hospital infection prevention and the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on the clinical performance of available tests is rapidly emerging, but the quality of evidence of the current literature is considered low to very low. Recognizing these limitations, the IDSA panel weighed available diagnostic evidence and recommends nucleic acid testing for all symptomatic individuals suspected of having COVID-19. In addition, testing is recommended for asymptomatic individuals with known or suspected contact with a COVID-19 case. Testing asymptomatic individuals without known exposure is suggested when the results will impact isolation/quarantine/personal protective equipment (PPE) usage decisions, dictate eligibility for surgery, or inform administration of immunosuppressive therapy. Ultimately, prioritization of testing will depend on institutional-specific resources and the needs of different patient populations.","output":"Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a cardiovascular disease with a high fatality rate. In this study, we combined network pharmacology and experimental pharmacology and discovered the potential mechanism of action and the active ingredients of the lily, Tricyrtis maculata was discovered. The monomer compound with stronger activity was discovered through in vitro cell experiments. METHODS: Forty known compounds were isolated from T. maculata. Using TCMSP, Swiss Target Prediction, metaTarFisher, GeneCards and OMIM databases, targets of drug compositions and AMI-related genes were obtained, and the differential expression genes between AMI and normal tissues were extracted through the GEO database. Then, through an online mapping tool, the intersection genes were obtained to predict the possible effective components of T. maculata that can be used to treat AMI. The top five targets were selected for molecular docking via the proteinCprotein interaction (PPI) network to verify the binding activity between key compounds and target proteins. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of the intersection genes were carried out with the program R to further screen key genes and effective compositions. On this basis, the compound with more optimal activity was screened and validated in vitro. RESULTS: In this study, 40 known monomer components were selected, and 1112 predicted genes, 1655 disease genes, 1425 differentially expressed genes, 1206 GO functions and 127 KEGG pathways were obtained. The results of molecular docking showed that the binding of MMP9 with drug components is stable.

The purpose of this analysis is to present the currently available longitudinal data on the recruited cohorts to help guide vaccination strategy decisions for different vaccine regimens and in age groups. We aimed at comparatively investigating SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike RBD IgG levels longitudinally for BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 and CoronaVac along with a single BNT162b2 or CoronaVac booster dose at around 6 months after initial complete immunization with CoronaVac. Primary assessments were targeted for 1-month and 3-month time points post second dose of each vaccine. One-month time point post third dose was also evaluated in a smaller cohort of subjects who received the booster dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac after initial receipt of a complete regimen of CoronaVac.

In addition, the rate of decline of antibodies was fastest in the CoronaVac group followed by ChAdOx1, and then by the BNT162b2. For the older-age higher risk group, the rate of seropositivity at 3 months post second dose was 100% for BNT162b2, 90% for ChAdOx1, and 60% for CoronaVac. In the final multivariate repeated measures model, lower antibody levels were also significantly associated with male sex, older age, and elapsed time since vaccination. Boosting a two-dose CoronaVac vaccination regimen at 6 months with a single BNT162b2 led to significantly increased levels of IgG compared to boosting with a single CoronaVac dose.<br><br>Interpretation: These longitudinal data can help shape vaccination strategies. Given the low antibody titers and fast decline observed in the CoronaVac group in individuals 60 years or older, other more potent vaccine options could be considered in these high-risk populations to sustain antibody responses over a longer period of time.

This observation has potentially important consequences for treating life-threatening human viral infections. Here, we investigated the role of neutrophils in this effect. Neutrophils are innate immunity effector cells with well-established microbe-killing activities that are rapidly mobilized upon infection. They are also emerging as orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunities. However, their immunomodulatory activity during antiviral mAb immunotherapies has never been studied. Our data reveal that neutrophils have an essential role in immunotherapy-induced immune protection of infected mice.

Instead, neutrophils operate as essential inducers of a potent host humoral antiviral response. Thus, neutrophils play an unexpected key role in protective immunity induction by antiviral mAbs.

The present study seeks to elucidate the composition of the microbiota associated with the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii and the functional strategies of the main symbionts. We combined microscopic approaches with metagenome-guided microbial genome reconstruction and amplicon community profiling towards this goal. Microscopic imaging revealed that the host and microbial cells appeared within dense biomass patches that are presumably syncytial tissue aggregates. Based on abundances in amplicon libraries and metagenomic data, SAR324 bacteria, Crenarchaeota, Patescibacteria and Nanoarchaeota were identified as abundant members of the V. pourtalesii microbiome and their genomic potentials were thus analyzed in detail. A general pattern emerged in that the V. pourtalesii symbionts had very small genome sizes in the range of 0.5-2.2 Mb and low GC contents, even below those of seawater relatives. Based on functional analyses of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), we propose two major microbial strategies: the givers, namely Crenarchaeota and SAR324, heterotrophs and facultative anaerobes, produce and partly secrete all required amino acids and vitamins. The takers, Nanoarchaeota and Patescibacteria, are anaerobes with reduced genomes that tap into the microbial community for resources, e.g., lipids and DNA, likely using pili-like structures. We posit that the existence of microbial cells in sponge syncytia together with the low-oxygen conditions in the seawater environment are factors that shape the unique compositional and functional properties of the microbial community associated with V. pourtalesii. Importance We investigated the microbial community of V. pourtalesii that forms globally unique, monospecific sponge grounds under low-oxygen conditions on the Scotian Shelf, where it plays a key role for its vulnerable ecosystem. The microbial community was found to be concentrated within biomass patches and is dominated by small cells (<1 m). MAG analyses showed consistently small genome sizes and low GC contents, which is unusual in comparison to known sponge symbionts. These properties as well as the (facultatively) anaerobic metabolism and a high degree of interdependence between the dominant symbionts regarding amino acid and vitamin synthesis are likely adaptations to the unique conditions within the syncytial tissue of their hexactinellid host and the low-oxygen environment.","output":"Microbial strategies for survival in the glass sponge Vazella pourtalesii"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this article is critical analysis, reflection and discussion in regards to the uses and impacts technology has had in community settings, specifically care homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the challenge is that if two classes of images share similar characteristics, the GAN might learn to generalize and hinder the classification of the two classes. In this paper, first we use MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets that are easy to visually inspect, to illustrate how similar images cause the GAN to generalize, leading to the poor classification of images. We then show how this generalization can misclassify pneumonia X-rays as healthy cases when using GANs for semi-supervised detection of pneumonia.

Preliminary research and clinical guidelines suggest patients recovering from critical illness associated with COVID-19 will present compromised function similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW). However, information regarding physical therapy and progressions of physiological and functional outcomes is currently limited. This case report describes the course of recovery of a patient without significant preexisting medical conditions. CASE DESCRIPTION : The patient RW (male, age 56) tested positive for COVID-19, and was admitted to ICU for 29 days. After weaning off mechanical ventilation after 2 months of hospitalization, he was transferred to our post-acute rehabilitation facility to recover from the residual effects. Physical therapy evaluation showed that while the patient was cognitively alert, he exhibited impaired general strength and activity intolerance due to severe exertional dyspnea. The patient received physical therapy aimed at improving his functional capacity. During his 16-day stay, the patient was able to significantly improve his capacities (i.e. 600% increase in 30-second chair stand test, 69.5% improvement in walking distance in 6-minute walk test, and 132.4% longer time to exhaustion during level ground ambulation). Dyspnea remained the main factor that limited his activities. DISCUSSION : This case demonstrated that post-acute physical therapy appeared to be effective and safe in improving function after critical illness due to COVID-19 for this patient. Physical therapists are encouraged to closely monitor respiratory parameters such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and levels of dyspnea during treatment for patient response and decisions regarding activity progression.","output":"Post-acute physical therapy for a patient with critical illness associated with COVID-19: A case report."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Innovative Smes and start-ups are the backbone and strategic drivers of economic growth for all economies Today, the current COVID-19 pandemic affects all companies regardless of their size or their activity Some sectors are less impacted than others, but overall, most SMEs and start-ups are strongly impacted by this crisis Indeed, this context is marked by the lengthening of payment terms, as well as the level of default which should reach 14% by the end of the year, with a peak at the end of the first quarter of 2021(Euler Hermes, 2020) Company default or failure prediction has been the subject of much theoretical and empirical work for forty years However, little research work focused on the distressed Small and Medium Enterprises, even though the risk of default of this type of business is very common Innovative Smes and start-ups are often considered to be rich in intangible capital but poor in liquidity (Brassell et King 2013) Based on these shortcomings, the purpose of this paper is to carry out a critical review of the literature on the phenomenon of default from the financial, economic and legal angles, before identifying the main determinants including intangible capital, in order to better understand their detection We will strive to reflect on a new rating approach integrating the notion of \\"Goowill\\" which is linked to the profitability generated by its intangible assets, as a solution to the problem of access to finance for innovative Moroccan SMEs and start-ups ?

VE was calculated after primary immunisation with two BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 doses, and at 2+ weeks following a BNT162b2 booster. Results Between 27 November and 06 December 2021, 581 and 56,439 eligible Omicron and Delta cases respectively were identified. There were 130,867 eligible test-negative controls. There was no effect against Omicron from 15 weeks after two ChAdOx1 doses, while VE after two BNT162b2 doses was 88.0% (95%CI: 65.9 to 95.8%) 2-9 weeks after dose 2, dropping to between 34 and 37% from 15 weeks post dose 2.From two weeks after a BNT162b2 booster, VE increased to 71.4% (95%CI: 41.8 to 86.0%) for ChAdOx1 primary course recipients and 75.5% (95%CI: 56.1 to 86.3%) for BNT162b2 primary course recipients. For cases with Delta, VE was 41.8% (95%CI: 39.4-44.1%) at 25+ weeks after two ChAdOx1 doses, increasing to 93.8% (95%CI: 93.2-94.3%) after a BNT162b2 booster.

It belongs to the coronavirus family of viruses, which have struck a few times before in history. Data based on previous research regarding etiology and epidemiology of other viruses from this family helped played a vital role in formulating prevention and precaution strategies during the initial stages of this pandemic. Data related to COVID-19 in Pakistan were not initially documented on a large scale. In addition, due to a weak health care system and low economic conditions, Pakistans population, in general, already suffers from many comorbidities, which can severely affect the outcome of patients infected with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 infections are coupled with a manifestation of various notable outcomes that can be documented and characterized clinically. The aim of this study was to examine these clinical manifestations, which can serve as indicators for early detection as well as severity prognosis for COVID-19 infections, especially in high-risk groups. METHODS: A retrospective observational study involving abstraction of demographic features, presenting symptoms, and adverse clinical outcomes for 1812 patients with COVID-19 was conducted. Patients were admitted to the four major hospitals in the Rawalpindi-Islamabad region of Pakistan, and the study was conducted from February to August 2020. Multivariate regression analysis was carried out to identify significant indicators of COVID-19 severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ventilator aid, and mortality. The study not only relates COVID-19 infection with comorbidities, but also examines other related factors, such as age and gender. RESULTS: This study identified fever (1592/1812, 87.9%), cough (1433/1812, 79.1%), and shortness of breath (998/1812, 55.1%) at the time of hospital admission as the most prevalent symptoms for patients with COVID-19. These symptoms were common but not conclusive of the outcome of infection. Out of 1812 patients, 24.4% (n=443) required ICU admission and 21.5% (n=390) required ventilator aid at some point of disease progression during their stay at the hospital; 25.9% (n=469) of the patients died. Further analysis revealed the relationship of the presented symptoms and comorbidities with the progression of disease severity in these patients. Older adult patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and asthma, were significantly affected in higher proportions, resulting in requirement of ICU admission and ventilator aid in some cases and, in many cases, even mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Older adult patients with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, and chronic kidney disease, are at increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infections, with an increased likelihood of adverse clinical outcomes.","output":"Presenting Characteristics, Comorbidities, and Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19 Hospitalized in Pakistan: Retrospective Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Workers supporting adults with intellectual disabilities experience significant stress in their essential role during COVID-19.

Yet, six months into the pandemic, there still exists no consensus on how to combat the virus in absence of a vaccine. Facing unprecedented circumstances, and in absence of real evidence on how to proceed, our organization early in the pandemic decided to act independently from often seemingly irrational guidance and, instead, to carefully follow a quickly evolving COVID-19 literature. Here described is the, likely, unique journey of a fertility center that maintained services during peaks of COVID-19 and political unrest that followed. Closely following publicly available data, we recognized relatively early that New York City and other East Coast regions, which during the initial COVID-19 wave between March and May represented the hardest-hit areas in the country, during the second wave, beginning in June and still in progress, remained almost completely unaffected. In contrast, south western regions, almost completely unaffected by the initial wave, were severely affected in the second wave. These two distinctively different infectious phenotypes suggested two likely explanations: The country was witnessing infections with two different SARS-CoV-2 viruses and NYC (along with the East Coast) acquired during the first wave much better immunity to the virus than south western regions. Both hypotheses since have been confirmed: East and West Coasts, indeed, were initially infected by two distinctively different lineages of the virus, with the East Coast lineage being 10-times more infectious. In addition, immunologists discovered an up to this point unknown long-term anti-viral innate (cellular) immune response which offers additional and much broader anti-viral immunity than the classical adaptive immunity via immobilizing antibodies that has been known for decades. Consequently, we predict that in the U.S., even in absence of an available vaccine, COVID-19, by SeptemberCOctober, will be at similarly low levels as are currently seen in NYC and other East Coast regions (generally < 1% test-positivity). We, furthermore, predict that, if current mitigation measures are maintained and no newly aggressive mutation of the virus enters the country, a significant fall-wave of COVID-19, in combination with the usual fall wave of influenza, appears unlikely.

METHODS: We built a hotline in 3 days using the following steps: 1) official mandate, 2) request for the creation of hotline numbers, 3) formulation of psychological intervention materials and policies, 4) call for volunteer certified psychologists, 5) call for volunteer certified psychiatrists in case of psychiatric cases, 6) creation of an anonymous and protected database, and 7) communication and regular reminders about the existence of the hotline for hospital workers. RESULTS: After the first 26 days, we received 149 calls with a mean of 5.73 calls/day (SD=3.22). The average call duration was 18.5 min (min=1; max=65min; SD=14.7), and mostly women (86%) called. The mean age was 32.7 years old (SD=11.0). Calls from hospital workers were from all professions; though mostly represented by frontline healthcare workers, non-frontline departments also called (total of 44 departments). Reasons for calling were anxiety symptoms (n=73, 49%), request for hotline information (n=31, 20.8%), worries about Covid-19 (n=23, 15.44%), exhaustion (n=17, 11.41%), trauma reactivation (n=10, 6.11%), insomnia (n=9, 6.0%), anger (n=8, 5.37%), depressive (n=6, 4.02%), and psychotic symptoms (n=3, 2.01%). Regarding referrals, 105 (70.47%) of them were referred to psychosocial, Covid, and general support.

In the latest benchmark CASF-2016 for comparative assessment of scoring functions, AutoDock Vina won the best docking power among all the docking tools. Modern drug discovery is facing a common scenario of large virtual screening of drug hits from huge compound databases. Due to the seriality characteristic of the AutoDock Vina algorithm, there is no successful report on its parallel acceleration with GPUs. Current acceleration of AutoDock Vina typically relies on the stack of computing power as well as the allocation of resource and tasks, such as the VirtualFlow platform. The vast resource expenditure and the high access threshold of users will greatly limit the popularity of AutoDock Vina and the flexibility of its usage in modern drug discovery. In this work, we proposed a new method, Vina-GPU, for accelerating AutoDock Vina with GPUs, which is greatly needed for reducing the investment for large virtual screens and also for wider application in large-scale virtual screening on personal computers, station servers or cloud computing, etc. Our proposed method is based on a modified Monte Carlo using simulating annealing AI algorithm. It greatly raises the number of initial random conformations and reduces the search depth of each thread. Moreover, a classic optimizer named BFGS is adopted to optimize the ligand conformations during the docking progress, before a heterogeneous OpenCL implementation was developed to realize its parallel acceleration leveraging thousands of GPU cores. Large benchmark tests show that Vina-GPU reaches an average of 21-fold and a maximum of 50-fold docking acceleration against the original AutoDock Vina while ensuring their comparable docking accuracy, indicating its potential for pushing the popularization of AutoDock Vina in large virtual screens.","output":"Accelerating AutoDock Vina with GPUs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We used transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analyses to determine if patients suffering from all types and subtypes of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), a severe inherited metabolic disease, may be more susceptible to COVID-19.

Four genes (GTF2F2, RAB18, TMEM97, PDE4DIP) coding for proteins potentially facilitating virus development were down-regulated, while two genes (FBN1, MFGE8), the products of which potentially interfere with virus propagation, were up-regulated in most MPS types.

The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the events spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the elections direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the elections spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines.","output":"Estimating direct and spill-over impacts of political elections on COVID-19 transmission using synthetic control methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Although the main route of transmission of SARS-CoV2 is via droplets and close contact, concerns about the possible secondary transmission via waters is growing given evidence for SARS-CoV2 faecal elimination. Here we review studies on coronavirus in water environments. METHODS: A review was carried out of papers writen in English on PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Papers were identified using the keywords: coronavirus, SARS, MERS, Covid-19 associated with water, surface water, drinking water, wastewater, sewage, slurry, sludge, biosolid. Papers were screened using their title and abstract to confirm their relevance. They were then reviewed to identify: coronavirus type and strain, type of water sample, type of study, detection methods, monitoring data, survival data, effect of disinfection and treatments. RESULTS: Since 1978, only 18 papers met the selection criteria. Of these, 11 reported experimental studies, 6 field studies, and one included both field and experimental work. Experimental studies were carried out using samples spiked with SARS-CoV or surrogates: 4 addressed the recovery efficiency of detection methods; 3 reported studies on virus removal from waters by different treatments; 7 were focussed on survival in water samples with results ranging from 2 to > 100 days, depending on virus, type of water, temperature, and detection method. Field studies monitored the presence of coronavirus in waters, sewage, slurry or biosolid. The included in total no more than 200 samples and used different detection methods. Some samples tested positive in 5 studies. CONCLUSIONS: While knowledge of coronavirus in waters appears very scarce and fragmentary, the recent SARS-CoV2 emergency demands new attention be focussed on its survival in natural conditions and following treatment in order to assess the risk of waterborne and food borne transmission as well as developing monitoring within sewage treatment facilities.

The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies allows to define a better picture of the spread of SARS-CoV2 infection in the population. The duration of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in the healthy population as well as in immunocompromised patients is still a topic of debate. HIV-infected people are at increased risk of developing complications from contracting a viral illness. Furthermore,their ability to develop and maintain an optimal immunological response to any kind of pathogen appears to be reduced.We analyzed the overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 antibodies in 85 HIV infected-people on ART aged between 5 and 34 years old from May to January 2021. 88,2%of patients were in a good state of viroimmunological control: 23 showed a VL<40cp/ml and 52 had an undetectable VL. When positive for SARS-CoV2 serology, a confirmatory nasopharyngeal swab for PCR assessment and a second serological assay would be performed.Out of the 85 patients, 5 proved to be positive for SARS-CoV2 antibodies (rate of prevalence 5.8%). In all 5 cases the nasopharyngeal swabs were negative and the second assay for SARS-CoV2 antibodies performed in 4 out of 5 patients a week later was negative as well. The anamnestic recall brought no elements of suspicion for a past infection.The duration of SARS-CoV2 antibodies after COVID19 disease is still poorly understood in healthy population and additional studies will be needed to define the durability of humoral responses in immunocompromised children and in particular in HIV infected children under effective ART. It is still unknown whether ART or their immunological impairment may in part mitigate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Also, it will be interesting to analyze the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV2 in HIV infected patients with a satisfactory virological control.","output":"SARS-COV2 Seroprevalence in a Cohort of Perinatally HIV Infected Children and Young Adults From May to December 2020 in Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current global situation requires urgent decision-making to reverse processes of mass extinction of thousands of species.

To facilitate the exchange of genetic material between in situ and ex situ populations, reproductive biotechniques have become a great tool, making it possible to restore species in their natural environments. For effective conservation to occur, there must be an integrated view of the problem as a whole, and action for solutions must take place jointly by different spheres of society. Even more, conservation must be carried out by the public sector, the private sector, the third sector, and not less importantly, the agricultural sector.

METHODS: Works summarized herein were searched through PubMed database and the Web. RESULTS: The review focuses on a subset of human viruses that have been largely studied through NMR techniques. Indeed, NMR solid- or solution-state methodologies allow to gain structural information on viral proteins and viral genomes either in isolation or bound to diverse binding partners. NMR data can be employed to set up structure-based approaches to design efficient antiviral agents inhibiting crucial steps of viral life cycle. In addition, NMR-based metabolomics analyses of biofluids from virus-infected patients let identify metabolites biomarkers of the disease and follow changes in metabolic profiles associated with antiviral therapy thus paving the way for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

Biochemical recurrence was defined as prostate-specific antigen > 0.02 ng/mL. Decipher score is reported as lower risk (< 0.6) and higher risk  0.60). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to examine the relationship between Decipher score and time to biochemical recurrence (months). Cox regression was used to analyze the relationship between Decipher score and time to biochemical recurrence while controlling for a number of clinical characteristics. Secondary analyses focused on a subset of men with prostate-specific antigen > 0.02 and < 0.20 ng/mL to determine if high-risk Decipher scores were associated with receipt of salvage treatment. RESULTS A total of 203 cases were analyzed: 37.9% and 62.1% had lower and higher risk Decipher scores respectively, and 56.2% had a biochemical recurrence. Median (inter-quartile range) follow-up was 20 (13.5, 25.3) months. Decipher score was significantly associated with time to biochemical recurrence (p = 0.027) while in the secondary analyses, high-risk Decipher scores ( 0.60) were associated with salvage treatment (p = 0.018). Stage category and Decipher score were significant predictors of time from elevated PSA to salvage treatment in the secondary analyses. CONCLUSION While it might not contribute statistically, Decipher score can be clinically useful in helping patients reach treatment decisions.","output":"Does post prostatectomy decipher score predict biochemical recurrence and impact care?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Two structural isomeric pentacyclic triterpenes, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid, were considered as the models for the quality control of many traditional Chinese herbal medicines and they have been proved to own important pharmacological activities.

Diagnosis is usually via real-time PCR, and it is unclear whether the semi-quantitative capability of this method, determining viral load through cycle threshold (Ct) values, can be leveraged. OBJECTIVES: We aim to review available knowledge on correlations between SARS-COV-2 Ct values and patient- or healthcare-related outcomes to determine whether Ct values provide useful clinical information. SOURCES: A PubMed search was conducted on 1 June 2020 based on a search strategy of (Ct value OR viral load) AND SARS-CoV-2. Data were extracted from studies reporting on the presence or absence of an association between Ct values, or viral loads determined via Ct value, and clinical outcomes. CONTENT: Data from 18 studies were relevant for inclusion. One study reported on the correlation between Ct values and mortality and one study reported on the correlation between Ct values and progression to severe disease; both reported a significant association (p < 0.001 and p = 0.008, respectively). Fourteen studies reported on the correlation between Ct value or viral loads determined via Ct value and disease severity, and an association was observed in eight (57%) studies. Studies reporting on the correlation of viral load with biochemical and haematological markers showed an association with at least one marker, including increased lactate dehydrogenase (n = 4), decreased lymphocytes (n = 3) and increased high-sensitivity troponin I (n = 2). Two studies reporting on the correlation with infectivity showed that lower Ct values were associated with higher viral culture positivity. IMPLICATIONS: Data suggest that lower Ct values may be associated with worse outcomes and that Ct values may be useful in predicting the clinical course and prognosis of patients with COVID-19; however, further studies are warranted to confirm clinical value.","output":"A Narrative Systematic Review of the Clinical Utility of Cycle Threshold Values in the Context of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: O'Brien MP, Forleo-Neto E, Musser BJ, et al.

The evaluation of organ severity is difficult in patients considered for cannulation in a distant hospital. This study was designed to identify early factors associated with hospital mortality in ARDS patients treated with ECMO and retrieved from referring hospitals. METHODS: Data from 85 consecutive ARDS patients equipped with ECMO by our mobile team and consequently admitted to our ICU were prospectively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The main ARDS etiologies were community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (35 %), influenza pneumonia (23 %) (with 12 patients having been treated during the first half of the study period), and nosocomial pneumonia (14 %). The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1C4) h. ECMO was venovenous in 77 (91 %) patients. No complications occurred during transport by our mobile unit. Forty-eight patients died at the hospital (56 %). Based on a multivariate logistic regression, a score including age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia was constructed. The probability of hospital mortality following ECMO initiation was 40 % in the 0C2 score class (n = 58) and 93 % in the 3C4 score class (n = 27). Patients with an influenza pneumonia diagnosis and a SOFA score before ECMO of less than 12 had a mortality rate of 22 %.

The cytotoxicity of curcumin was evaluated using MTT assay in Vero E6 cells. The antiviral activity of this compound against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using four treatment strategies (i. preCpost infection treatment, ii. co-treatment, iii. pre-infection, and iv. post-infection). The D614G strain and Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 were used, and the viral titer was quantified by plaque assay. The anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using qPCR and ELISA. By preCpost infection treatment, Curcumin (10 g/mL) exhibited antiviral effect of 99% and 99.8% against DG614 strain and Delta variant, respectively. Curcumin also inhibited D614G strain by pre-infection and post-infection treatment. In addition, curcumin showed a virucidal effect against D614G strain and Delta variant. Finally, the pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8) released by PBMCs triggered by SARS-CoV-2 were decreased after treatment with curcumin. Our results suggest that curcumin affects the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and exhibits virucidal effect with a variant/strain independent antiviral effect and immune-modulatory properties.

In this context, it is important to analyze the innate immune host responses triggered against ChikV. Autophagy has been shown to be an important component of the innate immune response and is involved in host defense elimination of different pathogens. However, the autophagic process was recently observed to be hijacked by virus for their own replication. Here we provide the first evidence that hallmarks of autophagy are specifically found in HEK.293 infected cells and are involved in ChikV replication. METHODS: To test the capacity of ChikV to mobilize the autophagic machinery, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on HEK.GFP.LC3 stable cells, and followed the LC3 distribution during the time course of ChikV infection. To confirm this, we performed electron microscopy on HEK.293 infected cells. To test the effect of ChikV-induced-autophagy on viral replication, we blocked the autophagic process, either by pharmacological (3-MA) or genetic inhibition (siRNA against the transcript of Beclin 1, an autophagic protein), and analyzed the percentage of infected cells and the viral RNA load released in the supernatant. Moreover, the effect of induction of autophagy by Rapamycin on viral replication was tested. RESULTS: The increasing number of GFP-LC3 positive cells with a punctate staining together with the enhanced number of GFP-LC3 dots per cell showed that ChikV triggered an autophagic process in HEK.293 infected cells. Those results were confirmed by electron microscopy analysis since numerous membrane-bound vacuoles characteristic of autophagosomes were observed in infected cells. Moreover, we found that inhibition of autophagy, either by biochemical reagent and RNA interference, dramatically decreases ChikV replication. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy may play a promoting role in ChikV replication. Investigating in details the relationship between autophagy and viral replication will greatly improve our knowledge of the pathogenesis of ChikV and provide insight for the design of candidate antiviral therapeutics.","output":"Chikungunya triggers an autophagic process which promotes viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The patterns and hospital course of COVID-19 in children appears distinct from adult experience and requires clear delineation The objective of this study is to describe the clinical course of children admitted with COVID-19 to a tertiary care pediatric center and to evaluate the frequency of MIS-C in various COVID-19 illness patterns METHODS: Children (68) admitted with COVID-19 till June 2020 were included in an IRB approved, retrospective single center study Serious COVID-19 illness was defined as any child requiring invasive respiratory or cardiovascular support or renal replacement therapy COVID-related Kawasaki-like disease (CKLD) was defined as any patient with COVID-19, fever 5d, elevated inflammatory markers and mucocutaneous lesions Remaining patients were mild to moderate illness CDC criteria were used to identify multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) RESULTS: The median age was 6 4Y 31 (45 6%) were male 60 (88 2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 Eight cases were antibody positive or epidemiologically linked MIS-C was present in 39 (57 4%), serious COVID-19 illness in 11 (16 2%), CKLD in 9 (13 2%) and rest had mild to moderate illness (n=49;72%) MIS-C was present in all cases admitted to PICU (n=17) or who had severe illness and CKLD cases Most common organs involved were hematologic (51 5%), hepatic (50%), respiratory (41 2%) and cardiac (23 5%) Children with serious illness were adolescents with elevated BMI (73%), premorbid conditions (82%) and ARDS (72%) Children with CKLD were 2-12 years old with no premorbid condition Of PICU admissions, 11 needed supplemental oxygen, 6 non-invasive ventilation and 3 invasive ventilation ARDS (S/ F264) was present in 8 The presence of lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, CRP&gt;3mg/dL, admission D-dimer&gt;0 41g/ mL or elevated BNP levels had a sensitivity of 0 84 and specificity of 0 75 for MIS-C diagnosis with COVID-19 (AUC:0 80;95%CI:0 68-0 91;p&lt;0 001) One child died CONCLUSIONS: The 3 patterns of COVID-19 in hospitalized children were (1) severe illness seen in obese adolescents with premorbidity (2) CKLD in 2-12-year-olds with varying cardiac involvement (3) mild to moderate illness in younger children Children&lt;2 years are generally spared from severe disease MIS-C is present in all children with severe illness and CKLD","output":"Patterns of COVID-19 illness in hospitalized children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human influenza viruses are occasionally detected in the stools of influenza patients.

Isolated viruses were then sequenced using MiSeq platform. Replication kinetics and receptor binding affinity were also evaluated. RESULTS Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 41% (36/87) of influenza A positive patients. Among the 36 stool samples subjected to viral isolation, 5 showed virus growth. Sequence analysis of isolated viruses revealed two distinct mutation patterns in fecal viruses. Set I viruses was able to replicate to higher titers in cell culture despite the limited number of mutations (6 mutations) compared to set II viruses (>10 mutations).

Since 60-80% of patients with Diamond Blackfan anemia (DBA), an inherited pure red cell aplasia induced by mutations in ribosomal protein genes became transfusion independent upon treatment with glucocorticoids, we investigated whether clinically relevant NR3C1 SNPs are associated with disease manifestation in DBA. The eight SNPs rs10482605, rs10482616, rs7701443, rs6189/rs6190, rs860457, rs6198, rs6196, and rs33388/rs33389 were investigated in a cohort of 91 European DBA patients. Results were compared with those observed in healthy volunteers (n=37) or present in public genome databases of Italian and European populations. Although, cases vs. control analyses suggest that the frequency of some of the minor alleles is significantly altered in DBA patients with respect to healthy controls or to the Italian or other European registries, lack of consistency among the associations across different sets suggests that overall the frequency of these SNPs in DBA is not different from that of the general population. Demographic data (47 females and 31 males) and driver mutations (44 S and 29 L genes and eight no-known mutation) are known for 81 patients while glucocorticoid response is known, respectively, for 81 (36 responsive and 45 non-responsive) and age of disease onsets for 79 (55 before and 24 after 4months of age) patients. Neither gender nor leading mutations were associated with the minor alleles or with disease manifestation. In addition, none of the SNPs met the threshold in the response vs. non-responsive groups. However, two SNPs (rs6196 and rs860457) were enriched in patients manifesting the disease before 4months of age. Although the exact biomechanistical consequences of these SNPs are unknown, the fact that their configuration is consistent with that of regulatory regions suggests that they regulate changes in glucocorticoid response during ontogeny. This hypothesis was supported by phosphoproteomic profiling of erythroid cells expanded ex vivo indicating that glucocorticoids activate a ribosomal signature in cells from cord blood but not in those from adult blood, possibly providing a compensatory mechanism to the driving mutations observed in DBA before birth.","output":"The Glucocorticoid Receptor Polymorphism Landscape in Patients With Diamond Blackfan Anemia Reveals an Association Between Two Clinically Relevant Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Time to Diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Objectives: With this study, for the first time among patients diagnosed with COVID-19, the neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratios of men and women were compared.

METHODS Nonsurvival experiments were conducted in 9 pigs to study the technical feasibility. The procedure comprised the following: (1) creation of the disease model by laparoscopic resection of the lower esophagus; (2) laparoscopic fundoplication, complete mobilization of the stomach, and enlargement of the esophageal hiatus; (3) formation of a peroral transesophageal entry site into either the postmediastinum or the right thoracic cavity followed by fashioning a tunnel to the peritoneal cavity; (4) gastric pull-up by using both laparoscopy and NOTES; (5) esophagoesophageal anastomosis using BraceBar?, a prototype of the double T-bar suturing device (Olympus Medical Systems Co., Tokyo, Japan).

In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the clinical, radiological and laboratory findings in hospitalized COVID-19 confirmed cases in Ilam province, west of Iran. Material: and methods: Overall, 2204 hospitalized RT-PCR confirmed patients with COVID-19 were considered in this study. Electronic medical records, including clinical symptoms, radiological images, laboratory findings, and the comorbidities of patients with COVID-19 were collected and analyzed. In addition, the medication regimens used in these patients were evaluated. The patients were classified in discharged and died groups according to their outcomes. Then, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings as well as treatment regimens and underlying diseases were compared in these two groups. Results: : Among the patients, 1209 (54.85%) were male and 995 (45.14%) were female. Pneumonia, dyspnea and cough, were the most common clinical data in both discharged and died groups. Among the comorbidities, COPD, and cancer were significantly more common in the dead patients than in the living.

Our aim was to evaluate whether a semi-quantitative assessment of rectal/throat ESBL-E carriage can predict ESBL-E-associated VAP in medical ICU patients. METHODS: From May 2014 to May 2017, all ESBL-E carriers had a semi-quantitative assessment of ESBL-E density in swabs cultures. For those who developed GNB-VAP (diagnosed using bronchoalveolar lavage or plugged telescopic catheter with significant quantitative culture), the last positive swab collected at least 48 h before GNB-VAP onset was selected. Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database. RESULTS: Among 365 ESBL-E carriers, 82 developed 107 episodes of GNB-VAP (ESBL-E VAP, n = 50; and non-ESBL-E GNB-VAP, n = 57) after 13 days of mechanical ventilation in median. Antimicrobials use before VAP onset was similar between groups. The last swabs were collected 5 days in median before VAP onset. ESBL-E. coli carriers developed ESBL-E VAP less frequently (n = 13, 34%) than others (n = 32, 67.3%, p < .01). Throat swab positivity (39 (78%) vs. 12 (23%), p < .01) was more frequent for ESBL-E VAP. ESBL-E VAP was associated with significantly higher ESBL-E density in rectal swabs. In multivariate models, non-E. coli ESBL-E carriage and rectal ESBL-E carriage density, or throat carriage, remained associated with ESBL-E VAP. CONCLUSION: In carriers of ESBL-E other than E. coli, ESBL-E throat carriage or a high-density ESBL-E rectal carriage are risk factors of ESBL-E VAP in case of GNB-VAP.

While several predicting factors have already been identified, it is still not well known if increased levels of inflammatory markers in the immediate perioperative phase correlate with a higher incidence of postoperative complications. This study aimed to evaluate which patient characteristics and intraoperative parameters correlate with increased plasma values of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) of thoracic surgery patients. A second goal was to explore whether MCP-1 and IL-6 are associated with the incidence of postoperative complications. We hypothesized that there is a positive association between inflammatory markers and the occurrence of complications within 6 months after surgery. METHODS This is a substudy of a recent randomized controlled trial, which defined the effect of desflurane versus propofol anesthesia on morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing thoracic surgery. MCP-1 and IL-6 were determined in plasma obtained before and 30 minutes after 1-lung ventilation, 6 hours after surgery, and on postoperative days 1 and 2. Complications were recorded for 6 months. Mixed linear models were used to examine factors associated with MCP-1 and IL-6 levels. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the association between MCP-1 and IL-6 and postoperative complications. RESULTS In the original study, 460 patients were included, MCP-1 and IL-6 levels were determined in 428 patients. MCP-1 was positively associated with the duration of surgery (P = .016), whereas IL-6 levels increased with both the length (P < .001) and invasiveness of lung surgery (thoracoscopic wedge resection or lobectomy versus open lobectomy, P = .005; thoracoscopic wedge resection or lobectomy versus pneumonectomy, P = .021). In an exploratory approach, elevated IL-6 plasma peaks were associated with the occurrence of severe complications defined as Clavien-Dindo score grade IVa during the postoperative phase up to 6 months after thoracic surgery (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS In summary, this substudy reveals factors, which correlate with high MCP-1 and IL-6 values. Moreover, higher IL-6 seems to be associated with postoperative severe complications. Perioperative IL-6 monitoring might be helpful for risk estimation in the perioperative setting of patients after lung surgery.","output":"Interleukin-6 Is an Early Plasma Marker of Severe Postoperative Complications in Thoracic Surgery: Exploratory Results From a Substudy of a Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To examine multilevel predictors on American public response to COVID-19.

SUBJECTS 2,440 respondents 18 years and older from all 50 states and D.C. MEASURES The outcome variable is the public response to COVID-19 measured by threat perception, behavioral adjustment, and policy support. The predictors include individual-level sociodemographic factors and state-level indicators about public health conditions, political context, and economic recovery. ANALYSIS Multilevel structural equation modeling is used for statistical estimation. RESULTS People from states with more COVID-19 cases ( = 0.020, p < 0.1), mandatory face mask policies ( = 0.069, p < 0.05), and liberal governments ( = 0.002, p < 0.05) are more likely to respond while people from states whose economies have recovered closer to the pre-pandemic level are less likely to do so ( = -0.005, p < 0.05).

Furthermore, it induces chemotaxis and inflammation once released in the extracellular milieu, and it has been reported to upregulate, but also to inhibit HIV-1 replication in different cell types. We here investigated the potential role of extracellular HMGB1 in both R5 and X4 HIV-1 replication in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and U937 promonocytic cells, respectively. DESIGN MDM or U937 cells were infected with R5 and X4 HIV-1 strains, respectively, in the presence or absence of endotoxin-free recombinant (r) HMGB1 or necrotic cell supernatants either containing or depleted of endogenous HMGB1. METHODS HIV replication was measured by means of virion-associated reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatants and cell-associated viral protein expression. Cytokine and chemokine production were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; cell surface expression of CD4, CC chemokine receptor 5, receptor for advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptor-2 and Toll-like receptor-4 were analyzed by flow cytometry. RESULTS Both rHMGB1 and necrotic cell supernatant-associated HMGB1 inhibited replication of R5 HIV-1 in MDM. Surprisingly enough, no upregulation of CC chemokine receptor 5-binding chemokines or of other chemokines and cytokines was observed in rHMGB1-stimulated MDM. HMGB1 also induced chemotaxis and strongly inhibited the replication of X4 HIV-1 in the 'Minus' subset of U937 cell clones expressing high levels of putative HMGB1 receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptors 2 and 4).

The effect of obesity is unclear and has not been shown to independently increase the likelihood of PPCs in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. We hypothesized the likelihood of mortality and PPCs would increase as body mass index (BMI) increases in trauma patients undergoing trauma laparotomy. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program (2010C2016) was queried to identify trauma patients  18-years-old undergoing trauma laparotomy within 6-h of presentation. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine the likelihood of PPCs and mortality when stratified by BMI. RESULTS: From 8,330 patients, 2,810 (33.7%) were overweight (25C29.9 kg/m(2)), 1444 (17.3%) obese (30C34.9 kg/m(2)), 580 (7.0%) severely obese (35C39.9 kg/m(2)), and 401 (4.8%) morbidly obese ( 40 kg/m(2)). After adjusting for covariates including age, injury severity score, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, smoking, and rib/lung injury, the likelihood of PPCs increased with increasing BMI: overweight (OR = 1.37, CI 1.07C1.74, p = 0.012), obese (OR = 1.44, CI 1.08C1.92, p = 0.014), severely obese (OR = 2.20, CI 1.55C3.14, p < 0.001), morbidly obese (OR = 2.42, CI 1.67C3.51, p < 0.001), compared to those with normal BMI. In addition, the adjusted likelihood of mortality increased for the morbidly obese (OR = 2.60, CI 1.78C3.80, p < 0.001) compared to those with normal BMI. CONCLUSION: Obese trauma patients undergoing emergent trauma laparotomy have a high likelihood for both PPCs and mortality, with morbidly obese trauma patients having the highest likelihood for both.

METHODS: We applied a bloodstream infection-specific desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) analysis to the results of a previously completed, randomized controlled trial comparing short versus conventional course antibiotic therapy for hospitalized patients with uncomplicated GNB. We determined the probability that a randomly selected participant in the short course group would have a more desirable overall outcome than a participant in the conventional duration group. We performed (1) partial credit analyses allowing for calculated and variable weighting of DOOR ranks and (2) subgroup analyses to elucidate which patients may benefit the most from short durations of therapy.

Partial credit analyses indicated that the DOOR results were similar across different patient preferences. Prespecified subgroup analyses using DOOR did not reveal significant differences between short and conventional courses of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Both short and conventional durations of antibiotic therapy provide comparable clinical outcomes when using DOOR to consider benefits and risks of treatment options for GNB.","output":"A Desirability of Outcome Ranking Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial Comparing Seven Versus Fourteen Days of Antibiotics for Uncomplicated Gram-Negative Bloodstream Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Providing targeted support to people who are mostly impacted financially is critical in managing the socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic; however, governments face the challenge of pinpointing vulnerable workers.

Access to investment, which was initially limited in nature, has become quite flexible due to the promulgation of the Omnibus Law on Job Creation. Legislative reform which was colored by intrigue and controversy was packaged as a way out for national development and economy, especially as a response to the prevention of the country's financial crisis. This research examines the implementation of FI regulations on the investment climate in Indonesia, especially during the period of COVID-19 pandemic and a critical narrative towards the Omnibus Law on Job Creation which represents the investment legal revolution. By using normative legal research methods, this research is expected to be able to answer the above legal issues through a statutory approach and literature law materials which include scientific works and research results. The results show that the implementation of FI regulations in Indonesia is still classified as complicated so that the effect is the low interest of foreign investors to invest their capital in Indonesia. Although the government through the Capital Investment Coordinating Board has attempted to overcome this problem by pioneering the establishment of the One Stop Integrated Service and Investment Service, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for the realization of foreign investment in Indonesia.

These numbers are still rising daily. Most (some 80%) cases of COVID-19 infection are asymptomatic, a substantial number of cases (15%) require hospitalization and an additional fraction of patients (5%) need recovery in intensive care units. Mortality for COVID-19 infection appears to occur globally between 0.1 and 0.5% of infected patients although the frequency of lethality is significantly augmented in the elderly and in patients with other comorbidities. The development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and episodes of thromboembolism that may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) represent the primary causes of lethality during COVID-19 infection. Increasing evidence suggests that thrombotic diathesis is due to multiple derangements of the coagulation system including marked elevation of D-dimer that correlate negatively with survival. We propose here that the thromboembolic events and eventually the development of DIC provoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection may represent a secondary anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome (APS). We will apply both Baconian inductivism and Cartesian deductivism to prove that secondary APS is likely responsible for coagulopathy during the course of COVID-19 infection.

While mostly idiopathic (idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis or IRF), RPF is frequently associated with certain drugs, infections, and malignancies. It is thought to be immune-mediated because of response to steroids and RPF is commonly seen with other autoimmune diseases, especially IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IRF is also a part of the chronic aortitis syndromes and the presence of aortic aneurysms is another characteristic of this disease. A 63-year old woman presented with left-sided flank pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed left hydronephrosis from compression of the ureter by a retroperitoneal mass. A thoracoabdominal aneurysm was also noted. A [(18)F]- fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showed hypermetabolism in the mass, with no abnormally increased activity noted elsewhere. Within four months, the mass enlarged to involve the right ureter as well, leading to right hydronephrosis. She required bilateral ureteral stents and aneurysm repair. Biopsy of the mass showed dense fibrosis with a mononuclear cell infiltrate. The histology of the aneurysm specimen showed chronic periaortic inflammation. Laboratory investigations were significant for elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), with no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. She was referred to the rheumatology clinic to receive steroid treatment for IRF. IRF commonly involves the ureters and is diagnosed on CT scans during a workup for obstructive uropathy. The treatment is high dose steroids, while in resistant cases, other immunosuppressants have been used. The presentation of a patient with IRF can commonly mimic that of urinary calculi and malignancy.

On the first day of life, the newborn required passive oxygen therapy, followed by respiratory support with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) due to respiratory insufficiency. As the newborns respiratory effort was intensifying, he was intubated. In the second day of life, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken yielding the presence of H1N1 and RSV in the RT-PCR test. The child was isolated and given oseltamivir and empirical antibiotic therapy, which improved his condition. Other newborns who initially stayed with the sick child in the post-delivery room did not obtain oseltamivir prophylactically as their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative. The childs parents denied the occurrence of influenza-like symptoms within 14 days of delivery, which suggests a transplacental transmission of the childs infection or asymptomatic course of infection in the parents. In conclusion, this report confirms the possibility of viral coinfections in newborns, which points attention to considering a panel of respiratory viruses in the diagnostics.

Policies put in place to curb the tide of the pandemic resulted in a decrease of patient volumes throughout the ambulatory system. The future implications of COVID-19 in healthcare are still unknown, specifically the continued impact on the ambulatory landscape. The primary objective of this study is to accurately forecast the number of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 weekly visits in primary care practices. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single health system in Delaware. All patients' records were abstracted from our electronic health records system (EHR) from January 1, 2019 to July 25, 2020. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared using t-tests, Chi square, and Mann Whitney U analyses as appropriate. ARIMA time series models were developed to provide an 8-week future forecast for two ambulatory practices (AmbP) and compare it to a na?ve moving average approach. Results Among the 271,530 patients considered during this study period, 4,195 patients (1.5%) were identified as COVID-19 patients. The best fitting ARIMA models for the two AmbP are as follows: AmbP1 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(4,0,1), AmbP1 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(2,0,1), AmbP2 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(1,1,1), and AmbP2 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(1,0,0). Discussion and Conclusion: Accurately predicting future patient volumes in the ambulatory setting is essential for resource planning and developing safety guidelines.

In order to prevent the epidemic, traffic lockdown was required in many areas of China, which led to inconvenience of treatment for dialysis patients. This study was conducted to explore the psychological distress and the psychological demand induced by CO-VID-19 in the patients undergoing dialysis and compare the difference between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients during the traffic lockdown period. METHODS: Questionnaires were given to the dialysis patients in the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. The Impact of Event Scale (IES) was used to investigate the patients' trauma-related distress in response to COVID-19. RESULTS: 232 eligible respondents were enrolled in this cross-section study, consisting of 156 PD patients and 76 HD patients. The median IES score for all the enrolled patients was 8.00 (2.00C19.00), which belonged to the subclinical dimension of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). HD patients had a significant higher IES score than PD patients (11.50 vs. 8.00) (p < 0.05). HD patients already got more psychological support from the medical staff. According to IES scores, 22.4% HD patients and 13.4% PD patients were classified as having moderate or severe PTSS, which need psychological support (p < 0.05). But more patients of both groups considered psychological support was necessary (HD: 50%, PD: 45.5%) (p > 0.05). In the multivariate regression analysis, we found that dialysis vintage, the impact of COVID-19 on the severity of illness and daily life, and confidence in overcoming the disease contributed to IES score (p < 0.05).

The rationale for the GPP is based on the assumption that vaccinated people should maintain a certain degree of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Here we describe and compare, for the first time, the humoral immune response to mRNA-1273, BNT162b2, Ad26.COV2.S, and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines in terms of antibody titer elicited, neutralizing activity, and epitope reactogenicity among 369 individuals aged 19 to 94 years. In parallel, we also considered the use of a rapid test for the determination of neutralizing antibodies as a tool to guide policymakers in defining booster vaccination strategies and eligibility for Green Pass. Our analysis demonstrates that the titer of antibodies directed towards the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 Spike is significantly associated with age and vaccine type. Moreover, natural COVID-19 infection combined with vaccination results, on average, in higher antibody titer and higher neutralizing activity as compared to fully vaccinated individuals without prior COVID-19. We also found that levels of anti-Spike RBD antibodies are not always strictly associated with the extent of inhibition of RBD-ACE2 binding, as we could observe different neutralizing activities in sera with similar anti-RBD concentrations. Finally, we evaluated the reactivity to four synthetic peptides derived from Spike protein on a randomly selected serum sample and observed that similar to SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccination elicits a heterogeneous antibody response with qualitative individual features. On the basis of our results, the use of rapid devices to detect the presence of neutralizing antibodies, even on a large scale and repeatedly over time, appears helpful in determining the duration of the humoral protection elicited by vaccination.

Within a cohort of healthcare workers (HCW), frequency and risk factors for symptoms compatible with long-COVID are assessed. METHODS: Participants answered baseline (August/September 2020) and weekly questionnaires on SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) results and acute disease symptoms. In January 2021, SARS-CoV-2 serology was performed; in March, symptoms compatible with long-COVID (including psychometric scores) were asked and compared between HCW with positive NPS, seropositive HCW without positive NPS (presumable a-/pauci-symptomatic infections), and negative controls. Also, the effect of time since diagnosis and quantitative anti-S was evaluated. Poisson regression was used to identify risk factors for symptom occurrence. RESULTS: Of 3'334 HCW (median 41 years; 80% female), 556 (17%) had a positive NPS and 228 (7%) were only seropositive. HCW with positive NPS more frequently reported 1 symptom compared to controls (73%vs.52%, p<0.001); seropositive HCW without positive NPS did not score higher than controls (58%vs.52%, p=0.13), although impaired taste/olfaction (16%vs.6%, p<0.001) and hair loss (17%vs.10%, p=0.004) were more common.

However, the nature of ovarian cysts lacks accurate judgement, leading to that many patients with benign nodules still need Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) biopsies or surgeries, increasing the physical pain and mental pressure of patients as well as unnecessary medical health care costs. Therefore, we present an image diagnosis system for classifying the ovarian cysts in color ultrasound images, which novelly applies the image features fused by both high-level features from deep learning network and low-level features from texture descriptor. Firstly, the ultrasound images are enhanced to improve the quality of training data set and the rotation invariant uniform local binary pattern (ULBP) features are extracted from each of the images as the low-level texture features. Then the high-level deep features extracted by the fine-tuned GoogLeNet neural network and the low-level ULBP features are normalized and cascaded as one fusion feature that can represent both the semantic context and the texture patterns distributed in the image. Finally, the fusion features are input to the Cost-sensitive Random Forest classifier to classify the images into \\"malignant\\" and \\"benign\\". The high-level features extracted by the deep neural network from the medical ultrasound image can reflect the visual features of the lesion region, while the low-level texture features can describe the edges, direction and distribution of intensities. Experimental results indicate that the combination of the two types of features can describe the differences between the lesion regions and other regions, and the differences between lesions regions of malignant and benign ovarian cysts.","output":"Improved Deep Learning Network Based in combination with Cost-sensitive Learning for Early Detection of Ovarian Cancer in Color Ultrasound Detecting System."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This situation report outlines some of the literature about conspiracy theories and its application to M?ori during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because SARS CoV-2 virus is spread via respiratory droplets, bag-mask ventilation, intubation, and extubation may place health care workers (HCW) at risk. While existing recommendations address airway management in patients with COVID-19, no guidance exists specifically for difficult airway management. Some strategies normally recommended for difficult airway management may not be ideal in the setting of COVID-19 infection. To address this issue the Society for Airway Management (SAM) created a task force to review existing literature and current Practice Guidelines for management of the difficult airway by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway. SAM task force created recommendations for management of known or suspected difficult airway in the setting of known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The goal of the task force was to optimize successful airway management while minimizing exposure risk. Each member conducted a literature review on specific clinical practice section utilizing standard search engines (PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar). Existing recommendations and evidence for difficult airway management in COVID-19 context were developed. Each specific recommendation was discussed among task force members and modified until unanimously approved by all task force members. Elements of AGREE Reporting Checklist for dissemination of clinical practice guidelines were utilized to develop this statement. Airway management in the COVID-19 patient increases HCW exposure risk. and difficult airway management often takes longer, may involve multiple procedures with aerosolization potential, strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols is mandatory to reduce risk to providers. When patient's airway risk assessment suggests awake tracheal intubation is an appropriate choice of technique, procedures that may cause increased aerosolization of secretions should be avoided. Optimal preoxygenation before induction with tight seal facemask may be performed to reduce risk of hypoxemia. Unless the patient is experiencing oxygen desaturation, positive pressure bag-mask ventilation after induction may be avoided to reduce aerosolization. For optimal intubating conditions, patients should be anesthetized with full muscle relaxation. Videolaryngoscopy is recommended as first-line strategy for airway management. If emergent invasive airway access is indicated, we recommend a surgical technique such as scalpel-bougie-tube, rather than an aerosolizing generating procedure, such as transtracheal jet ventilation.

We collected demographic data along with complete blood cell count; moreover, the outcome of the hospital in-stay was recorded. Results: At data cut-off, 221/664 patients (33.3%) had died and 453/664 (66.7%) had been discharged.

AIMS: The present study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of psychological outcomes and its association with various sociodemographic and occupational factors among the HCP in India. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional, online survey, using snowball sampling method was conducted between June 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020. The HCP working in COVID-19 designated hospitals across India were invited to participate. Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and 19-item stress-related questionnaire were used to evaluate symptoms of overall anxiety, depression, COVID-19 infection specific anxiety, exhaustion, and workload. RESULTS: In this cross-sectional study with 2334 HCP from 27 states and 7 union territories of India; 17.9% of participants had depression, 18.7% had overall anxiety, 26.5% had exhaustion, 30.3% reported heavy workload, and 25.4% had COVID-19 infection-specific anxiety, respectively. The HCP working in states with higher caseload was a common risk factor for overall anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; P < 0.001), depression (OR, 1.6; P < 0.001), COVID-19 infection-specific anxiety (OR, 2.5; P < 0.001), exhaustion (OR, 3.1; P < 0.001), and heavy workload (OR, 2.6; P < 0.001).

Moreover, very limited information is available about SARS-CoV-2 expressed regions and immune responses. In this paper an effort has been made, to facilitate vaccine development by proposing multiple epitopes as potential vaccine candidates by utilising SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome data. Here, publicly available RNA-seq data of SARS-CoV-2 infection in NHBE and A549 human cell lines were used to construct SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome to understand disease pathogenesis and immune responses. In the first step, epitope prediction, MHC class I and II gene identification for epitopes, population coverage, antigenicity, immunogenicity, conservation and crossreactivity analysis with host antigens were performed by using SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome, and in the second step, structural compatibility of identified T-and B-cell epitopes were evaluated with MHC molecules and B-cell receptors through molecular docking studies. Quantification of MHC gene expression was also performed that indicated high variation in allele types and expression level of MHC genes with respect to cell lines. In A549 cell line, HLA-A*30:01:01:01 and HLA-B*44:03:01:01 were highly expressed, whereas 92 variants of HLA-A*24 genes such as HLA-A*24:02:01:01, HLA-A*24:286, HLA-A*24:479Q, HLA-A*24:02:134 and HLA-A*24:02:116 were highly expressed in NHBE cell lines.

The first is to compare the results of qualitative phytochemical analysis of the ethanol extract of the leaves of P. canescens (EEPL). The second is to measure the total phenol and flavonoid content. The third is to test the FTIR and antioxidant activity of the ethanol extract of P. canescens leaves in vitro using the DPPH method. METHODS: Fresh plant material and simplicia, ethanol extract extracted by maceration method using 96% ethanol as solvent from P. canescens. The Dragendorffs and Mayer test carried out the qualitative phytochemical analysis, FeCl3 test, Salkowski method, LiebermannCBurchard method, foam test, and NaOH reagent. The total phenolic and flavonoid levels were tested using the FolinCCiocalteu method. In vitro antioxidant activity was carried out using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) method. RESULTS: The results of qualitative phytochemical screening showed that alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, and steroids were detected in the extract of P. canescens. The spectra from the FTIR test results showed various absorbance peak values indicating the bonding of specific functional groups, namely: 418.12, 599.94, 666.67, 1036.39, 1159.52, 1224.16, 1348.95, 1454.19, 1600.87, 1732.00, 2923.13, and 3353.01 cm-1.

The shikimate pathway is an attractive drug targets pathway as it is present in bacteria but absent in humans. As EPSP is essential for the A. baumannii growth and needed during the infection process, therefore it was used as a drug target herein for high-throughput screening of a comprehensive marine natural products database (CMNPD). The objective was to identify natural molecules that fit best at the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme and interact with functionally critical residues. Comparative assessment of the docking scores allowed selection of three compounds namely CMNPD31561, CMNPD28986, and CMNPD28985 as best binding molecules. The molecules established a balanced network of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, and the binding pose remained in equilibrium throughout the length of molecular simulation time. Radial distribution function (RDF) analysis projected key residues from enzyme active pocket which actively engaged the inhibitors. Further validation is performed through binding free energies estimation that affirms very low delta energy of <?22 kcal/mol in MM-GBSA method and <?12 kcal/mol in MM-PBSA method. Lastly, the most important active site residues were mutated and their ligand binding potential was re-investigated. The molecules also possess good druglike properties and better pharmacokinetics.

Databases searched were: Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and BioSis Previews. Grey literature was also explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review was conducted to locate published and unpublished studies. All studies examining corneal button contamination and its association with endophthalmitis and keratitis posttransplantation were included. Extracted data were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cost data from the London Laboratory Services Group in London, ON were used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of culturing donor rim cultures. RESULTS Of 7,870 grafts, 954 had a positive rim culture (12.1%), with 12 patients going on to develop keratitis or endophthalmitis (1.3%). The prevalence of keratitis and endophthalmitis in this study was 0.15%, and the positive predictive value 1.5%. Of the 12 infections, nine were fungal and three bacterial. The estimated cost of a positive and negative test result was CAD$45.99 and $14.15, respectively. The cost to run all 7,870 tests was estimated to be $141,735.86, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,215.70. CONCLUSION There was a significant divergence between bacterial and fungal rim-culture results. Bacterial cultures predicted clinical infection poorly, did not change management, and were expensive. Fungal cultures predicted clinical infection in over 10% of patients, had the potential to change management, and were 40% less expensive than full rim culturing (bacterial and fungal tests).

Based on disparate abdominal configurations and correlations in extant relatives, we posit that each new fossil taxon had a different mating approach along a nuptial gifting-coercive spectrum. The Eocene specimen possesses extreme female clamping abdominal armature, suggesting a degree of sexual coercion greater than in any other known scorpionfly, extinct or extant. The fossil record of abdominal modifications in male scorpionflies documents a relatively late evolution (Eocene) of long notal organs indicating oppressive behaviour toward a female during mating. Our findings reveal a wider array of mating-related morphological specialisations among extinct Panorpoidea, likely reflecting more diversified past mating strategies and behaviours in this group, and represent first steps towards gaining a deep-time perspective on the evolution of sexual conflict over mating among insects.","output":"Evolution of sexual conflict in scorpionflies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, theoretical high-energy physics, and likely also the majority of other disciplines, are seeing a surge of virtual seminars as a primary means for scientific exchange.

However, empirical and methodological inconsistencies have obscured the understanding of whether inflexibility and habitual tendencies indeed shape OCD symptoms in clinical and sub-clinical populations, and whether there are notable interactions amongst these traits. The present investigation adopted an interactionist individual differences approach to examine the associations between behaviorally-assessed cognitive flexibility and subclinical OCD symptomatology in a healthy population. It also explored the nature of the interactions between cognitive flexibility and habitual tendencies, and the degree to which these cognitive traits predict subclinical OCD symptomatology. Across two studies, including a preregistration, Bayesian and regression analyses revealed that cognitive inflexibility and compulsive habitual tendencies act as unique and independent predictors of subclinical OCD symptomatology in healthy populations. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between cognitive rigidity and habitual compulsivity, which accounted for 49.4% of the variance in subclinical OCD symptomatology in Study 1, and 37.3% in Study 2. In-depth analyses revealed a compensatory effect between cognitive inflexibility and habitual compulsivity such that both are necessary for OCD symptomatology, but neither is sufficient. These results imply that in order to generate reliable and nuanced models of the endophenotype of OCD symptomatology, it is essential to account for interactions between psychological traits. Moreover, the present findings have important implications for theories on the cognitive roots of OCD, and potentially in the development of interventions that target both cognitive inflexibility and habitual compulsivity.","output":"Cognitive Rigidity, Habitual Tendencies, and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms: Individual Differences and Compensatory Interactions."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Using fusions between the Escherichia coli genes argI and lacZ, it has been demonstrated that ribosomal frameshifting occurs at a frequency of between 3% and 16% within the argl mRNA, soon after the initiation codon.

This study examined whether there was a change in minutes of PA and depression scores after a stay-at-home order and examined predictors of these changes. An online survey was sent to all undergraduate and graduate students attending a large, diverse university via an electronic newsletter. The survey requested information about demographic and academic data, cardiorespiratory fitness, and depression symptoms. Paired t-tests and logistic regression were employed. Our sample (n=194) was predominantly female (73%), young (mean age of 25), not a sexual minority (82%), and had a mean 3.4 GPA. Students reported worse depression scores (p<0.01) and fewer minutes of PA (p=0.01) after the stay-at-home order. There was a small but significant (p=0.04) correlation between changes in total minutes of PA and depression scores. Senior (p=0.05) and Hispanic (p=0.03) students were less likely to report worsening depression scores than freshmen and white students, respectively. Asian students were significantly more likely than white students to report decreased PA. This study suggests that COVID-19 and its consequences may be contributing to reduced PA and greater depression symptoms in college students and that sub-groups have been affected differently.

Balancing public health directives with the need to continue upholding the rule of law, what followed was the largest, unforeseen mass-pilot of remote hearings across the world. For courts this was necessarily a time of action, not reflection. However, after having maintained court operations, it is now necessary to reflect on the experience of remote courts and their users during an otherwise unprecedented situation. Unlike previous iterations of remote hearings, the COVID-19 experience was fully remote C whereby all participants took part in the hearing remotely. The difficulty is until now, almost no prior empirical data has existed on this type of fully remote hearing with the majority of previous research focused on the use of audiovisual links (AVLs) to facilitate partially remote appearances within courtrooms. To bridge the research and data gap on fully remote hearings, this article draws on the previous body of literature to both examine the COVID-19 experience, and to assist in guiding future research and use of remote hearings. ? 2021, University of New South Wales Law Journal.

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the family environment and the emotional state of the medical staff members during the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to the importance of self-efficacy in regulating mental health, the mediating role of self-efficacy in the association between family environment and emotional state was also explored. A cross-sectional survey was performed, using an online questionnaire, on 645 medical staff who participated in the epidemic prevention and control tasks during the COVID-19 outbreak in Beijing. Family environment, self-efficacy, anxiety, and depressive symptoms were measured by the Family Environment Scale-Chinese Version (FES-CV), the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), respectively. Correlation analysis and mediating effect analysis were used to explore the relationships between them. First, a higher prevalence of anxiety (39%) and depressive (33%) symptoms were confirmed among the medical staff. Second, the symptoms of anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with the dimensions of cohesion and expressiveness and positively correlated with the dimensions of conflict in the FES-CV scale. Third, self-efficacy significantly mediated the association between the family environment and anxiety symptoms (P < 0.001) as well as the family environment and depressive symptoms (P < 0.001). These findings show that a negative family environment was the main predictor of symptoms of anxiety and depression in the medical staff during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we found that self-efficacy played a critical mediating role between the family environment and the symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Computational approaches for modeling toxicological data in conjunction with machine learning algorithms have gained popularity over the last few years. Machine learning approaches have been used to predict toxicity-related biological activities using chemical structure descriptors. However, toxicity-related proteomic features have not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct a computational pipeline using machine learning models for predicting the most important protein features responsible for the toxicity of compounds taken from the Tox21 dataset that is implemented within the multiscale Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) therapeutic discovery platform. Tox21 is a highly imbalanced dataset consisting of twelve in vitro assays, seven from the nuclear receptor (NR) signaling pathway and five from the stress response (SR) pathway, for more than 10,000 compounds. For the machine learning model, we employed a random forest with the combination of Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and the Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) method (SMOTE+ENN), which is a resampling method to balance the activity class distribution. Within the NR and SR pathways, the activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (NR-AhR) and the mitochondrial membrane potential (SR-MMP) were two of the top-performing twelve toxicity endpoints with AUCROCs of 0.90 and 0.92, respectively. The top extracted features for evaluating compound toxicity were analyzed for enrichment to highlight the implicated biological pathways and proteins. We validated our enrichment results for the activity of the AhR using a thorough literature search. Our case study showed that the selected enriched pathways and proteins from our computational pipeline are not only correlated with AhR toxicity but also form a cascading upstream/downstream arrangement. Our work elucidates significant relationships between protein and compound interactions computed using CANDO and the associated biological pathways to which the proteins belong for twelve toxicity endpoints. This novel study uses machine learning not only to predict and understand toxicity but also elucidates therapeutic mechanisms at a proteomic level for a variety of toxicity endpoints.","output":"Identifying Protein Features and Pathways Responsible for Toxicity Using Machine Learning and Tox21: Implications for Predictive Toxicology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a case of childhood coronavirus disease 2019 infection with pleural effusion complicated by possible secondary Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.

As a result, it has been difficult to treat cancer patients on time, which adversely affects their prognosis. To address this problem, cancer centers must develop a strategic plan to manage both inpatients and outpatients during the pandemic, provide them with the necessary treatment, and at the same time prevent the spread of the virus among patients, visitors and medical staff. METHODS: Based upon the epidemic situation in Zhejiang Province, China, the number of running non-emergency medical wards in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital was gradually increased in a controlled manner. All staff of the hospital received COVID-19 preventive training and was provided with three different levels of protection according to the risks of their services. Only patients without a known history of SARS-CoV-2 contact were eligible to schedule an appointment. Body temperature was measured on all patients upon their arrival at the hospital. Chest CT image, blood cell counting and travel/contact history were investigated in patients with fever. Respiratory tract samples, such as sputum and throat swabs, from all patients, including those clinically suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were collected for nucleic acid detection of SARS-CoV-2 before treatment. RESULTS: A total of 3697 inpatients and 416 outpatients seeking cancer treatment were enrolled from February 1 to April 3, 2020, in compliance with the hospital's infection-control interventions. The clinicopathological parameters of the patients were summarized herein. 4237 samples from 4101 patients produced negative RNA testing results. Four clinically suspected patients all presented negative RNA test results and were excluded from the SARS-CoV-2 infection through follow-up retesting and monitoring. Seven patients with only N-gene positive results were retested, followed by CT scan and SARS-CoV-2 contact history investigation. All of them were finally diagnosed as non-infected patients. There was one outpatient who was confirmed positive by virus RNA test and then followed up. She might be an asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed case. During the study period, there was no SARS-CoV-2 infection among staff, patients and escorts of patients in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital. CONCLUSION: This study suggested our infection-control interventions, including viral nucleic acid test, could be used as a reliable method to screen cancer patients in the area with moderate COVID-19 prevalence.

Telepsychology can curb the access barriers and improve adherence but the role of telepsychology in improving adherence has not been well investigated. The current study examines the utility of telepsychology during the COVID-19 pandemic and treatment adherence in PNES patients. Materials and Methods: Patients with PNES admitted to a 12-week counseling program were offered two visit types: telepsychology and in-office. Visit type, visit status, and demographic information were obtained from department database. Follow-up visits in 6 months were used to examine the effect of visit type on visit status. Adherence to treatment was measured by higher attendance of scheduled visits and less cancellation and no-show rates. Results: Two hundred fifty-seven (n) patients who scheduled virtual or telepsychology visits were included in the study. After adjusting for demographic variables, and accounting for repeated measures, telepsychology visits were significantly more likely to be attended (odds ratio [OR] = 2.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.69-3.41, p < 0.001) and were significantly less likely to be canceled (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.29-0.64, p < 0.001).

With the aim to compare the different breast cancer (BC) features in Northern and Southern Italy, we investigated the relationship between BMI and BC characteristic in two groups of patients referred in the Modena and Lecce breast units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a continuous series of BC patients referred to the Citt di Lecce Hospital and the Modena Cancer Center, from January 2019 to December 2020 was performed. We identified four groups of BMI at BC diagnosis: underweight, BMI <18.5 kg/m(2); normal weight, BMI  18.5C24.9 kg/m(2); overweight, BMI  25.0C29.9 kg/m(2); obese, BMI 30.0 kg/m(2). BC characteristics and clinical outcomes were analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Mann-Whitney U test; categorical data were compared using Pearsons chi-square test, and dicotomic data were compared by odds ratio. RESULTS: Nine hundred seventy-seven BC patients were included in the analysis. Overall, 470 were from Modena and 507 from Lecce. No differences were observed in the mean age of BC patients of Modena (61,42) and Lecce (62,08). No statistical differences between the two populations were shown in terms of tumor characteristics and pathological stage. Conversely, a statistical difference of BMI between the BC patients coming from Modena and Lecce (25.87 and 27.81, respectively; p = 0.000001) was found. BC patients diagnosed in Lecce at age 70 years had higher median BMI compared with the ones from Modena (p = 0.000002). The increased BMI in this aged population was also associated to larger tumor size (p = 0.040). CONCLUSION: The rate of overweight and obesity was higher in BC women living in Southern Italy, despite the presumed nutrition according to the so-called Mediterranean type dietary pattern. Unexpectedly, an increased BMI rate and a relationship with larger tumor size were found in Southern BC patients aged 70 years. Our findings strongly support the need for promoting a healthier lifestyle model in Italy, with the aim of reducing the rate of the obesity and, consequently, the increased risk of BC.","output":"Obesity in Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Patients: It Is Time to Improve Actions for a Healthier Lifestyle.

In the multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with mortality were age  65 years (OR, 11.9; 95% CI, 3.20C44.23), SOFA score (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05C1.39), vasopressor use (OR, 12.8; 95% CI, 3.45C48.17), and renal replacement therapy (OR, 9.0; 95% CI 2.37C34.42). Conclusions: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had high mortality mainly related to advanced age, the severity of the disease on admission to the ICU, the use of vasopressors and renal replacement therapy.","output":"Clinical features and prognostic factors of adults with COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units in Colombia: a multicentre retrospective study during the first wave of the pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays information technologies have been essential for the advancement of teaching and professional development.

In this study, we used a fixed effect model and provincial data to document how public health varies with the business cycle in China over the period of 2010C2019. The estimated results showed that the business cycle is negatively correlated with the mortality of infectious disease, a proxy variable of public health, thus indicating that public health exhibits a countercyclical pattern in China. Furthermore, we investigated the potential moderating role of public health education and digital economy development in the relationship between business cycle and public health. Our findings suggested that public health education and digital economy development can mitigate the damage of economic conditions on public health in China. Health education helps the public obtain more professional knowledge about diseases and then induces effective preventions. Compared with traditional economic growth, digital economy development can avoid environmental pollution which affects public health. Also, it ensures that state-of-the-art medical services are available for the public through e-health. In addition, digitalization assures that remote working is practicable and reduces close contact during epidemics such as COVID-19.

Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cellCspecific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cellCspecific and NK cellCspecific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses.

Using dissimilar search strategies for new antivirals will improve our overall chances of finding effective treatments. Here, we have established an experimental platform for screening of small molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, genetically engineered to enhance cellular uptake of small molecules in the environment. The system consists of a fusion of the E. coli toxin MazF and its antitoxin MazE, with insertion of a protease cleavage site in the linker peptide connecting the MazE and MazF moieties. Expression of the viral protease confers cleavage of the MazEF fusion, releasing the MazF toxin from its antitoxin, resulting in growth inhibition. In the presence of a small molecule inhibiting the protease, cleavage is blocked and the MazF toxin remains inhibited, promoting growth. The system thus allows positive selection for inhibitors. The engineered yeast strain is tagged with a fluorescent marker protein, allowing precise monitoring of its growth in the presence or absence of inhibitor. We detect an established main protease inhibitor down to 10 M by a robust growth increase. The system is suitable for robotized large-scale screens. It allows in vivo evaluation of drug candidates, and is rapidly adaptable for new variants of the protease with deviant site specificities. IMPORTANCEThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue several years before vaccination campaigns can put an end it globally. Thus, the need for discovery of new antiviral drug candidates will remain. We have engineered a system in yeast cells for detection of small molecule inhibitors of one attractive drug target of SARS-CoV-2, its main protease which is required for viral replication. To detect inhibitors in live cells brings the advantage that only compounds capable of entering the cell and remain stable there, will score in the system. Moreover, by its design in yeast, the system is rapidly adaptable for tuning of detection level, eventual modification of protease cleavage site in case of future mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, or even for other proteases.","output":"A genetic trap in yeast for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article explores the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for public transport.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of (i) volumes of oncological activities (2020 vs 2019), (ii) patients perception rate of the preventive measures, (iii) patients SARS-CoV-2 infections, clinical signs thereof, and (iv) new diagnoses made during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: As compared with a similar time frame in 2019, the overall activity in total numbers of outpatient chemotherapy administrations and specialist visits was not statistically different (P = .961 and P = .252), while inpatient admissions decreased for both medical oncology and thoracic oncology (18% (P = .0018) and 44% (P < .0001), respectively).

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS Retrospective review of 855 children undergoing initial cleft lip or palate surgery, or revision surgery after fistula/dehiscence of initial cleft repair. We measured acute and chronic malnutrition using World Health Organization Z-scores of weight-for-age and height-for-age, respectively, and noted any postsurgical fistula or dehiscence. RESULTS Among patients with cleft lip, 22.3% were at least moderately chronically malnourished at the time of initial repair, and 17.5% were at least moderately acutely malnourished. Among patients undergoing initial repair of cleft palate, 20.9% were at least moderately chronically malnourished, and 8.1% were at least moderately acutely malnourished. Increasing nutritional status, as measured by height-for-age, predicts decreased odds of fistula (OR 0.78, P = .01) after cleft palate surgery. CONCLUSIONS Chronic malnutrition significantly increases the risk of fistula formation in patient with cleft palate.

Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Partnering with northern communities and including Indigenous Knowledge Systems would improve the timeliness, and likelihood, of detecting emerging zoonotic risks, and contextualize risk assessments to the unique human-wildlife relationships present in northern biomes.","output":"Implications of Zoonoses From Hunting and Use of Wildlife in North American Arctic and Boreal Biomes: Pandemic Potential, Monitoring, and Mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We propose a method based on optimal transport theory for causal inference in classical treatment and control study designs.

It is now widely assumed that the virus was silently spreading for at least 2 weeks before the first patient was identified. During this silent phase, and in the following weeks when the hospital system was overburdened, data collection was not performed in an accurate enough way to estimate an epidemic curve. With the aim of assessing both the dynamics of the introduction of the virus and the effectiveness of containment measures introduced, we try to reconstruct the epidemic curve using all cause mortality data. Methods: we collected all cause mortality data stratified by age from the national institute of statistics, together with COVID-related deaths data released by other government structures. Using a SEIR model together with estimates of the exposure to death time distribution, we fitted the reproduction number in different phases of the spread at regional level. Results: We estimate a reproduction number of 2.6+/-0.1 before case 1 was identified. School closures in Lombardy lowered it to 1.3. Soft lockdown measures resulted in R<0.8 and no further reductions were observed when a hard lockdown was introduced (e.g. Emilia-Romagna soft lockdown 0.67 +/-0.07, hard lockdown 0.69+/-0.071).

On November 1, 2021, South Africa introduced the Vooma Voucher program, which provided a small guaranteed financial incentive, a Vooma Voucher redeemable at grocery stores, for COVID-19 vaccination among older adults, a population most vulnerable to serious illness, hospitalization, and death. However, the association of financial incentives with vaccination coverage remains unclear. ObjectiveTo evaluate the association of the conditional economic incentive program with first-dose vaccination rates among older adults (aged []60 years) in South Africa. DesignA quasi-experimental cohort study using daily data on first doses administered. We ran interrupted time series (ITS) models to evaluate the Vooma Voucher program, launched on November 1, 2021, at national and provincial levels. We used data between October 1, 2021 and November 27, 2021 in models estimated at the daily level. Setting and participantsThe Vooma Voucher program was a nationwide vaccination incentive program implemented for adults aged []60 years from November 1, 2021 to February 28, 2022. InterventionIndividuals who received their first vaccine dose received a text message to access a [~]$7 (ZAR100) voucher that was redeemable at nationwide chain of grocery stores. Main outcomeDaily first COVID-19 vaccine doses administered per 10,000 individuals aged []60 years. ResultsThe Vooma Voucher program was associated with a 7.15-12.01% increase in daily first-dose vaccination in November 2021 compared to late October 2021. The incentive accounted for 6,476-10,874 additional first vaccine doses from November 1-27, 2021, or 8.31-13.95% of all doses administered to those aged []60 years during that period. This result is robust to the inclusion of controls for the number of active vaccine delivery sites and for the nationwide Vooma weekend initiative (November 12-14), both of which also increased vaccinations through expanded access to vaccines and demand creation activities. Conclusions/RelevanceFinancial incentives for COVID-19 vaccination led to a modest increase in first dose vaccinations among older adults in South Africa.

In this study, we tested whether conspiracy beliefs affect containment-related behaviour in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this relationship is mediated by political trust, preference for saving the economy or for saving lives. The data were collected at two time points, at the beginning of the epidemic and after the state of emergency was introduced. The sample consisted of 790 adults from Serbia (349 at time 1 and 441 at time 2), of which around 60% were female, with a mean age of around 33. The results indicate that holding more conspiracy beliefs is related to less adherence to containment-related behaviour, both directly and indirectly, via decreased political trust. Preference for saving lives has a direct effect on containment-related behaviour, while preference for saving economy plays no important role in this relationship, although it has a negative zero-order association with containment-related behaviour.

Many universities and education centres adapted their teaching to online education1. Virtual simulation has been endorsed by stakeholders not only for teaching healthcare students and workers, but also to be counted as practice hours for students2. We propose an approach to facilitate simulation-based education (SBE) online in an interactive manner for multiple participants. Methods: Visually enhanced mental simulation (VEMS) is a low fidelity yet very immersive and engaging educational activity used for participants to practise non-technical skills such as decisionmaking and communication while others observe3. Unlike ordinary mental simulation, participants can engage in VEMS as in a full-scale scenario-based simulation session, while being observed by peers. It is supported with visual elements such as a patient poster and laminated equipment cards for participants to illustrate the actions performed. Actions and patient parameters are also recorded with the timing by a facilitator on a white board. The scenario is followed by a debriefing involving all participants and observers. Recommendations: VEMS can be adapted to the online environment and be facilitated through platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Skype, Zoom, GoToMeeting, or Cisco WebEx easily using a shared screen with Microsoft PowerPoint and their associated chat function or the facilitator's web camera facing a noticeboard. A patient pictogram and transparent background equipment images can be used in PowerPoint to illustrate the actions verbalised by the participants. The facilitator can speak as the patient and illustrate and write down everything in PowerPoint as the participants engage in the scenario, so all the other session attendees can observe. Everyone can then attend the scenario debriefing online. Conclusion: Online VEMS offers an opportunity for participants to practise non-technical and communication skills.

METHODS Twenty-five elite soccer players, aged 14, were included to perform physical exercises at home during the Covid-19 confinement. Two cardio-training sessions and two upper and lower limb muscle strengthening sessions were performed per week. The exercise program was monitored remotely via the web. Hooper, training and mental indexes allowed a psychological follow-up. The effect of Covid-19 confinement on aerobic capacity was measured using a pre- and post-confinement Yo-Yo test. RESULTS Out of the 25 adolescences who completed the exercises program, 19 performed the post-confinement Yo-Yo test. The running distance decreased by 614 +/- 630 m (-25%) (p = 0001) and the maximal running speed by 0.97 +/- 1 km/h (-5%) (p=0.001), confirming detraining.

The efficient replication and population spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates an effective evasion of human innate immune responses, although the viral proteins responsible for this immune evasion are not clear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, accessory proteins, and the main viral protease as potent inhibitors of host innate immune responses of distinct pathways. In particular, the main viral protease was a potent inhibitor of both the RLR and cGAS-STING pathways. Viral accessory protein ORF3a had the unique ability to inhibit STING, but not the RLR response. On the other hand, structural protein N was a unique RLR inhibitor. ORF3a bound STING in a unique fashion and blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 to inhibit nuclear factor-B signaling. 3CL of SARS-CoV-2 inhibited K63-ubiquitin modification of STING to disrupt the assembly of the STING functional complex and downstream signaling. Diverse vertebrate STINGs, including those from humans, mice, and chickens, could be inhibited by ORF3a and 3CL of SARS-CoV-2.

In the absence of a vaccine, a key way to control the pandemic is through behavioural change: people adhering to transmission-reducing behaviours (TRBs), such as physical distancing, hand washing and wearing face covering. Non-adherence may be explained by theories of how people think about the illness (the common-sense model of self-regulation) and/or how they think about the TRBs (social cognition theory and protection motivation theory). In addition, outbreaks of infectious diseases and the measures employed to curb them are likely to have detrimental effects on people's mental and general health. Therefore, in representative repeated surveys, we will apply behavioural theories to model adherence to TRBs and the effects on mental and general health in the Scottish population from June to November 2020, following the initial outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Repeated 20 min structured telephone surveys will be conducted with nationally representative random samples of 500 adults in Scotland. The first 6 weeks the survey will be conducted weekly, thereafter fortnightly, for a total of 14 waves (total n=7000). Ipsos MORI will recruit participants through random digit dialling.

Concerns around the impact on vaccine effectiveness, transmissibility and severity are now driving the public health response to these variants. This paper analyses the patterns of growth in hospitalisations and confirmed cases for novel VOCs by age groups, geography and ethnicity in the context of changing behaviour, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the UK vaccination programme. We seek to highlight where strategies have been effective and periods that have facilitated the establishment of new variants. DESIGN: We have algorithmically linked the most complete testing and hospitalisation data in England to create a data set of confirmed infections and hospitalisations by SARS-CoV-2 genomic variant. We have used these linked data sets to analyse temporal, geographic and demographic distinctions. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The setting is England from October 2020 to July 2021. Participants included all COVID-19 tests that included RT-PCR CT gene target data or underwent sequencing and hospitalisations that could be linked to these tests. METHODS: To calculate the instantaneous growth rate for VOCs we have developed a generalised additive model fit to multiple splines and varying day of the week effects. We have further modelled the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 variants and included a doubly interval censored model to temporally adjust the confirmed variant cases. RESULTS: We observed a clear replacement of the predominant B.1.1.7 by the B.1.617.2 variant without observing sustained exponential growth in other novel variants. Modelled exponential growth of RT PCR gene target triple-positive cases was initially detected in the youngest age groups, although we now observe across all ages a very small doubling time of 10.7 (95% CI 9.1 to 13.2) days and 8 (95% CI 6.9 to 9.1) days for cases and hospitalisations, respectively. We observe that growth in RT PCR gene target triple-positive cases was first detected in the Indian ethnicity group in late February, with a peak of 0.06 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.05) in the instantaneous growth rate, but is now maintained by the white ethnicity groups, observing a doubling time of 6.8 (95% CI 4.9 to 11) days. R(t) analysis indicates a reproduction number advantage of 0.45 for B.1.617.2 relative to B.1.1.7, with the R(t) value peaking at 1.85 for B.1.617.2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate a clear transmission advantage for the B.1.617.2 variant and the growth in hospitalisations illustrates that this variant is able to maintain exponential growth within age groups that are largely doubly vaccinated. There are concerning signs of intermittent growth in the B.1.351 variant, reaching a 28-day doubling time peak in March 2021, although this variant is presently not showing any evidence of a transmission advantage over B.1.617.2. Step 1b of the UK national lockdown easing was sufficient to precipitate exponential growth in B.1.617.2 cases for most regions and younger adult age groups. The final stages of NPI easing appeared to have a negligible impact on the growth of B.1.617.2 with every region experiencing sustained exponential growth from step 2. Nonetheless, early targeted local NPIs appeared to markedly reduced growth of B.1.617.2. Later localised interventions, at a time of higher prevalence and greater geographic dispersion of this variant, appeared to have a negligible impact on growth.","output":"Growth, reproduction numbers and factors affecting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 novel variants of concern in the UK from October 2020 to July 2021: a modelling analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This Covid-19 pandemic brings uncertainty and may lead to mental problems.

Online psychological measures were administered to 406 participants, including the IUS-12, the DASS-21, cognitive appraisal scales, and emotional and behavioural response scale. An indirect pathway was found between IU and depression, and the effect was serially mediated by perceived of severity and emotional and behavioural responses to COVID-19. Perceived knowledge and perceived controllability of COVID-19 did not significantly contribute to the model. A similar pathway was found for IU predicting anxiety. As conclusion, IU represents a risk factor for heightened emotional and behavioural difficulties that eventually, could lead to either anxiety or depression during COVID-19. ? 2021, Cluj University Press.

Nevertheless, all of the reports are limited compared to data from the same period over the past few years, providing mainly an overview of past events, with no future predictions. Lockdown level can be directly related to the number of new COVID-19 cases, air pollution, and economic restriction. As lockdown status varies considerably across the globe, there is a window for mega-cities to determine the optimum lockdown flexibility. To that end, firstly, we employed four different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to examine the compatibility to the original levels of CO, O3, NO2, NO, PM2.5, and PM10, for S?o Paulo City, the current Pandemic epicenter in South America. After checking compatibility, we simulated four hypothetical scenarios: 10%, 30%, 70%, and 90% lockdown to predict air pollution levels. To our knowledge, ANN have not been applied to air pollution prediction by lockdown level. Using a limited database, the Multilayer Perceptron neural network has proven to be robust (with Mean Absolute Percentage Error a?? 30%), with acceptable predictive power to estimate air pollution changes. We illustrate that air pollutant levels can effectively be controlled and predicted when flexible lockdown measures are implemented.

The method was tested on the publicly available SARS-CoV-2 CT-Scan dataset that not only provides scans of COVID patients but also of patients with other lung conditions. The results obtained indicate that the radiological features of COVID patients largely overlap with those of other lung diseases.

In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence has been reported in specific regions, but an extensive nationwide study has not been reported. Here, we report a nationwide study to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the population of KSA during the pandemic, using serum samples from healthy blood donors, non-COVID patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) in six different regions of the kingdom, with addition samples from COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 11,703 serum samples were collected from different regions of the KSA including; 5395 samples from residual healthy blood donors (D); 5877 samples from non-COVID patients collected through residual sera at clinical biochemistry labs from non-COVID patients (P); and 400 samples from consented HCWs. To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, all serum samples, in addition to positive control sera from RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients, were subjected to in-house ELISA with a sample pooling strategy, which was further validated by testing individual samples that make up some of the pools, with a statistical estimation method to report seroprevalence estimates. RESULTS: Overall (combining D and P groups) seroprevalence estimate was around 11% in Saudi Arabia; and was 5.1% (Riyadh), 1.5% (Jazan), 18.4% (Qassim), 20.8% (Hail), 14.7% (ER; Alahsa), and 18.8% in Makkah. Makkah samples were only D group and had a rate of 24.4% and 12.8% in the cities of Makkah and Jeddah, respectively. The seroprevalence in Saudi Arabia across the sampled areas would be 12 times the reported COVID-19 infection rate. Among HCWs, 7.5% (4.95-10.16 CI 95%) had reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 without reporting any previously confirmed infection. This was higher in HCWs with hypertension.

Public health has recognized these patients as immunocompromised. SCD patients may be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection due to their underlying pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic state, splenic dysfunction and secondary organopathies. Descriptions about disease severity and mortality rates in SCD vary widely. From the SECURE-SCD registry, Mucalo et al. recently reported a 0.3% and 4.7% mortality rate in children and adults, respectively. In the French registry, Arlet and colleagues reported a 2.4% death rate among those hospitalized with COVID-19 and SCD, not different from the general population. As a result, the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates among the SCD population remain uncertain. Objectives The primary objectives of our study are to describe the epidemiology, baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes of SCD patients with COVID-19 infection in the province of Quebec. In addition, we aim to identify risk factors for hospitalization and severe forms of COVID-19. Methods We built a web-based SCD-COVID-19 registry regrouping 7 adult and 4 paediatric tertiary care hospitals in the province of Quebec in June 2020. All SCD patients with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR test were included in the study. We compared the prevalence of infection and hospitalization rates of SCD patients to the general population of Quebec using the epidemiological data from the INSPQ (National Institute of Public Health of Quebec) public database. We retrospectively analyzed data included between March 11, 2020 to March 1, 2021. Relative risk was calculated using bilateral association measures (exact fisher, mid-p or chi-squared tests, as appropriate) to compare the incidence of infection and hospitalization of SCD patients to the population of Quebec and to assess risk factors of hospitalization among SCD patients. Results During the first 12 months of the pandemic, 74 patients were included in the registry. The male to female ratio was 1:1.12. Median age was 23 years, ranging from 8 months to 68 years old. SS-Sbeta 0 genotypes were present in 51% of cases, while 49% were SC or Sbeta +. The majority of patients were on disease modifying therapy: 54% were on hydroxyurea and 17.5% on exchange transfusion therapy. The incidence of reported COVID-19 infection was significantly higher in SCD patients compared to the general population (4.9% vs. 3.5% p=0,002) (Table 1). Even more strikingly, SCD had rate of hospitalization 10-times greater than the general population (33.8 vs 3.2%, p<0,001). Nevertheless, the risk of admission to the intensive care unit was similar between SCD patients and the general population (24.0% vs. 24.1%, p=0.99). No death was recorded amongst SCD patients with COVID-19 compared to a death rate in the general population in Quebec of less than 70 years old of 48-78 for 100 000 infections (male-female). A history of acute chest syndrome (ACS) in the last year (OR 2.6 [1.5-4.6], p=0.04) and arterial hypertension (OR 3.3 [2.3-4.8], p=0.01) were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization (Table 2). On the other hand, there was no statistically significant association with age, sex, genotype, ABO blood group, baseline SCD therapy, or other comorbidities (chronic renal disease, obesity, pulmonary hypertension, chronic lung disease and previous admission to ICU) in our cohort. Conclusions Similar to other reports, we found that SCD patients were at much greater risk of hospitalization compared to the general population. We however found no increased risk of mortality or disease complication. This contrasts with results from other registries. A history of ACS and hypertension were associated with a higher risk of hospitalization. Whether social determinants of health could explain some of the outcome variability between different countries merit further investigation. Furthermore, we believe that registries are critical to monitor the impact of preventive measures. As vaccination is ongoing, it will be important to consider its impact on hospitalization and death rate among SCD population. Recruitment to the registry is ongoing and updated data will be presented at the meeting.

In paediatric emergency departments (PEDs), 41C79% of attendances are non-urgent. Nevertheless, parents and primary care practitioners continue to view PEDs as an appropriate place to seek treatment for minor ailments, with a common reason being its convenience in performing laboratory and radiological investigations in the same location. Resource utilisation is a commonly used measure of appropriateness of an attendance, and is a suitable measure in the unique paediatric population.ObjectivesOur study aims to assess the appropriateness of PED attendances in a multi-ethnic Asian population, and identify predictors of inappropriate attendances (IAs). To our knowledge, no similar study has been performed in a multi-ethnic Asian population. This will allow identification of gaps in our healthcare system that can be addressed to decrease the proportion of inappropriate PED attendances. In the COVID-19 era, we also aim to review how these trends have changed in a pandemic.MethodsA retrospective study was performed on all attendances to the largest PED in Singapore from 1 January to 31 July 2019 and 2020. A total of 153,631 visits were included for analysis.Attendances were classified into appropriate or inappropriate depending on resources used and eventual disposition. An appropriate attendance (AA) was defined as fulfilling any of the following criteria: (1) investigated in emergency department (excluding urine studies in children aged 3 years and older);(2) treated in emergency department (excluding basic enteral anti-pyretic medications, prescription medications, or performing of simple procedures);or (3) admitted to the inpatient ward or discharged with specialist follow-up. All other attendances were hence classified as inappropriate attendances (IAs).Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of inappropriate attendances.ResultsA total of 31,657 attendances (20.6%) were classified as inappropriate attendances. On multivariate analysis, the three most significant factors predicting inappropriate attendances were lower triage acuity (P3 vs P1, OR 37.37, 95%CI 27.73C50.36), mode of arrival (self vs ambulance or police escort, OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.60C1.94), and first visits (re-attendance within 72 hours vs first visit, OR 0.56, 95%CI 0.50C0.64). Attendances in 2020 decreased by 40.2% from 2019, with a smaller proportion of inappropriate attendances in 2020 (21.7% in 2019 vs 18.8% in 2020, p < 0.001).

While expanded testing is laudable, measurement error and selection bias are the two greatest problems limiting our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic; neither can be fully addressed by increased testing capacity. In this paper, we demonstrate their impact on estimation of point prevalence and the effective reproduction number. We show that estimates based on the millions of molecular tests in the US has the same mean square error as a small simple random sample. To address this, a procedure is presented that combines case-count data and random samples over time to estimate selection propensities based on key covariate information. We then combine these selection propensities with epidemiological forecast models to construct a doubly robust estimation method that accounts for both measurement-error and selection bias. This method is then applied to estimate Indiana's prevalence using case-count, hospitalization, and death data with demographic information, a statewide random molecular sample collected from April 25--29th, and Facebook's COVID-19 symptom survey.

These patients commonly have associated diabetes and cardiovascular disease, with high rates of cardiovascular-related death. Management of ESKD requires renal replacement therapy via dialysis or transplantation. While transplantation provides the greatest improvement in survival and quality of life, the vast majority of patients are treated initially with hemodialysis. However, outcomes differ significantly among patient populations. Barriers in access to care have particularly affected at-risk populations, such as Black and Hispanic patients. These patients receive less pre-ESKD nephrology care, are less likely to initiate dialysis with a fistula, and wait longer for transplants-even in pediatric populations. Priorities for ESKD care moving into the future include increasing access to nephrology care in underprivileged populations, providing patient-centered care based on each patient's \\"life plan,\\" and focusing on team-based approaches to ESKD care.

The study of evolutionarily adaptive animal behavior (i.e., ethology) suggests that humanCanimal behaviors can be considered as a plausible solution in designing and building models of ethorobotsincluding modeling the inter-species bond between domesticated animals and humans. Evidence shows that people assign emotional feelings and personality characteristics to animal species leading to cooperation and communicationcrucial for designing social robots such as companion robots. Because dogs have excellent social skills with humans, current research applies humanCdog relationships as a template to understand HRA. Our goal of this article is twofold. First, we overview the research on how humanCdog interactions are implemented as prototypes of non-human social companions in HRA. Second, we review research about attitudes that humans have for interacting with robotic dogs based on their appearance and behavior, the implications for forming attachments, and humanCanimal interactions in the rising sphere of robot-assisted therapy. The rationale for this review is to provide a new perspective to facilitate future research among biologists, psychologists, and engineerscontributing to the creation of innovative research practices for studying social behaviors and its implications for society addressing HRA.","output":"HumanCdog relationships as a working framework for exploring humanCrobot attachment: a multidisciplinary review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. Notably, patients with advanced GC have a poor prognosis and quality of life, prompting the need for further studies on its prognostic markers. Among these, albumin and D-dimer are often used as prognostic factors in the prediction of a variety of tumors. Moreover, the albumin to D-dimer ratio (ADR) may be an improved predictor of chemotherapy effect and survival compared to albumin and D-dimer alone, but few studies have investigated this issue. Thus, we explored the relationship between pretreatment ADR and prognosis in advanced GC treated with first-line chemotherapy. A total of 247 advanced unresectable GC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy were retrospectively included. The cut-off value for ADR was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ADR had a cut-off value of 41.64. Compared to albumin and D-dimer alone, ADR had the highest area under curve (AUC) value (AUC = 0.730), followed by albumin (AUC = 0.659) and D-dimer (AUC = 0.719). Additionally, we found that patients with a low ADR (<41.64) had a lower disease control rate (77.9% vs. 92.5%, P < 0.01), shorter overall survival (OS) (271 vs. 389 days), and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (118 vs. 192 days) than patients with a high ADR (41.64). Similar results were also found on subgroup analysis, and ADR was found to be an independent advanced GC prognostic factor on multivariate analysis (all P < 0.001). Low ADR was found to be correlated with poor therapeutic effects of chemotherapy and shortened OS and PFS. Therefore, pretreatment ADR may be a useful tool for predicting the effect of chemotherapy and prognosis in advanced GC patients treated with first-line chemotherapy.","output":"Prognostic Value of Albumin to D-Dimer Ratio in Advanced Gastric Cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/purpose C Higher education institutions worldwide rapidly switched to emergency remote teaching with a sustainable quality education approach in response to the global health threat caused by the COVID-19 virus.

This study aims to discuss the potential effects of emergency remote teaching due to COVID-19 on disadvantaged students in higher education. Materials/methods C This study is a review article, which presents a brief literature review on the potential impact of emergency remote teaching due to COVID-19 on disadvantaged students in higher education. Practical implications C This study may help to provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for potential future work on the impact of emergency remote teaching in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on disadvantaged groups. From this perspective, the potential effect of emergency remote teaching on disadvantaged students in higher education is examined and recommendations put forwards for solutions aimed at educational administrators and decision-makers. Conclusion C The emergency remote teaching put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the widening of the digital divide among higher education students. Therefore, integrating the digital and distance education approach into the higher education system correctly and effectively may both facilitate the achievement of instructional goals and also help to eliminate digital inequality in the higher education student population.

This study uses primary data and the unit of analysis is 200 respondents of Bank Bukopin customers who are users of its internet and mobile banking services with a replication of the technology acceptance model (TAM) in the context of internet service adoption and mobile banking. This study uses non-probability sampling with purposive sampling technique, and to analyze the research model, the Partial Least Square (PLS) method is used with the SmartPLS 3.0 M3 program as a tool. The research findings indicate that the intention to reuse is directly affected significantly by perceived ease of use, trustworthiness, and attitude to use. Perceived benefits do not have a significant effect on directly affecting intention to use, but have a positive and significant effect if they get a mediating role from the attitude of using. This study proves the existence of a mediating role for perceived benefits and beliefs on attitudes to use. This study also strengthens the evidence that attitudes have a strong and positive and significant effect on intention to reuse, and are able to fully mediate the effect of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and trust on intention to reuse.

In contrast to classical block decompositions such as the ones in JPEG, the global inpainting problem is solved without creating block artefacts. We consider the popular homogeneous diffusion inpainting and supplement it with a multilevel version of an optimised restricted additive Schwarz (ORAS) method that solves the local problems with a conjugate gradient algorithm.

The adaptive cytotoxic T response is critical during primary infection and the generation of long-term protection. Potential epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome were predicted for 2,915 human alleles of 71 HLA class I families. Allele families showed extreme differences in number of recognized epitopes, underscoring genetic variability of protective capacity between humans. Up to 1,222 epitopes were associated with any of the twelve supertypes, that is, allele clusters covering 90% population. Among them, the B27 supertype showed the lowest number of epitopes. Epitope escape mutations identified in ~118,000 NCBI isolates mainly involved non-conservative substitutions at the second and C-terminal position of the ligand core, or total ligand removal by large recurrent deletions. Escape mutations affected 47% of supertype epitopes, which in 21% of cases concerned isolates from two or more sub-continental areas. Some of these changes were coupled, but never surpassed 15% evaded epitopes for the same supertype in the same isolate, except for B27, which reached up to 33%. In contrast to most supertypes, eight particular allele families mostly contained alleles with few SARS-CoV-2 ligands. Isolates harboring cytotoxic escape mutations for these families co-existed geographically within sub-Saharan and Asian populations enriched in these alleles. Collectively, these data indicate that independent escape mutation events have already occurred for half of HLA class I supertype epitopes. However, it is presently unlikely that, overall, it poses a threat to the global population. In contrast, single and double mutations for susceptible alleles may be associated with viral selective pressure and alarming local outbreaks. This study highlights the automated integration of genomic, geographical and immunoinformatic information for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants potentially affecting the population as a whole, as well as minority subpopulations. AUTHOR SUMMARY The cytotoxic T response, a type of immune response dependent upon an individual's genetics that does not require antibodies, is critical for neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection. The potential bypass of the cytotoxic T response by mutations acquired by the virus after one year of the pandemic is therefore of maximal concern. We have approached the complexity of human variability and more than 100.000 viral genomes in this respect using a computational strategy. We have detected numerous mutations in these genomes that mask some viral regions involved in the cytotoxic response. However, the accumulation of these changes in independent isolates is still too low to threaten the global human population. In contrast, our protocol has identified mutations that may be relevant for specific populations and minorities with cytotoxic genetic backgrounds susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some viral variants co-existed in the same country with these human communities which warrants deeper surveillance in these cases to prevent local outbreaks. Our study support the integration of massive data of different natures in the surveillance of viral pandemics.","output":"Predicted Impact of the Viral Mutational Landscape on the Cytotoxic Response against SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Will there be another thriving twenties, as there was in the previous century?

The existing bimodal and trimodal sensors correspond to particular cases of those interference sensors. A thorough study of the properties of the multimode waveguide section provided a deeper insight into the behavior of this class of sensors, which allowed us to establish new criteria for designing more sensitive structures. Other challenges of using high-order modes within the sensing area of the device reside in the excitation of these modes and the interpretation of the output signal. To overcome these, we developed a novel structure to excite any desired high-order mode along with the fundamental mode within the sensing section, while maintaining a fine control over the power distribution between them. A new strategy to detect and interpret the output signal is also presented in detail. Finally, we designed a high-order sensor for which numerical simulations showed a theoretical limit of detection of 1.910-7 RIU, making this device the most sensitive multimode interference sensor reported so far.","output":"High-Order Multimode Waveguide Interferometer for Optical Biosensing Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2020 Covid-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on Higher Education (HE) libraries, requiring them to rapidly overhaul their services and accelerating the shift to digital in a short space of time One of the most significant challenges has been how to provide students and other library users with continued access to resources previously only available in print, when libraries have been closed or are operating with restrictions in place that limit access to the physical library space This has led many libraries to increase investment in digital content to better support students in the current climate This article shares the perspective from Edge Hill University in the UK and focuses on work undertaken by the library to implement university-wide e-textbook access for the first time The article explores some of the barriers the library has faced sourcing textbooks and concludes by reflecting on how 2020 may shape the library's purchasing strategies in a post-pandemic information landscape","output":"Transforming library collections in a pandemic: the perspective from Edge Hill University"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the aim of contributing to the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), numerous strategies have been proposed.

A new competitive numerical platform specifically for designing microfluidic-integrated biosensors is developed and presented in this work. Properties of the biosensor, sample, buffer fluid and even the microfluidic channel can be modified in this model. This feature provides the scientific community with the ability to design a specific biosensor for requested point-of-care (POC) applications. First, the validation of the presented numerical platform against experimental data and then results and discussion, highlighting the important role of the design parameters on the performance of the biosensor is presented. For the latter, the baseline case has been set on the previous studies on the biosensors suitable for SARS-CoV, which has the highest similarity to the 2019 nCoV. Subsequently, the effects of concentration of the targeted molecules in the sample, installation position and properties of the biosensor on its performance were investigated in 11 case studies. The presented numerical framework provides an insight into understanding of the virus reaction in the design process of the biosensor and enhances our preparation for any future outbreaks.

The therapeutic effect of dexamethasone may be related to its ability to improve cortical function. Recent study showed that dexamethasone can reduce COVID-19 deaths by up to one third in critically ill patients. The aim of this article is to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 can attack the adrenal cortex to aggravate the relative adrenal insufficiency. METHODS: We summarized the clinical features of COVID-19 reported in currently available observational studies. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression was examined in human adrenal glands by immunohistochemical staining. We retrospectively analyzed serum cortisol levels in critically ill patients with or without COVID-19. RESULTS: High percentage of critically ill patients with SARS-COV-2 infection in the study were treated with vasopressors. ACE2 receptor and TMPRSS2 serine protease were colocalized in adrenocortical cells in zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. We collected plasma cortisol concentrations in nine critically ill patients with COVID-19. The cortisol levels of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were lower than those in non-COVID-19 critically ill group. Six of the nine COVID-19 critically ill patients had random plasma cortisol concentrations below 10 g/dl, which met the criteria for the diagnosis of CIRCI. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are colocalized in adrenocortical cells, and that the cortisol levels are lower in critically ill patients with COVID-19 as compared to those of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. Based on our findings, we recommend measuring plasma cortisol level to guide hormonal therapy.","output":"The Adrenal Cortex, an Underestimated Site of SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Alphavirus nsP3 phosphoprotein is essential for virus replication and functions initially within polyprotein P123 or P23 components of the short-lived minus-strand replicase, and upon polyprotein cleavage, mature nsP3 likely functions also in plus-strand synthesis.

The ts138 mutant possessed a change of G4303 to C, predicting an Ala68-to-Gly alteration that altered a conserved His-Ala-Val tripeptide in the ancient (pre-eukaryotic), \\"X\\" or histone 2A phosphoesterase-like macrodomain that in SIN encompasses nsP3 residues 1 to 161 and whose role is unknown. We undertook comparative analysis of three nsP3 N-terminal region mutants and observed (i) that nsP3 and nsP2 functioned initially as a single unit as deduced from complementation analysis and in agreement with our previous studies, (ii) that the degree of phosphorylation varied among the nsP3 mutants, and (iii) that reduced phosphorylation of nsP3 correlated with reduced minus-strand synthesis. The most striking phenotype was exhibited by ts4 (Ala268 to Val), which after shift to 40 degrees C made significantly underphosphorylated P23/nsP3 and lost selectively the ability to make minus strands. After shift to 40 degrees C, mutant ts7 (Phe312 to Ser) made phosphorylated P23/nsP3 and minus strands but failed to increase plus-strand synthesis. Macrodomain mutant ts138 was intermediate, making at 40 degrees C partially phosphorylated P23/nsP3 and reduced amounts of minus strands. The mutants were able to assemble their nsPs at 40 degrees C into complexes that were membrane associated.

Both laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair (LIHR) and open repair still exist concurrently with no consensus on gold standard treatment at present. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate our initial experience with LIHR in paediatric patients. METHODS A retrospective observational cohort study of all paediatric patients that underwent LIHR in our institution was performed. Intraoperative and postoperative outcomes were examined. RESULTS During the study period, 102 patients were scheduled for LIHR. The majority (76.5%) were male with a median age of 5 months. Thirty two patients (31.4%) were neonates at the time of surgery. The majority of cases (83.3%) were elective procedures. There were no instances of intraoperative vascular or visceral injury. Most patients underwent surgery as a day case. Eighteen patients underwent bilateral LIHR. The recurrence rate was 1.9%. These occurred in the first two patients to undergo LIHR, after which no recurrences were observed following a modification of the technique. The overall complication rate was 7.1%, most of which were managed conservatively. CONCLUSION Paediatric LIHR is a safe, feasible and effective procedure that is associated with a short inpatient length of stay, a low recurrence rate and low postoperative complication rate.

Here, we report the first case of severe H5N6 pneumonia successfully treated by sirolimus and NAIs. Case Description A 22-year-old man developed high fever and chills on September 24, 2018 (Day-0) and was hospitalized on Day-3. Influenza A (H5N6) was identified on Day-6 from a throat swab specimen. Despite the administration of NAIs and other supportive measures, the patient's clinical conditions and lung images showed continued deterioration, accompanied by persistently high viral titers. Consequently, sirolimus administration (rapamycin; 2 mg per day for 14 days) was started on Day-12. His PaO2/FiO2 values and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score gradually improved, and imaging outcomes revealed the resolution of bilateral lung infiltrations.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the acinar airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the acinar airways. While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid to how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells. The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles. For this purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Particle size distribution, breathing parameters supposing normal breathing through the nose, and viral loads were taken from the literature. We found that the probability of direct infection of the acinar airways due to inhalation of particles emitted by a bystander cough is very low. As the number of viruses deposited in the extrathoracic airways is about 7 times higher than in the acinar airways, we concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less dangerous. The period between the onset of initial symptoms and the potential clinical deterioration could provide an opportunity for prevention of pneumonia by blocking or significantly reducing the transport of viruses towards the acinar airways. Therefore, even non-specific treatment forms like disinfection of the throat and nasal and oral mucosa may effectively keep the viral load of the upper airways low enough to avoid or prolong the progression of the disease. In addition, using a tissue or cloth in order to absorb droplets and aerosol particles emitted by own coughs of infected patients before re-inhalation is highly recommended even if they are alone in quarantine.","output":"Deposition distribution of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in the human airways upon exposure to cough-generated droplets and aerosol particles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive research has demonstrated the transactional nature of parent-child psychopathology, with limited studies examining these effects during late adolescence and none, to our knowledge, longitudinally during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Follow-up analyses indicated different patterns when examining depressive and anxiety symptoms separately. The results highlight complex family dynamics between adolescents and their parents and begin to differentiate how individual characteristics impact the response to a significant life event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Transactional Associations Between Parent and Late Adolescent Internalizing Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Moderating Role of Avoidant Coping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In every age group, urinary tract infection (UTI) is found as a major recurrence infectious disorder.

Advanced digital manipulation tools and techniques make it easier to generate fake content and post it on social media. In addition, tweets with deep fake content make their way to social platforms. The polarity of such tweets is significant to determine the sentiment of people about deep fakes. This paper presents a deep learning model to predict the polarity of deep fake tweets. For this purpose, a stacked bi-directional long short-term memory (SBi-LSTM) network is proposed to classify the sentiment of deep fake tweets. Several well-known machine learning classifiers are investigated as well such as support vector machine, logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, extra tree classifier, and AdaBoost classifier. These classifiers are utilized with term frequency-inverse document frequency and a bag of words feature extraction approaches. Besides, the performance of deep learning models is analyzed including long short-term memory network, gated recurrent unit, bi-direction LSTM, and convolutional neural network+LSTM. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBi-LSTM outperforms both machine and deep learning models and achieves an accuracy of 0.92.","output":"Deepfake tweets classification using stacked Bi-LSTM and words embedding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present paper, I intend to systematically revisit Thomas Luckmanns account of the relation between phenomenology and sociology and to assess its strengths and weaknesses in terms of constructive criticism.

Damage to the respiratory and pulmonary systems are the most evident toxic side effects although the causes of these symptoms remain unclear. Conversely, the effects on other organs remain largely under-explored, limiting our understanding of the long-term volcanic ash-related risk at the whole-body scale. The metallome i.e. metal concentrations and isotopic compositions within the body, is suspected to be affected by volcanic ash exposure, having thus the potential for capturing some specificities of ash toxicity. However, the means by and extent to which the metallome is affected at the entire body scale and how the consequent chemical and isotopic deregulations correlate with pathophysiological dysfunctions are currently poorly understood. Here, we adopt a transdisciplinary approach combining high precision chemical analyses (major and trace element concentrations) and CuZn isotope measurements in seven organs and two biological fluids of isogenic mice (C57BL/6) exposed to eruption products from La Soufrire de Guadeloupe (Eastern Carribean), in tandem with biological parameters including physiological and morphological data. Based on principal component analysis, we show that after one month of exposure to volcanic ash deposits, the mice metallome; originally organ-specific and isotopically-typified, is highly disrupted as shown for example by heavy metal accumulation in testis (e.g., Fe, Zn) and Cu, Zn isotopic divergence in liver, intestine and blood. These metallomic variations are correlated with early testicular defects and might reflect the warning signs of premature (entero)hepatic impairments that may seriously affect fertility and favor the emergence of liver diseases after prolonged exposure. Monitoring the temporal evolution of the Cu and Zn isotope compositions seems to be a promising technique to identify the main biological processes and vital functions that are vulnerable to environmental volcanogenic pollutants although this will require further validation on human subjects.","output":"Metallome deregulation and health-related impacts due to long-term exposure to recent volcanic ash deposits: New chemical and isotopic insights"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a crucial intracellular second messenger molecule that converts extracellular molecules to intracellular signal transduction pathways generating cell- and stimulus-specific effects.

Here we tested the extracts from traditional Chinese medicine, Forsythia suspense seeds, which have been used for more than 2000 years to relieve respiratory symptoms. Using structural-functional analysis we found its major lignin, Forsynthin, acted as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting PDE4 in inflammatory and immune cell. Moreover, several novel, selective small molecule derivatives of Forsythin were tested in vitro and in murine models of viral and bacterial pneumonia, sepsis and cytokine-driven systemic inflammation.

It was reported that HCQ induced psychiatric symptoms in a few patients with autoimmune diseases, but it is still uncertain whether HCQ poses a risk to mental health. Therefore, in this study, we treated healthy mice with two different doses of HCQ that are comparable to clinically administered doses for 7 days. Psychiatric-like behaviors and the expression of related molecules in the brain were evaluated at two time points, i.e., 24 h and 10 days after drug administration. We found that HCQ increased anxiety behavior at both 24 h and 10 days. Furthermore, HCQ decreased the mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta, corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh), a serotonin transporter (Slc6a4), and a microglia maker (Aif1) in the hippocampus and decreased the mRNA expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in both the hippocampus and amygdala. Lots of these behavioral and molecular changes were sustained beyond 10 days after drug administration, and some of them were dose-dependent. Although this animal study does not prove that HCQ has a similar effect in humans, it indicates that HCQ poses a significant risk to mental health and suggests that further clinical investigation is essential.

In this paper, we study the impact of social distancing on epidemics for which it is executable. We use a mathematical model combining human mobility and disease spreading. For the mobility dynamics, we design an agent based model consisting of pedestrian dynamics with a novel type of force to resemble social distancing in crowded sites. For the spreading dynamics, we consider the compartmental SIE dynamics plus an indirect transmission with the footprints of the infectious pedestrians being the contagion factor. We show that the increase in the intensity of social distancing has a significant effect on the exposure risk. By classifying the population into social distancing abiders and non-abiders, we conclude that the practice of social distancing, even by a minority of potentially infectious agents, results in a drastic change on the population exposure risk, but reduces the effectiveness of the protocols when practiced by the rest of the population. Furthermore, we observe that for contagions which the indirect transmission is more significant, the effectiveness of social distancing would be reduced.

S. aureus was detected more frequently in tampons that did not require an applicator for their insertion (74/233 [32%] versus 90/381 [24%]; OR=1.51 [95% CI 1.04-2.17]) and in women who used an intrauterine device for contraception (53/155 [34%] versus 145/572 [27%]; OR =1.53 [95% CI 1.05-2.24]). The S. aureus strains isolated from tampons belonged to 22 different clonal complexes (CCs). The most prevalent CC was CC398 agr1 (n=57, 27%), a clone that does not produce superantigenic toxins, followed by CC30 agr 3 (n=27, 13%) producing TSST-1 (24/27 [89%]), the principal clone of S. aureus involved in menstrual toxic shock syndrome.IMPORTANCE Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (MTSS) is an uncommon severe acute disease that occurs in healthy menstruating women colonized by TSST-1-producing S. aureus who use intravaginal protection, such as tampons and menstrual cups. The catamenial product collected by the protection serves as a growth medium for S. aureus and allows TSST-1 production. Previous studies evaluated the prevalence of genital colonization by S. aureus by vaginal swabbing, but they did not examine tampon colonization. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of tampon colonization by S. aureus, and the presence of the CC30 TSST-1 S. aureus clone responsible for MTSS in tampons from healthy women. The results support the vaginal carriage of this lineage in healthy women. In addition, the higher prevalence of S. aureus within tampons that do not require an applicator indicates a crucial role of hand-washing before tampon handling to decrease the risk of tampon contamination.","output":"Vaginal tampon colonization by Staphylococcus aureus in healthy women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Translation control is crucial during virusChost interaction. On one hand, viruses completely rely on the protein synthesis machinery of host cells to propagate and have evolved various mechanisms to redirect the host's ribosomes toward their viral mRNAs. On the other hand, the host rewires its translation program in an attempt to contain and suppress the virus early on during infection; the antiviral program includes specific control on protein synthesis to translate several antiviral mRNAs involved in quenching the infection. As the infection progresses, host translation is in turn inhibited in order to limit viral propagation. We have learnt of very diverse strategies that both parties utilize to gain or retain control over the protein synthesis machinery. Yet novel strategies continue to be discovered, attesting for the importance of mRNA translation in virusChost interaction. This review focuses on recently described translation strategies employed by both hosts and viruses.

Social restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic have stressed AYA relationships and may cut them off from sources of support. AYA have been shown to respond to relationship stressors with behaviors that increase STI risk. This work examines whether relationship stressors (jealousy and worry about the relationship) exacerbate violence and STI risk among urban AYA during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsParticipants from four sexual and reproductive health studies in Baltimore, Maryland (USA) were invited to complete a cross-sectional telephone survey on relationship experiences/sexual behavior during the pandemic. March 16, 2020 stay-at-home order was used to define the pandemic period. Partner support, jealousy, worry about the relationship making it through the pandemic, current DV, change in DV during pandemic, and condom use at last sex were evaluated using regression analyses. Data collection is still underway in 2021.ResultsOf 194 participants surveyed, mean (sd) age 22.7 (2.8) years, 61% were in a romantic/sexual relationship. Of these, 14% reported current TDV, 6% experienced an increase in DV, 66% did not use a condom at last sex. AYA who worried their relationship would not make it through the pandemic were more likely to experience DV (OR: 5.64, 95%CI: 1.69, 18.9). AYA who felt jealous of other people their partner was talking to/hanging out with during the pandemic were more likely to experience DV (OR: 4.51, 95%CI: 1.39, 14.6). Greater partner support was associated with experiencing less DV (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.56, 0.90). Relationship stressors were not associated with condom use.ConclusionsRelationship insecurity exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase risk for DV among AYA.

A nationwide lockdown of two months imposed across India amid COVID-19 led to a dramatic decline in major sources of emissions except for household, mainly from cooking. This initially led to declined levels of CO in two of the largest megacities of India, Delhi and Mumbai under stable weather conditions, followed by a distinctly different variability under the influence of prevailing mesoscale circulation. We hereby trace the sources of CO from local emissions to transport pathways and interpret the observed variability in CO using the interactive WRF-Chem model and back trajectory analysis. For this purpose, COVID-19 emission inventory of CO has been estimated. Model results indicate a significant contribution from externally generated CO in Delhi from surrounding regions and an unusual peak on 17th May amid lockdown due to long range transport from the source region of biofuel emissions in central India. However, the oceanic winds played a larger role in keeping CO levels in check in a coastal megacity Mumbai which otherwise has high CO emissions from household sources due to a larger share of urban slums.

The importance of transmission via the eyes is unknown but might plausibly be reduced in those who wear glasses. Previous studies have mainly focussed on protective eyewear in healthcare settings. Methods Participants from the Virus Watch prospective community cohort study in England and Wales responded to a questionnaire on the use of glasses and contact lenses. This included frequency of use, purpose, and likelihood of wearing a mask with glasses. Infection was confirmed through data linkage with Second Generation Surveillance System (Pillar 1 and Pillar 2), weekly questionnaires to self-report positive polymerase chain reaction or lateral flow results, and, for a subgroup, monthly capillary blood testing for antibodies (nucleocapsid and spike). A multivariable logistic regression model, controlling for age, sex, income and occupation, was used to identify odds of infection depending on the frequency and purpose of using glasses or contact lenses. Findings 19,166 Virus Watch participants responded to the questionnaire, with 13,681 (71.3%, CI 70.7-72.0) reporting they wore glasses. A multivariable logistic regression model showed a 15% lower odds of infection for those who reported using glasses always for general use (OR 0.85, 95% 0.77-0.95, p = 0.002) compared to those who never wore glasses.

Evaluating unexplained increases in deaths due to all causes or attributed to nonspecific outcomes, such as pneumonia and influenza, can provide a more complete picture of the burden of COVID-19. Objective To estimate the burden of all deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States from March to May 2020. Design, Setting, and Population This observational study evaluated the numbers of US deaths from any cause and deaths from pneumonia, influenza, and/or COVID-19 from March 1 through May 30, 2020, using public data of the entire US population from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). These numbers were compared with those from the same period of previous years. All data analyzed were accessed on June 12, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Increases in weekly deaths due to any cause or deaths due to pneumonia/influenza/COVID-19 above a baseline, which was adjusted for time of year, influenza activity, and reporting delays. These estimates were compared with reported deaths attributed to COVID-19 and with testing data. Results There were approximately 781 000 total deaths in the United States from March 1 to May 30, 2020, representing 122 300 (95% prediction interval, 116 800-127 000) more deaths than would typically be expected at that time of year. There were 95 235 reported deaths officially attributed to COVID-19 from March 1 to May 30, 2020. The number of excess all-cause deaths was 28% higher than the official tally of COVID-19-reported deaths during that period. In several states, these deaths occurred before increases in the availability of COVID-19 diagnostic tests and were not counted in official COVID-19 death records. There was substantial variability between states in the difference between official COVID-19 deaths and the estimated burden of excess deaths. Conclusions and Relevance Excess deaths provide an estimate of the full COVID-19 burden and indicate that official tallies likely undercount deaths due to the virus. The mortality burden and the completeness of the tallies vary markedly between states.","output":"Estimation of Excess Deaths Associated With the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States, March to May 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We demonstrate PI2, the first notebook extension that can automatically generate interactive visualization interfaces during SQL-based analyses.","output":"Demonstration of PI2: Interactive Visualization Interface Generation for SQL Analysis in Notebook"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented surprise, to say the least.

As a convergence of health care, artificial intelligence, and information and communication technologies, personalized health care services that are developed under the concept of digital twins raise a myriad of ethical issues. Although some of the ethical issues are known to researchers working on digital health and personalized medicine, currently, there is no comprehensive review that maps the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to fill the research gap by identifying the major ethical risks of digital twins for personalized health care services. We first propose a working definition for digital twins for personalized health care services to facilitate future discussions on the ethical issues related to these emerging digital health services. We then develop a process-oriented ethical map to identify the major ethical risks in each of the different data processing phases. METHODS: We resorted to the literature on eHealth, personalized medicine, precision medicine, and information engineering to identify potential issues and developed a process-oriented ethical map to structure the inquiry in a more systematic way. The ethical map allows us to see how each of the major ethical concerns emerges during the process of transforming raw data into valuable information. Developers of a digital twin for personalized health care service may use this map to identify ethical risks during the development stage in a more systematic way and can proactively address them. RESULTS: This paper provides a working definition of digital twins for personalized health care services by identifying 3 features that distinguish the new application from other eHealth services. On the basis of the working definition, this paper further layouts 10 major operational problems and the corresponding ethical risks. CONCLUSIONS: It is challenging to address all the major ethical risks that a digital twin for a personalized health care service might encounter proactively without a conceptual map at hand. The process-oriented ethical map we propose here can assist the developers of digital twins for personalized health care services in analyzing ethical risks in a more systematic manner.","output":"Ethical Issues of Digital Twins for Personalized Health Care Service: Preliminary Mapping Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glycyrrhiza glabra is an important medicinal plant throughout the world. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid that is among the most important secondary metabolites produced by liquorice. Drought stress is proposed to enhance the levels of secondary metabolites. In this study, the effect of drought stress on the expression of important genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway was examined. Drought stress at the seedling stage was applied to 8-day-old plants using polyethylene glycol. Subsequently, the samples were collected 0, 4, 8 or 24 h post-treatment. At the adult plant stage, 10-month-old plants were subjected to drought stress by discontinuing irrigation. Subsequently, samples were collected at 2, 16 and 28 days after drought imposition (S(2d), S(16d) and S(28d), respectively). We performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays to evaluate the gene expression levels of sequalene synthase (SQS), -amyrin synthase (bAS), lupeol synthase (LUS) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS) during stress. Finally, the glycyrrhizin content of stolons was determined via HPLC. The results revealed that due to osmotic stress, the gene expression levels of SQS and bAS were increased, whereas those of CAS were relatively unchanged at the seedling stage. At the adult plant stage, the expression levels of SQS and bAS were increased under drought stress conditions, whereas the gene expression level of CAS remained relatively constant. The glycyrrhizin content in stolons was increased only under severe drought stress conditions (S(28d)). Our results indicate that application of controlled drought stress up-regulates the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins and directly enhances the production of secondary metabolites, including glycyrrhizin, in liquorice plants.","output":"The effect of drought stress on the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of triterpenoid saponins in liquorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Based on bioinformatics and network pharmacology, the treatment of Saussurea involucrata (SAIN) on novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was evaluated by the GEO clinical sample gene difference analysis, compound-target molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation. role in the discovery of new targets for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19, to better serve the discovery and clinical application of new drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Taking the Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database (TCMSP) as the starting point for the preliminary selection of compounds and targets, we used tools such as Cytoscape 3.8.0, TBtools 1.098, AutoDock vina, R 4.0.2, PyMol, and GROMACS to analyze the compounds of SAIN and targets were initially screened. To further screen the active ingredients and targets, we carried out genetic difference analysis (n = 72) through clinical samples of COVID-19 derived from GEO and carried out biological process (BP) analysis on these screened targets (P  0.05)., gene = 9), KEGG pathway analysis (FDR0.05, gene = 9), protein interaction network (PPI) analysis (gene = 9), and compounds-target-pathway network analysis (gene = 9), to obtain the target Point-regulated biological processes, disease pathways, and compounds-target-pathway relationships. Through the precise molecular docking between the compounds and the targets, we further screened SAIN's active ingredients (Affinity  ?7.2 kcal/mol) targets and visualized the data. After that, we performed molecular dynamics simulations and consulted a large number of related Validation of the results in the literature. RESULTS: Through the screening, analysis, and verification of the data, it was finally confirmed that there are five main active ingredients in SAIN, which are Quercitrin, Rutin, Caffeic acid, Jaceosidin, and Beta-sitosterol, and mainly act on five targets. These targets mainly regulate Tuberculosis, TNF signaling pathway, Alzheimer's disease, Pertussis, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, Influenza A, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Complement and coagulation cascades, Fructose and mannose metabolism, and Metabolic pathways, play a role in preventing or treating COVID-19. Molecular dynamics simulation results show that the four active ingredients of SAIN, Quercitrin, Rutin, Caffeic acid, and Jaceosidin, act on the four target proteins of COVID-19, AKR1B1, C5AR1, GSK3B, and IL1B to form complexes that can be very stable in the human environment.

BACKGROUND: The increased workload of health care workers in the COVID-19 pandemic affects their job performance, causes medical errors, contributes to patients' mortality and is a major concern for all health care organisations in the world. METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited 139 nurses selected from the ICUs, infectious disease wards and emergency units of two hospitals in Iran. The NASA-Task Load Index and Paterson's job performance questionnaire were used. RESULTS: Mean scores of mental workload and job performance of the nurses were 67.14  30.53 and 37.37  7.36, respectively. A total of 71.95% and 96.4% of the nurses had high mental workload and job performance levels, respectively. The results indicated a weak positive correlation between mental workload and the mean score of job performance(r = .057). Unlike the mental demand (r = .175, p = .04) and temporal demand (r = .307, p < .001) that had a significant positive correlation with job performance, frustration had a significant negative correlation with job performance (r = -.183, p = .032). The following variables explained 33% of the variance of nurses' job performance: age, gender, type of ward, working shift, experience of providing care to patients with COVID-19 and frustration. CONCLUSION: The nurses' mental workload increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the negative effect of mental workload on the nurses' behaviour and performance, the rise in their job performance and its weak positive correlation with their mental workload should be further addressed.

In total, 4788 men and women with the age range of 11C98 years from eight provinces in eastern, central and western China were included in the analysis. We adopted a tactical approach to capture three key domains of perceived psychosocial health that are more likely to occur during a pandemic including hopelessness, loneliness, and depression. Multiple regression method, binary logistic regression model and variance inflation factor (VIF) were used to conduct data analysis. RESULTS: Respectively 34.8%, 32.5% and 44.8% of the participants expressed feeling more hopeless, lonely, and depressed during the pandemic. The percentage of all three indicators was comparatively higher among women than among men: hopelessness (50.7% vs 49.3%), loneliness (52.4% vs 47.6%), and depression (56.2% vs 43.8%). Being married was associated with lower odds of loneliness among men (odds ratio [OR] = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.45C0.90). Loneliness was negatively associated with smoking (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45C0.99) and positively associated with drinking (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.04C2.02).

Deleterious effect of cytotoxic therapy, related to its immunosuppressive effect, may also be hypothesised. However, postponing or cancelling oncologic treatment, especially in younger patients with advanced and more aggressive tumors may worsen the prognosis. The case of a 39-year-old female patient is presented, who was diagnosed with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer during the pandemic. Primary systemic chemotherapy was started. The patient presented with acute respiratory tract symptoms during the fifth cycle and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was cancelled. Symptoms resolved in three days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive up to day 43. Antihormonal therapy was introduced on day 19 and she underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on day 51.

The characteristics of this cohort of patients, including the risk of bleeding and the need for systemic anticoagulation, are generally considered as relative contraindications to ECMO treatment. However, recent evidence suggests that the use of ECMO should be taken in consideration even in this group of patients. RECENT FINDINGS The recent findings suggest that venous-venous ECMO can be feasible in the treatment of refractory respiratory failure and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome trauma-related. The improvement of ECMO techniques including the introduction of centrifugal pumps and heparin-coated circuits are progressively reducing the amount of heparin required; moreover, the application of heparin-free ECMO showed good outcomes and minimal complications. Venous-arterial ECMO has emerged as a salvage intervention in patients with cardiogenic shock and after cardiac arrest. Venous-arterial ECMO provides circulatory support allowing time for other treatments to promote recovery in presence of acute cardiopulmonary failure. Only poor-quality evidence is available, for venous-arterial ECMO in trauma patients. SUMMARY ECMO can be considered as a safe rescue therapy even in trauma patients, including neurological injury, chest trauma as well as burns. However, evidence is still poor; further studies are warranted focusing on trauma patients undergoing ECMO, to better clarify the effect on survival, the type and dose of anticoagulation to use, as well as the utility of dedicated multidisciplinary trauma-ECMO units.","output":"Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation in the critical trauma patient."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanomedicine and plasma medicine are innovative and multidisciplinary research fields aiming to employ nanotechnology and gas plasma to improve health-related treatments.

We aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of critically ill COVID-19 patients and assess the impact on the use of hospital resources and compare with critically ill medical patients without COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 admitted to a private ICU in Sao Paulo, Brazil from March to June 2020. We compared these patients with those admitted to the unit in the same period of the previous year. A total of 212 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were compared with 185 medical patients from the previous year. Patients with COVID-19 were more frequently males (76% vs. 56%, p<0.001) and morbidly obese (7.5% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.027), and had lower SAPS 3 (49.65 (12.19) vs. 55.63 (11.94), p<0.001) and SOFA scores (3.78 (3.53) vs. 4.48 (3.11), p = 0.039). COVID-19 patients had a longer ICU stay (median of 7 vs. 3 days, p<0.001), longer duration of mechanical ventilation (median of 9 vs. 4 days, p = 0.003), and more frequent tracheostomies (10.8 vs. 1.1%, p<0.001). Survival rates until 28 days were not statistically different (91% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.111). After multivariable adjustment for age, gender, SAPS 3, and Charlson Comorbidity Index, COVID-19 remained not associated with survival at 28 days (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.33C1.06, p = 0.076). Among patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, the observed mortality at 28-days was 16.2% in COVID-19 patients compared to 34.6% in the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 required more hospital resources, including invasive and non-invasive ventilation, had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and a more prolonged ICU and hospital length of stay. There was no difference in all-cause mortality at 28 and 60 days, suggesting that health systems preparedness be an important determinant of clinical outcomes.","output":"Epidemiology, outcomes, and the use of intensive care unit resources of critically ill patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Sao Paulo, Brazil: A cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The soil cover of semi-desert territories is sensitive to modern climatic changes, responding to a change in the composition of soil complexes. Soil microstructure features reflect minor changes in microrelief or fluctuations in the level of groundwater. This property of soil microstructure to memorize soil formation conditions is used for subsequent characterization of changes in long-term climatic trends. But in semi-desert climates, it can be used as an indicator of short-term weather series. This article presents data collected on the territory of the Caspian Depression in the Dzhanybek Research Station of the Institute of Forest Science RAS. The soil cover of the studied site of this station is represented by a semi-desert, two-component meadow-steppe Solonetzic soil complex that strictly follows the elements of the local microtopography. The height range between the studied pits is 8 cm. The dataset includes micromorphological photographs of the state of the soil complex in 2005.

Here, we report a new CRISPR-mediated test, called CRISPR-top (CRISPR-mediated testing in one-pot), which integrates simultaneous target pre-amplification with CRISPR/cas12b-mediated detection into a one-pot reaction mixture, performed at a constant temperature. The novel CRISPR-top assay was applied to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). COVID-19 CRISPR-top targets the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and NP (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2, and operates at 59 C for 40 min with minimal instrument. The COVID-19 CRISPR-top assay can return results within 60-min and is easily interpreted by visual fluorescence or lateral flow readouts. The analytical limit of detection (LoD) for COVID-19 CRISPR-top is 10 copies (for each detection target) per reaction with no cross-reactivity observed from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. Among clinically collected non-COVID-19 samples, the assay's specificity was 100% (80/80 oropharynx swab samples). Among 52 COVID-19 positive clinical samples collected, the COVID-19 CRISPR-top assay yielded 38 (73.1%) positive results using fluorescence readout and 35 (67.3%) positive results with lateral-flow readout. These diagnostic results were similar to those obtained using RT-PCR (34 positive (65.4%)). These data indicate that COVID-19 CRISPR-top is a simple, rapid, accurate and highly sensitive method for SARS-CoV-2 detection which can be used in the clinic, field laboratories and primary care facilities in resource-challenged settings.","output":"A one-step, one-pot CRISPR nucleic acid detection platform (CRISPR-top): Application for the diagnosis of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW The aim of this article is to assess the current state of teleophthalmology given the sudden surge in telemedicine demand in response to the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive a 5-F single- or 6-F dual-lumen SBCC with (n = 42) or without (n = 42) a polyester cuff. Follow-up was performed at 2 weeks, 1 month, and 3 months or at catheter removal, whichever came first. At scheduled follow-up, catheter function, patient satisfaction, and infection were determined. At catheter removal, tip culture was performed to determine colonization and jugular vein patency was determined with ultrasonography (US). RESULTS The overall infection rate was 0.4 per 1,000 catheter days. There was one clinical infection (noncuffed catheter). Colonization occurred in two noncuffed catheters and one cuffed catheter. There was one catheter dislodgment in the noncuffed group and none in the cuffed group. Cuffed catheters were no more difficult to insert but took slightly longer to remove (6 minutes +/- 4.7 vs 5 minutes +/- 3, P = .39) and often required local anesthesia for removal, whereas noncuffed catheters did not (41% vs 0%, P = .001). Partial (two cuffed, 0 noncuffed) or complete (two cuffed, one noncuffed) jugular thrombosis was seen on five of 58 completion US studies (8.6%).

Levamisole (LVM) is an anthelminthic drug; it has immune-modulating effects through induction of type 1 immune response. Based on these findings several recent studies highlighted that LVM might be effective in preventing and treating SARS-CoV-2 infections. The aim of this report is to illustrate the potential role of LVM in SARS-CoV-2 infection and in the management of COVID-19. Different studies proposed that LVM may inhibit proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 through inhibition of papain-like protease. LVM may prevent ALI and acute kidney injury through activation of glucocorticoid receptors. In general, LVM has strong immune stimulant effects by modulating cellular and humoral immune responses. This effect is beneficial in the early phase of COVID-19 and harmful in the late phase. In the early phase, immune stimulation facilitates SARS-CoV-2 clearance and tissue repair, however, in the late phase, immune stimulation in COVID-19 may increase propagation risk of cytokine storm. In conclusion, LVM therapy in COVID-19 has bidirectional effects, beneficial in the early phase and harmful effects in the late phase of COVID-19.

However, data visualizations have a range of accessibility concerns, including visual acuity, color/contrast difficulties, color blindness, and size/scale issues. Data visualizations should therefore be designed following web standards for complex images to ensure that they are accessible to audiences with diverse needs. Key concepts: Drawing from work in professional communication and disability studies, practitioners recognize that users have varied accessibility needs. Universal design as a guiding principle is less helpful than targeted approaches to design that reflect actual user needs. Such targeted approaches should follow web standards for accessible design because they enable interaction with newer accessibility technologies and put more control in the hands of users. Key lessons: Follow these best practices to create visually accessible data visualizations. 1. Design the visual for accessibility by using whitespace, creating contrast, maintaining size/scale, and labeling the visual clearly. 2. Implement the visual using web standards to create semantic connections between the visual and text for both users and accessibility technologies. This goal can be achieved with textual description, overview/data/presentation context, or ARIA semantic links. 3. Test the visual for accessibility through user tests and industry-standard tools. Implications for practice: Web standards provide a blueprint for designing accessible data visualizations for online spaces, but professional communicators should be aware of the coding expertise and necessary infrastructure needed to deploy these visuals.

Post-operative simulation presented various scenarios of skin flap closures. Rotation and rhomboid flaps demonstrated maximal tension at the apex of the flap for both genders as well as advancement flap in the female face model. However, advancement flap closure in the male face model presented otherwise. Yet, the deformation patterns and the peak tension of the discussed flaps were consistent with conventional local flap surgery.

METHODS All patients who underwent cardiac catheterisation for Melody valve implantation and 3DRAA between August 2013 and February 2015 were reviewed. RESULTS 31 patients had 3DRAA with balloon sizing. Ten were deemed not Melody candidates (5 coronary compression, 2 aortic root distortion with cusp flattening, 2 RVOT was too large, and 1 had complex branch stenosis and a short landing zone). Of the 21 patients who were Melody candidates, 12 had conduits, 6 prosthetic valves and 3 native RVOTs. In patients with conduits, the technique of stenting the conduit prior to dilation was used after measuring the distance between the conduit and the coronary arteries on 3DRAA. In the Melody patients, we had 100% procedural success and no serious adverse events (coronary compression, tears, stent fracture or endocarditis).

Three-dimensional (3D) printed porous scaffolds incorporating osteoinductive components are considered as ideal bone grafts, because of the accurate control of structure parameters and the capacity to enhance bone tissue regeneration. Our previous studies demonstrated that nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (nanoZIF-8), a subclass of metal organic frameworks (MOFs), presented minimal cytotoxicity, inhibited bacterial activities, and promoted osteogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. However, the application of nanoZIF-8 in the 3D printed scaffold system remains unknown. In this study, nanoZIF-8 was incorporated into composite scaffolds composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) via extrusion-based 3D printing technology. The results revealed that the composite scaffolds possessed increased mechanical strength and exhibited homogeneous structure with highly interconnected macropores. In vitro studies indicated that scaffolds showed biocompatibility to bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), significantly up-regulated the expression of osteogenesis-related genes and proteins, and facilitated the extracellular matrix mineralization. In vivo results showed that 3D printed porous scaffolds promoted new bone formation and enhanced micro-architecture at the critical defect sites (10 mm) in rabbits, compared with the blank control group. Moreover, composite scaffolds significantly improved calvarial defect healing in comparison with scaffolds without nanoZIF-8 incorporation. In summary, nanoZIF-8 modified 3D printed porous composite scaffolds demonstrated great potential in the treatment of critical-sized bone defects, proving the effectiveness of MOF incorporation in 3D printed composite scaffolds to promote osteogenesis in the field of bone tissue engineering.","output":"3D printing of metal-organic framework incorporated porous scaffolds to promote osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the impact and correlation of socioeconomic vulnerability on COVID-19 outcomes and social distancing in Brazil Methods: The Gini Coefficient (GC), the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), epidemiological data on COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil, and the Social Distancing Index (SDI) were retrieved from online databases and assessed for each Brazilian state Data was statistically analyzed through non-parametric tests and multiple linear regressions Results: The mean values for the GC and SVI were 0 495 and 0 261, respectively A positive statistically significant correlation between the socioeconomic indicators and the three variables related to the COVID-19 outbreak was found States with very low social vulnerability presented fewer deaths per 100 thousand inhabitants due to COVID-19 than states with moderate social vulnerability SVI was a predictor of accumulated cases, confirmed deaths, and social distancing in Brazilian states during COVID-19 Conclusions: The COVID-19 outcomes and SDI in Brazilian states are correlated to the socioeconomic condition The pandemic impacts are more severe in less favored communities Objetivo: Avaliar o impacto e a correla??o da vulnerabilidade socioecon?mica nos desfechos da COVID-19 e no distanciamento social no Brasil Materiais e Mtodos: O Coeficiente de Gini (CG), o ndice de Vulnerabilidade Social (IVS), dados epidemiolgicos sobre a epidemia da COVID-19 no Brasil e o ndice de Distanciamento Social (IDS) foram obtidos a partir de bases de dados online e avaliados para cada estado brasileiro Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente atravs de testes n?o-paramtricos e de regress?o logstica linear Resultados: Os valores mdios para o CG e IVS foram 0 495 e 0 261, respectivamente Uma correla??o estatstica positiva foi encontrada entre os indicadores socioecon?micos e as trs variveis relacionadas  epidemia de COVID-19 Os estados brasileiros com menores ndices de vulnerabilidade social apresentaram uma quantidade menor de mortes pela COVID-19, para cada cem mil habitantes, quando comparados com estados com vulnerabilidade social moderada O IVS foi um preditor para o acumulado de casos, mortes confirmadas e distanciamento social nos estados brasileiros durante a pandemia da COVID-19 Conclus?o: Os desfechos da COVID-19 e o IDS nos estados brasileiros est?o correlacionados com a condi??o socioecon?mica Os impactos da pandemia s?o mais severos nas localidades mais vulnerveis","output":"The impact of socioeconomic vulnerability on COVID-19 outcomes and social distancing in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 crisis has radically changed the way people live and work. While most studies have focused on prevailing negative consequences, potential positive shifts in everyday life have received less attention. Thus, we examined the actual and perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life, and the consequences for mental well-being (MWB), and self-rated health (SRH) in German and Swiss employees. Methods: : Cross-sectional data from 2,118 German and Swiss employees (18C65 years) were collected. Using logistic regression, we analyzed how sociodemographic factors and the actual changes in work and private life routines were associated with participants perceived overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis on work and private life. Moreover, we explored how the perceived impact and the actual changes were associated with MWB and SRH. Results: : About 30% of employees reported that their work and private life had worsened, whereas about 11% reported improvements in work and 14% in private life as a result of the crisis. Mandatory short-time work was strongly associated with perceived negative impact on work life, while work from home, particularly if experienced for the first time, was strongly associated with a perceived positive impact on work life. Concerning private life, younger age, living alone, reduction in leisure time, and changes in quantity of caring duties were strongly associated with perceived negative impact on private life. In contrast, living with a partner or family, short-time work, and increases in leisure time and caring duties were associated with perceived positive impact on private life. Perceived negative impact of the crisis on work and private life was associated with lower MWB and SRH. Moreover, perceived positive impact on private life was associated with higher MWB. Finally, mandatory short-time work was negatively associated with MWB and SRH, and an increase in leisure time was positively associated with MWB and SRH. Conclusion: The results of this study show the differential impact of the COVID-19 crisis on peoples work and private life as well as the consequences for MWB and SRH.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This open-label multicentre randomized controlled trial will compare clinical outcomes of tocilizumab plus standard of care versus standard of care alone in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Two of the following four criteria are required for protocol enrolment: D-dimer > 1,000ng/mL; C reactive protein > 5mg/dL, ferritin > 300mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal. The primary objective will be to compare the clinical status on day 15, as measured by a 7-point ordinal scale applied in COVID-19 trials worldwide. The primary endpoint will be assessed by an ordinal logistic regression assuming proportional odds ratios adjusted for stratification variables (age and sex).

Methods We examined a retrospective cohort of 58 SOT recipients with first-wave COVID-19, comparing patients with severe and non-severe illness. Additionally, SOT patients are compared to general first-wave COVID-19 patients. Results Organs transplanted included 38 kidneys, 8 livers, 5 hearts, 3 pancreas. Average SOT patient age was 57.4 years with 62% male, 46.6% African American, 36.2% white. Comorbidities included hypertension (86%), chronic kidney disease (86%), diabetes mellitus (50%), coronary artery disease (26%), COPD (14%). Twenty patients (34.5%) had severe COVID-19 and 38 (65.5%) non-severe disease. Severe disease was more common in older SOT patients with comorbidities and associated with cough, dyspnea, pneumonia, C-reactive protein > 10 mg/L, platelet count < 150/mcL. Gender, race, BMI, time from transplant, baseline immunosuppression and diagnosis month did not differ between those with severe vs non-severe COVID-19. Seventy percent of SOT patients were hospitalized vs 27.2% of general COVID-19 patients and SOT inpatients had a higher mechanical ventilation rate. While trending towards longer length of stay, higher ICU admission and greater inpatient mortality (19.5% vs 14.8%), these differences were not significant. Conclusions SARS-CoV-2 has greatly impacted SOT recipients. One-third of our SOT patients seen during the first wave had severe illness with associated standard risk factors for poor outcome.

Our objective was to compare the volume of patients with urologic emergencies presenting to emergency departments (EDs) within a single health system before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed for 3 EDs within a single health system in the United States to identify all ED consults to urology from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. For emergent consults, covariates were extracted, including demographic information, insurance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, travel distance from home to the ED, and whether the patient had seen a provider in the hospital system before. Data were compared between COVID-19 months (March-May 2020) and corresponding months in 2019. RESULTS The study period encompassed 1,179 consults and 373 urologic emergencies. We observed not only a 22% decrease in urologic presentations to the ED compared to corresponding months in 2019, but also a 54% decrease in the proportion of urologic presentations that were truly emergent. For patients with emergent diagnoses, April 2020 saw an increase in Medicare/Medicaid coverage and a decrease in private insurance, May 2020 saw a decreased travel distance from home to the ED, and March and May 2020 saw an increase in patients who had previously seen a health system provider outside of the ED. No changes were seen in demographic characteristics or CCI. CONCLUSIONS During the early COVID-19 pandemic, urologic emergencies within a single health system decreased by 54% compared to the corresponding months pre-pandemic.

Since the first reported EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, several small outbreaks have been reported in central Africa with about 2,400 cases occurring between 1976 and 2013. The 2013-2015 EVD outbreak in west Africa is the first documented outbreak in this region and the largest ever with over 27,000 cases and more than 11,000 deaths. Although EVD transmission rates have recently decreased in west Africa, this crisis continues to threaten global health and security, particularly since infected travelers could spread EVD to other resource-limited areas of the world. Because vaccines and drugs are not yet licensed for EVD, outbreak control is dependent on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., infection control practices, isolation of EVD cases, contact tracing with follow-up and quarantine, sanitary burial, health education). However, delays in diagnosing and reporting EVD cases in less accessible rural areas continue to hamper control efforts. New advances in rapid diagnostics for identifying presumptive EVD cases and in mobile-based technologies for communicating critical health-related information should facilitate deployment of an early response to prevent the amplification of sporadic EVD cases into large-scale outbreaks.","output":"Ebola Virus Disease: Rapid Diagnosis and Timely Case Reporting are Critical to the Early Response for Outbreak Control."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study demonstrated good short-term safety profile after a third dose of BNT162b2 vaccine among HCWs.

Methods: The literature at home and abroad on the treatment of ONFH with vascularized bone grafting was reviewed, and the mechanism, operating methods and effectiveness, indications, and complications were summarized. Results: Vascularized bone grafting is a commonly used clinical hip-preserving operation. By replacing necrotic bone tissue with vascularized bone, it can rebuild the blood circulation system, promote the healing of the necrotic area, and provide biomechanical support for the necrotic area of the femoral head, prevent the joint surface collapse.

However, while hundreds to thousands of nuclear genomes of parasitic protozoa have been generated and analyzed, information about the diversity, structure and evolution of their mitochondrial genomes remains fragmentary, mainly because of their extraordinary complexity. Indeed, unicellular flagellates of the order Kinetoplastida contain structurally the most complex mitochondrial genome of all eukaryotes, organized as a giant network of homogeneous maxicircles and heterogeneous minicircles. We recently developed KOMICS, an analysis toolkit that automates the assembly and circularization of the mitochondrial genomes of Kinetoplastid parasites. While this tool overcomes the limitation of extracting mitochondrial assemblies from Next-Generation Sequencing datasets, interpreting and visualizing the genetic (dis)similarity within and between samples remains a time-consuming process. RESULTS: Here, we present a new analysis toolkit-rKOMICS-to streamline the analyses of minicircle sequence diversity in population-scale genome projects. rKOMICS is a user-friendly R package that has simple installation requirements and that is applicable to all 27 trypanosomatid genera. Once minicircle sequence alignments are generated, rKOMICS allows to examine, summarize and visualize minicircle sequence diversity within and between samples through the analyses of minicircle sequence clusters. We showcase the functionalities of the (r)KOMICS tool suite using a whole-genome sequencing dataset from a recently published study on the history of diversification of the Leishmania braziliensis species complex in Peru. Analyses of population diversity and structure highlighted differences in minicircle sequence richness and composition between Leishmania subspecies, and between subpopulations within subspecies. CONCLUSION: The rKOMICS package establishes a critical framework to manipulate, explore and extract biologically relevant information from mitochondrial minicircle assemblies in tens to hundreds of samples simultaneously and efficiently. This should facilitate research that aims to develop new molecular markers for identifying species-specific minicircles, or to study the ancestry of parasites for complementary insights into their evolutionary history.","output":"rKOMICS: an R package for processing mitochondrial minicircle assemblies in population-scale genome projects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Food insecurity in rural settings is complex and not fully understood, especially from the perspective of low-income and Black residents.

METHODS: Confirmed cases of COVID-19 were selected at the Fever Unit in two regions of Guizhou, China. On admission CRP levels were collected, and the diameter of the largest lung lesion was measured in the most severe lung lesion by lung CT scan. Differences in the diameter and CRP levels were compared in the following groups of patients: mild group, moderate group, severe group, and critical group. RESULT: CRP levels and the diameter of the largest lung lesion in the moderate group were higher than those in the mild group (Mann-Whitney test=-2.647, -2.171, P??0.05), those in the severe group were higher than those in the moderate group (Mann-Whitney test=0.693, -2.177, P??0.05), and those in the critical group were higher than those in the severe group (Mann-Whitney test=-0.068, -1.549, P??0.05).

We performed the experiments on EEG data of 32 subjects from the DEAP public dataset, where the subjects were stimulated using 60-s videos to elicitate different levels of Arousal/Valence and then self-reported the rating from 1 to 9 using the self-assessment Manikin (SAM). The EEG data was pre-processed and used as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN). First, the 32 EEG channels were used to compute the maximum accuracy level obtainable for each subject as well as for creating a single model using data from all the subjects. The experiment was repeated using one channel at a time, to see if specific channels contain more information to discriminate between low vs high arousal/valence. The results indicate than using one channel the accuracy is lower compared to using all the 32 channels. An optimization process for EEG channel selection is then designed with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with the objective to obtain optimal channel combinations with high accuracy recognition. The genetic algorithm evaluates all possible combinations using a chromosome representation for all the 32 channels, and the EEG data from each chromosome in the different populations are tested iteratively solving two unconstrained objectives; to maximize classification accuracy and to reduce the number of required EEG channels for the classification process. Best combinations obtained from a Pareto-front suggests that as few as 8-10 channels can fulfill this condition and provide the basis for a lighter design of EEG systems for emotion recognition. In the best case, the results show accuracies of up to 1.00 for low vs high arousal using eight EEG channels, and 1.00 for low vs high valence using only two EEG channels. These results are encouraging for research and healthcare applications that will require automatic emotion recognition with wearable EEG.","output":"Two-dimensional CNN-based distinction of human emotions from EEG channels selected by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemiological time series forecasting plays an important role in health public systems, due to its ability to allow managers to develop strategic planning to avoid possible epidemics. In this paper, a hybrid learning framework is developed to forecast multi-step-ahead (one, two and three-month-ahead) meningitis cases in four states of Brazil. First, the proposed approach applies an ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) to decompose the data into intrinsic mode functions and residual components. Then, each component is used as the input of five different forecasting models, and, from there, forecasted results are obtained. Finally, all combinations of models and components are developed, and for each case, the forecasted results are weighted integrated (WI) to formulate a heterogeneous ensemble forecaster for the monthly meningitis cases. In the final stage, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) using the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm C version II is employed to find a set of candidates weights, and then the Technique for Order of Preference by similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is applied to choose the adequate set of weights. Next, the most adequate model is the one with the best generalization capacity out-of-sample in terms of performance criteria including mean absolute error (MAE), relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE). By using MOO, the intention is to enhance the performance of the forecasting models by improving simultaneously their accuracy and stability measures. To access the models performance, comparisons based on metrics are conducted with: (i) EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble integrated by direct strategy, or simple sum; (ii) EEMD, homogeneous ensemble of components WI; (iii) models without signal decomposition. At this stage, MAE, RRMSE, sMAPE criteria and DieboldCMariano statistical test are adopted. In all twelve scenarios, the proposed framework was able to perform more accurate and stable forecasts, which showed, on 89.17% of the cases, that the errors of the proposed approach are statistically lower than other approaches. These results showed that combining EEMD, heterogeneous ensemble and WI with weights obtained by optimization can develop precise and stable forecasts. The modelling developed in this paper is promising and can be used by managers to support decision making.","output":"Multi-step ahead meningitis case forecasting based on decomposition and multi-objective optimization methods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Individuals with Down syndrome may struggle with anticipatory postural adjustments, and adapt slower to motor tasks and environmental changes, due to decreased motor proficiency. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of virtual reality therapy (VRT), specifically Nintendo Wii, combined with physiotherapy or occupational therapy (OT) for improving motor proficiency in individuals with Down syndrome, compared to standard physiotherapy, OT or no intervention. METHOD: Nine computerised databases were searched from inception to July 2020. Methodological quality of randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies was appraised using the physiotherapy evidence database (PEDro) scale and the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case Reports. RESULTS: Two randomised controlled trials and four quasi-experimental studies were included, with an average PEDro score of 7.3. One included case study scored 5. This review included 345 participants. Motor proficiency includes balance, coordination, strength and agility. Agility showed a significant improvement after 5 (p = 0.01) or 24 (p < 0.01) weeks. Strength showed a significant improvement after a 6- (p = 0.000) or 24-week intervention (p < 0.05). Balance showed inconclusive results for adults, and significant improvement in children after 6 (p = 0.000), 8 (p < 0.05) or 24 (p < 0.003) weeks. One study (n = 155) showed that upper limb and bilateral coordination improved significantly after 24 weeks (p < 0.003).

RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values of SARS-CoV-2  34 and the first 7C9 days of symptoms are associated with enhanced infectivity. We determined Ct values and duration of symptoms of HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. As HCW often assume their greatest risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 is working on a COVID-19 unit, we also determined Ct values and symptom duration of inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. METHODS: From 6/24/2020-8/23/2020, Ct values and duration of symptoms from 13 HCW, 12 outpatients, and 28 inpatients who had a positive nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed. RESULTS: Among HCW with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 46.2% (6/13) were asymptomatic and requested testing due to an exposure to someone with COVID-19; 83.3% (5/6) of those exposures occurred in the community rather than in the hospital. The median Ct value of HCW was 23.2, and 84.6% (11/13) had a Ct value  34. The median Ct value of 29.0 among outpatients with COVID-19 did not significantly differ from HCW. In contrast, inpatients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test had a median Ct value of 34.0 (p = 0.003), which translated into a median ~1,000-fold lower viral load than observed in HCW. Among those with symptoms related to COVID-19, no (0/6) HCW compared to 50% (6/12) of inpatients had symptoms for at least one week (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: At our institution, asymptomatic COVID-19 accounted for nearly half of the cases among HCW. Symptomatic HCW had high viral loads and short duration of symptoms, both of which are associated with peak infectivity. Infection prevention programs should educate HCW on these findings in an effort to increase adherence to the requirement to maintain six feet separation in workspaces and breakrooms, in addition to consistently wearing personal protection equipment.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 is associated with high viral loads in asymptomatic and recently symptomatic healthcare workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose>This paper aims to explore the best practices in marketing strategies for the Malaysian business event industry.Design/methodology/approach>A qualitative methodology was adopted to collect primary data from semi-structured interviews.

The first known Italian SARS-CoV-2 positive case was reported on 21 February. In some countries, cases of suspected \\"COVID-19-like pneumonia\\" had been reported earlier than those officially accepted by health authorities. This has led many investigators to check preserved biological or environmental samples to see whether the virus was detectable on dates prior to those officially stated. With regard to Italy, the results of a microbiological screening in sewage samples collected between the end of February and the beginning of April 2020 from wastewaters in Milan (Northern Italy) and Rome (Central Italy) showed presence of SARS-CoV-2. In the present study, we evaluated, by means of a standardized diagnostic method, the SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence amongst patients affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARI) in an academic hospital located in Central Italy during the period of 1 November 2019-1 March 2020. Overall, the number of emergency room (ER) visits during the investigated period was 13,843. Of these, 1208 had an influenza-like syndrome, but only 166 matched the definition of SARI as stated in the study protocol. A total of 52 SARI cases were laboratory confirmed as influenza: 26 as a type B virus, 25 as a type A, and 1 as both viruses. Although about 17% of the total sample had laboratory or radiological data compatible with COVID-19, all the nasopharyngeal swabs stored underwent SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and tested negative.

This project explored strategies and measures that could be adopted internationally for mitigating a disease outbreak on-board of a cruise ship by bringing evidence-based recommendations for an emergency response against current COVID-19 outbreak and future infectious threats. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: Research took place in October 2020-March 2021. Methods comprised of: a) consultation sessions with five international experts on public health, epidemiology, tourism and cruise management, b) both systematic and narrative literature reviews. Present guidance analysed why cruise ships promote an opportunistic environment for infectious outbreaks, along with a strategy for reducing the risks among passengers and crew. RESULTS: Results were organised under four main themes: a) advice on surface interactions and virus viability; b) prevention and control measures; c) suggestions on short and long term responses; d) advice on thermal and ventilation conditions and how they affect virus transmission. The guidance was very similar to other built environment contexts, ignoring the particularities of sociospatial interactions in cruise ships. Moreover, there was limited provision for the wellbeing and mental health during the outbreak. LESSONS: This project summarised recommendations for the preparedness of cruise ships during a pandemic from ports, off-board and on-board measures to repatriation. Demonstrated the importance of spatial characteristics in the preparedness of a ship. Pointed the effect pandemic can have upon crew and passengers. This needs to be taken into account when operations restart. Cruise experience would have to change due to covid-19, especially when social activity on board has to be restricted. The importance of future studies focusing on how this change will impact cruise industry arose, including crew hygiene, safety and supporting mental health during outbreaks.

This retrospective, observational, multicentre study used data collected from patients admitted to nine sentinel hospitals with ILI and SARI from January 2015 through December 2020 in Shanghai, China. We prospectively tested patients for a total of 22 respiratory pathogens using multi-real-time polymerase chain reaction. Of the 4541 patients tested, 40.37% (1833/4541) tested positive for respiratory pathogens and 3.59% (163/4541) tested positive for common HCoVs.

Bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy has recently been demonstrated to be safe and effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Preliminary evidence has suggested that bilateral MRgFUS capsulotomy can present increased difficulties in reaching lesional temperatures as compared to unilateral thalamotomy. The authors of this article aimed to study the parameters associated with successful MRgFUS capsulotomy lesioning and to present longitudinal radiographic findings following MRgFUS capsulotomy. METHODS: Using data from 22 attempted MRgFUS capsulotomy treatments, the authors investigated the relationship between various sonication parameters and the maximal temperature achieved at the intracranial target. Lesion volume and morphology were analyzed longitudinally using structural and diffusion tensor imaging. A retreatment procedure was attempted in one patient, and their postoperative imaging is presented. RESULTS: Skull density ratio (SDR), skull thickness, and angle of incidence were significantly correlated with the maximal temperature achieved. MRgFUS capsulotomy lesions appeared similar to those following MRgFUS thalamotomy, with three concentric zones observed on MRI. Lesion volumes regressed substantially over time following MRgFUS. Fractional anisotropy analysis revealed a disruption in white matter integrity, followed by a gradual return to near-baseline levels concurrent with lesion regression. In the patient who underwent retreatment, successful bilateral lesioning was achieved, and there were no adverse clinical or radiographic events. CONCLUSIONS: With the current iteration of MRgFUS technology, skull-related parameters such as SDR, skull thickness, and angle of incidence should be considered when selecting patients suitable for MRgFUS capsulotomy. Lesions appear to follow morphological patterns similar to what is seen following MRgFUS thalamotomy.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of human saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne virus and to compare it with those of artificial saliva and cell culture medium. A stock of MS2 bacteriophage was diluted in one of three nebulizer suspensions, aerosolized, size selected (100 to 450 nm) using a differential mobility analyzer, and collected onto gelatin filters. Uranine was used as a particle tracer. The resulting particle size distribution was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. The amounts of infectious virus, total virus, and fluorescence in the collected samples were determined by infectivity assays, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and spectrofluorometry, respectively. For all nebulizer suspensions, the virus content generally followed a particle volume distribution rather than a number distribution. The survival of airborne MS2 was independent of particle size but was strongly affected by the type of nebulizer suspension. Human saliva was found to be much less protective than cell culture medium (i.e., 3% tryptic soy broth) and artificial saliva. These results indicate the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory results, which often use artificial nebulizer suspensions.

Rino Rappuoli and others have contributed in this field by plotting the design of the most potent and fully computational approach for discovery of potential vaccine candidates which is popular as reverse vaccinology. This is quite an unambiguous advance for vaccine evolution where one begins with the genome information of the pathogen and ends up with the list of certain epitopes after application of multiple bioinformatics tools. This book chapter is an effort to bring this approach of reverse vaccinology into notice of readers using example of coronavirus.","output":"Advanced In Silico Tools for Designing of Antigenic Epitope as Potential Vaccine Candidates Against Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is now catching the country by surprise. The disease has had a huge influence worldwide, and the nation has been put in lockdown by this health crisis. The psychological health, physical health and economic condition of individuals are adversely impacted by quarantine and lockdown. As mobility is reduced, there will be a dramatic shift in the population's lifestyle, where the people's physical activity level will decrease. Low levels of physical exercise can lead to a large number of obesity cases. Therefore, steps for obesity prevention and management need to be taken. One approach is to administer nutrition with accuracy through precision nutrition. Therefore, this research aims to review articles on precision nutrition for the treatment and control of obesity towards a restricted movement order during the COVID-19 health crisis. The literature search was conducted from May 2020 until January 2021 using Scopus and Science Direct as the main databases. The articles included follow the inclusion criteria published in English language, including nutrition intervention for prevention and management of obesity, focus on health crisis, and no restriction of time and study design.

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of hyperthermia on bacterial swarming motility and antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: Thirty-one P. mirabilis isolates were included in the study. Seven inoculated agar plates were incubated inside incubators with increasing temperature levels: at 36 C (control) and 40-45 C. On the next day, inhibition of swarming was evaluated and minimum paralyzing temperature (MPT) values were determined. An antimicrobial susceptibility test (antibiogram) is performed by exposing bacteria to increasing concentrations of antibiotics, in vitro. Thus, we used the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion test as a screening method to analyze the antibiogram profiles of the isolates at 36 C and 42 C. Finally, a time-kill assay was performed to analyze the killing effect of hyperthermia (42 C) on planktonic bacteria, in combination with the antibiotic meropenem at the first and third hours. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the killing effects of meropenem, hyperthermia and their combinations. RESULTS: The median MPT value was determined as 44 C. In the disk diffusion assay, susceptibility development was observed in 94% of isolates for at least one antibiotic. In the time-kill assay, we observed a significant killing effect of hyperthermia in combination with meropenem. Under the microscope, we observed the formation of spherical cells by the effect of heat.

The reasons for this apparent pattern are unknown. Here, we expressed and purified representative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and studied three biochemical parameters that have been associated with the inhibitory effects of RDV-triphosphate (TP): (i) selective incorporation of the nucleotide substrate RDV-TP, (ii) the effect of the incorporated RDV-monophosphate (MP) on primer extension, and (iii) the effect of RDV-MP in the template during incorporation of the complementary UTP. The results of this study revealed a strong correlation between antiviral effects and efficient incorporation of RDV-TP. Inhibition in primer extension reactions is heterogeneous and usually inefficient at higher NTP concentrations. In contrast, template-dependent inhibition of UTP incorporation opposite the embedded RDV-MP is seen with all polymerases. Molecular modeling suggests a steric conflict between the 1'-cyano group of RDV-MP and conserved residues of RdRp motif F.

Polybasic substrate-like ligands typically trigger conformational changes shifting furins active site cleft from the OFF-state to the ON-state. Here, we solved the X-ray structures of furin in complex with four different arginine mimetic compounds with reduced basicity. These guanylhydrazone-based inhibitor complexes showed for the first time an active site-directed binding mode to furins OFF-state conformation. The compounds undergo unique interactions within the S1 pocket, largely different compared to substrate-like ligands. A second binding site was identified at the S4/S5 pocket of furin. Crystallography-based titration experiments confirmed the S1 site as the primary binding pocket. We also tested the proprotein convertases PC5/6 and PC7 for inhibition by guanylhydrazones and found an up to 7-fold lower potency for PC7.

With an increase in the number of bariatric procedures performed in recent years, it is important to be cognizant of the frequency, presentation, and management of this complication. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the incidence and management of bleeding complications after gastric bypass surgery. METHODS A review of prospectively maintained bariatric surgery databases was conducted at 2 tertiary bariatric units. All patients who presented with gastrointestinal and intra-abdominal bleeding after gastric bypass during a 10-year period were identified, and their charts were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 4466 patients who underwent gastric bypass during the 10-year period had reliable morbidity data available and were included in the present study. Of the 4466 patients, 42 (.94%) experienced a bleeding complication postoperatively. Of these patients, 20 (47.6%) had undergone previous abdominal surgery. Bleeding occurred in the early postoperative period (<30 d) in 30 (71%); the etiology of which included bleeding from the staple lines, iatrogenic visceral injury, or mesenteric vessel bleeding. Early postoperative bleeding required operative intervention to achieve hemostasis in 43%. Late postoperative bleeding (n = 12) were usually secondary to marginal ulceration and warranted surgical intervention in 33.3%. Previously undiagnosed bleeding diatheses were identified in 14.3%. CONCLUSION Gastrointestinal bleeding after gastric bypass, although infrequent, is a difficult clinical scenario. Nonoperative management is feasible for hemodynamically stable patients. Surgical intervention is merited for patients with hemodynamic compromise, those who do not respond to transfusion, and those in whom the bleeding source cannot be adequately identified nonoperatively.","output":"Incidence and management of bleeding complications after gastric bypass surgery in the morbidly obese."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enzyme cGAS functions as a sensor that recognizes the cytosolic DNA from foreign pathogen. The activation of the protein triggers the transcription of inflammatory genes, leading into the establishment of an antipathogen state. An interesting new discovery is that the detection of DNA by cGAS induced the formation of liquid-like droplets. However how cells regulate the formation of these droplets is still not fully understood. In order to unravel the molecular mechanism beneath the DNA-mediated phase separation of cGAS, we developed a polymer-based coarse-grained model which takes into accounts the basic structural organization in DNA and cGAS, as well as the binding properties between these biomolecules. This model was further integrated into a hybrid simulation algorithm. With this computational method, a multi-step kinetic process of aggregation between cGAS and DNA was observed. Moreover, we systematically tested the model under different concentrations and binding parameters. Our simulation results show that phase separation requires both cGAS dimerization and protein-DNA interactions, whereas polymers can be kinetically trapped in small aggregates under strong binding affinities. Additionally, we demonstrated that supramolecular assembly can be facilitated by increasing the number of functional modules in protein or DNA polymers, suggesting that multivalency and intrinsic disordered regions play positive roles in regulating phase separation. This is consistent to previous experimental evidences. Taken together, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first computational model to study condensation of cGAS-DNA complexes. While the method can reach the timescale beyond the capability of atomic-level MD simulations, it still includes information about spatial arrangement of functional modules in biopolymers that is missing in the mean-field theory.

Considering the effect of duty hours on residents, both physically and mentally, several models have been created over the years to address this complexity. The two main model schools aim to decrease the duty hour length and night shift (i.e., night float, NF) frequency. In recent years, duty hours have become a source of disagreement and frustration among the medical community, both residents and attendings. A possible change in the duty hour structure may affect residents in terms of several parameters, such as patient safety, the well-being of the physician and the degree of training of the resident. PURPOSE: (1) To investigate medical residents perspectives on their duty hours utilizing online questionnaires on their effect on the work environment and (2) to assess residents preferences in relation to the suggested shortened shift and NF models. METHODS: Questionnaires were emailed to all residents (main residents and fellows) at an Israeli tertiary medical center between March 2020 and April 2020. Questions were scored from 1 (disagree) to 5 (fully agree). RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty residents (227 main residents, 43 fellows) participated in the study (40% female). The score for the degree of balance between work and personal life was low (0.91.99). The shortened shift model was perceived by the residents as more compatible with a balanced lifestyle than the NF model (3.77  1.20 and 3.14  1.26, respectively, P < 0.0001). Neither model was considered to risk impairing professional training (2.33  1.45 and 2.47  1.25, respectively, P = 0.12). Overall, 74% of the residents were not willing to lower their income if the decision were made to change models, and 56% were not willing to increase the number of shifts. CONCLUSIONS: There is agreement among residents that shortening shift hours to 16 h would have a positive effect on the balance between personal life and work. In the eyes of residents, the change would not impair their training during residency.

METHODS: Patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) department and general infection department of TaiKang Tongji (Wuhan) Hospital from February 10 to March 27, 2020, were included. Data on clinical features, complications, laboratory parameters, chest CT, nutrient requirement, and electrolyte imbalance were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 123 (50 critical and 73 non-critical) patients were enrolled. 65% of patients with comorbidities, hypertension (45.5%), diabetes (21.9%), 36.5% of patients had more than one comorbidity. The proportion of lymphocytes in critical patients was significantly lower than that of non-critical patients. The proportion of patients with increased NLR, PLR, IL-6, CRP levels, and chest CT score was significantly higher in the critical than that of non-critical patients. The logistic regression analysis identified low lymphocyte count, high NLR, PLR, IL-6, CRP levels, and CT score as independent factors for discerning critical cases and high NLR, PLR, IL-6, and CT score could predict poor clinical outcome. Furthermore, we identified patients who needed nutrition support (HR 16.99) and with correction of electrolyte imbalance (HR 18.24) via intravenous injection were more likely to have a poor outcome.

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 by itself is not an indication for cesarean section. Different publications demonstrated the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia/anesthesia for delivery. Although SARS-CoV-2 was associated with a certain neurotropism, neuraxial block was not associated with neurological damage in COVID-19 parturients, and seems as safe and effective as in normal situations. It permits to avoid a general anesthesia in case of intrapartum cesarean section. Epidural failure is a concern: it may lead to a general anesthesia in case of emergency cesarean section. Local protocols and well-trained anesthesiologists will be helpful. COVID-19 patients require special circuits and every step (transfer to and from theatre, recovery, analgesia, and so on) should be planned in advance. For cesarean section under general anesthesia, personal protection equipment must be enhanced. Postoperative analgesia with neuraxial opioids, NSAIDs, or regional blocks are recommended. COVID-19 and pregnancy increase the risk of thrombosis, so thromboprophylaxis has to be considered and protocolized.

However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted in Saudi Arabia to assess its effectiveness. Methods: A hospital-based retrospective cohort study involving 161 patients with COVID-19 was conducted from March 1 to May 20, 2020. The study was conducted at Prince Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Hospital (PMAH).The population included hospitalized adults (age &#8805;18 years) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Each eligible patient was followed from the time of admission until the time of discharge. Patients were classified into two groups according to treatment type: in the HCQ group, patients were treated with HCQ; in the SC group, patients were treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to Ministry of Health (MOH) protocolsThe outcomes were hospitalization days, ICU admission, and the need for mechanical ventilation.We estimated the differences in hospital length of stay and time in the ICU between the HCQ group and the standard care (SC) group using a multivariate generalized linear regression. The differences in ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were compared via logistic regression. All models were adjusted for age and gender variables. Results: A total of 161 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Approximately 59% (n=95) received HCQ-based treatment, and 41% (n=66) received SC. Length of hospital stay and time in ICU in for patients who received HCQ based treatment was shorter than those who received SC. Similarly, there was less need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation among patients who received HCQ based treatment compared with SC, (8.6% vs. 10.7 and 3.1% vs. 9.1%).

We assessed the incidence and etiologies of exercise intolerance (EI) during Step 5 in concussed patients who tolerated maximal linear exertion. BACKGROUND Exertional testing can be used to determine appropriate levels of exercise tolerance (ET) in concussed patients. Traditionally linear modalities have been used to determine max ET prior to clearance. HIIT-MD protocols can be the next appropriate step to bridge clearance for more dynamic activities. DESIGN/METHODS Retrospective chart review included 130 step 5 trials for EI; of those, 72 had pre/postexercise King Devick (KD) and force plate (FP) testing. Patients were 10-59 years old and clinic visits occurred 2019-2020. EI rate was recorded and failure reason was documented by our clinic's concussion specialist. The difference between pre/post exercise KD and FP was investigated. RESULTS Of 130 step 5 trials, 21.54% failed due to EI. Reason for EI included the onset of symptoms (82.1%), followed by signs of dysautonomia (39.3%). Symptoms and dysautonomia combined were noted in 35.7% of those with EI. Symptoms appeared in combination with another marker 69.6% of the time. The average change in KD times pre/post exercise testing was +2.52 seconds longer in the EI group compared to -2.45 seconds shorter in the ET group (p = 0.62). The EI group demonstrated an average change of 0.36 deg/sec sway velocity increase after exercise compared to 0.13 deg/sec in the ET group (p = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS There is evidence for the utility of a HITT-MD protocol for dynamic exercise/sports clearance. Exercise testing progression and concussion clearance should include a dynamic HITT-MD protocol to ascertain no late phase dynamic EI. Dysautonomia and/or vestibulocular aggravation may be contributors to late phase EI.

In the present study, we generated neutralization-escape mutants, using 6 different monoclonal antibodies, and studied the effect of these neutralization-escape mutations on in vitro and in vivo fitness. These data provide a mechanism for overcoming neutralization escape by use of cocktails of cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that recognize residues within the glycoprotein that are important for virus replication and virulence.","output":"Escape From Monoclonal Antibody Neutralization Affects Henipavirus Fitness In Vitro and In Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Treating and reusing wastewater can augment water scarcity in water-stressed regions in the world. Additionally, wastewater streams contain useful resources that can be recovered and recycled to improve the economics of the water treatment processes. Another aspect that has been reported in the past few decades is the detection of novel contaminants of concern in the wastewater samples that often escape treatment and remediation. Studies have demonstrated that the conventional wastewater treatment practices are not sufficient to address resource recovery and emerging contaminants aspects. In this chapter, first, conventional wastewater treatment process based on activated sludge is presented, and subsequently novel wastewater treatment methods have been discussed. Theoretical aspect of each method is described, and its implementation in pilot or full-scale study has been highlighted. For increasing the water recovery rate from waste streams, membrane-based treatment technologies such as reverse osmosis will be crucial. Ion-exchange, adsorption, microalgal, and bioelectrochemical systems can be advantageous from resource recovery perspective. Further, epidemiological aspects of wastewater have been highlighted and the recent spread of COVID-19 has been discussed with respect to the virus detection in toilet wastewater. ? 2021 Elsevier Inc.

Nonetheless, new and emerging infections remain a threat that is likely to exacerbate in the coming years with continued globalization and climate change. More effective strategies of pathogen inactivation and more vigilant horizon screening are hoped to abate the risk. Additionally, allogeneic transfusion has repeatedly been shown to be associated with worsening of outcomes in patients, including the documented increased risk of infections (often nosocomial) in recipients of transfusions. The underlying mechanism is likely to be related to immunosuppressive effects of allogeneic blood, iron content, and bacterial contamination.

However, it can also place other stresses on workers outside of their work. This study determines the effect of COVID-19 on symptoms of negative and positive mental health and the workforces experience with various sources of support. Effect modification by demographic variables was also studied. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study, conducted between 2 April and 4 May 2020 (two waves), led to a convenience sample of 4509 health-care workers in Flanders (Belgium), including paramedics (40.6%), nurses (33.4%), doctors (13.4%) and management staff (12.2%). About three in four were employed in university and acute hospitals (29.6%), primary care practices (25.7%), residential care centers (21.3%) or care sites for disabled and mental health care. In each of the two waves, participants were asked how frequently (on a scale of 0C10) they experienced positive and negative mental health symptoms during normal circumstances and during last week, referred to as before and during COVID-19, respectively. These symptoms were stress, hypervigilance, fatigue, difficulty sleeping, unable to relax, fear, irregular lifestyle, flashback, difficulty concentrating, feeling unhappy and dejected, failing to recognize their own emotional response, doubting knowledge and skills and feeling uncomfortable within the team. Associations between COVID-19 and mental health symptoms were estimated by cumulative logit models and reported as odds ratios. The needed support was our secondary outcome and was reported as the degree to which health-care workers relied on sources of support and how they experienced them. RESULTS: All symptoms were significantly more pronounced during versus before COVID-19. For hypervigilance, there was a 12-fold odds (odds ratio 12.24, 95% confidence interval 11.11C13.49) during versus before COVID-19. Positive professional symptoms such as the feeling that one can make a difference were less frequently experienced. The association between COVID-19 and mental health was generally strongest for the age group 30C49 years, females, nurses and residential care centers. Health-care workers reported to rely on support from relatives and peers. A considerable proportion, respectively, 18 and 27%, reported the need for professional guidance from psychologists and more support from their leadership. CONCLUSIONS: The toll of the crisis has been heavy on health-care workers. Those who carry leadership positions at an organizational or system level should take this opportunity to develop targeted strategies to mitigate key stressors of health-care workers mental well-being.","output":"COVID-19 is having a destructive impact on health-care workers mental well-being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Awake tracheal intubation remains the gold standard for managing a predicted difficult airway.

There is minimal information on potential co-pathogens in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in the US. We analyzed pathogens, antimicrobial use, and healthcare utilization in hospitalized US patients with and without severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included patients with > 1 day of inpatient admission and discharge/death between March 1 and May 31, 2020 at 241 US acute care hospitals in the BD Insights Research Database. We assessed microbiological testing data, antimicrobial utilization in admitted patients with 24 h of antimicrobial therapy, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: A total of 141,621 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (17,003 [12.0%] positive) and 449,339 patients were not tested. Most (> 90%) patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 had additional microbiologic testing performed compared with 41.9% of SARS-CoV-2-untested patients. Non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen rates were 20.9% for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients compared with 21.3 and 27.9% for SARS-CoV-2-negative and ?untested patients, respectively. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens (45.5, 44.1, and 43.5% for SARS-CoV-2-positive, ?negative, and ?untested patients). SARS-CoV-2-positive patients had higher rates of hospital-onset (versus admission-onset) non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens compared with SARS-CoV-2-negative or ?untested patients (42.4, 22.2, and 19.5%, respectively), more antimicrobial usage (68.0, 45.2, and 25.1% of patients), and longer hospital LOS (mean [standard deviation (SD)] of 8.6 [11.4], 5.1 [8.9], and 4.2 [8.0] days) and intensive care unit (ICU) LOS (mean [SD] of 7.8 [8.5], 3.6 [6.2], and 3.6 [5.9] days). For all groups, the presence of a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen was associated with increased hospital LOS (mean [SD] days for patients with versus without a non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogen: 13.7 [15.7] vs 7.3 [9.6] days for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, 8.2 [11.5] vs 4.3 [7.9] days for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients, and 7.1 [11.0] vs 3.9 [7.4] days for SARS-CoV-2-untested patients). CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar rates of non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive, ?negative, and ?untested patients, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher rates of hospital-onset infections, greater antimicrobial usage, and extended hospital and ICU LOS.

HALO was selected for this study becuase it is the largest health system serving Asian Americans in Sacramento Co., CA. About one-third of their patients (9000) are Asian [primarily Hmong and other SE Asains). The hypothesis we tested was based on UC Davis's prior completed research that bilingual/bicultural Hmong lay health workers significantly increased screenings for HBV and colorectal cancer screening in randomized controlled community trials among Asians who largely had limited English proficiency. Our premise was to apply this concept to a clinical setting through HALO's bilingual/bicultural medical assistants (MAs). By comparing baseline (prior to the initiation of our funding) to 3 years of collaboration, we observed an overall 13.3% increase (surpassing our 10% goal) in cancer screenings & prevention/control behaviors. The largest percentage increases were in mammography (20.3%), colorectal cancer screening (11.6%), and Pap tests (7.9%).vaccination (2.8%).

A major adjustment was to learn that the electronic health systems used by community health centers such as HALO were not intended for reseearch purposes. While primary care provider time was less flexible, we found that MAs who reflect the HALO patient population were very receptive to training. We provided training through 10 Saturday academies, in-person and later delivered virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic.

More rigorous evaluation approaches to link our efforts to the impact of our work would have been preferred, but would have needed to be more resource-intensive. However, we anticipate that the equipping of MAs in new competencies and tools we provided for patients in various languages as infographics will be the bases for sustained effectiveness.

METHODOLOGY: An exploratory, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 444 participants, using a non-probability convenience sampling method. English-speaking participants from the medical field aged 18 and above were included in the study. The validated questionnaire was administered online and distributed across social media platforms from May-July 2020.

Given the importance of this potential connection, we present here a molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis that explains well these findings and will serve to explore the potential CNS damage in COVID-19 patients. The model explaining the cascade effects from COVID-19 to CNS is developed by using bioinformatic tools. It includes the post-translational modification of host proteins in the lungs by viral proteins, the transport of modified host proteins via exosomes out the lungs, and the disruption of protein-protein interaction in the CNS by these modified host proteins. Our hypothesis is supported by finding 44 proteins significantly expressed in the CNS which are associated with PD and whose interactions can be perturbed by 24 host proteins significantly expressed in the lungs. These 24 perturbators are found to interact with viral proteins and to form part of the cargoes of exosomes in human tissues. The joint set of perturbators and PD-vulnerable proteins form a tightly connected network with significantly more connections than expected by selecting a random cluster of proteins of similar size from the human proteome. The molecular-level mechanistic hypothesis presented here provides several routes for the cascading of effects from the lungs of COVID-19 patients to PD. In particular, the disruption of autophagy/ubiquitination processes appears as an important mechanism that triggers the generation of large amounts of exosomes containing perturbators in their cargo, which would insult several PD-vulnerable proteins, potentially triggering Parkinsonism in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Cascading from SARS-CoV-2 to Parkinson's Disease through Protein-Protein Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the category of rare inherited genetic disorders, phenylketonuria is a prominent example. Here, the defective phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme fails to catalyze conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine. This leads to not only excess deposition of phenylalanine leading to phenylalanine toxicity but also precludes the production of important glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters, leading to epileptic disorders, microcephaly, low intelligence quotient etc. For long, specialized food products are considered as preferred solution to prevent disease outcome. Different medical diets are developed for managing phenylketonuria includes amino acid mixtures, protein hydrolysates, cofactor-based therapy, large neutral amino acids and glycomacropeptides. However, despite the advent of alternate forms of diet products, the central form of treatment has still been free amino acid mixture. The formulated diet is by and large expensive and in-depth evaluation of several factors which contribute to the expense of medicated diet is requisite to create effective yet affordable avenues for management of disease. For this, we have discussed the role of various factors involved in increasing price of medicated diet and presented possible solutions to it. We have also extensively reviewed prevalence of disease, commercial diet for PKU patients, and their associated limitations. Overall, this is the first attempt to present a holistic view of balance between the overall impact of diet associated therapy and weighing it against the associated finances incurred.","output":"Food Regime for Phenylketonuria: Presenting Complications and Possible Solutions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"N/A.","output":"Comparative impacts of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors versus angiotensin II receptor blockers on the risk of COVID-19 mortality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put a strain on health systems globally. Although Africa is the least affected region to date, it has the weakest health systems and an exponential rise in cases as has been observed in other regions, is bound to overwhelm its health systems. Early detection and isolation of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases are pivotal to the prevention and control of the pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all laboratory-confirmed cases should be isolated and treated in a health care facility; however, where this is not possible due to the health system capacity, patients can be isolated in re-purposed facilities or at home. An already very apparent future challenge for Africa is facility-based isolation of COVID-19 cases, given the already limited health infrastructure and health workforce, and the risk of nosocomial transmission. Use of repurposed facilities requires additional resources, including health workers. Home isolation, on the other hand, would be a challenge given the poor housing, overcrowding, inadequate access to water and sanitation, and stigma related to infectious disease that is prevalent in many African societies. Conflict settings on the continent pose an additional challenge to the prevention and control of COVID-19 with the resultant population displacements in overcrowded camps where access to social services is limited. These unique cultural, social, economic and developmental differences on the continent, call for a tailored approach to COVID-19 case management strategies. This article proposes three broad case management strategies based on the transmission scenarios defined by WHO, and the criteria and package of care for each option, for consideration by policy makers and governments in African countries. Moving forward, African countries should generate local evidence to guide the development of realistic home-grown strategies, protocol and equipment for the management of COVID-19 cases on the continent [Image: see text] .","output":"COVID-19 case management strategies: what are the options for Africa?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study employed a multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to model the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets in quiescent air. The approach is featured with a continuity equation being explicitly solved for water vapor, which allows comprehensively considering the effects of inhomogeneous humidity field on droplets evaporation and movement. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computations based on the approach achieved a satisfactory agreement with the theoretical models reported in the literature. The results demonstrated that the evaporation-generated vapor and super-saturated wet air exhaled from the respiratory tracks forms a vapor plume in front of the respiratory track opening, which, despite the short life time, significantly impedes the evaporation of the droplets captured in it. The study also revealed that due to the droplet size reduction induced by evaporation, both the number density of airborne droplets and mass concentration of inhalable pathogens remarkably increased, which can result in a higher risk of infection. Parametric studies were finally conducted to evaluate the factors affecting droplet evaporation. SUMMARY: The study demonstrated the importance of considering inhomogeneous humidity field when modelling the evaporation and dispersion of cough droplets. The multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian model presented in this study provides a comprehensive approach to address different influential factors in a wide parametric range, which will enhance the assessment of the health risks associated with droplet exposure.","output":"Modelling of evaporation of cough droplets in inhomogeneous humidity fields using the multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across the world, scholars are racing to predict the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19. Such predictions are often pursued by numerically simulating epidemics with a large number of plausible combinations of relevant parameters. It is essential that any forecast of the epidemic trajectory derived from the resulting ensemble of simulated curves is presented with confidence intervals that communicate the uncertainty associated with the forecast. Here we argue that the state-of-the-art approach for summarizing ensemble statistics does not capture crucial epidemiological information. In particular, the current approach systematically suppresses information about the projected trajectory peaks. The fundamental problem is that each time step is treated separately in the statistical analysis. We suggest using curve-based descriptive statistics to summarize trajectory ensembles. The results presented allow researchers to report more representative confidence intervals, resulting in more realistic projections of epidemic trajectories and -- in turn -- enable better decision making in the face of the current and future pandemics.","output":"Fixed-time descriptive statistics underestimate extremes of epidemic curve ensembles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Good sleep quality is associated with a diverse range of positive outcomes such as better health, less daytime sleepiness, well-being, and proper psychological functioning. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality leads to many metabolic, endocrine, and immune changes. Many studies have shown changes in sleep schedule along with worsening of sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among students of a medical college in Kathmandu, Nepal from January 13, 2021, to February 15, 2021. A stratified random sampling technique was used. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Questionnaires that were completely filled were included and analyzed using STATA vs. 15. Results 168 medical students filled out the questionnaires with a response rate of 88.42%. 30.36% (n=51) of respondents were having poor quality of sleep (PSQI total score of > 5) with an average PSQI score of 4.242.19. Unadjusted logistic regression analysis showed significantly higher odds of poor quality of sleep among females (OR, 2.25; CI, 1.14-4.43) comparing to male and the relation persists even adjusting with age and year in medical school (aOR, 2.81; CI, 1.35-5.86) Adjusting with age and gender 4 (th)-year MBBS students were 82% less likely to have a poor quality of sleep compared to 2 (nd)-year MBBS students (aOR, 0.18; CI, 0.04-0.76).

METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted via an anonymous electronic survey sent to 11 large academic medical centers (Physician Wellness Academic Consortium) between January 2017 and September 2018. The survey included the Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) and an abbreviated form of the PROMIS Sleep-related impairment (SRI) scale. Two-sample t-tests and chi-square exact tests were used for analysis (p < 0.05). RESULTS Two hundred forty-seven radiology residents responded to the survey. Out of these, 36.2% reported burnout, 37.4% endorsed PF, 64.8% reported sleep-related impairment, 7.6% expressed ITL. There were no significant differences between genders. Burnout was associated with reduced PF, increased sleep-impairment (p < 0.001 for both) and increased ITL (p = 0.02). Lower PF, peer support, perceived appreciation for and meaningfulness in work, alignment of organizational and personal values, self-compassion, and higher sleep impairment were associated with burnout (p < 0.001 for all). Burnout was associated with perceptions of less support from department leaders (p = 0.003), control over schedules (p = 0.001) and helpfulness of electronic health record systems (p = 0.01).

Although universally considered to be important, faculty and resident wellness is rarely evaluated in an objective way. We sought to evaluate and compare faculty and resident wellness using simple and well-supported scales. Methods: Full-time faculty and residents at a suburban EM residency program were surveyed using an online, anonymous survey. We utilized two scales: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS), a validated psychometric scale, used across multiple industries, designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS), another validated scale used to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. The percent of faculty and residents with mild to severe levels of depression, anxiety and stress, as well as degree of resiliency within the two groups was determined. Differences between the faculty and residents with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results: 20 (77%) full-time faculty and 21 (78%) residents completed the survey. 10% of faculty and 33% of residents were measured to have some degree of depression, ranging from mild to severe (Difference 23%, CI: - 3, 49, p= 0.08) with 0% of faculty and 19% of residents rating as severe. 10% of faculty and 38% of residents were measured to have some degree of anxiety (Difference 28%, CI: 2, 54, p<0.05), with 0% of faculty and 19% of residents rating as severe. 10% of faculty and 48% of residents were measured to have some degree of stress (Difference 38%, CI: 11, 65, p<0.01), with 0% of faculty and 10% of residents rating as severe. The average faculty resiliency score was 4.1 compared to 3.8 for the residents (Difference NS). One faculty member (6%) and two residents (10%) scored as having low resiliency (Difference NS). Conclusion: Although resiliency levels appear to be similar, faculty have significantly less anxiety and stress than the residents, and a trend toward less depression.

This review focuses on perinatal outcomes following URTI during pregnancy. Few data exist on the explicit topic of URTI and adverse perinatal outcomes. The entire URTI burden among pregnant women is not properly represented by the studies included in this review, because only those infections severe enough to warrant hospitalization have been studied. Most probably, the number of URTIs in pregnant women not requiring hospitalization is far larger, but this has yet to be quantified. Clearly, there are logistical barriers to obtaining such statistics. Severe URTI requiring hospitalization during pregnancy was noted to be associated with adverse perinatal complications. URTI was found to be positively correlated with preterm delivery (PTD; less than 37 weeks gestation), lower birth weight, and cesarean deliveries, without a significant effect on the rates of perinatal mortality or low Apgar scores. There appears to be a possible link between various infectious processes that occur during pregnancy and the outcome of a PTD. The inflammatory environment present during infection includes high levels of cytokines that are known to increase prostaglandins, which, in turn, can induce preterm birth.

We sought to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac injury and hypertension during the current coronavirus pandemic. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The clinical data of 366 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed. The clinical signs and laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Two independent, experienced clinicians reviewed and analyzed the data. RESULTS: Cardiac injury was found in 11.19% (30/268) of enrolled patients. 93.33% (28/30) of cardiac injury cases were in the severe group. The laboratory findings indicated that white blood cells, neutrophils, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase were positively associated with cardiac injury marker. Compared with healthy controls, the 190 patients without prior hypertension have higher Ang level, of which 16 (8.42%) patients had a rise in blood pressure to the diagnostic criteria of hypertension during hospitalization, with a significantly increased level of the cTnI, procalcitonin, angiotensin-II (Ang) than those normal blood pressure ones. Multivariate analysis indicated that elevated age, cTnI, the history of hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors for illness severity. The predictive model, based on the four parameters and gender, has a good ability to identify the clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (area under the curve: 0.932, sensitivity: 98.67%, specificity: 75.68%). CONCLUSION: Hypertension, sometimes accompanied by elevated cTnI, may occur in COVID-19 patients and become a sequela.

Then we exposed these mice to PM2.5 or saline to explore the underling mechanism of cardiac injury in hyperlipidemia mice. The hyperlipemia mice are more susceptible to heart damage caused by PM2.5 exposure. The participation of oxidative stress, cell apoptosis and Ca2+ related mechanism could be observed in this model. After NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) treatment, the oxidative stress level induced by PM2.5 exposure significantly decreased in hyperlipemia mice. NAC effectively alleviated cardiac injury, improved the imbalance of calcium and attenuated apoptosis induced by PM2.5 exposure in hyperlipemia mice. The strong oxidative stress in hyperlipemia mice could lead to calcium homeostasis imbalance and activation of apoptosis-related pathways. This mechanism of PM2.5-induced myocardial injury was also verified in vitro.

A prospectively validated method to predict the need for ventilation in COVID-19 patients is essential to help triage patients, allocate resources, and prevent emergency intubations and their associated risks. METHODS: In a multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning algorithm for prediction of invasive mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients within 24 h of an initial encounter. We enrolled patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted to five United States health systems between March 24 and May 4, 2020. RESULTS: 197 patients were enrolled in the REspirAtory Decompensation and model for the triage of covid-19 patients: a prospective studY (READY) clinical trial.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study targeted the population of Oman and was carried out during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic from 11th August 2020 to 7th September 2020. This study utilized the online survey most appropriately designed for the population. The survey was distributed to the public through social media and text messages. The survey was translated into the four main spoken languages in Oman, which are Arabic, English, Swahili, and Hindi. RESULTS: A total of 943 residents responded to the online survey. The majority of respondents reported that they are ready/ready to a great extent to practice physical distancing (61.9%) during the pandemic compared to 34.9% not sure/ready to some extent and 3.2% not ready at all for physical distancing. It was found that financial factors, religious and cultural-norms had the strongest negative-impact to maintain physical distancing. While level of responsibility, governmental legislations, and fear of getting or transmitting the infection had the strongest positive impact to maintain physical distancing. Males reported a greater financial and religious negative impact of physical distancing with p-values of 0.002 and 0.001, respectively. Females reported a greater positive impact of family and friend's support and legislation with p-values of 0.046 and 0.008, respectively.

The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the international committee for the classification of viruses (ICTV). The disease caused by this virus was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In addition to pulmonary manifestations, hematological changes such as lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation dysfunction can also be found in COVID-19 patients, and the mechanism is still unclear. Case data and methods: A total of 633 COVID-19 patients from Wuhan hospital of China were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical case data of all patients were collected, including gender, age, chronic underlying diseases, outcome, and blood laboratory test results. The hematological features of COVID-19 patients and the factors affecting their outcome were analyzed. Results: Of 633 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 62 years (interquartile range, IQR, 51.0-70.0) and 330 (52%) were men. Lymphocytopenia (lymphocyte count, 1.0 109 / L [IQR, 0.7-1.4]) occurred in 317/607 patients (52%), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100  109/ L) occurred in 14/62 death patients (23%), prolonged prothrombin time (13.8 seconds [IQR, 13.1-15.1]) in 289/486 patients (59%), increased D-Dimer level (0.7 mg/L[IQR, 0.2-2.9]) in 230/411 patients (57%) and increased C-reactive protein levels (10.7 mg/L [IQR, 2.2-49.7]) in 217/426 patients (51%) . Compared with the survival patients, death patients have higher white blood cell count (11.7  109/L [IQR, 8.4 to 15.6]), neutrophil count (10.8  109/L [IQR, 7.8 to 13.9]), neutrophil count/lymphocyte count (20.5 [IQR, 12.4-34.2]), activated partial thromboplastin time (36.8 seconds [IQR, 31.3-42.3]), prothrombin time (17.1 seconds [IQR, 14.7 to 19.7]), D-Dimer level (4.6 mg/L [IQR, 1.0 to 7.8]), C-reactive protein level (111.8 mg/L (IQR, 53.1 to 196.6), and low lymphocyte count (0.5  109/L [IQR, 0.3 to 0.7]). The results of logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that age, neutrophil count, prothrombin time, and C-reactive protein were risk factors for patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: Hematological changes are common in patients with COVID-19. The early stage of the disease is mainly characterized by lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and the late stage may be characterized by more severe lymphocytopenia, even neutrophils elevation, elevated C-reactive protein, and severe coagulation disorder. The pathogenesis may be mediated by a direct viral infection and/or indirect immunopathology.

Innovative approaches to coordinate financing have recently been tested as part of a broader development agenda for humanitarian response. Adopting a system that enables donors to invest in disease outbreaks rather than actors represents an opportunity to deliver a more cost-effective, transparent, and unified global response to infectious disease outbreaks.

However, these benefits have been achieved at a massive cost to welfare and the economy. This commentary draws lessons from the COVID-19 crisis for climate change. It discusses whether there are more sustainable ways of achieving these benefits, as part of a more desirable, low carbon resilient future, in a more planned, inclusive and less disruptive way. In order to achieve this, we argue for a clearer social contract between citizens and the state. We discuss how COVID-19 has demonstrated that behaviours can change abruptly, that these changes come at a cost, that we need a social mandate to ensure these changes remain in the long-term, and that science plays an important role in informing this process. We suggest that deliberative engagement mechanisms, such as citizens assemblies and juries, could be a powerful way to build a social mandate for climate action post-COVID-19. This would enable behaviour changes to become more accepted, embedded and bearable in the long-term and provide the basis for future climate action.","output":"Building a Social Mandate for Climate Action: Lessons from COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES This study sought to assess the comparative effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) over implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) alone in older Medicare patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND Despite growing numbers of older patients with HFrEF, the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in this group are largely unknown. METHODS A cohort of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years of age with HFrEF and enrolled in Medicare Part D who underwent CRT-D or ICD implantation from January 2008 to August 2015 was identified. Beneficiaries were divided by age (65-74, 75-84, and 85+ years), and outcomes were compared between the CRT-D and ICD groups after inverse probability weighting. RESULTS Compared with the ICD group, the CRT-D group was older and more likely to be White, be female, and have left bundle branch block. After weighting, overall complications were high across age and device groups (14%-20%). The 1-year mortality was high across all groups. In the 2 oldest age strata, the hazard of death was lower in the CRT-D group (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.86-0.95 and HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, respectively; P < 0.001); the hazard of heart failure hospitalization was lower for CRT-D vs ICD in the 85+ years age group (HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.74-0.92; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In older Medicare beneficiaries undergoing ICD with or without CRT, complications and 1-year mortality were high. Compared with ICD alone, CRT-D was associated with a lower hazard of mortality in patients 74 years of age and lower hazard of HF hospitalization in those 85 years of age. These findings support the use of CRT in eligible older patients undergoing ICD implantation.","output":"Complications and Mortality Following CRT-D Versus ICD Implants in Older Medicare Beneficiaries With Heart Failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In its response to safeguard the country in face of the global COVID-19 outbreak, the Trinidad and Tobago, Ministry of Health continues to provide up-to-date information of the country&#039;s response to this situation","output":"Trinidad and Tobago COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus) Update #60"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antiviral interventions are urgently required to support vaccination programmes and reduce the global burden of COVID-19. Prior to initiation of large-scale clinical trials, robust preclinical data in support of candidate plausibility are required.

This work provides cross-validation for the recent report demonstrating potent antiviral activity of probenecid against SARS-CoV-2 in preclinical models (1). Vero E6 cells were pre-incubated with probenecid, across a 7-point concentration range, or control media for 2 hours before infection with SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2/Human/Liverpool/REMRQ0001/2020, Pango B; MOI 0.05). Probenecid or control media was then reapplied and plates incubated for 48 hours. Cells were fixed with 4% v/v paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet and cytopathic activity quantified by spectrophotometry at 590 nm. Syrian golden hamsters (n=5 per group) were intranasally inoculated with virus (SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant B.1.617.2; 10(3) PFU/hamster) for 24 hours prior to treatment. Hamsters were treated with probenecid or vehicle for 4 doses. Hamsters were ethically euthanised before quantification of total and sub-genomic pulmonary viral RNAs. No inhibition of cytopathic activity was observed for probenecid at any concentration in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, no reduction in either total or subgenomic RNA was observed in terminal lung samples from hamsters on day 3 (P > 0.05). Body weight of uninfected hamsters remained stable throughout the course of the experiment whereas both probenecid- (6 C 9% over 3 days) and vehicle-treated (5 C 10% over 3 days) infected hamsters lost body weight which was comparable in magnitude (P > 0.5). The presented data do not support probenecid as a SARS-CoV-2 antiviral. These data do not support use of probenecid in COVID-19 and further analysis is required prior to initiation of clinical trials to investigate the potential utility of this drug.","output":"Lack of antiviral activity of probenecid in Vero E6 cells and Syrian golden hamsters: a need for better understanding of inter-lab differences in preclinical assays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infection produces a response of the innate immune system causing oxidative stress and a strong inflammatory reaction termed cytokine stormthat is one of the leading causes of death.

We aimed to investigate the alterations in the circulating levels of PON1, CCL2 and galectin-3 in 126 patients with COVID-19 and their interactions with clinical variables and analytical parameters. A machine learning approach was used to identify predictive markers of the disease. For comparisons, we recruited 45 COVID-19 negative patients and 50 healthy individuals. Our approach identified a synergy between oxidative stress, inflammation and fibrogenesis in positive patients that is not observed in negative patients. PON1 activity was the parameter with the greatest power to discriminate between patients who were either positive or negative for COVID-19, while their levels of CCL2 and galectin-3 were similar.

Recently, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed to kill millions of people worldwide and is dangerous to society health, survival, and livelihood. The people with cardiovascular problems are noticed as most common patients of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is a greater risk of mortality and morbidity in these patients than other patients of COVID-19. In the heart, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and response effect of hyperactivity with angiotensin II associated to the renin-angiotensin mechanism are key factors of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and congestive heart failure. Recent Findings: Mortality rates have been observed about 10.5% cases in patients with cardiovascular disease; however, a mortality rate of 52% was recorded in patients with heart failure, while 12% recovered ultimately. The occupancy of intense injury controlled by troponin elevation was a noteworthy factor in relation to mortality. Among 187 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, about 35% were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (CVD) history and 28% with raised troponin. Troponin elevation was identified more frequently (55%) in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Mortality rate in patients without cardiovascular diseases and normal troponin was 7.6%, normal troponin and cardiovascular disease with 13.3%, augmented troponin and without cardiovascular disease 37.5%, however 69.4% among cardiovascular disease and advanced troponin.

In infected cells, N proteins are present at the replication-transcription complexes (RTCs), the sites of CoV RNA synthesis. It has been shown that N proteins are important for viral replication and that the one of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a commonly used model CoV, interacts with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a component of the RTCs. These two aspects of the CoV life cycle, however, have not been linked. We found that the MHV N protein binds exclusively to nsp3 and not other RTC components by using a systematic yeast two-hybrid approach, and we identified two distinct regions in the N protein that redundantly mediate this interaction. A selective N protein variant carrying point mutations in these two regions fails to bind nsp3 in vitro, resulting in inhibition of its recruitment to RTCs in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to the wild-type N protein, this N protein variant impairs the stimulation of genomic RNA and viral mRNA transcription in vivo and in vitro, which in turn leads to impairment of MHV replication and progeny production. Altogether, our results show that N protein recruitment to RTCs, via binding to nsp3, is an essential step in the CoV life cycle because it is critical for optimal viral RNA synthesis. IMPORTANCE CoVs have long been regarded as relatively harmless pathogens for humans. Severe respiratory tract infection outbreaks caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, however, have caused high pathogenicity and mortality rates in humans. These outbreaks highlighted the relevance of being able to control CoV infections. We used a model CoV, MHV, to investigate the importance of the recruitment of N protein, a central component of CoV virions, to intracellular platforms where CoVs replicate, transcribe, and translate their genomes. By identifying the principal binding partner at these intracellular platforms and generating a specific mutant, we found that N protein recruitment to these locations is crucial for promoting viral RNA synthesis. Moreover, blocking this recruitment strongly inhibits viral infection. Thus, our results explain an important aspect of the CoV life cycle and reveal an interaction of viral proteins that could be targeted in antiviral therapies.","output":"Nucleocapsid Protein Recruitment to Replication-Transcription Complexes Plays a Crucial Role in Coronaviral Life Cycle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This review provides current information on safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant and lactating patients.

Those species pose a threat, as theyespecially the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus)can transmit many pathogens. The aim of this study is a nationwide overview on the situation of alien mosquitoes in Austria. Using traps representing ideal breeding sites for those mosquitoes, we collected, counted and identified the species of the mosquito eggs laid in the traps. The Asian tiger mosquito was found at two sites, once in Tyrol, where this species has been reported before, and for the first time in the province of Lower Austria. The Asian bush mosquito (Aedes japonicus) was widespread and abundant in Austria. Although it was found in all provinces, the Asian bush mosquito was more often found in the South than the North and more eggs were collected in urban/industrial/transport areas than in (mostly) natural areas. Further, more eggs from the Asian bush mosquito were found in samples collected at higher daily mean temperatures, and fewer eggs in samples collected at higher daily maximum wind speeds. The results of this study will help to better understand the risk from alien mosquitoes to human health in Austria and will be useful to show future changes in the distribution of those species. ABSTRACT: In Austria, only fragmented information on the occurrence of alien and potentially invasive mosquito species exists. The aim of this study is a nationwide overview on the situation of those mosquitoes in Austria. Using a nationwide uniform protocol for the first time, mosquito eggs were sampled with ovitraps at 45 locations in Austria at weekly intervals from May to October 2020. The sampled eggs were counted and the species were identified by genetic analysis. The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus was found at two sites, once in Tyrol, where this species has been reported before, and for the first time in the province of Lower Austria, at a motorway rest stop. The Asian bush mosquito Aedes japonicus was widespread in Austria. It was found in all provinces and was the most abundant species in the ovitraps by far. Aedes japonicus was more abundant in the South than in the North and more eggs were found in habitats with artificial surfaces than in (semi-) natural areas. Further, the number of Ae. japonicus eggs increased with higher ambient temperature and decreased with higher wind speed. The results of this study will contribute to a better estimation of the risk of mosquito-borne disease in Austria and will be a useful baseline for a future documentation of changes in the distribution of those species.","output":"First Nationwide Monitoring Program for the Detection of Potentially Invasive Mosquito Species in Austria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers the selection of Keir Starmer as the new Leader of the Labour Party within the context of the Stark model for explaining leadership election outcomes.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate heterogeneity in associations between various heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS We used data from the CAPACITY-COVID registry and LEOSS study. Multivariable Poisson regression models were fitted to assess the association between different types of pre-existing heart disease and in-hospital mortality. A total of 16 511 patients with COVID-19 were included (21.1% aged 66-75 years; 40.2% female) and 31.5% had a history of heart disease. Patients with heart disease were older, predominantly male, and often had other comorbid conditions when compared with those without. Mortality was higher in patients with cardiac disease (29.7%; n = 1545 vs. 15.9%; n = 1797). However, following multivariable adjustment, this difference was not significant [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.15; P = 0.12 (corrected for multiple testing)]. Associations with in-hospital mortality by heart disease subtypes differed considerably, with the strongest association for heart failure (aRR 1.19, 95% CI 1.10-1.30; P < 0.018) particularly for severe (New York Heart Association class III/IV) heart failure (aRR 1.41, 95% CI 1.20-1.64; P < 0.018). None of the other heart disease subtypes, including ischaemic heart disease, remained significant after multivariable adjustment. Serious cardiac complications were diagnosed in <1% of patients. CONCLUSION Considerable heterogeneity exists in the strength of association between heart disease subtypes and in-hospital mortality.

How ethically demanding situations are handled affects employees moral stress and job satisfaction. AIM: Describe priority-setting dilemmas, moral distress and support experienced by nurses and physicians across medical specialties in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Western Norway. RESEARCH DESIGN: A cross-sectional hospital-based survey was conducted from 23 April to 11 May 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Ethical approval granted by the Regional Research Ethics Committee in Western Norway (131421). FINDINGS: Among the 1606 respondents, 67% had experienced priority-setting dilemmas the previous two weeks. Healthcare workers who were directly involved in COVID-19 care, were redeployed or worked in psychiatry/addiction medicine experienced it more often. Although 59% of the respondents had seen adverse consequences due to resource scarcity, severe consequences were rare. Moral distress levels were generally low (2.9 on a 0C10 scale), but higher in selected groups (redeployed, managers and working in psychiatry/addiction medicine). Backing from existing collegial and managerial structures and routines, such as discussions with colleagues and receiving updates and information from managers that listened and acted upon feedback, were found more helpful than external support mechanisms. Priority-setting guidelines were also helpful. DISCUSSION: By including all medical specialties, nurses and physicians, and various institutions, the study provides information on how the COVID-19 mitigation also influenced those not directly involved in the COVID-19 treatment of patients. In the next stages of the pandemic response, support for healthcare professionals directly involved in outbreak-affected patients, those redeployed or those most impacted by mitigation strategies must be a priority.

Evidence-based immunization policies and practices are responsible for this success and are supported by epidemiology that has generated scientific evidence for informing policy and practice. The purpose of this report is to highlight the role of epidemiology in the development of immunization policy and successful intervention in public health practice that has resulted in a measurable public health impact: the control and elimination of VPDs in the United States. Examples in which epidemiology informed immunization policy were collected from a literature review and consultation with experts who have been working in this field for the past 30 years. Epidemiologic examples (e.g., thimerosal-containing vaccines and the alleged association between the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism) are presented to describe challenges that epidemiologists have addressed. Finally, we describe ongoing challenges to the nations ability to sustain high vaccination coverage, particularly with concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness, increasing use of religious and philosophical belief exemptions to vaccination, and vaccine hesitancy. Learning from past and current experiences may help epidemiologists anticipate and address current and future challenges to respond to emerging infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, with new vaccines and enhance public health impact of immunization programs for years to come.","output":"The Role of Epidemiology in Informing United States Childhood Immunization Policy and Practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Performing large scale numerical simulations is essential to understand the explosion mechanism of core-collapse supernovae.

I argue that public opinion on UBI provides few electoral incentives to push for social policy change. Using prepandemic data from 21 European democracies and pandemic data from the UK, I show that political support for UBI has been divided between different groups who advocate conflicting policy goals and who hold divergent views about existing welfare state arrangements. While support for UBI might have increased during the pandemic, the underlying political dividing lines are likely to have remained intact. Due to these enduring divisions and the stable support for existing social policy arrangements over an untested policy, the prospects for introducing UBI schemes in the post-pandemic world remain uncertain.","output":"COVID-19 and welfare state support: the case of universal basic income"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, there has been no vaccine or specific antiviral medication for treatment of the infection where supportive care and prevention of complications is the current management strategy In this work, the potential use of medicinal plants and more than 16 500 of their constituents was investigated within two suggested therapeutic strategies in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 including prevention of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis and replication, through targeting vital proteins and enzymes as well as modulation of the host's immunity through production of virulence factors Molecular docking studies on the viral enzymes 3Clpro, PLpro and RdRp suggested rocymosin B, verbascoside, rutin, caftaric acid, luteolin 7-rutinoside, fenugreekine and cyanidin 3-(6 ''-malonylglucoside) as promising molecules for further drug development Meanwhile, the medicinal plantsGlycyrrhiza glabra,Hibiscus sabdariffa,Cichorium intybus,Chrysanthemum coronarium,Nigella sativa,Anastatica hierochuntica,Euphorbia species,Psidium guajavaandEpilobium hirsutumwere enriched in compounds with the multi-targets PTGS2, IL2, IL1b, VCAM1 and TNF such as quercetin, ursolic acid, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, luteolin, glycerrhizin and apigenin Enriched pathways of the molecular targets included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TNF signaling pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway and JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway which are all closely related to inflammatory, innate and adaptive immune responses The present study identified natural compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 for furtherin vitroandin vivostudies and emphasizes the potential role of medicinal plants in the mitigation of SARS-CoV-2","output":"Potential role of medicinal plants and their constituents in the mitigation of SARS-CoV-2: identifying related therapeutic targets using network pharmacology and molecular docking analyses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we aimed to investigate the evolving debate over border closure in Korea during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, to address the main themes associated with border closure, and to discuss the factors that need to be considered when making such decisions.

It is necessary to understand public knowledge and behaviors if we are to effectively address the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that knowledge about COVID-19 influences participation in different behaviors including self-reports of purchasing more goods than usual, attending large gatherings, and using medical masks. METHODS: This study was funded and approved by the Institutional Review Board on March 17, 2020. The cross-sectional online survey of 1034 US residents aged 18 years or older was conducted on March 17, 2020. RESULTS: For every point increase in knowledge, the odds of participation in purchasing more goods (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95), attending large gatherings (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81-0.93), and using medical masks (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.50-0.62) decreased by 12%, 13%, and 44%, respectively.

However, ICIs demonstrated a modest benefit in treating breast cancer (BC), with the exception of certain subsets of triple-negative BCs. An immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment (TME), typically present in BC, is an important factor in the poor response to immunotherapy. After almost two decades of poor clinical trial results, cancer vaccines (CVs), an active immunotherapy, have come back in the spotlight because of some technological advancements, ultimately boosted by coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. In particular, neoantigens are emerging as the preferred targets for CVs, with gene-based and viral vectorCbased platforms in development. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles proved to be immunogenic and efficient delivery vehicles. Past clinical trials investigating CVs focused especially on the metastatic disease, where the TME is more likely compromised by inhibitory mechanisms. In this sense, favouring the use of CVs as monotherapy in premalignant or in the adjuvant setting and establishing combination treatments (i.e. CV plus ICI) in late-stage disease are promising strategies.

In the absence of an international standardized model for lung donor-recipient allocation, we set out to develop such a model based on the characteristics of past experiences with lung donors and recipients with the aim of improving the outcomes of the entire transplantation process. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 404 lung transplants carried out at the Reina Sofa University Hospital (Crdoba, Spain) over 23 years. We analyzed various clinical variables obtained via our experience of clinical practice in the donation and transplantation process. These were used to create various classification models, including classical statistical methods and also incorporating newer machine-learning approaches. RESULTS: The proposed model represents a powerful tool for donor-recipient matching, which in this current work, exceeded the capacity of classical statistical methods. The variables that predicted an increase in the probability of survival were: higher pre-transplant and post-transplant functional vital capacity (FVC), lower pre-transplant carbon dioxide (PCO2) pressure, lower donor mechanical ventilation, and shorter ischemia time. The variables that negatively influenced transplant survival were low forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) pre-transplant, lower arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, bilobar transplant, elderly recipient and donor, donor-recipient graft disproportion requiring a surgical reduction (Tailor), type of combined transplant, need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the surgery, death of the donor due to head trauma, hospitalization status before surgery, and female and male recipient donor sex. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the difficulty of the problem which required the introduction of other variables into the analysis. The combination of classical statistical methods and machine learning can support decision-making about the compatibility between donors and recipients.

This study aimed to examine risks of VTE and major bleeding in hospitalized and community-managed SARS-CoV-2 patients compared with control populations. METHODS: Using nationwide population-based registries, 30-day risks of VTE and major bleeding in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were compared with those of SARS-CoV-2 test-negative patients and with an external cohort of influenza patients. Medical records of all COVID-19 patients at six departments of infectious diseases in Denmark were reviewed in detail. RESULTS: The overall 30-day risk of VTE was 0.4% (40/9,460) among SARS-CoV-2 patients (16% hospitalized), 0.3% (649/226,510) among SARS-CoV-2 negative subjects (12% hospitalized), and 1.0% (158/16,281) among influenza patients (59% hospitalized). VTE risks were higher and comparable in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive (1.5%), SARS-CoV-2 negative (1.8%), and influenza patients (1.5%). Diagnosis of major bleeding was registered in 0.5% (47/9,460) of all SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals and in 2.3% of those hospitalized.

The analyses of mean differences revealed that women as compared to men, bachelor's and master's students as compared to post-master's students, and unemployed students as compared to employed students experienced greater fear of the outbreak. Also, those suffering from severe anxiety experienced greater fear of COVID-19 followed by those suffering from moderate, mild, and minimal anxiety. Moreover, knowing someone suffering from the coronavirus, being afraid that someone close might contract the virus, and believing that the current COVID-19 situation adversely affects academic performance were linked to higher levels of fear of the pandemic.

The presence of T(RM) prior to treatment or their induction is associated to the response to anti-Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy and the efficacy of cancer vaccines. Previous work by our group and others has shown that the intranasal route of vaccination allows more efficient induction of these cells in head and neck and lung mucosa, resulting in better tumor protection. The mechanisms of in vivo migration of these cells remains largely unknown, apart from the fact that they express the chemokine receptor CXCR6. METHODS: We used CXCR6-deficient mice and an intranasal tumor vaccination model targeting the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) E7 protein expressed by the TC-1 lung cancer epithelial cell line. The role of CXCR6 and its ligand, CXCL16, was analyzed using multiparametric cytometric techniques and Luminex assays. Human biopsies obtained from patients with lung cancer were also included in this study. RESULTS: We showed that CXCR6 was preferentially expressed by CD8(+) T(RM) after vaccination in mice and also on intratumoral CD8(+) T(RM) derived from human lung cancer. We also demonstrate that vaccination of Cxcr6-deficient mice induces a defect in the lung recruitment of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, preferentially in the T(RM) subsets. In addition, we found that intranasal vaccination with a cancer vaccine is less effective in these Cxcr6-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice, and this loss of efficacy is associated with decreased recruitment of local antitumor CD8(+) T(RM). Interestingly, intranasal, but not intramuscular vaccination induced higher and more sustained concentrations of CXCL16, compared with other chemokines, in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and pulmonary parenchyma. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates the in vivo role of CXCR6-CXCL16 axis in the migration of CD8(+) resident memory T cells in lung mucosa after vaccination, resulting in the control of tumor growth. This work reinforces and explains why the intranasal route of vaccination is the most appropriate strategy for inducing these cells in the head and neck and pulmonary mucosa, which remains a major objective to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1, especially in cold tumors.","output":"CXCR6 deficiency impairs cancer vaccine efficacy and CD8(+) resident memory T-cell recruitment in head and neck and lung tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) shows unusually high transmission rate and unique clinical characteristics, with key pathological mechanism","output":"Study of the Lymphocyte Change Between COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 Pneumonia Cases Suggesting Other Factors Besides Uncontrolled Inflammation Contributed to Multi-Organ Injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has evolved in each country, the approach to the laboratory assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has had to evolve as well.

During this developmental period, social media use is also emerging as a dominant mode of communication with peers, allowing for both risk and resilient behaviors that can impact well-being. OBJECTIVE: This exploratory study aims to examine how sexual minorities in middle school use social media, who they are connected to and for what purposes, and the associations between these behaviors and mental well-being compared with their heterosexual peers. METHODS: In our cross-sectional survey study of 1033 early adolescents aged between 10 and 16 years (average age 12.7, SD 1.21 years) from 4 middle school sites in the Northeastern United States, we conducted an exploratory study comparing sexual minorities (212/873, 24.3% of sample with known sexual orientation) with their heterosexual peers (n=661), obtaining an 84.46% (1033/1223; total possible) response rate. RESULTS: Sexual minorities reported having smaller networks on their favorite social media website (=?.57; P<.001), less often responded positively when friends shared good news (=?.35; P=.002), and less often tried to make friends feel better when they shared bad news (=?.30; P=.01). However, sexual minorities more often reported joining a group or web-based community to make themselves feel less alone (=.28; P=.003), unlike heterosexual youth. Sexual minorities had higher averages of loneliness and social isolation (=.19; P<.001) than heterosexual students. Sexual minorities were also twice as likely to have tried to harm themselves in the past (=.81; odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% CI 1.64-3.06; P<.001) and were more likely to have symptoms that reached the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression definition of depression (=.15; OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.08-1.25; P<.001). About 39.1% (83/212) of sexual minorities had no one to talk to about their sexual orientation. Sexual minorities were 1.5 times more likely to have joined a social media website their parents would disapprove (=.41; OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.14-1.97; P=.004) and more likely to report seeing videos related to self-harm (=.33; OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.06-1.83; P=.02) on the web than heterosexual youth. CONCLUSIONS: Given previous reports of supportive and safe web-based spaces for sexual minority youth, our findings demonstrated that sexual minority youth prefer to maintain small, close-knit web-based communities (apart from their families) to express themselves, particularly when reaching out to web-based communities to reduce loneliness.

AIM: To evaluate the long\\\\term pulmonary morbidity of respiratory viral infections during chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Childhood ALL survivors, aged 7 to 18 years, greater than 6 months posttreatment were recruited. Exclusion criteria included HSCT or proven bacterial/fungal respiratory infection during treatment. Subjects were classified into viral or control groups according to retrospective medical records that documented the presence of laboratory\\\\proven RVIs during chemotherapy. Symptom questionnaires (Liverpool, ISAAC) and lung function testing (spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity, forced oscillation technique to ATS/ERS standards) were then performed cross\\\\sectionally at the time of recruitment. RESULTS: Fifty\\\\four patients (31 viral, 23 control) were recruited: median (range) age 11.2 (7.2\\\\18.1) years, and at 4.9 (0.5\\\\13) years posttherapy. Abnormalities were detected in 17 (31%) individuals (8 viral, 9 control), with the most common being DLCO impairment (3 viral, 4 control) and reduced respiratory reactance at 5 Hz (5 viral, 6 control). Children with RVIs during chemotherapy reported more current respiratory symptoms, particularly wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9\\\\10.0; P = .09) and cough (OR, 2.7; 95% CI: 0.8\\\\9.5; P = .11).

Objective: To determine whether convalescent plasma would improve outcomes for critically ill adults with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: The ongoing Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP) enrolled and randomized 4763 adults with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 between March 9, 2020, and January 18, 2021, within at least 1 domain; 2011 critically ill adults were randomized to open-label interventions in the immunoglobulin domain at 129 sites in 4 countries. Follow-up ended on April 19, 2021. Interventions: The immunoglobulin domain randomized participants to receive 2 units of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma (total volume of 550 mL  150 mL) within 48 hours of randomization (n = 1084) or no convalescent plasma (n = 916). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary ordinal end point was organ support-free days (days alive and free of intensive care unit-based organ support) up to day 21 (range, -1 to 21 days; patients who died were assigned -1 day). The primary analysis was an adjusted bayesian cumulative logistic model. Superiority was defined as the posterior probability of an odds ratio (OR) greater than 1 (threshold for trial conclusion of superiority >99%). Futility was defined as the posterior probability of an OR less than 1.2 (threshold for trial conclusion of futility >95%). An OR greater than 1 represented improved survival, more organ support-free days, or both. The prespecified secondary outcomes included in-hospital survival; 28-day survival; 90-day survival; respiratory support-free days; cardiovascular support-free days; progression to invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal mechanical oxygenation, or death; intensive care unit length of stay; hospital length of stay; World Health Organization ordinal scale score at day 14; venous thromboembolic events at 90 days; and serious adverse events. Results: Among the 2011 participants who were randomized (median age, 61 [IQR, 52 to 70] years and 645/1998 [32.3%] women), 1990 (99%) completed the trial. The convalescent plasma intervention was stopped after the prespecified criterion for futility was met. The median number of organ support-free days was 0 (IQR, -1 to 16) in the convalescent plasma group and 3 (IQR, -1 to 16) in the no convalescent plasma group. The in-hospital mortality rate was 37.3% (401/1075) for the convalescent plasma group and 38.4% (347/904) for the no convalescent plasma group and the median number of days alive and free of organ support was 14 (IQR, 3 to 18) and 14 (IQR, 7 to 18), respectively. The median-adjusted OR was 0.97 (95% credible interval, 0.83 to 1.15) and the posterior probability of futility (OR <1.2) was 99.4% for the convalescent plasma group compared with the no convalescent plasma group. The treatment effects were consistent across the primary outcome and the 11 secondary outcomes. Serious adverse events were reported in 3.0% (32/1075) of participants in the convalescent plasma group and in 1.3% (12/905) of participants in the no convalescent plasma group. Conclusions and Relevance: Among critically ill adults with confirmed COVID-19, treatment with 2 units of high-titer, ABO-compatible convalescent plasma had a low likelihood of providing improvement in the number of organ support-free days.

Recognising the risk factors for non-contact injury in this population will aid future injury prevention strategies. OBJECTIVE To identify the risk factors for non-contact injury in adolescent cricket pace bowlers. METHODS We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, Embase, and the South African Journal of Sports Medicine to identify all experimental and observational studies reporting risk factors for non-contact injuries in pace bowlers (aged 12-19 years). The search syntax included terms relevant to cricket bowling, injury, and known risk factors for injury. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale were used to assess the risk of bias in the cohort and cross-sectional studies, respectively. RESULTS Sixteen studies (five cross-sectional studies, 11 cohort studies) comprising 687 participants (96% male, 75% playing cricket in Australia) met the selection criteria and were included for qualitative synthesis. Three cross-sectional studies were rated as high risk of bias and two as very high risk of bias. For the cohort studies, three were rated as low risk of bias, and eight as high risk of bias. Injury was associated with bowling biomechanics (excessive lateral trunk flexion and pelvis/hip kinematics), reduced trunk endurance, poor lumbo-pelvic-hip movement control, and early signs of lumbar bone stress. Conflicting results were found by studies examining the mixed technique, bowling workload and quadratus lumborum asymmetry. CONCLUSIONS The current systematic review identified a number bowling biomechanics and various neuromuscular deficiencies as risk factors for non-contact injury in adolescent pace bowlers. These factors may provide a useful target for future interventional research aiming to prevent injury in this population. Future studies should utilise prospective cohort designs, and ensure that participants are injury-free at baseline, confounding factors are well controlled and attrition rates are reported.

DATA SYNTHESIS: None. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of intracranial pressure monitoring in a patient with acute encephalitis following coronavirus disease 2019. Intracranial pressure data exhibited a high incidence of plateau waves with intracranial pressure insults above 40 mm Hg that required cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Intracranial compliance was low, and pressure reactivity was intact. It is probable that the combination of low intracranial compliance and intact pressure autoregulation explain the high degree of plateau intracranial pressure waves and intracranial pressure variability. This case illustrates that it could be of value to consider intracranial pressure monitoring in selected coronavirus disease 2019 patients with suspicion of increased intracranial pressure to be able to confirm and treat intracranial hypertension if needed.

As of 25 May 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 has caused 347,192 deaths around the world. The current evidence showed that severely ill patients tend to have a high concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-6, compared to those who are moderately ill. The high level of cytokines also indicates a poor prognosis in COVID-19.

We examined the impact of time to intubation and use of high-flow nasal cannula on clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six coronavirus disease 2019-specific ICUs across four university-affiliated hospitals in Atlanta, Georgia. PATIENTS: Adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who received high-flow nasal cannula or mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among 231 patients admitted to the ICU, 109 (47.2%) were treated with high-flow nasal cannula and 97 (42.0%) were intubated without preceding high-flow nasal cannula use. Of those managed with high-flow nasal cannula, 78 (71.6%) ultimately received mechanical ventilation. In total, 175 patients received mechanical ventilation; 44.6% were female, 66.3% were Black, and the median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 56C75 yr). Seventy-six patients (43.4%) were intubated within 8 hours of ICU admission, 57 (32.6%) between 8 and 24 hours of admission, and 42 (24.0%) greater than or equal to 24 hours after admission. Patients intubated within 8 hours were more likely to have diabetes, chronic comorbidities, and higher admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores. Mortality did not differ by time to intubation ( 8 hr: 38.2%; 8C24 hr: 31.6%;  24 hr: 38.1%; p = 0.7), and there was no association between time to intubation and mortality in adjusted analysis. Similarly, there was no difference in initial static compliance, duration of mechanical ventilation, or ICU length of stay by timing of intubation. High-flow nasal cannula use prior to intubation was not associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019, neither time from ICU admission to intubation nor high-flow nasal cannula use were associated with increased mortality.

Thanks to the scientific communitys unprecedented efforts, the atomic structure of several viral proteins has been promptly resolved. As the crucial mediator of host cell infection, the heavily glycosylated trimeric viral Spike protein (S) has been attracting the most attention and is at the center of efforts to develop antivirals, vaccines, and diagnostic solutions. Herein, we use an energy-decomposition approach to identify antigenic domains and antibody binding sites on the fully glycosylated S protein. Crucially, all that is required by our method are unbiased atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; no prior knowledge of binding properties or ad hoc combinations of parameters/measures extracted from simulations is needed. Our method simply exploits the analysis of energy interactions between all intra-protomer aminoacid and monosaccharide residue pairs, and cross-compares them with structural information (i.e., residueresidue proximity), identifying potential immunogenic regions as those groups of spatially contiguous residues with poor energetic coupling to the rest of the protein. Our results are validated by several experimentally confirmed structures of the S protein in complex with anti- or nanobodies. We identify poorly coupled sub-domains: on the one hand this indicates their role in hosting (several) epitopes, and on the other hand indicates their involvement in large functional conformational transitions. Finally, we detect two distinct behaviors of the glycan shield: glycans with stronger energetic coupling are structurally relevant and protect underlying peptidic epitopes; those with weaker coupling could themselves be poised for antibody recognition. Predicted Immunoreactive regions can be used to develop optimized antigens (recombinant subdomains, synthetic (glyco)peptidomimetics) for therapeutic applications.","output":"The answer lies in the energy: how simple atomistic molecular dynamics simulations may hold the key to epitope prediction on the fully glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for the treatment of mild-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients who are at high risk of disease progression. The EUA allows for COVID-19 mAb infusion to occur up to 10 days from symptom onset and due to logistics, mAb treatment typically occurs later in this 10 day window. Efficacy of early versus late mAb treatment is unknown Methods In this single center, retrospective case-control study, we performed a risk factor analysis of patients with mild COVID-19 infection treated with mAb on the composite outcome of subsequent evaluation in the Emergency Department (ED) or inpatient admission December 2020 through May 2021. Multivariate analysis of variables found to be significant in univariate analysis was performed using STATA 15 statistical software Results Two-hundred eighty-eight patients who received mAb treatment were included in analysis. The mean age was 58.6 years and 59.7% were female, 64.9% white, and 27.1% African American. Following mAb infusion, 31 (10.8%) had disease progression resulting in an ED encounter or inpatient admission. Patients who received early (days 1-5 of symptoms) mAb infusion were less likely to have progressive disease than patients with late (days 6-12 of symptoms) infusion;(6.1% vs 13.2%;P= 0.048). Zero of 21 patients who received mAb infusion on day 1-3 of symptoms had disease progression. Patients with CHF (7.4% vs 19.4%;P=0.038), cirrhosis (9.3% vs 25.8%;p=0.012), CKD (12.5% vs 35.5%;p=0.001) and hypertension (70.8% vs 90.3%;p=0.021) were more likely to have disease progression. There were no differences in sex, race, BMI, or symptoms between groups. Multivariate analysis revealed cirrhosis (OR 3.0;95% CI 1.1-7.9) and CKD (OR 2.6;95% CI 1.0-6.4) increased risk of disease progression while early mAb infusion was protective (OR 0.38;95% CI 0.14-1.0) Conclusion Infusion of mAb for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 within 5 days of symptom onset reduces rate of disease progression compared to delayed (day 6-12 of symptoms) infusion.

With the recent COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, POC has become critical in managing the spread of disease. Applicable diagnostics should be readily deployable, easy to use, portable, and accurate so that they fit mobile laboratories, pop-up treatment centers, field hospitals, secluded wards within hospitals, or remote regions, and can be operated by staff with minimal training. Complete blood count (CBC), however, has not been available at the POC in a simple-to-use device until recently. The HemoScreen, which was recently cleared by the FDA for POC use, is a miniature, easy-to-use instrument that uses disposable cartridges and may fill this gap. CONTENT: The HemoScreen's analysis method, in contrast to standard laboratory analyzers, is based on machine vision (image-based analysis) and artificial intelligence (AI). We discuss the different methods currently used and compare their results to the vision-based one. The HemoScreen is found to correlate well to laser and impedance-based methods while emphasis is given to mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), and platelets (PLT) that demonstrate better correlation when the vision-based method is compared to itself due to the essential differences between the underlying technologies.

It has affected millions of people and continues to affect more, despite tremendous social preventive measures. Identifying candidate drugs for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is crucial. The pathogenesis and the complications with advanced infection mainly involve an immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, therapeutic strategy relies on suppressing infectivity and inflammation, along with immune modulation. One of the most promising therapeutic targets for the modulation of immune-inflammatory responses is the endocannabinoid system, particularly the activation of cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2R), a G-protein coupled receptor which mediates the anti-inflammatory properties by modulating numerous signaling pathways. To pharmacologically activate the CB2 receptors, a naturally occurring cannabinoid ligand, beta-caryophyllene (BCP), received attention due to its potent anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulatory properties. BCP is recognized as a full selective functional agonist on CB2 receptors and produces therapeutic effects by activating CB2 and the nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). BCP is regarded as the first dietary cannabinoid with abundant presence across cannabis and non-cannabis plants, including spices and other edible plants. BCP showed tissue protective properties and favorably modulates numerous signaling pathways and inhibits inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, prostanoids, and eicosanoids. Based on its pharmacological properties, molecular mechanisms, and the therapeutic potential of BCP as an immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory, organ-protective, and antiviral, we hypothesize that BCP could be a promising therapeutic and/or preventive candidate to target the triad of infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19. In line with numerous studies that proposed the potential of cannabinoids in COVID-19, BCP may be a novel candidate compound for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical development due to its unique functional receptor selectivity, wide availability and accessibility, dietary bioavailability, nonpsychoactivity, and negligible toxicity along with druggable properties, including favorable pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties. Based on reasonable pharmacological mechanisms and therapeutic properties, we speculate that BCP has potential to be investigated against COVID-19 and will inspire further preclinical and clinical studies.","output":"-Caryophyllene, A Natural Dietary CB2 Receptor Selective Cannabinoid can be a Candidate to Target the Trinity of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the time of writing, FIND has listed four CE-marked SARSCoV-2 antigen tests We evaluated the recently CE-approved rapid POCT SD-Biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection in nasopharyngeal secretions from 330 patients admitted to the Emergency Room for a suspect of COVID-19 and travelers returning home from high risk countries Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and predictive values were consistent with the use of the test to mass-screening for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance","output":"Urgent need of rapid tests for SARS CoV-2 antigen detection: evaluation of the SD-Biosensor antigen test for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed to cause the regional outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess associations of NLR with fatal strokes. RESULTS: Compared to those in the first quartile and after adjustment for a series of factors, the participants in the highest neutrophil quartile had an increased risk of fatal all stroke (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.18C1.79) and fatal ischaemic stroke (aHR = 1.58, 95% CI, 1.17C2.12).

Coinfection and antibody-dependent enhancement are major areas of concern during DENV and CHIKV infections, which can alter the clinical severity. Acute hepatic illness is a common manifestation and major sign of disease severity upon infection with either dengue or chikungunya. Hence, in this study, we characterized the coexistence and interaction between both the viruses in human hepatic (Huh7) cells during the coinfection/superinfection scenario. We observed that prior presence of or subsequent superinfection with DENV enhanced CHIKV replication. However, prior CHIKV infection negatively affected DENV. In comparison to monoinfection, coinfection with both DENV and CHIKV resulted in lower infectivity as compared to monoinfections with modest suppression of CHIKV but dramatic suppression of DENV replication. Subsequent investigations revealed that subneutralizing levels of DENV or CHIKV anti-sera can respectively promote the ADE of CHIKV or DENV infection in FcRII bearing human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Our observations suggest that CHIKV has a fitness advantage over DENV in hepatic cells and prior DENV infection may enhance CHIKV disease severity if the patient subsequently contracts CHIKV.

This study aimed to discover other-regarding information nudges that can reinforce people's intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine without impeding their autonomous decision-making. In March 2021, we conducted an online experiment with 1595 people living throughout Japan, and randomly assigned them either of one control group and three treatment groups that received messages differently describing peer information: control, comparison, influence-gain, and influence-loss. We compared each message's effects on vaccination intention, autonomous decision-making, and emotional response. We found that the influence-gain nudge was effective in increasing the number of older adults who newly decided to receive the vaccine. The comparison and influence-loss nudges further reinforced the intention of older adults who had already planned to receive it. However, the influence-loss nudge, which conveys similar information to the influence-gain nudge but with loss-framing, increased viewers' negative emotion. These messages had no promoting effect for young adults with lower vaccination intentions at baseline. Based on the findings, we propose governments should use different messages depending on their purposes and targets, such as comparison instead of influence-loss, to encourage voluntary vaccination behavior.","output":"Nudges for COVID-19 voluntary vaccination: How to explain peer information?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conducted a coordinated analysis of eight longitudinal studies with data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In three studies, older adults were consistently less variable (i.e., lower within-person standard deviation) in negative emotional well-being such as negative affect and depressive symptoms compared to younger adults. In four studies older adults were also less variable in stress. Evidence of better outcomes associated with social interactions was found in three studies, where within-person variability in social interactions was positively correlated with variability in positive affect across age.

Healthcare service systems are one of the main social systems that can also be understood using network-based approaches, for example, to identify and evaluate influential providers. In this paper, we propose a network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems. First, the provider-interacting network is constructed by employing publicly available information on locations and types of healthcare services of providers. Second, the ranking of nodes in the generated provider-interacting network is conducted in parallel on the basis of four nodal influence metrics. Third, the impact of the top-ranked influential nodes in the provider-interacting network is evaluated using three indicators. Compared with other research work based on patient-sharing networks, in this paper, the provider-interacting network of healthcare service providers can be roughly created according to the locations and the publicly available types of healthcare services, without the need for personally private electronic medical claims, thus protecting the privacy of patients. The proposed method is demonstrated by employing Physician and Other Supplier Data CY 2017, and can be applied to other similar datasets to help make decisions for the optimization of healthcare resources in the response to public health emergencies.","output":"A network-based method with privacy-preserving for identifying influential providers in large healthcare service systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This work documents a relationship-maintenance strategy that individuals use when they perceive their time with a partner as scarce (vs. abundant): choosing to share extraordinary experiences (i.e., those characterized by uniqueness and superiority; pilot study N = 57).

The database was based on the PTB-XL database, and the signals from Lead ICXII were analyzed. This research focuses on determining the Few-Shot Learning (FSL) applicability for ECG signal proximity-based classification. The study was conducted by training Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to recognize 2, 5, and 20 different heart disease classes. The results of the FSL network were compared with the evaluation score of the neural network performing softmax-based classification. The neural network proposed for this task interprets a set of QRS complexes extracted from ECG signals. The FSL network proved to have higher accuracy in classifying healthy/sick patients ranging from 93.2% to 89.2% than the softmax-based classification network, which achieved 90.5C89.2% accuracy. The proposed network also achieved better results in classifying five different disease classes than softmax-based counterparts with an accuracy of 80.2C77.9% as opposed to 77.1% to 75.1%.

REPS were administered immediately post-thaw into the subretinal space of a mammalian model, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS)/nude rat. Implanted REPS were assessed at 30, 60, and 90 days post-implantation, and thawed cells demonstrate survival as an intact monolayer on the parylene scaffold. Furthermore, immunoreactivity for the maturation marker, RPE65, significantly increased over the post-implantation period in vivo, and cells demonstrated functional attributes similar to non-cryopreserved controls.

The data of sACE, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), complete blood count (CBC), lung function, bronchoalveolar lavage, and biopsy were collected. The differences between the sarcoidosis group and the nonsarcoidosis group and between different stages of sarcoidosis were compared. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for the diagnostic test of sACE in sarcoidosis. RESULTS: A total of 84 cases with suspected sarcoidosis were included, among which 70 cases were confirmed to be sarcoidosis by biopsy. The mean value of sACE in sarcoidosis patients was 56.61  30.80 U/L, which was significantly higher than that in nonsarcoidosis patients (28.07  14.11 U/L, P = 0.001).

Postextubation respiratory failure causes increased morbidity and mortality. HFNC has been widely employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to report a single-centre experience on the effectiveness and safety of HFNC in weaning COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nine patients showed severe acute respiratory failure and interstitial pneumonia due to SARS-CoV-2. After mechanical ventilation (5 Helmet CPAP, 4 invasive mechanical ventilation), they were de-escalated to HFNC. Settings were: 34-37C, flow from 50 to 60 L min-1. FiO2 was set to achieve appropriate SpO2. RESULTS: Nine patients (4 females; age 63  13.27 years; BMI 27.2  4.27) showed a baseline PaO2/FiO2 of 109  45 mm Hg. After a long course of ventilation all patients improved (PaO2/FiO2 336  72 mm Hg). Immediately after initiation of HFNC (2 hours), PaO2/FiO2 was 254  69.3 mm Hg. Mean ROX index at two hours was 11.17 (range: 7.38-14.4). It was consistent with low risk of HFNC failure. No difference was observed on lactate. After 48 hours of HFNC oxygen therapy (day 3), mean PaO2/FiO2 increased to 396  83.5 mm Hg. All patients recovered from respiratory failure after 7  4.1 days. CONCLUSIONS: HFNC might be helpful in weaning COVID-19 respiratory failure. Effectiveness and comfort should be assessed between 2 and 48 hours. Clinical outcomes, oxygenation, and ROX index should be considered, to rule out the need for intubation. Further evidence is required for firm conclusions.","output":"Clinical outcomes of high-flow nasal cannula in COVID-19 associated postextubation respiratory failure.

To enable label-efficient learning and better generalizability, we propose to incorporate contrastive learning (CL) with latent augmentation (LA) to build a few-shot system. CL learns useful representations without manual labels, while LA transfers semantic variations of the base dataset in an unsupervised way. These two components fully exploit unlabeled training data and can scale gracefully to other label-hungry problems. In experiments, we find i) models learned by CL generalize better than supervised learning for histology images in unseen classes, and ii) LA brings consistent gains over baselines. Prior studies of self-supervised learning mainly focus on ImageNet-like images, which only present a dominant object in their centers. Recent attention has been paid to images with multi-objects and multi-textures. Histology images are a natural choice for such a study.

We performed transfontanellar directional power Doppler and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound during major high-risk non-cardiac neonatal surgery. Pial arteries were of interest for the measurements. Extracted Doppler ultrasound parameters were: peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity, the resistivity index and pulsatility index. Results: In 10 out of 14 patients it was possible to perform perioperative measurements; the others failed for logistic and technical reasons. In 6 out of 10 patients, it was feasible to perform serial intraoperative transfontanellar ultrasound measurements with directional power Doppler and pulsed wave Doppler of the same pial artery during neonatal surgery. Median peak systolic velocity was ranging between 5.7 and 7.0 cm s-1 and end diastolic velocity between 1.9 and 3.2 cm s-1. In patients with a vasoactive-inotropic score below 12 the trend of peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity corresponded with the mean arterial blood pressure trend. Conclusion: Perioperative transfontanellar ultrasound Doppler measurements of the pial arteries are feasible and provide new longitudinal data about perioperative cortical cerebral blood flow velocity.

COVID-19 is associated with a coagulopathy. In this mixed-methods PRISMA-compliant scoping review, we set out to determine if ARDS, sepsis and DIC could account for the coagulopathy and if there were any other features of the coagulopathy we could determine so as to inform future research. Methods: We used a search strategy to identify papers with clinically relevant thromboembolic events in COVID-19. We then developed a technique referred to as an Abridged Thematic Analysis (ATA) to quickly identify themes in the papers so as to increase the yield of clinically relevant information. We further developed Validated Abridged Thematic Analysis (VATA) to validate the resulting taxonomy of themes. Finally we developed a number of methods that can be used by other researchers to take forwards this work. Results: We identified 56 studies with 10,523 patients, 456 patients with COVID-19 and thromboembolic events (TBE's) and 586 thrombembolic events. There were an average of 1.3 TBE's per patient. There were five main arterial territories with corresponding clinical sequelae: Acute limb ischaemia, myocardial infarcts, strokes, mesenteric ischaemia and pulmonary embolism. We also identified DVT's. There were two further groups: medical-device-related coagulopathy and dermal lesions. In a subgroup of 119 patients we found mortality ranged from 26% in DVT to 79% in acute limb ischaemia although there was evidence of selection bias in the latter group. All patients were hospitalised and the average age of survivors was 63 versus 73 for those who died. 91/150 patients with TE's had fever. From the ATA, we identified 16 characteristics of the clotting pathology in COVID-19. From the VATA, we identified 34 mechanisms leading to coagulopathy and grouped them according to Virchow's triad of vascular damage, stasis and hypercoagulability. Coagulopathy occurred with and without each of ARDS, Sepsis and DIC. We conclude that COVID-19 leads to the syndrome of a viral clotting fever in a subgroup of patients and that the presentation of coagulopathy and fever should raise the possibility of COVID-19 as a differential. We make recommendations for future research studies.","output":"Characterising COVID-19 as a Viral Clotting Fever: A Mixed-Methods Scoping Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been significant, with many regions across the globe reporting significant increases in anxiety, depression, trauma, and insomnia This study aims to validate a potential cognitive model of maintenance factors of COVID-19 related distress by examining psychological predictors of distress, and their goodness-of-fit as a coherent model.

In this study, we performed a longitudinal characterization of vaccination coverage in Brazil and compared the profiles between the distinct regions in the country to test whether there has been a substantial change over the last 5 years. METHODS: De-identified publicly available data were retrieved from the repository of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, comprising detailed information on vaccination coverage in all age groups between 1994 and 2019. The vaccination coverage for the whole country and for each Brazilian region, by year, was examined, and a time-series pattern analysis was performed. RESULTS: A significant decrease in overall vaccination coverage across the country regions was observed between 2017 and 2019, especially in childhood immunization. A reduction in BCG, hepatitis B, influenza, and rotavirus vaccine coverage was observed. Conversely, vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and meningococcus showed an increase in coverage. Region-specific changes in vaccination patterns within the study period were observed.

With the appearance of multidrug-resistant TB and emerging infectious disease such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza viruses, engineering controls using 254 nm UV-C lamps within specialized luminaires, herein designated UVGI fixtures, are being installed in high-risk settings such as homeless shelters, hospitals, jails and prisons, and schools. Studies have established that a relatively uniform spatial distribution of UV-C in the upper room can effectively cleanse the air of aerosolized pathogens. However, for planning purposes, the placement of multiple UVGI fixtures in a space, to achieve uniformity of UV-C energy distribution using currently available lighting software, is not yet practical because no industry-wide standard method exists for radiometric measurement of commercial UVGI fixtures. In this article, standard methods for photometry and reporting of general fluorescent lighting luminaire photometric data are adopted to provide UVGI fixture spatial emission distribution data in an electronic file format. The ultimate expectation of the authors is that the results will lead to a software program for fixture placement, comparable to and as easy to use as the corresponding software used for general interior lighting applications. To accomplish this goal, a radiometry measurement system is developed to obtain the radiant intensity distributions of UVGI fixtures in a three-dimensional space. This system includes a moving-mirror Type C goniometer, a mirror, a radiometer, a desktop computer, the mechanical control hardware, and the data acquisition/presentation software. Repeated measurements were made on each of three exemplary UVGI fixtures, and measurement variation did not exceed  2.0%.","output":"A radiometry protocol for UVGI fixtures using a moving-mirror type gonioradiometer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED Several arenaviruses are known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where VHF is a major public health and medical concern. The biosafety level 4 categorization of these arenaviruses restricts their use and has impeded biological studies, including therapeutic drug and/or vaccine development. Due to difficulties associated with handling live viruses, pseudotype viruses, which transiently bear arenavirus envelope proteins based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or retrovirus, have been developed as surrogate virus systems. Here, we report the development of a pseudotype VSV bearing each envelope protein of various species of arenaviruses (AREpv), including the newly identified Lujo virus (LUJV) and Chapare virus. Pseudotype arenaviruses generated in 293T cells exhibited high infectivity in various mammalian cell lines. The infections by New World and Old World AREpv were dependent on their receptors (human transferrin receptor 1 [hTfR1] and -dystroglycan [DG], respectively). However, infection by pseudotype VSV bearing the LUJV envelope protein (LUJpv) occurred independently of hTfR1 and DG, indicating that LUJpv utilizes an unidentified receptor. The pH-dependent endocytosis of AREpv was confirmed by the use of lysosomotropic agents. The fusion of cells expressing these envelope proteins, except for those expressing the LUJV envelope protein, was induced by transient treatment at low pH values. LUJpv infectivity was inhibited by U18666A, a cholesterol transport inhibitor. Furthermore, the infectivity of LUJpv was significantly decreased in the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-deficient cell line, suggesting the necessity for NPC1 activity for efficient LUJpv infection. IMPORTANCE LUJV is a newly identified arenavirus associated with a VHF outbreak in southern Africa. Although cell entry for many arenaviruses has been studied, cell entry for LUJV has not been characterized. In this study, we found that LUJpv utilizes neither DG nor hTfR1 as a receptor and found unique characteristics of LUJV glycoprotein in membrane fusion and cell entry. Proper exclusion of cholesterol or some kinds of lipids may play important roles in LUJpv cell entry.","output":"Analysis of Lujo virus cell entry using pseudotype vesicular stomatitis virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: although the main manifestations of COVID-19 are respiratory, several neurological symptoms and complications have also been reported. The pandemic seems to have some epidemiological specificities in sub-Saharan Africa, and this may be reflected in the type and frequency of neurological symptoms. This study aimed to report neurological manifestations associated with symptomatic COVID-19 in a sub-Saharan African setting. Methods: we conducted a retrospective review of symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to the Bafoussam Regional Hospital between March and September 2020. Patients' files were reviewed at discharge by a consultant neurologist. Socio-demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, symptoms on admission, neurological symptoms during hospitalization, management, and in-hospital outcome were recorded. Comparisons between patients with and without neurological symptoms were performed using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: we enrolled 177 symptomatic patients (68% men). Mean age was 54.6  17.8 years (range 2-99 years). Co-morbidities were present in 57.6% of patients, including hypertension (27.1%) and diabetes mellitus (25.4%). Neurological symptoms were found in 113 (63.8%) patients. The most frequent were headache (39.0%), myalgia (35.6%), anosmia (11.9%), impaired consciousness (10.7%) and delirium (5.6%). Regarding the presenting symptoms, fever was more frequent in patients with neurological symptoms than in those without (81.4% versus 50.0%, p< 0.001), while digestive symptoms were less frequent in patients with neurological symptoms (0.9% versus 9.4%, p= 0.004).

As of 24 April 2020, Lombardy was the worst hit Italian region and entirely separated from all the others. Sensitivity analysis-by excluding data from Lombardy-partitioned the remaining regions into four clusters. Although cluster 1 (i.e. Veneto) and 2 (i.e. Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna) included the most hit regions beyond Lombardy, this partition reflected differences in the efficacy of restrictions and testing strategies. Cluster 3 was heterogeneous and comprised regions where the epidemic started later and/or where it spread with the lowest intensity. Regions within cluster 4 were those where the epidemic started slightly after Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, favoring timely adoption of control measures.

Developing intelligent bioinformatics tools is a mandatory to aid in the analysis of the disease. One of these tools is local aligner which aims to find the longest common subsequence between two biological sequences. Fragmented local aligner technique (FLAT) was developed based on meta-heuristic algorithms to accelerating the alignment process, especially for sequences with huge length. In this paper, the performance of ions motion optimization (IMO) algorithm for implementing FLAT was measured. The performance was poor, and a chaotic parameter was added in the exploration equations of IMO to enhance its performance for FLAT. A set of real proteins having a product length which ranges from 250,000 to 9,000,000 were used as a dataset to test the performance of IMO and its developed version. Besides, COVID-19 virus was aligned using FLAT according to IMO and chaotic IMO to verify the enhancement of IMO. All results were compared to the results founded by SmithCWaterman approach. The tests prove the superiority of chaotic IMO over IMO for implementing FLAT on all datasets. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","output":"Chaotic Ions Motion Optimization (CIMO) for Biological Sequences Local Alignment: COVID-19 as a Case Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system, and their immunogenicity is key in achieving protection against specific pathogens Questions have been raised whether in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients they could induce disease exacerbation and whether vaccines could possibly act as a trigger in the onset of MS in susceptible populations So far, no correlation has been found between the vaccinations against influenza, hepatitis B, tetanus, human papillomavirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, tuberculosis, yellow fever, or typhoid fever and the risk of MS Further research is needed for the potential protective implications of the tetanus and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccines in MS patients Nowadays with the emerging coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and recent vaccinations approval and arrival, the risk-benefit in MS patients with regards to safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination in those treated with immunosuppressive therapies is of paramount importance In this manuscript, we demonstrate how different vaccine types could be related to the immunopathogenesis of MS and discuss the risks and benefits of different vaccinations in MS patients","output":"Current Immunological and Clinical Perspective on Vaccinations in Multiple Sclerosis Patients: Are They Safe after All?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computer vision is one of the hottest research directions in artificial intelligence at present, and its research goal is to give computers the ability to perceive and cognize their surroundings from a single image. Image recognition is an important research direction in the field of computer vision, which has important research significance and application value in industrial applications such as video surveillance, biometric identification, unmanned vehicles, human-computer interaction, and medical image recognition. In this article, we propose an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel IoT-oriented fuzzy support tensor product adaptive image classification method. Considering the problem that traditional support tensor product classification methods are difficult to directly produce pixel-to-pixel classification results, the research is based on the idea of inverse convolution network design, which directly outputs dense pixel-by-pixel classification results for images to be classified of arbitrary size to achieve true end-to-end and pixel-to-pixel high-score image classification and improve the efficiency of support tensor product models for high-score image classification on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Moreover, considering that network supervised classification training using deep learning requires a large amount of labeled data as true values and obtaining a large number of labeled data sources is a difficult problem in the field of image classification, this article proposes using a large amount of unlabeled high-resolution remote sensing images for learning generic structured features through unsupervised to assist the labeled high-resolution remote sensing images for better-supervised feature extraction and classification training. By finding a balance between generic structural feature learning of images and differentiated feature learning related to the target class, the dependence of supervised classification on the number of labeled samples is reduced, and the network robustness of the support tensor product algorithm is improved under a small number of labeled training samples.","output":"Fuzzy Support Tensor Product Adaptive Image Classification for the Internet of Things"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To define the natural history of, and treatment strategy for, blunt traumatic internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudoaneurysms. BACKGROUND The natural history and management of traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysms is controversial. METHODS We retrospectively identified all traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysms diagnosed on head/neck computed tomographic angiography at a high-volume trauma center over a 10-year period. Radiographic and clinical data were recorded, and a treatment algorithm was derived. RESULTS Forty-three pseudoaneurysms were diagnosed in 39 patients. All patients were treated with daily aspirin unless contraindicated, and 82% underwent daily transcranial Doppler ultrasonography with embolic monitoring. A rate of 8 or more emboli per hour was predictive of embolic stroke (P = 0.0076). Acute ischemic or embolic stroke was seen in 7 patients (16%) with an overall mortality in this subpopulation of 42% (n = 3). Four patients (9%) underwent acute surgical treatment (parent vessel sacrifice and/or arterial bypass) for ongoing ischemia. Long-term radiographic and clinical follow-up was obtained for 36 surviving patients (mean = 8 months; range: 1 week-5 years), all of whom were maintained on daily aspirin. No delayed ischemic or embolic events were reported. For ICA pseudoaneurysms treated with aspirin and observation alone, 9 (28%) increased in size, 17 (53%) decreased or stabilized, and 6 (19%) resolved. Enlargement of 5 mm or more in maximal diameter underwent delayed endovascular treatment with a 100% obliteration rate and no complications. CONCLUSIONS Traumatic ICA pseudoaneurysms are safely treated with daily aspirin, embolic monitoring, and radiographic surveillance. Acute stroke or hemorrhage, or delayed radiographic progression, are indications for endovascular or surgical treatment.","output":"Natural History and Management of Blunt Traumatic Pseudoaneurysms of the Internal Carotid Artery: The Harborview Algorithm Based Off a 10-Year Experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Milan metropolitan area in Northern Italy was among the most severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The aim of this study was to examine the seroprevalence trends of SARS-CoV-2 in healthy asymptomatic adults, and the risk factors and laboratory correlates of positive tests. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in a random sample of blood donors, who were asymptomatic at the time of evaluation, at the beginning of the first phase (February 24th to April 8th 2020; n=789). Presence of IgM/IgG antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2-Nucleocapsid protein was assessed by a lateral flow immunoassay. RESULTS: The test had a 100/98.3 sensitivity/specificity (n=32/120 positive/negative controls, respectively), and the IgG test was validated in a subset by an independent ELISA against the Spike protein (n=34, p<0.001). At the start of the outbreak, the overall adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.7% (95% CI: 0.3-6%; p<0.0001 vs 120 historical controls). During the study period, characterised by a gradual implementation of social distancing measures, there was a progressive increase in the adjusted seroprevalence to 5.2% (95% CI: 2.4-9.0; 4.5%, 95% CI: 0.9-9.2% according to a Bayesian estimate) due to a rise in IgG reactivity to 5% (95% CI: 2.8-8.2; p=0.004 for trend), but there was no increase in IgM+ (p=not significant). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, IgG reactivity was more frequent in younger individuals (p=0.043), while IgM reactivity was more frequent in individuals aged >45 years (p=0.002). DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection was already circulating in Milan at the start of the outbreak. The pattern of IgM/IgG reactivity was influenced by age: IgM was more frequently detected in participants aged >45 years.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the patient factors and early time-varying prescription-related factors associated with opioid-related fatal or nonfatal overdose. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study evaluated opioid-naive adult patients in Oregon using data from the Oregon Comprehensive Opioid Risk Registry, which links all payer claims data to other health data sets in the state of Oregon. The observational, population-based sample filled a first (index) opioid prescription in 2015 and was followed up until December 31, 2018. Data analyses were performed from March 1, 2020, to June 15, 2021. EXPOSURES: Overdose after the index opioid prescription. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The outcome was an overdose event. The sample was followed up to identify fatal or nonfatal opioid overdoses. Patient and prescription characteristics were identified. Prescription characteristics in the first 6 months after the index prescription were modeled as cumulative, time-dependent measures that were updated monthly through the sixth month of follow-up. A time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess patient and prescription characteristics that were associated with an increased risk for overdose events. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 236 921 patients (133 839 women [56.5%]), of whom 667 (0.3%) experienced opioid overdose. Risk of overdose was highest among individuals 75 years or older (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.22; 95% CI, 1.94-5.36) compared with those aged 35 to 44 years; men (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.10-1.51); those who were dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare Advantage (aHR, 4.37; 95% CI, 3.09-6.18), had Medicaid (aHR, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.97-4.80), or had Medicare Advantage (aHR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.44-3.31) compared with those with commercial insurance; those with comorbid substance use disorder (aHR, 2.74; 95% CI, 2.15-3.50), with depression (aHR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.03-1.55), or with 1 to 2 comorbidities (aHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08-1.62) or 3 or more comorbidities (aHR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.42-2.53) compared with none. Patients were at an increased overdose risk if they filled oxycodone (aHR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04-2.77) or tramadol (aHR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.34-5.84) compared with codeine; used benzodiazepines (aHR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.11); used concurrent opioids and benzodiazepines (aHR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.70-2.62); or filled opioids from 3 or more pharmacies over 6 months (aHR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.09-1.75).

Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for ID communication. We will review the power of Twitter in ID. RECENT FINDINGS: Twitter allows for real-time sharing of educational resources at ID scientific conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend conferences to follow conferences anytime anywhere and stimulate discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. Further, Twitter chats are a valuable tool for stewardship, with different accounts periodically hosting chats on various stewardship topics. Several studies have also demonstrated the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact of publications with the help of Twitter. There is great value in engaging with non-ID people on Twitter via dissemination of ID knowledge to other disciplines. Lastly, when used appropriately, Twitter is a useful site for distributing vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities) and allows one to keep up with ongoing ID outbreaks in real time. SUMMARY: Twitter has transformed how we communicate in healthcare. Particularly in ID, where bacteria and viruses can enter/exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance for clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, is a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for HCPs and the public to socialize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.","output":"To Tweet or Not to Tweeta Review of the Viral Power of Twitter for Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: One of the most feared complications of COVID-19 is respiratory failure caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. In order to improve oxygenation and survival, patients admitted to intensive care units and intubated may undergo prone position mechanical ventilation. Prolonged prone positioning may cause meralgia paraesthetica due to lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment between the inguinal ligament and the anterior superior iliac spine. Reports of the first two cases have been recently published. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 52-year-old man with respiratory failure during COVID-19 infection, who underwent prone position ventilation for 16 hours a day over 19 days and developed persistent burning pain and dysaesthesia on the lateral surface of the thigh bilaterally, diagnosed as meralgia paraesthetica. CONCLUSION: This is the second report describing meralgia paraesthetica following prone position ventilation in COVID-19. Given the ongoing pandemic and the inevitability of more patients with severe respiratory distress requiring prone position ventilation, this disabling entrapment condition should be considered and possibly prevented. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19 may require intubation and mechanical ventilation because of respiratory distress. Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation, but may cause lateral femoral cutaneous nerve entrapment and meralgia paraesthetica. Medical personnel should be aware of the risk of meralgia paraesthetica as a disabling condition potentially affecting more patients as the COVID-19 pandemic persists.","output":"Meralgia Paraesthetica after Prone Position Ventilation in a Patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: We undertook a prospective qualitative survey to ascertain the perceptions and experience of National Health Service patients in the United Kingdom who underwent planned or elective procedures and surgery at alternate 'clean' hospital sites during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These alternate 'clean' hospital sites were independent hospitals running active staff and patient testing programmes for COVID-19 and which did not admit or treat patients suffering with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective survey was undertaken to include patients at least 30 days after a planned surgery or procedure conducted at a 'clean' alternate hospital site during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted using structured interviews undertaken by trained assessors. A 20% sample group of patients were randomly selected to participate in this study. Qualitative data related to confidence, safety and perceptions of safety were collected. RESULTS: Ninety-five patients (60%) reported that they had prior worries or concerns about undergoing an elective procedure during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 47 patients (30%) had delayed their surgery at least once because of these concerns. A total of 150 patients (95%) felt that the precautions in place to protect their safety in the setting of an alternate 'clean' hospital site were well thought out and proportionate. Patients reported high levels of confidence in the measures undertaken. Separation of patient pathways using the independent sector and patient testing were identified by patients as having the greatest impact on their perception of safety. CONCLUSIONS: Patient confidence will be key to ensuring uptake of planned and elective procedures and surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Perceptions of safety will be key to this confidence and efforts to demonstrably enhance safety are well received by patients. In particular, patients felt that a dedicated programme of patient testing and separation of patient pathways provided the greatest levels of confidence in the safety of their treatment.","output":"The perception of patient safety in an alternate site of care for elective surgery during the first wave of the novel coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom: a survey of 158 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Solar water splitting is one of the most efficient technologies to produce H2, which is a clean and renewable energy carrier. Photoanodes for water oxidation play the determining roles in solar water splitting, while its photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance is severely limited by the hole injection efficiency at the interface of semiconductor/electrolyte. To address this problem, in this research, by employing BiVO4 as the model semiconductor for photoanodes, we develop a novel, facile, and efficient method, which simply applies K cations in the preparation process of BiVO4 photoanodes, to in situ induce a crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction by the formation of an amorphous BiVO4 layer (a-BiVO4) on the surface of the crystalline BiVO4 (c-BiVO4) film for PEC water oxidation. The K cation is the key to stimulate the formation of the heterophase, but not incorporated in the final photoelectrodes. Without sacrificing the light absorption, the in situ formed a-BiVO4 layer accelerates the kinetics of the hole transfer at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, leading to the significantly increased efficiency of the surface hole injection to water molecules. Consequently, the BiVO4 photoanode with the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction (a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4) exhibits almost twice the photocurrent density at 1.23 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for water oxidation than the bare c-BiVO4 ones. Such advantages from the crystalline-amorphous heterophase junction are still effective even when the a-BiVO4/c-BiVO4 is coated by the cocatalyst of FeOOH, reflecting its broad applications in PEC devices. We believe this study can supply an efficient and simple protocol to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance of photoanodes, and provide a new strategy for the potential large-scale application of the solar energy-conversion related devices.","output":"In Situ Induced Crystalline-Amorphous Heterophase Junction by K+ to Improve Photoelectrochemical Water Oxidation of BiVO4."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Globally, coronavirus disease\\\\2019 (COVID\\\\19) is a new, highly contagious, and life\\\\threatening virus.

Clinical studies revealed that ABMi attenuated liver fibrosis and improved liver function in some patients; however, this therapy has some limitations such as the need of general anesthesia. Following ABMi therapy, studies have focused on specific cells such as mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from a variety of tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord tissues. Particularly, studies have focused on gaining mechanistic insights into MSC distribution and effects on immune cells, especially macrophages. Several basic studies have reported the use of MSCs for liver cirrhosis models, while a number of clinical studies have used autologous and allogeneic MSCs; however, there are only a few reports on the obvious substantial effect of MSCs in clinical studies. Since then, studies have analyzed and identified the important signals or components in MSCs that regulate immune cells, such as macrophages, under cirrhotic conditions and have revealed that MSC-derived exosomes are key regulators.

On detailed review, a clearer picture emerges, which suggests that the potential therapeutic value of this intervention has been underestimated. Our analysis is consistent with the propositions that: (1) IgG is highly effective for a proportion of patients with severe and well-characterised ME/CFS; (2) responders can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy based on markers of immune dysfunction. Rigorous steps were taken in the research trials to record adverse events, with transient symptom exacerbation commonly experienced in both intervention and placebo control groups, suggesting that this reflected the impact of participation on people with an illness characterised by post-exertional symptom exacerbation. Worsening of certain specific symptoms, notably headache, did occur more commonly with IgG and may have been concomitant to effective treatment, being associated with clinical improvement. The findings emerging from this review are supported by clinical observations relating to treatment of patients with severe and very severe ME/CFS, for whom intramuscular and subcutaneous administration provide alternative options. We conclude that: (1) there is a strong case for this area of research to be revived; (2) pending further research, clinicians would be justified in offering a course of IgG to selected ME/CFS patients at the more severe end of the spectrum. As the majority of trial participants had experienced an acute viral or viral-like onset, we further suggest that IgG treatment may be pertinent to the care of some patients who remain ill following infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus.","output":"Back to the Future?

In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, ReCoNet (residual image-based COVID-19 detection network), is proposed for COVID-19 detection. This is achieved from chest X-ray (CXR) images shedding light on the preprocessing task considered to be very useful for enhancing the COVID-19 fingerprints. The proposed modular architecture consists of a CNN-based multi-level preprocessing filter block in cascade with a multi-layer CNN-based feature extractor and a classification block. A multi-task learning loss function is adopted for optimization of the preprocessing block trained end-to-end with the rest of the proposed network. Additionally, a data augmentation technique is applied for boosting the network performance. The whole network when pre-trained end-to-end on the CheXpert open source dataset, and trained and tested with the COVIDx dataset of 15,134 original CXR images yielded an overall benchmark accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97.48%, 96.39%, and 97.53%, respectively. The immense potential of ReCoNet may be exploited in clinics for rapid and safe detection of COVID-19 globally, in particular in the low and middle income countries where RT-PCR labs and/or kits are in a serious crisis.","output":"ReCoNet: Multi-level Preprocessing of Chest X-rays for COVID-19 Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Loralin Welch and Noorie K.

The new coronavirus shares about 82% of its genome with the one which produced the 2003 outbreak (SARS CoV-1). Both coronaviruses also share the same cellular receptor, which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) one. In spite of these similarities, the new coronavirus has expanded more widely, more faster and more lethally than the previous one. Many researchers across the disciplines have used diverse modeling tools to analyze the impact of this pandemic at global and local scales. This includes a wide range of approachesCdeterministic, data-driven, stochastic, agent-based, and their combinationsCto forecast the progression of the epidemic as well as the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions to stop or mitigate its impact on the world population. The physical complexities of modern society need to be captured by these models. This includes the many ways of social contactsC(multiplex) social contact networks, (multilayers) transport systems, metapopulations, etc.Cthat may act as a framework for the virus propagation. But modeling not only plays a fundamental role in analyzing and forecasting epidemiological variables. It plays an important role in helping to find cures for the disease and in preventing contagion by means of new vaccines. The necessity for answering swiftly and effectively to the questions: Could existing drugs work against SARS CoV-2? and Can new vaccines be developed in time?demands the use of physical modeling of proteins, protein-inhibitors interactions, virtual screening of drugs against virus targets, predicting immunogenicity of small peptides, modeling vaccinomics and vaccine design, to mention just a few. Here, we review these three main areas of modeling research against SARS CoV-2 and COVID-19: (1) epidemiology; (2) drug repurposing; and (3) vaccine design. Therefore, we compile the most relevant existing literature about modeling strategies against the virus to help modelers to navigate this fast-growing literature. We also keep an eye on future outbreaks, where the modelers can find the most relevant strategies used in an emergence situation as the current one to help in fighting future pandemics.","output":"COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2.

OBJECTIVES: To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers/parents across Nova Scotia who are caring for a child 0-12 months of age. DESIGN: This study utilized an online qualitative survey to collect data. Feminist poststructuralism and discourse analysis guided the analysis and discussion. SETTING: Nova Scotia, Canada PARTICIPANTS: : 68 participants were recruited from across the province of Nova Scotia. FINDINGS: Mental health and socialization were both major concerns for new mothers/parents, as many expressed feelings of worry, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, and stress. KEY CONCLUSIONS: Online support was sought by many new mothers/parents as a way of supporting their own mental health. Some found ways to make it meaningful for them, while others believed that it could not replace or offer the same benefits as in-person interaction and support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Informal and formal support systems are both essential for new mothers. As public health systems and health care services learn to adapt to COVID-19, further research is required to examine how health services may best meet the needs of new mothers/parents.","output":"Mental Health & Parental Concerns during COVID-19: The Experiences of New Mothers Amidst Social Isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Women are predicted to be disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to increased carer responsibilities, loss of income, worry about the virus and a predominantly female healthcare workforce. Whilst there is emerging evidence that negative mental health impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be more pronounced for women than men, less attention has focussed on changes to health behaviours and health seeking experienced by women. Similarly, the impact of the pandemic in rural areas has not been investigated in detail. Our research questions were 'have females residing in rural areas experienced changes in alcohol consumption, unhealthy food consumption, smoking, exercise or health seeking during the COVID-19 pandemic?' and 'are there differences in health behaviour changes between rural females living with or without children?'. Net increases (scale of 0-1) in consumption of unhealthy food (95% CI 0.05, 0.22) and alcohol (95% CI 0.12, 0.29) were observed. Net decreases (scale of -1 to 0) in visits to the doctor (95% CI -0.23, -0.35) and other health professionals (95% CI -0.40, -0.54) were observed.

We assessed the adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with prenatal antiretroviral drug exposure, notified to the French ANRS pharmacovigilance system. METHODS: An exhaustive case report series has been performed using the ANRS pharmacovigilance database. All ANRS-sponsored HIV clinical research studies using antiretroviral drugs either in pregnant women or women of childbearing age were eligible from 2004 to 2019. We analysed the following pregnancy outcomes: abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, prematurity (<37 weeks of gestational age), low birth weight (<2500 g) and congenital abnormalities. A logistic regression was performed to assess the odds ratio (OR) for each outcome separately (if occurrence >50) compared to the outcome observed when exposed to non-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor (NNRTI)-based regimen as the reference. RESULTS: Among the 34 studies selected, 918 deliveries occurred, of whom 88% had pregnancy outcomes documented. Pregnant women were mainly exposed to PI (n = 387, 48.6%), NNRTI (n = 331, 41.5%) and INI-based combinations (n = 40, 5.0%, 18 on dolutegravir). Compared to NNRTI-based combinations, there was no significant association observed with exposure to other antiretroviral combination for spontaneous abortion, prematurity or low birth weight, except an increased risk of low birth weight in new-born exposed to exclusive nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor (NRTI) combinations (n = 4; OR 7.50 [1.49-37.83]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study, mainly based on protease inhibitor (PI) and NNRTI-based regimens, is overall reassuring on the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, except for NRTI which should be interpreted cautiously (small number, indication bias).

We evaluated associations between LA epicardial fat and LA volume in patients with sinus rhythm (SR), paroxysmal AF (PAF), and persistent/permanent AF. METHODS AND RESULTS: In total, 300 patients (100 with SR, 100 with PAF, and 100 with persistent/permanent AF) who underwent cardiac computed tomography angiography (CTA) were included. The epicardial fat mass posterior to the LA and the LA volume were quantified from CTA and compared between patients with SR, PAF, and persistent/permanent AF. Furthermore, four groups were created by classifying LA epicardial fat and LA volume into large or small according to their median. The mean age of the population was 58.9  10.5 years and 69.7% was male. Left atrial epicardial fat mass was larger in patients with PAF compared with SR, but did not further increase from PAF to persistent/permanent AF. Left atrial volume increased significantly from SR to PAF and to persistent/permanent AF. Left atrial epicardial fat and LA volume were both concordantly large or small in 184 (61%) patients, and discordant in 116 (39%). When both were small, 65.2% of the patients had SR, 23.9% PAF, and 10.9% persistent/permanent AF. When the LA epicardial fat mass was large and the LA volume small (compared with both being small), patients were significantly more often in PAF (55.2 vs. 23.9, P < 0.05), less frequently in SR (32.8% vs. 65.2%, P < 0.05) but showed comparable rates of persistent/permanent AF (12.0% vs. 10.9%, P < 0.05). When the LA volume was large, most patients had persistent/permanent AF. CONCLUSION: Left atrial epicardial fat mass was larger in PAF vs. SR, possibly indicating a marker of early disease, while large LA volumes were associated with a high prevalence of persistent/permanent AF. Elevated LA epicardial fat mass without large LA volume may reflect the early AF disease process.","output":"Association between left atrial epicardial fat, left atrial volume, and the severity of atrial fibrillation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a case of prostate cancer with abnormal renal and ureteric anatomy who underwent robotic assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Miscarriage rates were <2.5%, even when only studies of moderate/high-quality were included. Increased rates of CS and preterm birth were found, with uncertain vertical transmission. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A considerable number of systematic reviews, with substantial heterogeneity regarding their methods and included populations, on the impact of COVID-19 on infected pregnant women and their neonates, has emerged. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Three bibliographical databases were searched (last search: September 10, 2020). Quality assessment was performed using the AMSTAR-2 tool. Primary outcomes included mode of delivery, preterm delivery/labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM/pPROM) and abortions/miscarriages. Outcomes were mainly presented as ranges. A separate analysis, including only moderate and high-quality systematic reviews, was also conducted. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020214447); PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The search strategy followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Keywords employed were (COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus disease 2019) AND (Neonatal outcom* OR Neonatal characteristic* OR Maternal outcom* OR maternal characteristic* OR pregnancy outcom* OR vertical transmission). All retrieved studies were imported into the Rayyan QCRI and duplicated articles were removed. A snow-ball procedure was also implemented by hand-searching the reference lists of included systematic reviews for additional sources. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Thirty-nine reviews were analyzed. Twelve reviews (30.8%) were found to be of very low quality, 11 of low quality, 13 (33.3%) of moderate, and three (7.7%) of high quality. Ten articles dealt with miscarriages. One review integrated them into pregnancy terminations (1.4% (4/295)), one into intrauterine fetal deaths (1(3%)), while another one described them as spontaneous abortions (0.8% (3/385)). Taking into account reviews, which calculated these rates for their entire included population, miscarriage rates were <2.5%. The reported rates by moderate and high-quality studies were  2%. Reported rates,regarding both preterm and term gestations, varied between 52.3%-95.8% for caesarean sections; 4.2%-44.7% for vaginal deliveries; 14.3%-63.8% specifically for preterm deliveries and 22.7%-32.2% for preterm labor; 5.3%-12.7% for PROM and 6.4%-16.1% for pPROM. Maternal anxiety for potential fetal infection contributed to abortion decisions, while SARS-CoV-2-related miscarriages could not be excluded. Maternal ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates were 3%-28.5% and 1.4%-12%, respectively. Maternal mortality rate was <2%, while stillbirth, neonatal ICU admission and mortality rates were <2.5%, 3.1%-76.9% and <3%, respectively. Neonatal PCR positivity rates ranged between 1.6% and 10%. After accounting for quality of studies, ranges of our primary outcomes remained unchanged. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results are presented in a narrative way using ranges as the primary mean of quantification. We also included studies with both RT-PCR positive women and women with suspected infection based on their clinical and imaging manifestations, whereas, if excluding them, we might have missed a considerable source of information. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In conclusion, a rapid increase of CS was observed, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, most likely due to lack of knowledge and robust recommendations. Preterm birth rates were elevated, with iatrogenic reasons potentially involved. Even though neonatal infections were rare, the probability of vertical transmission cannot be eliminated.

We characterized the temporal dynamics in diversity of E. coli in fecal samples from a cohort of goat kids and adult meat goats on pasture over a one-year period. Isolates were characterized based on phylogenetic grouping, virulence genes; shiga toxins 1 and 2 (Stx1&Stx2) (STEC), intimin (eaeA), hemolysin (hly) and select important sero-groups (026, 045, 0103, 0126 and 0146) using molecular methods. RESULTS: A total of 516 E. coli isolates were screened. Prevalence of virulence genes and STEC was 65 and 56% respectively. Prevalence of virulence genes and STEC was significantly higher in goat kids less than six months (76% /66%) than adults (48% /28%). Isolates with virulence profiles of two or more genes were also higher in young goat kids (50%) than adults (20%). Entero-pathogenic E. coli (EPEC-eaeA gene only) were mostly from pre-weaned goat kids while hly gene only isolates were significantly higher in adults. The stx1, stx2 and hly genes peaked around weaning (60, 63 and 52%) respectively. Goats kids were mostly hosts to group D (59%) while adults older than one year had B1 (75%) isolates. Group D isolates were most abundant at weaning (64%) and diarrhea samples (74%). Group B2 isolates overall (6%) were mostly detected around weaning (63%) while A isolates were 4% overall. Twenty-four isolates belonged to sero-groups 026, 0103 and 0146 with 70% of the isolates detected around weaning. Nineteen of these isolates were STEC with most harboring the stx1/stx2/hly/eae (25%) profile. Most belonged to O26 sero-group (75%) and phylogroup D (75%). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this is the first study to highlight longitudinal age related differences in E. coli phylogenetic diversity, abundance of virulence genes and select important sero-groups in goats. Differences detected suggest a possible role of age and weaning stress in influencing E. coli diversity in the gut of goats. The findings are relevant to both animal and public health to advise on further studies on caprine E. coli isolates as animal and human pathogens.","output":"Age related differences in phylogenetic diversity, prevalence of Shiga toxins, Intimin, Hemolysin genes and select serogroups of Escherichia. coli from pastured meat goats detected in a longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As one of the most common forms of cancer, lung cancers present as a collection of different histological subtypes. These subtypes are characterized by distinct sets of driver mutations and phenotypic appearance, and they often show varying degrees of heterogenicity, aggressiveness, and response/resistance to therapy. Intriguingly, lung cancers are also capable of showing features of multiple subtypes or converting from one subtype to another. The intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of lung cancers as well as incidences of subtype transdifferentiation raise the question of to what extent the tumor characteristics are dictated by the cell of origin rather than the acquired driver lesions. We provide here an overview of the studies in experimental mouse models that try to address this question. These studies convincingly show that both the cell of origin and the genetic driver lesions play a critical role in shaping the phenotypes of lung tumors. However, they also illustrate that there is far from a direct one-to-one relationship between the cell of origin and the cancer subtype, as most epithelial cells can be reprogrammed toward diverse lung cancer fates when exposed to the appropriate set of driver mutations.","output":"Cells of origin of lung cancers: lessons from mouse studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present study has been conducted to investigate the relative changes of carbonaceous aerosols (CA) over a high altitude Himalayan atmosphere with and without (very low) anthropogenic emissions. Measurements of atmospheric organic (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) were conducted during the lockdown period (April 2020) due to global COVID 19 outbreak and compared with the normal period (April 2019). The interesting, unexpected and surprising observation is that OC, EC and the total CA (TCA) during the lockdown (OC: 12.1a?a?5.5a?ga?m-3; EC: 2.2a?a?1.1a?ga?m-3; TCA: 21.5a?a?10a?ga?m-3) were higher than the normal period (OC: 7.04a?a?2.2a?ga?m-3; EC: 1.9a?a?0.7a?ga?m-3; TCA: 13.2a?a?4.1a?ga?m-3). The higher values for OC/EC ratio too was observed during the lockdown (5.7a?a?0.9) compared to the normal period (4.2a?a?1.1). Much higher surface O3 during the lockdown (due to very low NO) could better promote the formation of secondary OC (SOC) through the photochemical oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from Himalayan coniferous forest cover. SOC during the lockdown (7.6a?a?3.5a?ga?m-3) was double of that in normal period (3.8a?a?1.4a?ga?m-3). Regression analysis between SOC and O3 showed that with the same amount of increase in O3, the SOC formation increased to a larger extent when anthropogenic emissions were very low and biogenic emissions dominate (lockdown) compared to when anthropogenic emissions were high (normal). Concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis showed that the anthropogenic activities over Nepal and forest fire over north-east India were the major long-distant sources of the CA over Darjeeling during the normal period. On the other hand, during lockdown, the major source regions of CA over Darjeeling were regional/local. The findings of the study indicate the immense importance of Himalayan biosphere as a major source of organic carbon.","output":"High rise in carbonaceous aerosols under very low anthropogenic emissions over eastern Himalaya, India: Impact of lockdown for COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While antimicrobial drug development has historically mitigated infectious diseases that are known, COVID-19 revealed a dearth of in-advance therapeutics suitable for infections by pathogens that have not yet emerged. Such drugs must exhibit a property that is antithetical to the classical paradigm of antimicrobial development: the ability to treat infections by any pathogen. Characterisation of such pan-pathogen antimicrobials requires consolidation of drug repositioning studies, a new and growing field of drug discovery. In this review, a previously-established system for evaluating repositioning studies is used to highlight 4 therapeutics which exhibit pan-pathogen properties, namely azithromycin, ivermectin, niclosamide, and nitazoxanide. Recognition of the pan-pathogen nature of these antimicrobials is the cornerstone of a novel paradigm of antimicrobial development that is not only anticipatory of pandemics and bioterrorist attacks, but cognisant of conserved anti-infective mechanisms within the host-pathogen interactome that are only now beginning to emerge.

The commentary aims to outline main challenges and opportunities in resilient healthcare theory and practice globally, as a backdrop for contributions to the collection. MAIN TEXT: Some of the main challenges in this field relate to a myriad of definitions and approaches to resilience in healthcare, and a lack of studies having multilevel perspectives. Also, the role of patients, families, and the public in resilient and responsive healthcare systems is under researched. By flipping the coin, this illustrates opportunities for research and practice and raise key issues that future resilience research should pay attention to. The potential of combining theoretical lenses from different resilience traditions, involvement of multiple stakeholders in co-creating research and practice improvement, and modelling and visualizing resilient performance are all opportunities to learn more about how healthcare succeeds under stress and normal operations.

In addition to the burden of psychosocial stress, there is increasing evidence of direct viral neuroinvasion of the central nervous system through physical contact with the nasal mucosa. In a parallel fashion, there is a significant body of ongoing research related to the risk of in utero viral transmission and the resulting neurodevelopmental impact in the fetus. Aberrant neurodevelopment secondary to viral transmission has previously been related to the later development of psychosis, schizophrenia, and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, generating the hypothesis that this population of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 may see an increased incidence in future decades. We discuss the current understanding of the possible neurotropism and vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and relate this to the history of viral pandemics to better understand the relationship of viral infection, aberrant immune response and neurodevelopment, and the risk for schizophrenia disorder.","output":"Prenatal exposure to viral infection and neuropsychiatric disorders in offspring: A review of the literature and recommendations for the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The quantity and composition of nutrients carried by rivers play an important role in maintaining the ecosystem of downstream rivers and marginal seas. To reveal the impact of damming on the composition and flux changes of nutrients in rivers, this study conducted a detailed survey of a large sub-tropical reservoir (Xinanjiang Reservoir, XAJR) in eastern China from August 2013 to June 2014 obtaining samples at bi-monthly intervals. The thermal stratification, water quality in situ parameters, and the contents of nutrients in the water column of the river inflow, transition area, central reservoir area, and discharge water of the XAJR were analyzed in detail along the fluvial direction. The results show that the thermal stratification of the XAJR had seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. Accordingly, the pH and dissolved oxygen saturation degree in water also showed a similar stratification phenomenon. The analysis of nutrient limitation for primary productivity indicated that in different seasons, varying limiting degrees of the silicon or phosphorus were developed in different locations along the XAJR- river system. Among them, the river area and transition area were more susceptible to silicon restriction in winter, whereas phosphorus restriction mainly occurred during the warm seasons from April to October. XAJR had a retention effect on nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon, among which phosphorus was more easily retained by the reservoir. In addition, nitrogen underwent transformation processes between different forms inside the reservoir. In the reservoir, the different degrees of retention effect of nutrients also led to a significant increase in the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water. This study confirmed that thermal stratification has important control over the contents and forms of nutrients in water. This finding provided an idea for the restoration of the fluxes and stoichiometric ratios of the nutrients in the downstream river using the reservoir's capacity for artificial regulation.","output":"Impact of a large sub-tropical reservoir on the cycling of nutrients in a river"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Native Americans are disproportionately affected by COVID-19.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalised adults and children (15 years) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A/B, RSV, rhinovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses, metapneumovirus, seasonal coronaviruses, adenovirus or bocavirus in a respiratory sample at admission between 2011 and 2020. RESULTS: A total of 6321 adult (1721 SARS-CoV-2) and 6379 paediatric (101 SARS-CoV-2) healthcare episodes were included in the study. In adults, SARS-CoV-2 positivity was independently associated with younger age, male sex, overweight/obesity, diabetes and hypertension, tachypnoea as well as better haemodynamic measurements, white cell count, platelet count and creatinine values. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 was associated with higher 30-day mortality as compared with influenza (adjusted HR (aHR) 4.43, 95% CI 3.51 to 5.59), RSV (aHR 3.81, 95% CI 2.72 to 5.34) and other respiratory viruses (aHR 3.46, 95% CI 2.61 to 4.60), as well as higher 90-day mortality, ICU admission, ICU mortality and pulmonary embolism in adults.

By contrast, the modeled reductions in tropospheric NO2 columns are about two times higher than those in surface NO2 concentrations. This discrepancy could be driven by the combined effects from uncertainties in simulations and observations, associated with possible inaccurate simulations of lower tropospheric NO2, larger uncertainties in the modeled interannual variabilities of NO2 columns, as well as insufficient consideration of aerosol effects and a priori NO2 variability in satellite retrievals.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lockdown. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lockdown in a second-phase cluster analysis. RESULTS: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lockdown in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths (Spain, Germany, Italy, UK, and France-cluster 1) fared poorly compared to those who declared lockdown early on (Belgium, Austria, New Zealand, India, Hungary, Poland and Malaysia-cluster 2). Sweden and South Korea, countries without lock-down, fared as good as the countries in cluster 2.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the risk factors for mortality in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with severe and critical COVID-19 from four hospitals in Wuhan, China, by evaluating the clinical characteristics and laboratory results, and using Cox proportional hazards model to assess the risk factors involved in disease progression. RESULTS: In total, 446 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The study indicated a high mortality rate (20.2%) in severe and critical COVID-19 patients. At the time of admission, all patients required oxygen therapy, and 52 (12%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, of which 50 (96%) died. The univariate Cox proportional hazards model showed a white blood cell count of more than 10  109/L (HR 3.993,95%CI 2.469 to 6.459) that correlated with an increased mortality rate. The multivariable Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that older age (HR 1.066, 95% CI 1.043 to 1.089) and higher white blood cell count (HR 1.135, 95% CI 1.080 to 1.192) were independent risk factors for determining COVID-19 associated mortality.

Treatment targeting this immune response might be beneficial but there is limited evidence on its efficacy. The aim of this study was to determine if early treatment of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with tocilizumab and/or steroids was associated with better outcome. METHODS: This observational single-center study included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were not intubated and received either standard of care (SOC, controls) or SOC plus early (within 3 days from hospital admission) anti-inflammatory treatment. SOC consisted of hydroxychloroquine 400mg bid plus, in those admitted before March 24th, also darunavir/ritonavir. Anti-inflammatory treatment consisted of either tocilizumab (8mg/kg intravenously or 162mg subcutaneously) or methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg for 5 days or both. Failure was defined as intubation or death, and the endpoints were failure-free survival (primary endpoint) and overall survival (secondary) at day 30. Difference between the groups was estimated as Hazard Ratio by a propensity score weighted Cox regression analysis (HROW). RESULTS: Overall, 196 adults were included in the analyses. They were mainly male (67.4%), with comorbidities (78.1%) and severe COVID-19 pneumonia (83.7%). Median age was 67.9 years (range, 30-100) and median PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg (IQR 133-289). Among them, 130 received early anti-inflammatory treatment with: tocilizumab (n = 29, 22.3%), methylprednisolone (n = 45, 34.6%), or both (n = 56, 43.1%). The adjusted failure-free survival among tocilizumab/methylprednisolone/SOC treated patients vs. SOC was 80.8% (95%CI, 72.8-86.7) vs. 64.1% (95%CI, 51.3-74.0), HROW 0.48, 95%CI, 0.23-0.99; p = 0.049.

The answers to a series of questions pertaining to the impact of COVID-19 on TAVI were collected and analyzed. These led subsequently to an expert consensus recommendation on the conduct of TAVI during the pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in a 25% (10-80) reduction of case volume and 53% of operators required triaging to manage their patients with severe aortic stenosis. The two most important parameters used to triage were symptoms and valve area. Periprocedural changes included the introduction of teleconsultation, preprocedure COVID-19 testing, optimization of protests, and catheterization laboratory set up. In addition, length of stay was reduced from a mean of 4.4 to 4 days. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on the delivery of TAVI services to patients in Asia.

With SARS-CoV-2 infection, there was an unexpectedly high and specific prevalence of olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs). These high rates of hyposmia and hypogeusia, initially reported as up to 89% in European case series, led to the global inclusion of loss of taste and/or smell as a distinctive feature of COVID-19. However, there is emerging evidence that there are striking differences in the rates of OTDs in East Asian countries where the disease first emerged, as compared to Western countries (15.8 vs. 60.9%, p-value &lt; 0.01). This may be driven by either variations in SARS-CoV-2 subtypes presenting to different global populations or genotypic differences in hosts which alter the predisposition of these different populations to the neuroinvasiveness of SARS-CoV-2. We also found that rates of OTDs were significantly higher in objective testing for OTDs as compared to subjective testing (73.6 vs. 60.8%, p-value = 0.03), which is the methodology employed by most studies. Concurrently, it has also become evident that racial minorities across geographically disparate world populations suffer from disproportionately higher rates of COVID-19 infection and mortality.

Further, the COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on residency selection that is undetermined. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine to what degree and the type of PRS SM content that drives prospective applicants' interest of a residency program, especially in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: Prospective PRS residency applicants were surveyed anonymously. RESULTS: An average of 60% of respondents reported that PRS social media (SM) content influenced their perception of a program. Fifty-eight percent reported that resident lifestyle content made them gain interest in a program. Separately, 32% reported that resident lifestyle content influenced them to rank a program higher. Seventy-two percent of respondents claimed SM content did not make them lose interest in a program. Rarely posting, outdated content, and lack of engagement were cited as factors for loss of interest in a program. A majority of respondents (53%) reported wanting to see more resident life and culture content on SM. Of the existing PRS SM content, respondents were most interested in resident lifestyle, followed by clinical and program-specific content. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic amplified the importance of SM PRS residency selection. Resident lifestyle content was consistently indicated as more likely to make respondents gain interest in a program, rank a program higher, and as the most desired content.

To determined how mROS activates the inflammasome, we transformed 293T cells with NLRP3, ASC, pro-caspase-1 and pro-IL-1 plus used THP1 derived macrophages to monitor the secretion of mature IL-1. This revealed that mROS activates a factor that is released via the NIM811-sensitive mitochondrial permeability pore (mtPTP) to activate the inflammasome.

Recently, it evolved to postoperative follow-up on selected cases, physical examination, and even teleconsultations direct to patients. Studies have reported that consultation can be offered safely to selected patients. Although this topic is already being addressed for a long time, recent studies have reported that there is still resistance among many orthopedic surgeons. Telemedicine for orthopedics has safely expanded its operations. It can be used in postoperative follow-up of selected cases, fracture follow-up, and even in pediatric cases. Remote diagnosis of fractures is done successfully on an outpatient basis in many countries. Protocols and methods to standardize the virtual orthopedic examination for common musculoskeletal conditions have been developed. Satisfaction with teleconsultations as well as cost-effectiveness of remote care orthopedics were already well reported by some studies.

In response, the reconfiguration of health systems to encourage greater collaboration and integration has been promoted with a variety of collaborative shapes and forms being encouraged and developed. Despite this continued interest, evidence for success of these various arrangements is lacking with the links between collaboration and improved performance often remaining uncertain. To date, many examinations of collaborations have been undertaken, but use of realist methodology may shed additional light on how and why collaboration works, and whom it benefits. Methods: This paper seeks to test initial context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOCs) of interorganisational collaboration with the view to producing a refined realist theory. This phase of the review used case study and evaluation literature;combined with supplementary systematic searches. These searches were screened for rigour and relevance, after which CMOCs were extracted from included literature and compared against existing ones for refinement, refutation, or affirmation. We also identified demi-regularities to better explain how these CMOCs were interlinked. Results: Fifty-one papers were included, from which 338 CMOCs were identified, where many were nonunique. This resulted in new mechanisms such as risk threshold and refinement of many others, including trust, confidence, and faith, into more well-defined constructs. Refinement and addition of CMOCs enabled the creation of a web of causality depicting how contextual factors form CMOC chains which generate outputs of collaborative behaviour. Core characteristics of collaborations, such as whether they were mandated or cross-sector, were explored for their proposed impact according to the theory. Conclusion: The formulation of this refined realist theory allows for greater understanding of how and why collaborations work and can serve to inform both future work in this area and the implementation of these arrangements.

To ensure continued response to the epidemic is most effective, it is imperative to better understand both retrospectively and prospectively the geographical evolution of COVID-19 caseloads and deaths at small-area resolution, identify localised areas in space-time at significantly higher risk, quantify the impact of changes in localised population mobility (or movement) on caseloads, identify localised risk factors for increased mortality and project the likely course of the epidemic at high spatial resolution in coming weeks. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical space-time SEIR model to assess the spatiotemporal variability of COVID-19 caseloads (transmission) and deaths at small-area scale in England [Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA), 6791 units] and by week (using observed data from week 5 to 34 of 2020), including key determinants, the modelled transmission dynamics and spatial-temporal random effects. We also estimate the number of cases and deaths at small-area resolution with uncertainty projected forward in time by MSOA (up to week 51 of 2020), the impact mobility reductions (and subsequent easing) have had on COVID-19 caseloads and quantify the impact of key socio-demographic risk factors on COVID-19 related mortality risk by MSOA. Reductions in population mobility during the course of the first lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction of COVID-19 caseloads across England, however local authorities have had a varied rate of reduction in population movement which our model suggest has substantially impacted the geographic heterogeneity in caseloads at small-area scale. The steady gain in population mobility, observed from late April, appears to have contributed to a slowdown in caseload reductions towards late June and subsequent start of the second wave. MSOA with higher proportions of elderly (70+ years of age) and elderly living in deprivation, both with very distinct geographic distributions, have a significantly elevated COVID-19 mortality rates. While non-pharmaceutical interventions (that is, reductions in population mobility and social distancing) had a profound impact on the trajectory of the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in England, increased population mobility appears to have significantly contributed to the second wave. A number of contiguous small-areas appear to be at a significant elevated risk of high COVID-19 transmission, many of which are also at increased risk for higher mortality rates.

Philosopher of education Joseph Schwab, who analysed the practical nature of teaching, concluded that teachers make choices every minute in the classroom, and demanded that their autonomy be expanded. This article identifies parallels between these two philosophical moves and suggests complementing features.

Simultaneously, due to staff shortages and the Polish health-care system being seriously challenged, many students were eager to contribute to the fight against the outbreak. This study explores medial student volunteers (MSV) perspectives and their lived experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Material and Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty-one students. Results: A total of seven major themes emerged from the interviews: 1. students reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2. students experiences of the outbreak, 3. motivations for volunteering, 4. students perceptions of the COVID-19 volunteering, 5. organization of students volunteering, 6. benefits and costs of volunteering during COVID-19, and 7. social perception of MSVs. Although students volunteering was an example of civic responsibility and created new learning opportunities, many students felt unprepared for the pandemic, lacked social skills and access to psychological support, and were the target of stigmatization and discrimination. Discussion: Because during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic medical universities were closed and classes were held online, students volunteering became an important part of service learning and created an opportunity for education. Consequently, while it benefited students, patients and the healthcare system, students involvement reinforced such important values of medical ethos as: altruism, public service, and (professional) solidarity. However, some systemic approach should be undertaken that would prepare students better for future crises.","output":"Who Else If Not We.

In March 2020, the German government passed the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act that guaranteed compensation payments for these limitations. In this study the regional impact of this intervention were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The performance data and revenue figures for the departments of general and visceral surgery of the University Hospital of Erlangen (UKER) and the District Hospital St. Anna H?chstadt/Aisch (KKH) during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2019 were compared with the respective period in 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in bed occupancy rates and case numbers of inpatient treatment. The latter declined by 20.06% in the UKER and 60.76% in the KKH. Nononcological elective surgery was reduced by 33.04% in the UKER and 60.87% in the KKH. The number of emergency procedures remained unchanged in the UKER, while they decreased by 51.58% in the KKH. The revenues from diagnosis-related groups (DRG) decreased by 22.12% (UKER) and 54% (KKH), respectively. After taking compensation payments and savings from variable material costs into account, the UKER recorded a loss of -3.87%, while there was a positive revenue effect of 6.5% in the KKH. DISCUSSION: The nonselective restriction of elective surgery had a significant impact on patient care and revenue figures at both locations. With respect to the increase of intensive care capacities, such untargeted measures do not appear to be efficient. In addition, the fixed rate of compensation payments led to an unbalanced distribution of the financial aid between the two departments.","output":"[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in general and visceral surgery : A comparison of performance and revenue data from two departments of hospitals with different levels of referral]./ ?konomische Auswirkung der COVID-19-Pandemie in der Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie : Ein Vergleich von Leistungs- und Erl?sdaten zweier Kliniken aus Krankenh?usern unterschiedlicher Versorgungsstufen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 is one of the major health crisis that has affected the world in the past century. With the emergence of new strains of viruses and antimicrobial resistance, the world is looking for an alternate therapeutic option to fight infectious disease. Objective: The present study evaluated the efficacy of a novel polyherbal formulation, named NOQ19, against SARS-CoV-2 in an in vitro setting. NOQ 19 is an unique blend of 13 Ayurvedic herbs. Method: ology: Vero E6 (CL1008), the African green monkey kidney epithelial cell, were infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate USA-WA1/2020) in a 96 well-plate. NOQ19 test material was diluted in different concentration as follows 0.05mg/ml, 0.1mg/ml, 0.2mg/ml, 0.3mg/ml, 0.4mg/ml, 0.5mg/ml, 0.6mg/ml, 0.7mg/ml, 0.8mg/ml and 0.9mg/ml. These different concentrations of NOQ19 were added to infected cells respectively and incubated for 3 days in 5% CO2 incubator.

However, we lack insights into local communities experiences in coping with the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study explored both the impact of, and response to, COVID-19 within the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp (Belgium) during the first lockdown period (March 2020 C May 2020). METHODS: We conducted an explorative qualitative study using a participatory approach. First, we performed a community mapping to identify relevant stakeholders. Through the active involvement of a community advisory board and based on qualitative interviews with key-informants and community members, we elicited lived experiences, attitudes, and perceptions towards COVID-19. Interviews were conducted both face-to-face and using online web conferencing technology. Data were analyzed inductively according to the principles of thematic analysis. RESULTS: Government-issued outbreak control measures presented context-specific challenges to the Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp. They related mainly to the remote organization of religious life, and practicing physical distancing in socially and culturally strongly connected communities. Existing community resources were rapidly mobilized to adapt to the outbreak and to self-organize response initiatives within communities. The active involvement of community and religious leaders in risk communication proved to be of great importance to facilitate the coverage and uptake of pandemic control measures while protecting essential community values and traditions. Creating bottom-up and community-adapted communication strategies, including addressing language barriers and involving Rabbis in the dissemination of prevention messages, fostered a feeling of trust in governments response measures. However, unmet information and prevention needs were also identified, such as the need for inclusive communication by public authorities and the need to mitigate the negative effects of stigmatization. CONCLUSION: The experiences of Orthodox Jewish communities in Antwerp demonstrate a valuable example of a feasible community-centered approach to health emergencies. Increasing the engagement of communities in local decision-making and governance structures remains a key strategy to respond to unmet information and prevention needs.","output":"Understanding how communities respond to COVID-19: experiences from the Orthodox Jewish communities of Antwerp city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to improve the knowledge on Generation Z as employees within workforce and in the workplace, as well as on the main thematic trends that drive the research on the topic.

Korth., commonly known as Kadam, is an endangered and pharmaceutically valued tree of the family Rubiaceae. The numerous medicinal properties are attributed to the various alkaloids of this plant. Poor seedling survival (due to very small size of seeds, approximately 10,000 per gm), overexploitation and habitat destruction are the major constraints in conserving the wild stocks of this species. This paper reports a significant, improved, and repeatable micropropagation protocol of M. parvifolia using nodal explants of a mature tree. Nodal explants harvested during spring season from the lopped tree differentiated the maximum number of axillary shoots (5.3  0.82 per node) on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 3.0 mg L(?1) 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and additives (25 mg L(?1) each of adenine sulfate, L-arginine, and citric acid and 50 mg L(?1) ascorbic acid). Shoots were amplified in vitro through (1) recurrent transfer of mother explants and (2) subculturing on fresh nutrient medium. The greatest number of shoots (13.4  1.26) with an average length of 6.2  1.03 cm was produced after 4 wk on MS medium containing 0.5 mg L(?1) BAP, 0.25 mg L(?1) kinetin (Kin), 0.1 mg L(?1) Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), additives, 100 mg L(?1) activated charcoal (AC), and 0.8% (w/v) agar. This is the first report of concurrent ex vitro rooting and acclimatization (CEVRA) in M. parvifolia. About 90% micropropagated shoots rooted ex vitro on pulse treatment of 500 mg L(?1) Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA; for 5 min) and produced 8.5  0.97 roots per shoot with an average length of 9.40  1.06 cm, after 5 wk.

Here, we take a culturally sensitive approach to try and better disentangle factors that may contribute to misconceptions about epilepsy in Zimbabwe. Methods: Initially, through a series of community-based workshops organised by the Epilepsy Support Foundation of Zimbabwe, we analysed stigmatisation of epilepsy in urban and rural settings. Workshops consisted of initial presentations on epilepsy followed by small group discussions. We implemented learning from these workshops to develop surveys, translated into native Zimbabwean languages, to capture, at scale, how both the person with epilepsy and those close to them perceive epilepsy. Results: Around 100 people participated in workshops based in Harare, Masvingo and Gweru. Considerable stigmatisation persists, particularly perpetuated by older members of local communities. Men with epilepsy felt disempowered by their ability to not work or participate in certain social activities. Both men and women agreed, however, that females with epilepsy were more likely to be subject to prejudice and potentially exposed to greater risk C for example having to cook on open fires away from other village members. While the survey questionnaires are prepared, deployment has not yet proved possible owing to the COVID 19 pandemic. Conclusions: Our study again emphasises that multiple misconceptions surround epilepsy, which can lead to severe stigmatisation. The surveys will provide the detailed insight necessary to develop tailored solutions to help empower those with epilepsy as well as the friends and family who help care for them.","output":"Epilepsy in Zimbabwe C an historical and ethnographic approach to demystifying an ancient disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi COVID-19 telah melanda seluruh dunia pada beberapa bulan terakhir.

Preclinical and clinical studies are required to investigate if itraconazole is effective for the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: Due to the initial absence of preclinical models, the effect of itraconazole was explored in a clinical, proof-of-concept, open-label, single-center study, in which hospitalized COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care with or without itraconazole. Primary outcome was the cumulative score of the clinical status until day 15 based on the 7-point ordinal scale of the World Health Organization. In parallel, itraconazole was evaluated in a newly established hamster model of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission, as soon as the model was validated. FINDINGS: In the hamster acute infection model, itraconazole did not reduce viral load in lungs, stools or ileum, despite adequate plasma and lung drug concentrations. In the transmission model, itraconazole failed to prevent viral transmission. The clinical trial was prematurely discontinued after evaluation of the preclinical studies and because an interim analysis showed no signal for a more favorable outcome with itraconazole: mean cumulative score of the clinical status 49 vs 47, ratio of geometric means 1.01 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.19) for itraconazole vs standard of care. INTERPRETATION: Despite in vitro activity, itraconazole was not effective in a preclinical COVID-19 hamster model. This prompted the premature termination of the proof-of-concept clinical study.

METHODS: COPD patients on acute exacerbation admitted to our hospital from COPD patients from January 2019 to March 2020 was selected. The characteristics and ratio of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of small pulmonary vessels to the total area of the lung field, and the ratio of pulmonary artery and aorta (PA/A) cross-sectional diameter in patients with COPD were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 128 COPD patients were included. There were significant differences in the duration of COPD, smoking history, the PaO(2), PaCO(2), pH, and FEV1, FVC and FEV1/FVC among COPD patients with different severity (all p < 0.05). The duration of COPD, smoking, PaO(2), PaCO(2), CSA and PA/A were correlated with the COPD severity (all p < 0.05). Both CSA, PA/A were correlated with post BD FEV1 (all p < 0.05).

Our proposal is based on the idea that data streams, stream transformations, and stream-processing programs should be classified using types. The type of a data stream is captured formally by a monoid, an algebraic structure with a distinguished binary operation and a unit. The elements of a monoid model the finite fragments of a stream, the binary operation represents the concatenation of stream fragments, and the unit is the empty fragment. Stream transformations are modeled using monotone functions on streams, which we call stream transductions. These functions can be implemented using abstract machines with a potentially infinite state space, which we call stream transducers. This abstract typed framework of stream transductions and transducers can be used to (1) verify the correctness of streaming computations, that is, that an implementation adheres to the desired behavior, (2) prove the soundness of optimizing transformations, e.g. for parallelization and distribution, and (3) inform the design of programming models and query languages for stream processing.

Little is known about whether new dental graduates' (NDGs') perspectives and use of evidence-based practice (EBP) change when they enter professional practice.Aim To explore changes in NDGs' perception of EBP for: self-efficacy; knowledge of EBP principles; attitudes; confidence in appraisal skills; and frequency of accessing evidence.Methods Two pre-validated instruments: knowledge, attitude, confidence and accessing EBP resources, EBP confidence scale, and clinical scenarios. NDGs from one dental school completed the questionnaire upon graduation (R1) and six to nine months into vocational dental training (R2).Results Response rates of R1 were 34 (52%) and R2, 21 (62% of R1, 32% overall). Between R1 and R2, knowledge (median [25th-75th percentiles]: R1 = 4 [2.5-4]; R2 = 3 [2.8-3], p = 0.07), self-efficacy (R1 = 645 [587-782]; R2 = 630 [550-690], p = 0.8) and scores related to knowledge of gold standards were comparable. However, attitude (R1 = 38 [34-39], R2 = 27 [25-30]), confidence in appraisal skills (R1 = 16 [14-20], R2 = 11[8-16]) and frequency of accessing evidence (R1 = 26 [22-28]; R2 = 18 [16-19]) all showed statistically significant reductions.Conclusion After six months in professional practice, NDGs showed statistically significant reductions in the value they place on EBP, their EBP-related skills and their use of reliable evidence sources.

MGCTs, as GCTs at other extragonadal sites, are thought to arise from germ cells improperly retained during migration along the midline during embryogenesis. Similar to their counterparts in the testes, MGCTs are classified into seminomatous and nonseminomatous GCTs. Seminomatous MGCT represents pure seminoma, whereas nonseminomatous MGCTs encompass pure yolk sac tumors, embryonal carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, mature or immature teratoma, and mixed GCTs with any combination of GCT types, including seminoma. Somatic-type or hematologic malignancies can also occur in association with a primary MGCT. MGCTs share molecular findings with GCTs at other sites, most commonly the presence of chromosome 12p gains and isochromosome i(12p). Treatment includes neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection of residual tumor, with the exception of benign teratomas, which require only surgical resection without chemotherapy.

Here, I report a comparative study of these ORF proteins, mainly encoded in two gene clusters, i.e. between the Spike and the Envelope genes, and between the Membrane and the Nucleocapsid genes. For brevity and focus, a greater emphasis was placed on the first cluster, collectively designated as the 'orf3 region' for ease of referral. Overall, an apparently diverse set of ORFs, such as ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF4 and ORF5, but not necessarily numbered in that order on all CoV genomes, were analyzed along with other ORFs. Unexpectedly, the gene order or naming of the ORFs were never fully conserved even within the members of one Genus. These studies also unraveled hitherto unrecognized orf genes in alternative translational frames, encoding potentially novel polypeptides as well as some that are highly similar to known ORFs. Finally, several options of an inclusive and systematic numbering are proposed not only for the orf3 region but also for the other orf genes in the viral genome in an effort to regularize the apparently confusing names and orders. Regardless of the ultimate acceptability of one system over the others, this treatise is hoped to initiate an informed discourse in this area.","output":"Systematizing the genomic order and relatedness in the open reading frames (ORFs) of the coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In Nigeria, about 1.25million induced abortions occur annually and the country accounts for one-fifth of abortion-related deaths globally.

This study presents a functional folded nasolabial island flap (FNIF) that can be used to repair large-sized full-thickness alar defects in a straightforward manner. METHODS This retrospective study included seven patients who received a FNIF for a full-thickness alar defect between January 2007 and December 2020. The FNIF is different from the conventional nasolabial flap in that it is folded and twisted to achieve nostril reconstruction with a satisfactory three-dimensional mucosal lining in a single stage. The cosmetic and functional results of FNIF were evaluated by both patients and physicians. RESULTS The age ranged from 51 to 82 years (mean, 65.6 years). The causes of the defects were squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and trigeminal trophic syndrome. The nostril lining did not collapse, there was no hypertrophic scarring, and air movement through the nostrils on the flap side was normal. Overall, FNIF produced excellent aesthetic and functional outcomes, with minimal patient discomfort. There were no postoperative complications. CONCLUSION Compared with existing reconstruction methods for large full-thickness alar defects, FNIF can easily achieve aesthetic and functional success in a single-stage procedure.

Methods: Ovid MEDLINE and Compendex were searched from inception to January 2021. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and full text of potentially relevant reviews, using a priori inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria were systematic reviews examining effects of HVAC design features on virus transmission. Two reviewers independently assessed methodological quality using AMSTAR2. Results: Searching identified 361 citations, 45 were potentially relevant, and 7 were included. Reviews were published between 2007 and 2021, and included 47 virus studies. Two earlier reviews (2007, 2016) of 21 studies found sufficient evidence that mechanical ventilation (airflow patterns, ventilation rates) plays a role in airborne transmission; however, both found insufficient evidence to quantify minimum mechanical ventilation requirements. One review (2017) of 9 studies examining humidity and indoor air quality found that influenza virus survival was lowest between 40% and 80% relative humidity; authors noted that ventilation rates were a confounding variable. Two reviews (2021) examined mitigation strategies for coronavirus transmission, finding droplet transmission decreased with increasing temperature and relative humidity. One review (2020) identified 14 studies examining coronavirus transmission in air-conditioning systems, finding HVAC systems played a role in virus spread during previous coronavirus outbreaks. One review (2020) examined virus transmission interventions on public ground transportation, finding ventilation and filtration to be effective. Discussion: Seven reviews synthesizing 47 studies demonstrate a role of HVAC in mitigating airborne virus transmission. Ventilation, humidity, temperature, and filtration can play a role in viability and transmission of viruses, including coronaviruses.

A total of 1959 students were recruited in this study and ages ranged from 18 to 55 years old. RESULTS: Among the respondents, 55.03% were female, 93.8% were from Duhok province, and the majority of participants (93.4%) were undergraduate students. The overall correct answer rate of the knowledge questions toward COVID-19 was 75.8% with an average score of 9.1  2.1 SD out of 12. Participants showed better knowledge of infection prevention with around 86.2% correct answers, while the lowermost subscale scores were (67.7%) for questions toward the mode of the transmission of the infection. We found a significant difference in knowledge scores across genders, marital status, program of study, and among different colleges/institutes (P < 0.001).

Patient clinical symptoms were relieved or disappeared, and basic clinical information and laboratory test results were collected. The study focused on the most recent CT imaging characteristics. RESULTS: The average age of the 12 patients was 58.8  16.2 years. The most prevalent symptoms were fever (100%), dyspnea (100%), and cough (83.3%). All patients experienced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), of which 9 were moderate to severe. Six patients used noninvasive ventilators, and 4 patients used mechanical ventilation. One patient was treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The lymphocyte count decreased to 0.67  0.3 ( 10 (9)/L). The average day from illness onset to the last follow-up CT was 56.1  7.7 d. The CT results showed a decrease in ground glass opacities (GGO), whereas fibrosis gradually increased. The common CT features included GGO (10/12, 83.3%), subpleural line (10/12, 83.3%), fibrous stripes (12/12, 100%), and traction bronchiectasis (10/12, 83.3%). Eight patients (66.7%) showed predominant reticulation and interlobular thickening. Four patients (33.3%) showed predominant GGO. Lung segments involved were 174/216 (80.6%). CONCLUSIONS: Fibrous stripes and GGO are common CT signs in critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in the early recovery period. Signs of pulmonary fibrosis in survivors should be carefully monitored.","output":"Pulmonary fibrosis in critical ill patients recovered from COVID-19 pneumonia: Preliminary experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of the article is to present some kind of injustice of fate in the aspect of uneven territorialdistribution of post-Covid-19 deaths.

Details on two underwater sites are reported: Cape Bruguieres, comprising > 260 recorded lithic artefacts at depths down to -2.4 m below sea level, and Flying Foam Passage where the find spot is associated with a submerged freshwater spring at -14 m. The sites were discovered through a purposeful research strategy designed to identify underwater targets, using an iterative process incorporating a variety of aerial and underwater remote sensing techniques and diver investigation within a predictive framework to map the submerged landscape within a depth range of 0-20 m. The condition and context of the lithic artefacts are analysed in order to unravel their depositional and taphonomic history and to corroborate their in situ position on a pre-inundation land surface, taking account of known geomorphological and climatic processes including cyclone activity that could have caused displacement and transportation from adjacent coasts. Geomorphological data and radiometric dates establish the chronological limits of the sites and demonstrate that they cannot be later than 7000 cal BP and 8500 cal BP respectively, based on the dates when they were finally submerged by sea-level rise. Comparison of underwater and onshore lithic assemblages shows differences that are consistent with this chronological interpretation. This article sets a foundation for the research strategies and technologies needed to identify archaeological targets at greater depth on the Australian continental shelf and elsewhere, building on the results presented.

The COVID-19 vaccine is the first to be developed within a period of one year. The expediency associated with the development of the COVID-19 vaccine has however been hampered by vaccine hesitancy and other relevant factors that could influence consequent immunisation. This study aimed at investigating factors associated with vaccine hesitancy and willingness to pay for COVID-19 vaccination. METHODS: A cross sectional approach was used to undertake online and physical data collection with a validated questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 1767 valid responses were received, female participants were in the minority (42.2%), majority (54.9%) of the study participants were between the ages of 18 and 30 years, and more than half (53.8%) of the participants were educated up to first degree level. Slightly above half (52.9%) of the study participants indicated that they were worried about side effects that may be associated with COVID-19 vaccines, and this may likely prevent them from taking the vaccine. A strong majority (85.1%) of the study participants indicated that COVID-19 vaccine should be administered at no cost to citizens. Only a quarter (26%) of the participants were willing to pay a fee for COVID-19 vaccination. Also, older participants and those that had been previously infected with COVID-19 were more likely to pay for COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSION: This study provides critical insights which could influence immunisation efforts during the pandemic. An early understanding of population perceptions of the COVID-19 vaccine can be invaluable in designing successful campaigns. This is even more critical, given supply limitations, access issues and vaccines inequity occasioned by the international scramble.","output":"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and willingness to pay: Emergent factors from a cross-sectional study in Nigeria"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We conduct an adaptive randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a SMS-based information campaign on the adoption of social distancing and handwashing in rural Bihar, India, six months into the COVID-19 pandemic.

The syndrome accompanying predominant right anterior temporal atrophy has previously been described as memory loss, prosopagnosia, getting lost and behavioural changes. Accurate detection is challenging, as the clinical syndrome might be confused with either behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) or Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, based on neuroimaging features, the syndrome has been considered a right-sided variant of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Therefore, we aimed to demarcate the clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of rtvFTD versus svPPA, bvFTD and Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, we aimed to compare its neuroimaging profile against svPPA, which is associated with predominant left anterior temporal atrophy. Of 619 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia or primary progressive aphasia, we included 70 subjects with a negative amyloid status in whom predominant right temporal lobar atrophy was identified based on blinded visual assessment of their initial brain MRI scans. Clinical symptoms were assessed retrospectively and compared with age- and sex-matched patients with svPPA (n = 70), bvFTD (n = 70) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 70). Prosopagnosia, episodic memory impairment and behavioural changes such as disinhibition, apathy, compulsiveness and loss of empathy were the most common initial symptoms, whereas during the disease course, patients developed language problems such as word-finding difficulties and anomia. Distinctive symptoms of rtvFTD compared to the other groups included depression, somatic complaints, and motor/mental slowness. Aside from right temporal atrophy, the imaging pattern showed volume loss of the right ventral frontal area and the left temporal lobe, which represented a close mirror image of svPPA. Atrophy of the bilateral temporal poles and the fusiform gyrus were associated with prosopagnosia in rtvFTD. Our results highlight that rtvFTD has a unique clinical presentation. Since current diagnostic criteria do not cover specific symptoms of the rtvFTD, we propose a diagnostic tree to be used to define diagnostic criteria and call for an international validation.","output":"A clinical-radiological framework of the right temporal variant of frontotemporal dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The present study is aimed at estimating patient flow dynamic parameters and requirement for hospital beds. Second, the effects of age and gender on parameters were evaluated. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 987 COVID-19 patients were enrolled from SMS Medical College, Jaipur (Rajasthan, India). The survival analysis was carried out from February 29 through May 19, 2020, for two hazards: Hazard 1 was hospital discharge, and Hazard 2 was hospital death. The starting point for survival analysis of the two hazards was considered to be hospital admission. The survival curves were estimated and additional effects of age and gender were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: The Kaplan Meier estimates of lengths of hospital stay (median = 10 days, IQR = 5C15 days) and median survival rate (more than 60 days due to a large amount of censored data) were obtained. The Cox model for Hazard 1 showed no significant effect of age and gender on duration of hospital stay. Similarly, the Cox model 2 showed no significant difference of age and gender on survival rate. The case fatality rate of 8.1%, recovery rate of 78.8%, mortality rate of 0.10 per 100 person-days, and hospital admission rate of 0.35 per 100,000 person-days were estimated.

Sera from autoimmune patients and from MRL/lpr and NZB/W lupus-prone mice reacted with the C-terminal residues of lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)2A. No cross-reaction was observed with LAMP2B or LAMP2C variants, with dsDNA or mononucleosomes, or with heat-shock protein A8. Moreover, administering chromatography-purified LAMP2A autoantibodies to MRL/lpr mice accelerated mortality. Furthermore, flow cytometry revealed elevated cell-surface expression of LAMP2A on MRL/lpr B cells. These findings reveal the involvement of a new class of autoantibodies targeting the C-terminus of LAMP2A, a receptor for cytosolic proteins targeted for degradation via chaperone-mediated autophagy. These autoantibodies could affect the autophagy process, which is abnormally upregulated in lupus.

Immunosuppressive therapy and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) may abrogate the ability of transplanted patients to mount an adequate immune response to vaccines. We assessed the immune response of patients after allogeneic HCT to the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) and identified patient and treatment-related factors that predict humoral response in this population. Methods: We conducted an observational prospective cohort study at Rabin Medical Center, Israel. Adult patients after allogeneic HCT were eligible if they had no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and received the 2-dose BNT162b2 vaccine. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant (Abbott?,) assay was performed 4-6 weeks after the second vaccine for quantitative measurement of IgG antibodies to spike protein (S-IgG) of SARS-CoV-2. The assay result was considered positive if S-IgG level was 50 AU/ml. We used the likelihood ratio of the ROC curves to define the optimal cut-off for continuous variables, 2 to compare variables on categorical scale and Mann-Whitney to compare medians. To predict seronegativity, we applied logistic regression with the exp() as an estimator of hazard-ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) around it. To predict S-IgG levels, we used linear regression. Results: Our cohort included 106 patients. Median age was 65 (range: 23-80) years and 59% were males. Median time from transplant to vaccination was 42 (range: 4-439) months. At time of vaccination, 49% of patients were receiving immunosuppression, while 51% were not. Overall, 14% (15/106) tested negative for S-IgG after vaccination, 27% (14/52) of patients on immunosuppression compared with only 1.8% (1/54) of patients off immunosuppression (p=0.0002). Based on ROC analysis we divided the cohort into patients who were transplanted within (57%) vs. beyond (43%) 4.5y (AUC 0.77, CI: 0.66-0.88). With this cut-off, the sensitivity was 0.93. In univariate analysis, patients vaccinated within 4.5y of HCT (HR: 13.7, 95% CI 1.8-108.5, p=0.013), or still receiving immunosuppression (HR: 9.8, 95% CI 2.1-44.7, p=0.004) and patients with moderate to severe chronic GVHD (HR: 5.9, 95% CI 1.2-29, p=0.03) were more likely to remain seronegative. Age, gender, type of disease and absolute-lymphocyte-count did not predict seronegativity. In MVA, only time, i.e. <4.5y from HCT remained predictive (HR: 10.8, 95% CI 1.2-93.2, p=0.03) (Table 2). Since 93% (14/15) of seronegative patients were transplanted <4.5y, we performed a subgroup analysis of the 57% (60/106) of patients that were transplanted within this time frame. Among these, patients receiving immunosuppression (65%, 39/60) were more likely to remain seronegative (HR: 10, 95% CI: 1.1-93, p=0.03); 36% (14/39) of patients on immunosuppression remained seronegative compared with none of the patients off immunosuppression (p=0.002). Among the 43% (46/106) of patients who were vaccinated >4.5y after HCT, 33% (15/46) were still receiving immunosuppression. Yet only 6.6% (1/15) in this subgroup tested negative. Titer levels in seropositive patients ranged between 60 and 80,000 AU/ml (median: 5319). Only a small fraction of this variance is explained by variables tested in this study. Older age (r 2=0.04, p=0.04), shorter time from transplantation (r 2=0.03, p=0.09), the use of corticosteroids (r 2=0.03, p=0.07) or calcineurin inhibitors (r 2=0.06, p=0.013) predicted lower S-IgG levels. The vaccine was well tolerated by most patients. No new cases of GVHD have been reported following vaccination. However, seven patients with chronic GVHD (mild=2; moderate=1; severe=4) reported that GVHD -related symptoms worsened within days following the first, second or both vaccines. Notably, one patient with chronic GVHD developed grade 4 steroid-refractory immune thrombocytopenia 2 weeks after the first vaccine. Conclusion: Overall, 14% of allogeneic HCT recipients had an inadequate antibody response to the BNT162b2 vaccine. It was only 6.5% among patients off immunosuppression and patients vaccinated >4.5y after HCT. However, inadequate antibody response rate was 36% among recipients vaccinated <4.5y from HCT who were still receiving immunosuppression.

Control of odours is also socially important and believed to be a societal measure of cleanliness. Understanding the need for good cleaning and disinfecting is even more important today considering the potential spread of emerging pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 virus. While the flush toilet was a major advancement in achieving these objectives, exposure to pathogens can occur from failure to clean and disinfect areas within a restroom, as well as poor hand hygiene. The build-up of biofilm within a toilet bowl/urinal including sink can result in the persistence of pathogens and odours. During flushing, pathogens can be ejected from the toilet bowl/urinal/sink and be transmitted by inhalation and contaminated fomites. Use of automatic toilet bowl cleaners can reduce the number of microorganisms ejected during a flush. Salmonella bacteria can colonize the underside of the rim of toilets and persist up to 50 days. Pathogenic enteric bacteria appear in greater numbers in the biofilm found in toilets than in the water. Source tracking of bacteria in homes has demonstrated that during cleaning enteric bacteria are transferred from the toilet to the bathroom sinks and that these same bacteria colonize cleaning tools used in the restroom. Quantitative microbial risk assessment has shown that significant risks exist from both aerosols and fomites in restrooms. Cleaning with soaps and detergents without the use of disinfectants in public restrooms may spread bacteria and viruses throughout the restroom. Odours in restrooms are largely controlled by ventilation and flushing volume in toilet/urinals. However, this results in increased energy and water usage.

DATA SOURCES PubMed, Medline Ovid database, and article reference lists. REVIEW METHODS A structured literature search was performed to identify current English language articles relating to the objectives of this study using the aforementioned data sources, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The search was limited to submissions published between January 1, 2015, and January 1, 2020. CONCLUSIONS Numerous proposals have been made for improving the otolaryngology residency application and selection process and addressing the competitive nature of the Match. These proposals include but are not limited to mandating a secondary essay, implementing consortia and early match processes, using a signaling system, conducting regional and web-based interviews, offering early engagement with interest groups, instituting a hard cap on applications, increasing costs of applying, counseling self-restraint to prospective applicants, and creating application filters. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE As the volume of literature surrounding the OTO-HNS Match continues to increase, this review aims to provide a summary of past proposals and serve as a guide for possible future innovations. We propose 3 initiatives that may improve the residency application and selection process for both program and resident, with minimal impact to the current National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) Match structure.","output":"Ideas and Innovations to Improve the Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Residency Application and Selection Process."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Size- and time-dependent particle removal efficiency (PRE) of different protective respiratory masks were determined using a standard aerosol powder with the size of particles in the range of an uncoated SARS-CoV-2 virus and small respiratory droplets.

The Middle East has a death toll of 50,000 and over 20,000 of these are in Iran, which has over 350,000 confirmed cases. We expect that Iranian cases caused outbreaks in the neighbouring countries and that variant mapping and phylogenetic analysis can be used to prove this. We also aim to analyse the variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to characterise the common genome variants and provide useful data in the global effort to prevent further spread of COVID-19. Methods The approach uses bioinformatics approaches including multiple sequence alignment, variant calling and annotation and phylogenetic analysis to identify the genomic variants found in the region. The approach uses 122 samples from the 13 countries of the Middle East sourced from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Findings We identified 2200 distinct genome variants including 129 downstream gene variants, 298 frame shift variants, 789 missense variants, 1 start lost, 13 start gained, 1 stop lost, 249 synonymous variants and 720 upstream gene variants. The most common, high impact variants were 10818delTinsG, 2772delCinsC, 14159delCinsC and 2789delAinsA. Variant alignment and phylogenetic tree generation indicates that samples from Iran likely introduced COVID-19 to the rest of the Middle East. Interpretation The phylogenetic and variant analysis provides unique insight into mutation types in genomes. Initial introduction of COVID-19 was most likely due to Iranian transmission. Some countries show evidence of novel mutations and unique strains. Increased time in small populations is likely to contribute to more unique genomes.

We investigated the COVID-19 induced lockdown effects in India through an interrupted time series analysis coupled with a survey result of 729 consumers, 225 farmers and synthesis of the literature evidence on food loss as well as food waste. Our article complements the literature inventory on COVID-19 by estimating and tracking the effects on prices and consumer behaviour in the long-run apart from discussing the implications for food loss and waste. Prices post-lockdown shot up immediately and significantly for chickpea (4.8%), mung bean (5.2%), and tomato (78.2%) corroborating the loss in highly perishable product C tomato C owing to its spiked price. We find no structural break in prices due to lockdown implying that lockdown-induced price change was not sufficient to alter the long-run price movement, and the prices of the major commodities reverted to the pre-lockdown levels. The pandemic induced lockdown did restrict the access to food markets and a majority of consumers (75.31%) experienced a price increase across COVID zones of different intensity of incidence leading to food loss along supply chain and wastage at consumers end. Consumers livelihood affected from moderate (59.53%) to severe (3.3%) with 92 per cent reporting a change in shopping behavior. The Kruskal-Wallis test on consumption behavior change indicated a significant shift among the consumers reporting altered income, mostly in the downside, post-lockdown. Despite the relaxation for agricultural related activities during the lockdown, farmers reported disruption in disposing their winter produce barring wheat, bolstered by a record state procurement in 2020. The paper affirms that the pandemic has caused a significant price change and unprecedented panic purchase that led to the food wastage but subsided soon exhibiting the resilience in Indian agriculture. We strongly recommend for promoting the capacity and collective resilience of small-scale production systems through institutions, policies and reforms. Contract farming, farmer producer organizations, creation and functioning of social safety nets to overcome income, production and price shocks, access to digital national markets and capacity building on food waste management practices will insulate vulnerable section as well as reduce the loss of food across supply chain.","output":"COVID-19 induced lockdown effects on agricultural commodity prices and consumer behaviour in India C Implications for food loss and waste management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 pandemic caused huge decrease of pediatric admissions to Emergency Department (ED), arising concerns about possible delays in diagnosis and treatment of severe disorders Methods Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Emergency Room (ICOPER) was a retrospective multicentre observational study including 23 Italian EDs All the children &lt;18 years admitted, between March 9th and May 3rd 2020 stratified by age, priority code, cause of admission and outcome have been included and compared to those admitted in the same period of 2019 Our objectives were to assess the characteristics of pediatric admissions to EDs since COVID-19 outbreak until the end of lockdown, and to describe the features of critical children Findings 16,426 children were admitted in 2020, compared to 55,643 in 2019 (-7048%) Higher reduction was reported in hospitals without Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) (-7338%) than in those with PICU (-6408%) (P&lt;00001) Admissions with low priority decreased more than critical ones (-8277% vs 4417% respectively;P&lt;00001) Reduction of discharged patients was observed both in hospitals with (-6650%) and without PICU (-7465%) (P&lt;00001) No difference in the duration of symptoms before admission was reported between 2019 and 2020, with the majority of children accessing within 24 h (5508% vs 5728% respectively;P = 02344) Interpretation Admissions with low priority decreased significantly more than those with high priority;we suppose that the fear of being infected in hospital maybe overcame the concerns of caregivers Compared to 2019, no significant referral delay by caregivers was reported Our data suggest the need of adaptation of EDs and primary care services to different needs of children during COVID-9 pandemic","output":"Pediatric admissions to emergency departments of North-Western Italy during COVID-19 pandemic: A retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The production of recombinant proteins is one of the major successes of biotechnology. Animal cells are required to synthesize proteins with the appropriate post-translational modifications. Transgenic animals are being used for this purpose. Milk, egg white, blood, urine, seminal plasma and silk worm cocoon from transgenic animals are candidates to be the source of recombinant proteins at an industrial scale. Although the first recombinant protein produced by transgenic animals is expected to be in the market in 2000, a certain number of technical problems remain to be solved before the various systems are optimized. Although the generation of transgenic farm animals has become recently easier mainly with the technique of animal cloning using transfected somatic cells as nuclear donor, this point remains a limitation as far as cost is concerned. Numerous experiments carried out for the last 15 years have shown that the expression of the transgene is predictable only to a limited extent. This is clearly due to the fact that the expression vectors are not constructed in an appropriate manner. This undoubtedly comes from the fact that all the signals contained in genes have not yet been identified. Gene constructions thus result sometime in poorly functional expression vectors. One possibility consists in using long genomic DNA fragments contained in YAC or BAC vectors. The other relies on the identification of the major important elements required to obtain a satisfactory transgene expression. These elements include essentially gene insulators, chromatin openers, matrix attached regions, enhancers and introns. A certain number of proteins having complex structures (formed by several subunits, being glycosylated, cleaved, carboxylated...) have been obtained at levels sufficient for an industrial exploitation. In other cases, the mammary cellular machinery seems insufficient to promote all the post-translational modifications. The addition of genes coding for enzymes involved in protein maturation has been envisaged and successfully performed in one case. Furin gene expressed specifically in the mammary gland proved to able to cleave native human protein C with good efficiency. In a certain number of cases, the recombinant proteins produced in milk have deleterious effects on the mammary gland function or in the animals themselves. This comes independently from ectopic expression of the transgenes and from the transfer of the recombinant proteins from milk to blood. One possibility to eliminate or reduce these side-effects may be to use systems inducible by an exogenous molecule such as tetracycline allowing the transgene to be expressed only during lactation and strictly in the mammary gland. The purification of recombinant proteins from milk is generally not particularly difficult. This may not be the case, however, when the endogenous proteins such as serum albumin or antibodies are abundantly present in milk. This problem may be still more crucial if proteins are produced in blood. Among the biological contaminants potentially present in the recombinant proteins prepared from transgenic animals, prions are certainly those raising the major concern. The selection of animals chosen to generate transgenics on one hand and the elimination of the potentially contaminated animals, thanks to recently defined quite sensitive tests may reduce the risk to an extremely low level. The available techniques to produce pharmaceutical proteins in milk can be used as well to optimize milk composition of farm animals, to add nutriceuticals in milk and potentially to reduce or even eliminate some mammary infectious diseases.","output":"Transgenic animal bioreactors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Optimizing the results of public health management is a goal of many managers.

By August 18, 2020, the United States, Brazil, and India were the most affected countries. Health infrastructure and socioeconomic vulnerabilities may be affecting the response capacities of these countries. We compared official indicators to identify which vulnerabilities better determined the exposure risk to COVID-19 in both the most and least affected countries. To achieve this purpose, we collected indicators from the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE). All indicators were normalized to facilitate comparisons. Speed, incidence, and population were used to identify the groups of countries with the highest and lowest risks of infection. Countries' response capacities were determined based on socioeconomic, political, and health infrastructure conditions. Vulnerabilities were identified based on the indicator sensitivity. The highest-risk group included the U.S., Brazil, and India, whereas the lowest-risk group (with the largest population by continent) consisted of China, New Zealand, and Germany. The high-sensitivity cluster had 18 indicators (50% extra IDVI), such as merchandise trade, immunization, public services, maternal mortality, life expectancy at birth, hospital beds, GINI index, adolescent fertility, governance, political stability, transparency/corruption, industry, and water supply. The greatest vulnerability of the highest-risk group was related first to economic factors (merchandise trade), followed by public health (immunization), highlighting global dependence on Chinese trade, such as protective materials, equipment, and diagnostic tests. However, domestic political factors had more indicators, beginning with high sensitivity and followed by healthcare and economic conditions, which signified a lesser capacity to guide, coordinate, and supply the population with protective measures, such as social distancing.","output":"The exposure risk to COVID-19 in most affected countries: A vulnerability assessment model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID\\\\19 pandemic has not spared the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region.

A major risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19 infection is the presence of advance age, co-morbidities including diabetes, hypertension and obesity among other non-communicable diseases2. Epidemiological data from high-prevalence countries reveal that compared to men, women are less likely to die or to require hospital admission to intensive care. This may suggest that pregnant women are not more susceptible to infection or to experience serious complications. However, whether the presence of co-morbidities or advanced maternal age confers a higher risk of adverse outcome in pregnant women with COVID-19 is unknown3. In this research letter, we aimed at evaluating the risk factor associated with maternal mortality secondary to COVID-19 infection in a middle-income country. Advanced maternal age is linked to an increased risk of mortality, while diabetes is the most important risk factor for maternal death. This is partly explained by an increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases in women of advanced age which is a common feature in most countries4. In the last decades, low- and middle-income countries have experienced accelerated socio-cultural changes associated with its incorporation into the international economic community, which have increased the number of obese and diabetic population, including pregnant women5. This has caused an increased risk for complications and fatality among COVID-19 positive population2,3.

We investigated whether sTREM-1 circulating concentrations are associated with the outcome of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to assess the role of this pathway in COVID-19. This observational study was performed in two independent cohorts of patients with COVID-19. Plasma concentrations of sTREM-1 were assessed after ICU admission (pilot cohort) or after COVID-19 diagnosis (validation cohort). Routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected from electronic patient files. Results showed sTREM-1 plasma concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 (161 [129C196] pg/ml) compared to healthy controls (104 [75C124] pg/ml; P<0.001). Patients with severe COVID-19 needing ICU admission displayed even higher sTREM-1 concentrations compared to less severely ill COVID-19 patients receiving clinical ward-based care (235 [176C319] pg/ml and 195 [139C283] pg/ml, respectively, P = 0.017).

Survival analyses indicated that patients with higher sTREM-1 concentrations are at higher risk for death (hazard ratio = 3.3, 95%CI: 1.4C7.8). In conclusion, plasma sTREM-1 concentrations are elevated in patients with COVID-19, relate to disease severity, and discriminate between survivors and non-survivors.

However, despite all these advantages, no study has identified the structures of the rat brain using conventional ultrasound. METHODS A 13 MHz high frequency transducer was used to identify brain structures in the rat. The enlargement of the transcranial window was performed gradually using the ultrasound directly on the skin of the animal, then against the skull, then through a delimited craniotomy and finally through a complete craniotomy. RESULTS Our results showed that ultrasound allowed the identification of cerebral ventricles and subarachnoid cisterns, as well as the analysis of real-time monitoring of cerebral blood flow in the main brain arteries of the rat. Comparison with existing methods: Ultrasound is a tool with the potential to identify brain structures and blood vessels. In contrast to MRI, transcranial ultrasound is a fast, non-invasive, well tolerated and low-cost method and can be done at the bedside.

Superspreader nodes typically are characterized either by their locations within the network, by their degree of connectivity and centrality, or by their habitat suitability for the disease, described by their reproduction number (R). Here we introduce a model that considers simultaneously the effects of network properties and R on superspreaders, as opposed to previous research which considered each factor separately. This type of model is applicable to diseases for which habitat suitability varies by climate or land cover, and for direct transmitted diseases for which population density and mitigation practices influences R. We present analytical models that quantify the superspreader capacity of a population node by two measures: probability-dependent superspreader capacity, the expected number of neighboring nodes to which the node in consideration will randomly spread the disease per epidemic generation, and time-dependent superspreader capacity, the rate at which the node spreads the disease to each of its neighbors. We validate our analytical models with a Monte Carlo analysis of repeated stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) simulations on randomly generated human population networks, and we use a random forest statistical model to relate superspreader risk to connectivity, R, centrality, clustering, and diffusion. We demonstrate that either degree of connectivity or R above a certain threshold are sufficient conditions for a node to have a moderate superspreader risk factor, but both are necessary for a node to have a high-risk factor. The statistical model presented in this article can be used to predict the location of superspreader events in future epidemics, and to predict the effectiveness of mitigation strategies that seek to reduce the value of R, alter host movements, or both.","output":"Connectivity, reproduction number, and mobility interact to determine communities epidemiological superspreader potential in a metapopulation network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUE/PROBLEM: Italy was one of the four European countries that started to join forces to accelerate access and distribution of a much-needed vaccine against COVID-19. When the first vaccine was approved, a National Strategic Plan for COVID-19 vaccination, examining the most relevant domains for Health Technology Assessment (HTA), has just been issued in Italy. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM: Considering the possible provision of COVID-19 vaccines in the short time, in Autumn 2020 the necessity for a comprehensive assessment came up. In Italy HTA has been identified as the method for assessing the broad value of existing and new vaccines by the last two National Immunization Plans. However, the pandemic highlighted the need for a quick introduction and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. A multidisciplinary Steering Group was therefore appointed by the Ministry of Health, in order to define vaccination strategies, organizational models, economic aspects, communication and social issues. RESULTS: Taking into account plans already released by other countries, a National Strategic Plan for COVID-19 vaccination was issued in December 2020. Main topics covered were: epidemiology and priority groups to be immunized, logistic and organization, efficacy and safety monitoring, economic and burden of disease assessments, communication. The application of these recommendations has finally proven to be difficult, because of vaccines procurement delays, suspected adverse events, inequalities in the different Regional settings. LESSONS: Given the concerns and difficulties faced by Italy and other European countries in the appraisal and management of COVID-19 vaccines, a HTA adapted framework could be an option for guiding the definition of National Strategic Plans. This could offer a common structured approach, make decision-making process more transparent, and be significant for a timely, convenient, and affordable access to new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"The role of HTA in COVID-19 vaccination campaign: the Italian experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In spring 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced educators to adjust the delivery and assessment of curriculum.

This includes the remote completion of a surgical skills curriculum using instructional videos and models and the delaying of laboratory sessions deemed impossible to deliver remotely. First- and third-year students were subsequently assessed using modified remote OSCEs. Second-year students were assessed using the standard surgical skills examination, video-recorded. All first- and third-year students successfully passed their OSCE upon either first attempt or remediation. Two second-year students failed their remediation examination and were offered additional faculty tutoring and another remediation attempt at the start of the fall semester. The remediation rate on the surgical skills examination was not different from that of previous years. One incident of suspected academic dishonesty occurred in the first-year OSCE. Students learned surgical skills successfully at home by practicing on models and receiving feedback of their skills on video recordings. While disappointing, one case of academic dishonesty among the 368 total students tested was not surprising. Remote assessment using modified OSCEs and surgical skills exams appears feasible and fair when in-person testing is not possible.","output":"Remote Assessment of Veterinary Clinical Skills Courses During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mit dem Wandel der Arbeitswelt gehen auch neue Formen flexiblen Arbeitens einher. In diesem Zusammenhang sind vermehrt Fragen der Nutzung, Gestaltung und Wirkung von Homeoffice und ortsmobilem Arbeiten in den Fokus gerckt. Dies gilt umso mehr, als Unternehmen und Besch?ftigte w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie in gro?em Stil die Arbeit von zu Hause als M?glichkeit genutzt haben, um betriebliche Abl?ufe trotz Mobilit?tsbeschr?nkungen und Abstandsregelungen aufrecht zu erhalten. Auch der Koalitionsvertrag der Bundesregierung greift das Thema auf und spricht sich fr eine Erleichterung, F?rderung und rechtliche Rahmung mobiler Arbeit aus. Gegenstand dieser Kurzexpertise ist es, das verfgbare Wissen ber die Nutzung, die Effekte und die rechtliche Gestaltung zu mobiler Arbeit und Homeoffice zusammenzustellen, zu bewerten und an einigen Stellen gezielt zu erweitern. Hierzu wird die verfgbare Literatur systematisch ausgewertet. Dies wird mit repr?sentativen Umfragen vor und w?hrend der COVID-19-Pandemie, einer international vergleichenden Untersuchung sowie betriebliche Fallstudien vertieft. Um die positiven Aspekte von Homeoffice und mobilem Arbeiten realisieren zu k?nnen, stellen sich, wie die Studie belegt, einerseits erh?hte Anforderungen an die betriebliche Organisation von Arbeit und Zusammenarbeit, andererseits an die F?higkeiten zur Selbstorganisation bei den Besch?ftigten. Die Praxis zeigt, dass in vielen F?llen passende Arrangements gefunden werden. Gleichwohl wird ein individueller Rechtsanspruch auf Prfung der Machbarkeit ortsflexiblen Arbeitens im Einzelfall von einer Mehrheit der Besch?ftigten befrwortet. Insgesamt ist davon auszugehen, dass die Arbeit im Homeoffice auch nach der Pandemie, wie es sich bereits abzeichnet, als ein normaler Baustein im Arbeitsleben fr breitere Besch?ftigtengruppen angesehen werden wird. The transformation of the world of work is accompanied by new forms of flexible work. In this context, questions of the use, design and effect of work from home and mobile working have recently come increasingly into focus. This is all the more true as companies and employees during the COVID-19 pandemic used working from home on a large scale as an opportunity to maintain operational processes despite mobility restrictions and physical distancing. The coalition agreement of the Federal Government also takes up the topic and advocates the facilitation, promotion and legal framing of mobile work. The object of this report is to compile and evaluate the available knowledge about the use, effects and legal design of mobile work and home office, and to expand it in some areas in a targeted manner. For this purpose, the available literature is systematically evaluated. This is deepened with representative surveys before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, an international comparative study as well as operational case studies. To be able to realize the positive aspects of remote and mobile work, the study shows that on the one hand increased demands are placed on the operational organization of work and cooperation, and on the other hand on the employees abilities for self-organization. Practical experiences show that in many cases suitable arrangements can be found. Nevertheless, an individual legal entitlement, which implies an examination of the feasibility of location-flexible working in individual cases, is supported by a majority of employees. It can therefore be assumed that also after the pandemic, as is already becoming apparent, work from home will continue to be regarded as a normal component of working life for broader groups of employees.","output":"Verbreitung und Auswirkungen von mobiler Arbeit und Homeoffice: Kurzexpertise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We describe the first documented case of Covid-19 reinfection in Israel, out of only a handful such case worldwide, in a 20 year old otherwise healthy young woman In the first occasion she was mildly symptomatic, whereas the second episode was apparently asymptomatic, except for tachycardia of 90/min, compared to 60/min in the first episode The fact that out of 25 million infected persons worldwide only a handful of re-infected cases have been identified suggests that this is a rare phenomenon Alternatively, it will be critical to rule out that new mutations are not introduced, which are not covered by existing immunity","output":"The First Case of Documented Covid-19 Reinfection in Israel"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract We analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on state and local government finances, with an emphasis on health spending needs and the role of the Medicaid program.

METHODS Using random-digit dialing, we sampled 4481 Hong Kong residents in 6 population-based surveys that were conducted at different times during and after the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). RESULTS Respondents' State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score (range, 10-40) showed a decreasing temporal trend, from a high mean value of 24.8 during the peak of the Amoy Gardens outbreak to a postepidemic mean baseline value of 14.5. Those who perceived a higher likelihood of contracting or dying of SARS had significantly higher anxiety scores. Female respondents, individuals aged 30-49 years, and individuals with only a primary education or less were predisposed to greater anxiety. There was a positive dose-response gradient between anxiety level and uptake of personal protective measures. Males respondents, individuals at the extremes of age, and individuals with lower educational levels were less likely to engage in self-protective behavior. The presence of symptoms was the only consistent predictor for greater use of health services. There was remarkable stability in the magnitude and the direction of associations between predictors and outcomes over time. CONCLUSIONS Our findings can assist in modifying public service announcements in the future, which should be tailored to psychobehavioral surveillance intelligence to achieve the desired behavioral outcomes. Future research should explore the use of more-sophisticated techniques, including structural equation modeling and game-theoretical frameworks, to analyze population psychology and behavior, and it should integrate such findings with transmission dynamics modeling.","output":"Longitudinal assessment of community psychobehavioral responses during and after the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The county-wide lockdowns that were implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in some in-person qualitative research studies needing to be transitioned online using a video conferencing platform. However, evaluating the feasibility of transitioning an ongoing qualitative research study focused on low-income, racial/ethnic minorities had not been performed. Orsmond and Cohn's feasibility framework was used to evaluate this study in three primary areas: recruitment capability, data collection procedures, and evaluation of relevant resources. Recruitment efforts for the in-person focus groups (January-March 2020) and online focus groups (March-April 2020), along with data collection procedures, were measured through various counts. To gauge the resources needed to transition a study from in-person to online, the administrative capacity, the space, technology, and funds necessary to support the research study were recorded. Sample characteristics were extracted from administrative and survey data. To estimate the differences in the sample characteristics, recruitment efforts and the length of the focus groups before and during the lockdown, independent sample t-tests, or proportion tests were conducted. The sociodemographic characteristics of participants pre-lockdown and during the lockdown were similar between the two groups with most participants identifying as female, Black, single, unemployed. The average number of participants recruited, confirmed, and attended per focus group, along with the total number of contact attempts remained similar before and during the lockdown. The length of the focus groups before and during the lockdown also remained similar. The in-person focus groups did require more financial resources for their successful execution than the online focus groups. It is feasible to sustain a research study focused on low-income, racial/ethnic minorities by transitioning the study from in-person to online using a video conferencing platform.

However, no studies were conducted to explore the existence of the micro-structural changes in the central nervous system after infection. We aimed to identify the existence of potential brain micro-structural changes related to SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In this prospective study, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and 3D high-resolution T1WI sequences were acquired in 60 recovered COVID-19 patients (56.67% male; age: 44.10  16.00) and 39 age- and sex-matched non-COVID-19 controls (56.41% male; age: 45.88  13.90). Registered fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were quantified for DTI, and an index score system was introduced. Regional volumes derived from Voxel-based Morphometry (VBM) and DTI metrics were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Two sample t-test and Spearman correlation were conducted to assess the relationships among imaging indices, index scores and clinical information. Findings: In this follow-up stage, neurological symptoms were presented in 55% COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had statistically significantly higher bilateral gray matter volumes (GMV) in olfactory cortices, hippocampi, insulas, left Rolandic operculum, left Heschl's gyrus and right cingulate gyrus and a general decline of MD, AD, RD accompanied with an increase of FA in white matter, especially AD in the right CR, EC and SFF, and MD in SFF compared with non-COVID-19 volunteers (corrected p value <0.05). Global GMV, GMVs in left Rolandic operculum, right cingulate, bilateral hippocampi, left Heschl's gyrus, and Global MD of WM were found to correlate with memory loss (p value <0.05). GMVs in the right cingulate gyrus and left hippocampus were related to smell loss (p value <0.05).

METHODS One hundred and eighty patients who underwent LC were randomized to one of three groups with sixty patients each: Group A received 50 mg 0.5% bupivacaine subcutaneously at trocar sites before incision closure; Group B received intravenous parecoxib (40 mg) after entering the recovery room; Group C did not receive postoperative analgesia unless needed and was served as control. The postoperative pain at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after the operation was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes, including intraoperative and postoperative complications, the incidence of shoulder pain, pethidine requirements, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and hospital stay were also recorded. RESULTS At 1, 2, and 4 hours after surgery, VAS pain scores were significantly lower in group A and B compared with group C (P < 0.05 for all). There was no significant difference among the three groups at 8, 12, and 24 hours after the procedure (P > 0.05 for all).

However, its validity is reliant upon accuracy in the ability to predict MF which may be affected by congruence of the perception of effort compared with the actual effort required. The present study examined participants with at least 1 year of resistance training experience predicting their proximity to MF in two different experiments using a deception design. Within each experiment participants performed four trials of knee extensions with single sets (i.e., bouts of repetitions) to their self-determined repetition maximum (sdRM; when they predicted they could not complete the next repetition if attempted and thus would reach MF if they did) and MF (i.e., where despite attempting to do so they could not complete the current repetition). For the first experiment (n = 14) participants used loads equal to 70% of a one repetition maximum (1RM; i.e., the heaviest load that could be lifted for a single repetition) performed in a separate baseline session. Aiming to minimize participants between day variability in repetition performances, in the second separate experiment (n = 24) they used loads equal to 70% of their daily isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Results suggested that participants typically under predicted the number of repetitions they could perform to MF with a meta-analytic estimate across experiments of 2.0 [95%CIs 0.0 to 4.0].

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hospitalisation for COVID-19 in England between 16(th) March and 26(th) April 2020 as provided by Public Health England. RESULTS: There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function - verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51).

This does not necessarily mean that instructional support has diminished as a consequence of the transition to remote learning. In this study, instructional support was explored using quantitative and qualitative methods of data analysis. Surveys from over 600 students in sophomore and junior level courses in engineering at a large public institution were collected in the Spring of 2020 and compared to results from similar courses offered prior to the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Likert-scale items, as well as short answer items, that independently measured faculty support and TA support were analyzed in this study. Initial t-tests indicated that perceptions of faculty support were not significantly different between remote and traditional learning. To consider the possibility that failure to reject the null hypothesis was due to course-by-course variations, additional t-tests were used to compare student perceptions of faculty support across pairs of courses taught in both settings. Post-hoc tests showed that faculty support was significantly higher in the remote learning setting in three of seven pairs of courses and significantly lower in the remote learning setting in the four remaining courses (p < 0.05). Similarly, in considering TA support, an initial t-test indicated that perceptions of TA support were not significantly different in remote learning compared to traditional learning, but in course-by-course comparisons, students believed they were offered significantly higher TA support in remote learning in three pairs of classes and significantly lower TA support in one pair of classes (p < 0.05) with three classes indicating no significant difference. Students in both settings were also asked to identify one thing that faculty could do and one thing that TAs could do to better support their learning. Inductive coding of these short answer responses revealed that while in traditional learning, students emphasized faculty support in in-class and out of class delivery of materials, in remote learning, the emphasis shifted to needs for support in out of class delivery and out of class interactions. For TAs, student expectations were balanced between in-class delivery and out-of-class interactions in traditional learning but their needs for more out of class interactions dominated their concerns in remote learning. Overall, for faculty, about 20% of students requested greater availability in both remote and in-person settings. For TAs, 44% of students requested greater availability of and access to their TAs in remote learning, compared to 18% in in-person settings. The analysis of both Likert-scale and short answer data regarding TA and faculty support in this study reinforces the importance of availability of instructional support regardless of setting. As students, TAs, and faculty continue to navigate the uncharted waters of the traditional college education system gone online, the nature of connection differs yet its importance remains the same. ?

However, male faces were relatively narrower and vertically prolonged, with slightly wider noses, narrower-set and lower eyebrows, wider mouths, and higher forehead hairline. The most sexually dimorphic regions of the face were the lower jaw and the nose. Facial width-to-height ratio (fWHR), measured in six known variants, revealed no significant sexual dimorphism. The allometric effects on facial traits were mostly related to the face growth, rather than the growth of the whole body (body height). Significant body dimorphism was demonstrated, men being significantly higher, with larger wrist diameter and hand grip strength, and women having higher BMI, hips circumferences, upper arm circumferences, triceps skinfolds. Facial and body sexual dimorphisms were not associated. CONCLUSIONS: Facial sex differences in Maasai are very low, while on the contrary, the body sexual dimorphism is high. There were practically no associations between facial and body measures. These findings are interpreted in the light of trade-offs between environmental, cultural, and sexual selection pressures.

It is foreseeable that this exceptional situation will have psychological effects on citizens. In this work, the impact of confinement on perceived sleep quality and depression is evaluated through questionnaires, as well as the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence (EI) in this relationship. Our results show, firstly, higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in women and young people associated with poorer perceived sleep quality, and secondly, that Emotional Intelligence intervenes as a mediator in this relationship through three different pathways. Worse perceived quality of sleep causes a greater number of depressive symptoms. In addition, this direct relationship may be enhanced by the mediating role of Emotional Intelligence, which we can express in three different ways: low perceived sleep quality and high emotional attention lead to greater depression; low perceived sleep quality and low emotional clarity increase greater symptoms of depression; and low perceived sleep quality together with low clarity and low emotional repair increase levels of depression. Therefore, we can conclude that improving the skills involved in Emotional Intelligence might increase perceived sleep quality, and thus reduce depressive symptoms, which in turn may improve the quality of life.","output":"Emotional Intelligence as a Mediator between Subjective Sleep Quality and Depression during the Confinement Due to COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to identify the level of awareness among the local community in the Najran region, Saudi Arabia about emerging of Coronavirus Covid-19, To achieve the goal of the study, the descriptive survey method was used The study sample consisted of (930) individuals and the questionnaire were used as a tool to collect data The results of the study showed that there is awareness among the study sample members of the most common symptoms that are difficulty breathing and a rise in temperature and coughing, and that the most preventive way to maintain personal hygiene and avoid direct contact with an infected person and the use of tissues when sneezing or coughing, and that the methods of transmission appear in the spray Flying from an infected patient while coughing, sneezing, touching contaminated surfaces and direct contact with an infected patient, and that the most common sources of information for respondents on the emerging coronavirus are social media and Internet sites","output":"The level of awareness among the local community in Najran Region, Saudi Arabia about emerging of coronavirus Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of a tire pressure sensor (TPS) cycling power meter against a gold standard (SRM) during indoor cycling.

MetSyn is clustering many pathological conditions, which, untreated, could increase the risk and often lead to more severe metabolic defects such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Many data demonstrate the complex role of gut microbiota in the host metabolism, and hence, deciphering the microbiome patterns linked to MetSyn could enable us for novel diagnosis and monitoring markers and for better disease management. Moreover, interventions designed to alter patient microbiome composition may help prevent or decrease morbidity linked with MetSyn. However, the microbiome composition is largely different across geographically distinct populations. Our study investigated the microbiota and mycobiome patterns in Romanian metabolic syndrome patients. We also correlated the identified microbiomeCmycobiome patterns with levels of metabolites important for host health such as short chain fatty acids, organic acids, and taurine. We found that MetSyn patients are harboring a microbiome enriched in Enterobacteriaceae, Turicibacter sp., Clostridium coccoides, and Clostridium leptum, while beneficial taxa such as Butyricicoccus sp., Akkermansia muciniphila, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were decreased. These microbiome changes were correlated with lower butyrate levels and increased succinate. In terms of mycobiome signatures, MetSyn was associated with a high abundance of Saccharomyces and Aspergillus species.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was performed on adult patients (> 18 years old) with stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) who were admitted to hospital with or without COVID-19. The primary outcome was stroke-related disability, which was measured by mRS at baseline and discharge. Hospital duration, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mortality were considered the secondary outcomes. RESULTS: From February 2019 until August 2020, we recruited and analyzed 151 patients, 42 of whom had COVID-19 based on RT-PCR tests or lung CT scan findings. COVID-19 positive patients had higher baseline and final mRS scores than the control group (4.46 0.67 vs 4.79 0.61, P: 0.001, 3.831.22 vs 4.46 0.67, P: 0.001). Moreover, stroke patients with COVID-19 experienced a more severe disease and required a higher rate of ICU admission (17 vs 0, P:0.001) and longer hospitalization compared to those without COVID-19 (8.507.86 vs 7.511.20, P: 0.021). Also, mortality was higher in the COVID-19 group (19 vs 13, P:0.001). There was not any significant differences between the two groups in terms of the involvement of cerebral arteries and type of stroke. Male sex, COVID-19, and ICU admission were the main independent risk factors for death.

At the time of this study, the number of infected people in the United States is the highest globally (31.2 million infections). Within the infected population, patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are in more life-threatening circumstances, resulting in severe respiratory system failure. Various studies have investigated the infections to COVID-19 and ARDS by monitoring laboratory metrics and symptoms. Unfortunately, these methods are merely limited to clinical settings, and symptom-based methods are shown to be ineffective. In contrast, vital signs (e.g., heart rate) have been utilized to early-detect different respiratory diseases in ubiquitous health monitoring. We posit that such biomarkers are informative in identifying ARDS patients infected with COVID-19. In this study, we investigate the behavior of COVID-19 on ARDS patients by utilizing simple vital signs. We analyze the long-term daily logs of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) associated with 150 ARDS patients admitted to five University of California academic health centers (containing 77,972 samples for each vital sign) to distinguish subjects with COVID-19 positive and negative test results. In addition to the statistical analysis, we develop a deep neural network model to extract features from the longitudinal data. Our deep learning model is able to achieve 0.81 area under the curve (AUC) to classify the vital signs of ARDS patients infected with COVID-19 versus other ARDS diagnosed patients. Since our proposed model uses only the BP and HR, it would be possible to review data prior to the first reported cases in the U.S. to validate the presence or absence of COVID-19 in our communities prior to January 2020. In addition, by utilizing wearable devices, and monitoring vital signs of subjects in everyday settings it is possible to early-detect COVID-19 without visiting a hospital or a care site.","output":"Detection of COVID-19 Using Heart Rate and Blood Pressure: Lessons Learned from Patients with ARDS."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Graph neural networks, trained on experimental or calculated data are becoming an increasingly important tool in computational materials science.

By building a neural network that provides a confidence on the predicted properties, we are able to develop an active learning scheme that can reduce the amount of labelled data required, by identifying the areas of chemical space where the model is most uncertain.

ID e-consults (ID electronic consultations or asynchronous?) are an alternative but data are limited on their effectiveness, especially patient outcomes. Methods In the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and ID physician outage, we were asked to perform ID e-consults at a 380-bed tertiary care hospital located in Blair County, PA. We performed retrospective chart reviews of 121 patients initially evaluated by ID e-consults between April 2020 and July 2020. Follow-up visits were also conducted via e-consults with or without direct phone calls with the patient. Key patient outcomes assessed were length of stay (LOS), disposition after hospitalization, 30-day mortality from initial ID e-consult and 30-day readmission post-discharge. Results The majority of patients were white males and non-ICU (Table 1). The most common ID diagnosis was bacteremia (27.3%, 33/121), followed by skin and soft tissue infections (15.7%, 19/121) and bone/joint infections (14.9%, 18/121) (Figure 1). Table 2 shows patient outcomes. Average total LOS was 11 days and 7 days post-initial ID e-consult. 48.7% (59/121) of patients were discharged home and 37.2% (45/121) to a post-acute rehabilitation facility. 2.5% (3/121) of patients required transfer to a higher level of care facility;none of which were to obtain in-person ID care. The index mortality rate was 3.3% (4/121), which appears to be lower than published data for in-person ID care. The 30-day mortality rate was 4.1% (5/121), which is also comparable to previously reported for ID e-consults. 25.6% (31/121) of patients required readmission within 30 days but only 14.0% (17/121) were related to the initial infection.

Therefore, an accurate prediction of disease progression with baseline imaging at the time of the initial presentation can help in patient management.

The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion (21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus. Inclusion of the French cohort enabled us to identify 161 novel mutations never reported in SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected worldwide.

However, modest sample sizes have limited characterization of the extent to which onset to treatment (OTT) time influences outcome; and the generalizability of findings to clinical practice is uncertain. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the degree to which OTT time is associated with outcome among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intraveneous tPA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Data were analyzed from 58,353 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset in 1395 hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke Program, April 2003 to March 2012. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Relationship between OTT time and in-hospital mortality, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, ambulatory status at discharge, and discharge destination. RESULTS Among the 58,353 tPA-treated patients, median age was 72 years, 50.3% were women, median OTT time was 144 minutes (interquartile range, 115-170), 9.3% (5404) had OTT time of 0 to 90 minutes, 77.2% (45,029) had OTT time of 91 to 180 minutes, and 13.6% (7920) had OTT time of 181 to 270 minutes. Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale documented in 87.7% of patients was 11 (interquartile range, 6-17). Patient factors most strongly associated with shorter OTT included greater stroke severity (odds ratio [OR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.1 per 5-point increase), arrival by ambulance (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 4.5-7.3), and arrival during regular hours (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 3.8-5.4). Overall, there were 5142 (8.8%) in-hospital deaths, 2873 (4.9%) patients had intracranial hemorrhage, 19,491 (33.4%) patients achieved independent ambulation at hospital discharge, and 22,541 (38.6%) patients were discharged to home. Faster OTT, in 15-minute increments, was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001), reduced symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98; P < .001), increased achievement of independent ambulation at discharge (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.03-1.05; P < .001), and increased discharge to home (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a registry representing US clinical practice, earlier thrombolytic treatment was associated with reduced mortality and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and higher rates of independent ambulation at discharge and discharge to home following acute ischemic stroke.

The 24-h movement guidelines for children and adolescents recommend 60 min per day of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity,  2-h per day of recreational screen time, and 9C11-h of sleep per night for school-aged children or 8C10-h per night for adolescents. The objective of this study was to examine the association of meeting the 24-h movement guidelines with life stress and self-esteem among students in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Self-reported data on movement behaviors, life stress and self-esteem were derived from the 2019 cycle of the Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a cross-sectional and province-wide survey of students in grades 7C12 aged 11 to 20 years (N = 6,932). Multivariable ordered logistic regression analyses were adjusted for the complex sample design of the survey and for important covariates. RESULTS: Overall, meeting all combinations of movement behavior recommendations were associated with lower life stress and better self-esteem compared with meeting none of the recommendations, except meeting the physical activity only or screen time only recommendations that were not associated with lower life stress. Meeting all 3 recommendations was associated with lower life stress (OR: 0.40; 95 CI: 0.30C0.53) and better self-esteem (OR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.21C0.40). There was a dose-response gradient between the number of recommendations met (3 > 2 > 1) and lower life stress (p < 0.001) and higher self-esteem (p < 0.001), with meeting all 3 recommendations being the best combination.

Short-Term Studies: In 16-day studies, all five male and five female rats and mice dosed with 2,000 mg/kg benzyl alcohol died. Two of five male and 3/5 female rats and 1/5 male and 2/5 female mice dosed with 1,000 mg/kg died. Rats and mice of each sex in the two highest dose groups were lethargic after dosing. Other toxic responses to benzyl alcohol in these dose groups included blood around the mouth and nose, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and blood in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts of rats and blood in the urinary bladder of mice. Animals administered lower doses of benzyl alcohol (125, 250, or 500 mg/kg) had no compound-related histologic lesions. Doses selected for the 13-week studies were 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg for rats and mice. Eight of 10 male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg died during weeks 7 and 8; four of these deaths were described as gavage related. Rats dosed with 800 mg/kg exhibited clinical signs indicative of neurotoxicity including staggering, respiratory difficulty, and lethargy. Hemorrhages occurred around the mouth and nose, and there were histologic lesions in the brain, thymus, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In mice, deaths were scattered among all dose levels, but none occurred in vehicle controls. Four male and six female mice died after being dosed; all deaths but one were described as gavage related. Staggering after dosing also occurred during the first 2 weeks of the studies in mice dosed with 800 mg/kg. Some of the deaths in the rats and mice may have been caused by a combination of the gavage procedure and chemical toxicity, since there was evidence that benzyl alcohol induced neurotoxic effects. There were reductions in relative weight gain in male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg benzyl alcohol, in female rats dosed with 200 mg/kg or more, in male mice dosed with 400 or 800 mg/kg, and in female mice dosed with 200 mg/kg or more. No notable changes in body weight gain or compound-related histopathologic lesions were observed in rats or mice from the lower dose groups. Based on mortality, reduction in relative body weight gain, and the histopathologic lesions, doses selected for 2-year studies in rats were 0, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Doses selected for 2-year studies in mice were 0, 100, and 200 mg/kg, based on mortality and depression in relative body weight gain. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Fifty animals of each species and sex were administered benzyl alcohol in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Administration of benzyl alcohol did not affect survival in male rats (final survival rates: vehicle control, 28/50; low dose, 27/50; high dose, 24/50) but reduced survival of dosed female rats by half (36/50; 18/50; 17/50). Many of the early deaths were considered related to the gavage procedure. Survival in mice was not affected by benzyl alcohol administration (male: 34/50; 33/50; 35/50; female: 26/50; 32/50; 36/50). No effect of benzyl alcohol on body weight gain in rats or mice was observed. In the third month of the studies, clinical signs of sialodacryoadenitis virus infection were observed in rats. A positive serologic reaction for rat coronavirus was observed in sentinel animals at 6 months and again at 18 months. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: No apparent compound-related nonneoplastic responses were observed. Dose-related negative trends in the incidences of anterior pituitary gland neoplasms were seen in female rats (vehicle control, 29/50; low dose, 17/47; high dose, 9/49) and of harderian gland adenomas in male mice (8/50; 3/50; 2/50). Adenomas of the adrenal cortex occurred at an increased incidence in high dose male mice (0/48; 0/44; 3/48), but this slight increase was not considered to be related to chemical expcal exposure. Genetic Toxicology: Benzyl alcohol was not mutagenic when tested by the preincubational protocol in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537. In the mouse L5178Y/TK lymphoma assay, benzyl alcohol induced an increase in trifluorothymidine (Tft)-resistant cells in the absence, but not in the presence, of S9; the effect was associated with toxicity. In cytogenetic assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, treatment with benzyl alcohol produced an increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) which was judged to be equivocal both with and without S9; a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after exposure to benzyl alcohol in the presence, but not the absence, of S9. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of benzyl alcohol have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female F344/N rats dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg. Survival in both dose groups of female rats was 50% that of vehicle controls, primarily due to an increased number of gavage-related deaths. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female B6C3F1 mice dosed with 100 or 200 mg/kg for 2 years.

Here we designed a simulation study, based on empirically validated epidemiological models of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, to predict the impact of a breadth of vaccines with different mean duration (range: 2C5 years) and heterogeneity (coefficient of variation range: 50C100%) of protection against infection. We then assessed how confidently the duration of protection could be estimated under a range of epidemiological scenarios in the year following the start of mass immunization. We found that lower population mean and higher inter-individual variability facilitated estimation of the duration of vaccine protection. Across the vaccines tested, high waning and high heterogeneity permitted complete identification of the duration of protection;in contrast, low waning and low heterogeneity allowed only estimation of the fraction of vaccinees with rapid loss of immunity. These findings suggest that key aspects of COVID-19 vaccine immunity can be estimated with limited epidemiological data.

We report on the deployment of emergency services for cardiovascular events in a defined region in western Germany during the government-imposed lock-down period. METHODS: We examined 5799 consecutive patients who were treated by emergency services for cardiovascular events during the Covid-19 pandemic (January 1 to April 30, 2020), and compared those to the corresponding time frame in 2019. Examining the emergency physicians' records provided by nine locations in the area, we found a 20% overall decline in cardiovascular admissions. RESULTS: The greatest reduction could be seen immediately following the government-imposed social restrictions. This reduction was mainly driven by a reduction in discretionary admissions for dizziness/syncope (-53%), heart failure (-38%), exacerbated COPD (-28%) and unstable angina (-23%), while unavoidable admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and stroke were unchanged. There was a greater decline in emergency admissions for patients &#8805;60 years.

The susceptibility to develop, and the severity, of adhesions following intra-abdominal surgery varies within and between individuals, suggesting that heritable factors influence adhesion development. In this manuscript, we discuss the pathophysiology of adhesion development from the perspective of genetic susceptibility. We restrict our discussion to genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are specifically involved in, or that cause modification of, the adhesion development process. We performed a literature search using the PubMed database for all relevant English language articles up to March 2020 (n = 186). We identified and carefully reviewed all relevant articles addressing genetic mutations or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that impact the risk for adhesion development. We also reviewed references from these articles for additional information. We found several reported SNPs, genetic mutations, and upregulation of messenger RNAs that directly or indirectly increase the propensity for postoperative adhesion development, namely in genes for transforming growth factor beta, vascular endothelial growth factor, interferon-gamma, matrix metalloproteinase, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and the interleukins. An understanding of genetic variants could provide insight into the pathophysiology of adhesion development. The information presented in this review contributes to a greater understanding of adhesion development at the genetic level and may allow modification of these genetic risks, which may subsequently guide management in preventing and treating this challenging complication of abdominal surgery. In particular, the information could help identify patients at greater risk for adhesion development, which would make them candidates for anti-adhesion prophylaxis.

METHOD Between June 2010 and December 2011, 25 patients presenting with malignant disease underwent single-incision laparoscopy for right hemicolectomy. Four different ports (SILS? port, Covidien; SSL(?) Access system, Ethicon; X-Cone/S-Portal(?) , Storz; and OCTO? port, AFS Medical) were used. Patients were recruited prospectively and all data were processed retrospectively. RESULTS Twenty-five patients were included in our study (and their characteristics, described later in this paragraph, are expressed as median (range)). Four conversions to standard laparoscopy were performed. The age of patients was 69 (36-89) years, and they had a body mass index (BMI) of 24.5 (19.1-34.2).

Bariatric surgeons have several tools to assess this adversity. There have been debates as to which method is more superior and furthermore whether these methods should be routinely or selectively used. The aim of our study is to evaluate and compare whether methylene blue or upper gastrointestinal (UGI) study is more effective in detecting an anastomotic leak after RYGB. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 2013 and March 2014, 119 patients underwent laparoscopic RYGB. Linear staplers were used to create the gastrojejunostomy and the jejunojejunostomy. All patients underwent routine UGI studies and methylene blue challenges on postoperative day 1. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database was performed for all patients. RESULTS Of the 105 patients in this study there were 83 females (79.0%) and 22 males (21.0%). Mean age was 45.210.7 years (range, 21 to 66 y) and mean preoperative body mass index was 47.87.9 kg/m (range, 35.7 to 76.4 kg/m) at the time of procedure. Mean length of hospital stay was 3.26.0 days (range, 1 to 53 d).Four (3.8%) patients were found to have leaks postoperatively, but no leakage was detected in any of the initial routine UGI studies or methylene blue challenges. Both patient were diagnosed with clinical signs and underwent oversewing of the leak sites. CONCLUSIONS UGI studies and methylene blue challenges had no significant difference in detecting a postoperative leak. Furthermore, these tests may have limited utility and may warrant adjuncts to aid in leak detection.","output":"Methylene Blue or Upper GI, Which is More Effective for Detecting Leaks in Gastric Bypass Patients?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the educational landscape.

Core genes are hypothesized to play a direct role in regulating disease; thus, their identification has the potential to reveal critical regulators and novel therapeutic targets. Here, we sought to identify genes with core-like characteristics for bone mineral density (BMD), one of the most significant predictors of osteoporotic fracture. This was accomplished by analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data through the lens of a cell-type and timepoint-specific gene co-expression network for mineralizing osteoblasts. We identified a single co-expression network module that was enriched for genes implicated by GWAS and partitioned BMD heritability, correlated with in vitro osteoblast mineralization, and enriched for genes, which when mutated in humans or mice, led to a skeletal phenotype. Further characterization of this module identified four novel genes (B4GALNT3, CADM1, DOCK9, and GPR133) located within BMD GWAS loci with colocalizing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and altered BMD in mouse knockouts, suggesting they are causal genetic drivers of BMD in humans. Our network-based approach identified a core module for BMD and provides a resource for expanding our understanding of the genetics of bone mass.","output":"Identification of a core module for bone mineral density through the integration of a co-expression network and GWAS data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Complex relationships between growth hormone (GH) signaling and mammalian aging continue to attract attention of many investigators. Recent results include evidence that the impact of GH on genome maintenance (DNA damage and repair) is drastically different in normal as compared to cancer cells, consistent with GH promoting aging and cancer progression. Impact of GH on DNA methylation was studied as a possible mechanism linking actions of GH during early life to the trajectory of aging. Animals with reduced or enhanced GH signaling and novel animals with adipocyte-specific deletion of GH receptors were used to elucidate the effects of GH on white and brown adipose tissue, including the impact of this hormone on lipolysis, fibrosis, and thermogenesis. Effects of GH on adipose tissue related to lipid and energy metabolism emerge as mechanistic links between GH, healthspan, and lifespan. Treatment of healthy men with a combination of GH, dehydroepiandrosterone, and metformin was reported to restore thymus function and reduce epigenetic age. Studies of human subjects with deficiency of GH or GH receptors and studies of mice with the same endocrine syndromes identified several phenotypic changes related (positively or negatively) to the previously reported predisposition to healthy aging.

Here in this study we reviewed the literature regarding EGPA patients with COVID-19 and patients who diagnosed with EGPA or suffered an EGPA flare mimicking COVID-19. We conducted a literature survey in PUBMED database using meshed keywords COVID-19 and EGPA, COVID-19 and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, COVID-19 and Churg Strauss Syndrome, to reveal previously reported cases involving EGPA patients who had COVID-19 infection, patients who suspected to have COVID-19 but eventually diagnosed with EGPA and patients with a known diagnosis of EGPA who suffered a flare but a COVID-19 infection was suspected initially. A total of 11 cases (6 literature cases, 5 cases from our clinic) were included in our study. Seven (63.6%) of the cases were defined as COVID-19 mimicker and 4 (36.4%) were EGPA with COVID-19.

This public health crisis has accelerated the transformation of health care delivery through the use of telehealth. Due to the coronavirus' severity and pathogenicity, telehealth services are considered the best platforms to meet suddenly increased patient care demands, reduce the transformation of the virus, and protect patients and health care workers. However, many hospitals, clinicians, and patients are not ready to switch to virtual care completely. OBJECTIVES: We designed six experiments to examine how people (as an actual beneficiary of telehealth) evaluate five telehealth encounters versus face-to-face visits. METHODS: We used an online survey to collect data from 751 individuals (patients) in the United States. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate that significant factors for evaluating five types of telehealth encounters are perceived convenience expected from telehealth encounters, perceived psychological risks associated with telehealth programs, and perceived attentive care services delivered by telehealth platforms. However, significant elements for comparing telehealth services with traditional face-to-face clinic visits are perceived cost-saving, perceived time-saving, perceived hygienic services, perceived technical errors, perceived information completeness, perceived communication barriers, perceived trust in medical care platforms' competency, and perceived privacy concerns. CONCLUSION: Although the in-person visit was reported as the most preferred care practice, there was no significant difference between people's willingness to use face-to-face visits versus virtual care. Nevertheless, before the widespread rollout of telehealth platforms, health care systems need to determine and address the challenges of implementing virtual care to improve patient engagement in telehealth services. This study also provides practical implications for health care providers to deploy telehealth effectively during the pandemic and postpandemic phases.","output":"Do Hospitals Need to Extend Telehealth Services?

Independent sample t tests were conducted for each outcome variable using the suicide item of the BDI as a dichotomous (ie, zero vs nonzero score) grouping variable. RESULTS Relative to students with substantial depressive symptoms without SI, those with SI were more symptomatic overall, having significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and anxiety. However, contrary to our expectations, nonsuicidal and suicidal students did not differ on measures of everyday functioning (ie, cognitive and physical functioning and grade point average).

In spite of data being collected at different phases of the COVID-19 outbreak and across two different cultures, the results converged. Volunteers and health workers reported higher mental distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, somatization) than the comparison group. However, volunteers and health workers also reported more happiness than the comparison group.

Nowadays, information about health is produced so quickly that it becomes complicated to manage it efficiently. Not only scientific evidence production increased exponentially, other sources of non-validated information also emerged through websites, blogs and social media. Public health professionals must be aware of such relevant concepts, the cognitive theories that support them and what the main threats to population's health are - such as vaccine hesitancy, non compliance with public health measures and use of ineffective treatments. Due to their proximity to, and knowledge of communities, public health professionals are extremely important in infodemic management but should not neglect their online presence (particularly on social media) and the potential of partnerships with local organizations. The aim of this workshop is to provide an overview of public health services approach to infodemic management, including practical examples that can be applied by participants according to available resources. Infodemic management can be complex to handle at first, but particular areas should always be targeted in public health strategies. Social listening is a key step to understand communities' concerns and identify sources of misinformation. It provides an efficient approach to detecting rumours and eases community engagement in the response process. As a way to prevent the spread of misinformation, communities should be inoculated with high-quality, engaging health information which can be co-produced with citizens to increase engagement and efficiency. On the other hand, misinformation and disinformation must be countered rapidly but carefully, through fact-checking teams and collaboration with community leaders and media platforms to ensure rapid dissemination. Capacity building and training for public health professionals in infodemic management is an emergent need, the foundations of which can be introduced in this short session. This workshop will be held in a skills building seminar format facilitated by two alumni of the WHO infodemic management training It consists of four specific parts. First, we will provide a brief introduction on main infodemic concepts and cognitive theories, which will be applied in a brief online game called Bad News. Secondly, we will show how infodemic management can overlap common epidemic management, including focus in preparedness and monitoring. Then, we will showcase monitoring and social listening strategies and relevant interventions to prevent and tackle misinformation. Participants will be able to discuss examples of their own experiences or of those shared by panelists. Finally, we will provide useful links for more comprehensive training and practical tools that can be used at both local and national level.

We aimed to evaluate the association between ultrasound visualisation and surveillance test performance. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study among patients with cirrhosis, with or without HCC, who underwent ultrasound-based surveillance at two large health systems between July 2016 and July 2019. Ultrasound visualisation assessment was recorded by interpreting radiologists using the ultrasound LI-RADS Visualisation score. We performed logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between ultrasound visualisation and diagnostic test performance. We assessed sensitivity for HCC detection among ultrasounds performed in the year prior to HCC diagnoses and specificity using ultrasounds in those without HCC. RESULTS: Among 186 patients with HCC, severely limited visualisation (Vis Score C) on ultrasound prior to HCC diagnosis was associated with increased odds of false-negative results, that is lower sensitivity (OR 7.94, 95% CI 1.23-51.16) in multivariable analysis. Ultrasound sensitivity with visualisation scores A or B exceeded 75%, compared to only 27.3% with visualisation score C. Among 2052 cirrhosis patients without HCC, moderate visualisation limitations (Vis score B) were associated with increased odds of false-positive results (OR 1.60, 1.13-2.27), although specificity exceeded 95% across all visualisation scores.

This review will focus briefly on medications used during the outbreak. We will discuss current therapeutic candidates and their status and will then turn to a related and essential topic: supportive care and the standard of care for filovirus infected patients. Potential benefits and pitfalls of combination therapies for filoviruses will be discussed. Areas covered: Clinical trials of therapeutics targeting EBOV; clinical usage of therapeutics during recent EBOV outbreak; potential need for combination therapy; role of supportive care in treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). Expert commentary: In the absence of another large scale EBOV outbreak, the path to therapeutic product licensure in the United States of America (USA) would need to be via the FDA Animal Rule. However, human data may be needed to supplement animal data. The future of filovirus therapeutics may therefore benefit by establishing the ability to implement clinical trials in an outbreak setting in a timely fashion. Supportive care guidelines for filovirus infection should be defined and established as standard of care for treatment of EVD.","output":"Treatment-focused Ebola trials, supportive care and future of filovirus care."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose of Review We highlight the new clinical entity multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), the progress in understanding its immunopathogenesis, and compare and contrast the clinical and immunologic features of MIS-C with Kawasaki disease (KD). Recent Findings Studies show immune dysregulation in MIS-C including T lymphocyte depletion and activation, T cell receptor Vbeta skewing, elevated plasmablast frequencies, increased markers of vascular pathology, and decreased numbers and functional profiles of antigen-presenting cells. Summary MIS-C is a late manifestation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 associated with marked immune activation and many potential mechanisms of immunopathogenesis. MIS-C and KD have clinical similarities but are distinct. Myocardial dysfunction with or without mild coronary artery dilation can occur in MIS-C but generally corrects within weeks. In contrast, the coronary arteries are the primary target in KD, and coronary artery sequelae can be lifelong. Supportive care and anti-inflammatory therapy appear to hasten improvement in children with MIS-C, and there is hope that vaccines will prevent its development.","output":"Current Insights Into the Pathophysiology of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite limited evidence for competent infection and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system (CNS), neurologic dysfunction is a common post-acute medical condition reported in recovered COVID-19 patients. To identify a potential noninfectious route for SARS-CoV-2-mediated neurological damage, we constructed colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots linked to micelles decorated with spike protein (COVID-QDs) as a biomimetic to interrogate how blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysregulation may subsequently induce neuroinflammation in the absence of infection. In transwell co-culture of endothelial bEnd.3 monolayers and primary neuroglia, we exposed only the bEnd.3 monolayers to COVID-QDs and examined by fluorescence microscopy whether such treatment led to (i) increased inflammation and leakage across the bEnd.3 monolayers, (ii) permeability of the COVID-QDs across the monolayers, and (iii) induction of neuroinflammation in neuroglial cultures. The results of our study provide evidence of neuroinflammatory hallmarks in cultured neurons and astrocytes without direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2-like nanoparticles. Additionally, we found that pre-treatment of our co-cultures with a small-molecule, broad-spectrum inhibitor of mixed lineage and leucine rich repeat kinases led to reversal of the observed dysregulation in endothelial monolayers and resulted in neuroglial protection.

However, neurological manifestations of COVID 19, namely Guillain-Barre syndrome are rare. We present a case of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP), a form of GBS in a patient with recent COVID infection. Case: 66 year old man with no significant medical history presented to the emergency department for progressive weakness of all extremities for 2 days. Patient was diagnosed with COVID 19 three weeks prior to onset of weakness. As per patient, he only had mild respiratory illness with cough, general weakness without respiratory symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, he felt weakness in his lower extremities, which then progressed to involve the upper extremities. On initial evaluation the patient's pupils were symmetric and 3mm, reactive to light, visual field were full to confrontation, cranial nerves intact, shoulder shrug symmetric with full strength. He had decreased motor tone with 2/5 strength in both upper and lower extremities and depressed or absent reflexes in all extremities. His labs were significant for positive COVID 19 PCR and antibodies. CT head was negative for acute stroke or intracranial pathology. The patient was admitted to MICU where he developed respiratory muscle weakness with diminished vital capacity of 12ml/kg and negative inspiratory force of 12mmHg and he was intubated. Cerebral spinal fluid showed elevated protein to 145mg/dL, WBC of 4/UL with 50% lymphocytes and glucose of 67. Other CSF studies were negative for oligoclonal bands, EBV, CMV, cryptococcus, syphilis, and sarcoidosis. Electromyography was consistent with moderate AIDP. He received 5 doses of IVIG with no significant improvement so he underwent tracheostomy and was initiated on plasmapheresis for AIDP. Discussion: GBS is an immune-mediated disease that typically affects the peripheral neurons and nerve roots after respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. Typical infections are Campylobacter jejuni, Zika virus, Influenza, and there are even reports of GBS after MERS and SARS COV-1. However, there has been increasing evidence of COVID 19 causing neurologic manifestations such as encephalitis, meningitis, stroke, and GBS [1]. Patients, such as the one presented in this report with GBS, usually have a long and protracted disease despite aggressive treatments with IVIG and plasmapheresis with reliance on mechanical ventilator.

Translation of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in tombusviruses is mediated using this strategy and we have investigated this process using a variety of in vitro and in vivo approaches. Our results indicate that readthrough generating the RdRp requires a novel long-range RNA-RNA interaction, spanning a distance of 3.5 kb, which occurs between a large RNA stem-loop located 3'-proximal to the stop codon and an RNA replication structure termed RIV at the 3'-end of the viral genome. Interestingly, this long-distance RNA-RNA interaction is modulated by mutually-exclusive RNA structures in RIV that represent a type of RNA switch. Moreover, a different long-range RNA-RNA interaction that was previously shown to be necessary for viral RNA replicase assembly was also required for efficient readthrough production of the RdRp. Accordingly, multiple replication-associated RNA elements are involved in modulating the readthrough event in tombusviruses and we propose an integrated mechanistic model to describe how this regulatory network could be advantageous by (i) providing a quality control system for culling truncated viral genomes at an early stage in the replication process, (ii) mediating cis-preferential replication of viral genomes, and (iii) coordinating translational readthrough of the RdRp with viral genome replication.

The stress associated with MV can damage the delicate epithelium in small airways and alveoli, which can cause complications resulting in ventilation-induced lung injuries (VILIs) in many cases, especially in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, efforts were directed to develop safe modes for MV. In our work, we propose a different approach to decrease injuries of epithelial cells (EpCs) upon MV. We alter EpCs' cytoskeletal structure to increase their survival rate during airway reopening conditions associated with MV. We tested two anti-inflammatory drugs dexamethasone (DEX) and transdehydroandrosterone (DHEA) to alter the cytoskeleton. Cultured rat L2 alveolar EpCs were exposed to airway reopening conditions using a parallel-plate perfusion chamber. Cells were exposed to a single bubble propagation to simulate stresses associated with mechanical ventilation in both control and study groups. Cellular injury and cytoskeleton reorganization were assessed via fluorescence microscopy, whereas cell topography was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results indicate that culturing cells in media, DEX solution, or DHEA solution did not lead to cell death (static cultures). Bubble flows caused significant cell injury. Preexposure to DEX or DHEA decreased cell death significantly. The AFM verified alteration of cell mechanics due to actin fiber depolymerization. These results suggest potential beneficial effects of DEX and DHEA for ARDS treatment for patients with COVID-19.

Airborne virus transmission by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major contributor to the fast spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many countries. Concerted research efforts in diverse scientific fields have meanwhile advanced the understanding of the physical principles of the manifold processes involved in airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As part of these efforts, the physics and dynamics of aerosol filtration by various types of face masks have been studied. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In particular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic individual to a healthy individual, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor environment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic filtering of IAs by the imperfectly fitted face masks. Furthermore, we are able to show that the fit of the face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability if the infectious dose for virus transmission to the healthy person is in a critical range. We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it naturally encompasses the randomness of the transmission process and thus enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical averages. ? 2021 ACM.","output":"Statistical Modeling of Airborne Virus Transmission through Imperfectly Fitted Face Masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background.

In sepsis, a massive aggregation of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) cause a cytokine storm. The endothelial glycocalyx (eGC) is a gel like layer on the luminal side of the endothelium that consists of proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and plasma proteins. It is synthesized by endothelial cells and plays an active role in the regulation of inflammation, permeability, and coagulation. In sepsis, early and profound injury of the eGC is observed and circulating eGC components correlate directly with clinical severity and outcome. The activity of the heparan sulfate (HS) specific glucuronidase Heparanase-1 (Hpa-1) is elevated in sepsis, resulting in shedding of heparan sulfate (HS), a main GAG of the eGC. HS induces endothelial barrier breakdown and accelerates systemic inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a PAMP mainly found on the surface of gram-negative bacteria, activates TLR-4, which results in cytokine production and further activation of Hpa-1. Hpa-1 shed HS fragments act as DAMPs themselves, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation and end-organ dysfunction such as septic cardiomyopathy and encephalopathy. Recently, Hpa-1s natural antagonist, Heparanase-2 (Hpa-2) has been identified. It has no intrinsic enzymatic activity but instead acts by reducing inflammation. Hpa-2 levels are reduced in septic mice and patients, leading to an acquired imbalance of Hpa-1 and Hpa-2 paving the road towards a therapeutic intervention. Recently, the synthetic antimicrobial peptide 19C2.5 was described as a promising therapy protecting the eGC by inhibition of Hpa-1 activity and HS shed fragments in animal studies. However, a recombinant Hpa-2 therapy does not exist to the present time. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), a modality already tested in clinical practice, effectively removes injurious mediators, e.g., Hpa-1, while replacing depleted protective molecules, e.g., Hpa-2. In critically ill patients with septic shock, TPE restores the physiological Hpa-1/Hpa-2 ratio and attenuates eGC breakdown. TPE results in a significant improvement in hemodynamic instability including reduced vasopressor requirement. Although promising, further studies are needed to determine the therapeutic impact of TPE in septic shock.","output":"Targeting the sweet spot in septic shock C A perspective on the endothelial glycocalyx regulating proteins Heparanase-1 and -2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design of corona virus testing kit is proposed in this paper using silicon based 3D photonic structure through zirconium quantum dot solution at the signal of 412 nm.

A prospective feasibility study showed that elemental diet (ED), an oral supplement that does not require digestion, may prevent OM. Based on this, we established a central review system for oral cavity assessment by dental oncology specialists blinded to background data. We used this system to elucidate the preventive effect of an ED against OM in patients with esophageal cancer receiving docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (DCF) therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this phase III, multicenter, parallel-group, controlled trial, patients consuming a normal diet orally were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to receive two cycles of DCF with (group A) or without (group B) an ED (Elental? 160 g/day). We assessed the incidence of grade 2 OM evaluated by two reviewers, changes in body weight, prealbumin, C-reactive protein, and DCF completion rate based on ED compliance. RESULTS Of the 117 patients randomly assigned to treatment, four failed to start treatment and were excluded from the primary analysis; thus, groups A and B comprised 55 and 58 patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in background characteristics. Grade 2 OM was observed in eight (15%) and 20 (34%) patients in groups A and B, respectively (P = 0.0141).

However, a newly proposed single\\\\syringe technique (SST), in which adenosine is diluted with an up to 20 ml IV bolus of NSS, was found to be beneficial. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that the SST was noninferior to the DST for terminating stable SVT. METHODS: A pilot multicenter, single\\\\blind, randomized controlled study was conducted at nine hospitals in north and northeast Thailand. Thirty patients who were diagnosed with stable SVT were randomized into two groups of 15, with one receiving adenosine via the DST and the other via the SST. We examined SVT termination, the average successful dose, and the complication rate of each group. Analyses were based on the intention\\\\to\\\\treat principle. RESULT: The termination rate was 93.3% in the DST and 100% in the SST group (p = 1.000), and the success rate of the first 6\\\\mg dose of adenosine was 73.3% and 80%, respectively (p = 1.000).

Although highly effective vaccines have been developed, non-pharmaceutical interventions remain critical to controlling disease transmission. One such interventionrapid, at-home antigen self-testingcan ease the burden associated with facility-based testing programs and improve testing access in high-risk communities. However, its impact on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission has yet to be definitively evaluated, and the socio-behavioral aspects of testing in underserved populations remain unknown. METHODS: As part of the Rapid Acceleration of DiagnosticsCUnderserved Populations (RADx-UP) program funded by the National Institutes of Health, we are implementing a public health intervention titled Say Yes! COVID Test (SYCT) involving at-home self-testing using a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen assay in North Carolina (Greenville, Pitt County) and Tennessee (Chattanooga City, Hamilton County). The intervention is supported by a multifaceted communication and community engagement strategy to ensure widespread awareness and uptake, particularly in marginalized communities. Participants receive test kits either through online orders or via local community distribution partners. To assess the impact of this intervention on SARS-CoV-2 transmission, we will conduct a non-randomized, ecological study using community-level outcomes. Specifically, we will evaluate trends in SARS-CoV-2 cases and hospitalizations, SARS-CoV-2 viral load in wastewater, and population mobility in each community before, during, and after the SYCT intervention. Individuals who choose to participate in SYCT will also have the option to enroll in an embedded prospective cohort substudy gathering participant-level data to evaluate behavioral determinants of at-home self-testing and socio-behavioral mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. DISCUSSION: This is the first large-scale, public health intervention implementing rapid, at-home SARS-CoV-2 self-testing in the United States. The program consists of a novel combination of an at-home testing program, a broad communications and community engagement strategy, an ecological study to assess impact, and a research substudy of the behavioral aspects of testing. The findings from the SYCT project will provide insights into innovative methods to mitigate viral transmission, advance the science of public health communications and community engagement, and evaluate emerging, novel assessments of community transmission of disease.

Recent developments in molecular analyses have greatly contributed to a more accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of CNS tumors. Additionally, sequencing studies have identified various, often entity specific, tumor-driving events. In contrast to adult tumors, which often harbor multiple mutated oncogenic drivers, the number of mutated genes in pediatric cancers is much lower and many tumors can have a single oncogenic driver. Moreover, in children, much more than in adults, fusion proteins play an important role in driving tumorigenesis, and many different fusions have been identified as potential driver events in pediatric CNS neoplasms. However, a comprehensive overview of all the different reported oncogenic fusion proteins in pediatric CNS neoplasms is still lacking. A better understanding of the fusion proteins detected in these tumors and of the molecular mechanisms how these proteins drive tumorigenesis, could improve diagnosis and further benefit translational research into targeted therapies necessary to treat these distinct entities. In this review, we discuss the different oncogenic fusions reported in pediatric CNS neoplasms and their structure to create an overview of the variety of oncogenic fusion proteins to date, the tumor entities they occur in and their proposed mode of action.","output":"The oncogenic fusion landscape in pediatric CNS neoplasms."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] of the coronavirus disease 2019 has been estimated to range between 2 and 4.

Its use in the United States is highly regulated at both the federal and state level. The regulations related to take-home doses were loosened because of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus public health emergency declaration. The aim was to assess the effect of loosened regulations on methadone-related exposures reported to poison control centers. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of population-based intentional methadone exposures (in persons 18 years of age and older) reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Poison Data System. A quasi-experimental design looking at one year before and after the March 16, 2020 loosening of methadone take-home regulations. Severity of exposure was assessed by: disposition (discharged from emergency department, admitted to non-critical care versus critical care units), medical treatments received, and medical outcomes (no effect, minor effect, moderate effect, major effect, death). One tail Student t-test and Chi Square were used; p significance was <0.05. RESULTS: The number of adult intentional exposures involving methadone increased by 5.3% in the year following the change in federal regulations (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in distribution of age, gender, whether exposures involved methadone-only or methadone plus other substances, therapies administered or hospitalizations. There was no difference in overall distribution of medical outcomes, including deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of exposures involving methadone increased post-regulation change, the severity of exposures remained unchanged. Various additional factors (Medicare and Medicaid expansion; increased number of opioid treatment programs) may have also contributed to this increase. As federal officials consider possible permanent changes to the methadone regulations, it is important to evaluate potential related risks and benefits. This study lends support to the consideration that loosening of methadone regulations does not necessarily lead to a substantial increase in severity of exposures.","output":"Methadone Exposures Reported to Poison Control Centers in the United States Following the COVID-19-Related Loosening of Federal Methadone Regulations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airline alliances provide more flights, include different destinations, and maximize revenues. In an alliance, collaborating airlines can offer tickets for an identical flight plan, unlike the traditional single airline approach. In particular, due to epidemic/pandemic events, such as COVID-19, the available customer demands become highly uncertain across many real airline alliance problems, and maintaining stable revenue is as important as maximizing the revenue in the alliance. A critical question is how the independent airline companies of an alliance should collaborate to maintain reliable maximum revenue. Therefore, this question was studied using a grey mathematical programming model for small-sized airline alliances under grey demand data. Some cooperative game theoretical solution concepts, such as Shapley, equal revenue, Nucleolus, and minimax core, are presented. A numerical study of a small-sized alliance with three airline companies was used to interpret the results of the cooperative game theory concepts. Three cases were considered based on the grey passenger demand structure of airline collaborations to share extra revenues and maintain stable revenue distribution that would maximize the expected revenue. Based on the obtained results, the synergy of collaboration increased with the increase in the size coalition in all of the cases, except for the cases of lower (L) and upper (U) demand levels.","output":"Collaborative airline revenue sharing game with grey demand data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For years, experts have warned that a global pandemic was only a matter of time.

One method to study this question is through the use of a contemporary linked donor-recipient repository. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study Allogeneic Donor and Recipient (RADAR) repository was established between 2000 and 2003 by seven blood centers and eight collaborating hospitals. Specimens from consented donors were collected, components from their donations were routed to participating hospitals, and recipients of these units gave enrollment and follow-up specimens for long-term storage. The repository was designed to show that zero transmissions to enrolled recipients would indicate with 95 percent confidence that the transfusion transmission rate of an agent with prevalence of 0.05 to 1 percent was lower than 25 percent. RESULTS The repository contains pre- and posttransfusion specimens from 3,575 cardiac, vascular, and orthopedic surgery patients, linked to 13,201 donation specimens. The mean number of RADAR donation exposures per recipient is 3.85. The distribution of components transfused is 77 percent red cells, 13 percent whole blood-derived platelet concentrates, and 10 percent fresh frozen plasma. A supplementary unlinked donation repository containing 99,906 specimens from 84,339 donors was also established and can be used to evaluate the prevalence of an agent and validate assay(s) performance before accessing the donor-recipient-linked repository.

We created an indicatorthe COVID-19 bereavement multiplierthat estimates the average number of individuals who will experience the death of a close relative (defined as a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child) for each COVID-19 death. Using demographic microsimulation-based estimates of kinship networks in the United States, the clear age gradient in COVID-19 mortality seen across contexts, and several hypothetical infection prevalence scenarios, we estimate COVID-19 bereavement multipliers for White and Black individuals in the United States. Our analysis shows that for every COVID-19 death, approximately nine surviving Americans will lose a grandparent, parent, sibling, spouse, or child. These estimates imply, for example, that if 190,000 Americans die from COVID-19, as some models project, then 1.7 million will experience the death of a close relative. We demonstrate that our estimates of the bereavement multiplier are stable across epidemiological realities, including infection scenarios, total number of deaths, and the distribution of deaths, which means researchers can estimate the bereavement burden over the course of the epidemic in lockstep with rising death tolls. In addition, we provide estimates of bereavement multipliers by age group, types of kin loss, and race to illuminate prospective disparities.

We have been flexible and creative in order to continue providing elective colorectal cancer operations and to restart services for benign cases during the recovery period of the pandemic. In this paper, we describe the impact of coronavirus on our elective services and how we have implemented new patient pathways to allow us to continue providing patient care. Methods: Data on major colorectal elective resections was prospectively collected in an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) database. Data on the number of proctology cases and telemed appointments were collected from the hospital theatre information management system and electronic patient record system respectively. Results: During the pandemic, there was a complete shift towards cancer cases, with benign services and proctology cases being placed on hold. Hospital length of stay was reduced. We implemented earlier hospital discharge and more intense telephone follow up after elective major surgery. This has not resulted in an increase in post-operative complications, nor any increase in readmission into hospital. During the recovery phase, we have introduced a higher proportion of telemed consultations, including one-stop telemed proctology clinics, resulting in straight to tests or investigations. Conclusions: We have created a streamlined multi-disciplinary pathway to reinstate our elective colorectal services as soon as possible and to minimise potential harm caused to patients whose treatment have been delayed.

We demonstrated that higher concentrations of pentobarbital (100-1,000 M) significantly inhibited capsaicin (100 nM)-induced, but not high K+ (50 mM)-induced, SP release from DRG cells, although a high concentration of ketamine (1 mM) did not. This study revealed that pentobarbital functions between the activation of vanilloid receptor subtype 1 (TRPV1) receptors, to which capsaicin selectively binds, and the opening of voltage-operated Ca2+ channels (VOCC) in the nerve endings. Therefore, the anti-inflammatory action of pentobarbital is mediated through different mechanisms than those of ketamine.

METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional study that surveyed fellowship-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons in HNORS. This cohort of surgeons was contacted via a generated email list of surgeons enrolled in the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons pathology special interest group. An electronic survey contained 16 questions to assess the COVID-19 effect on HNORS practice and capture their practice patterns from mid-March to mid-April 2020. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze counts, percentages, and response rates. RESULTS: We had a 60% response rate (39 of 64); 72% of our responders worked at academic institutions, 18% marked themselves as hybrid academic/private practice, and only 10% were considered hospital-based surgeons. Only 8% of the survey respondents were requested to pause head and neck cancer surgery, whereas 24% were requested to pause free flap surgery during the pandemic. Fifty-five percent agreed that the head and neck and reconstructive surgery should be conducted during a pandemic. Finally, 45% thought that two weeks was a reasonable delay for head and neck cancer cases, whereas 29% thought they should not be delayed for any amount of time. Regarding practice patterns, microvascular reconstruction was the favored method (100%). Respondents generally admitted patients to an intensive care unit postoperatively (92%) and were kept on a ventilator (53%).

Amino acid substitutions in the amino terminus, or deletion of regions in the internal carboxy-terminal region of E protein, led to virus attenuation.

To analyze the host responses leading to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation, differences in gene expression elicited by the native and mutant viruses in the lungs of infected mice were determined. Expression levels of a large number of proinflammatory cytokines associated with lung injury were reduced in the lungs of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E*-infected mice, whereas the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were increased, both at the mRNA and protein levels. These results suggested that the reduction in lung inflammation together with a more robust antiviral T cell response contributed to rSARS-CoV-MA15-E* attenuation. The attenuated viruses completely protected mice against challenge with the lethal parental virus, indicating that these viruses are promising vaccine candidates. IMPORTANCE Human coronaviruses are important zoonotic pathogens. SARS-CoV caused a worldwide epidemic infecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality of around 10%. Therefore, understanding the virulence mechanisms of this pathogen and developing efficacious vaccines are of high importance to prevent epidemics from this and other human coronaviruses. Previously, we demonstrated that a SARS-CoV lacking the E protein was attenuated in vivo. Here, we show that small deletions and modifications within the E protein led to virus attenuation, manifested by minimal lung injury, limited neutrophil influx to the lungs, reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, increased anti-inflammatory cytokine levels, and enhanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell counts in vivo, suggesting that these phenomena contribute to virus attenuation. The attenuated mutants fully protected mice from challenge with virulent virus. These studies show that mutations in the E protein are not well tolerated and indicate that this protein is an excellent target for vaccine development.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses with mutations in the E protein are attenuated and promising vaccine candidates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE During COVID-19 vaccine development studies, vaccines' efficacy and safety profiles should be carefully investigated. Only a few studies have shown that the COVID-19 vaccine can cause axillary lymphadenopathy on the injection arm. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy and imaging findings using B-mode and Doppler ultrasonography (US) examinations in volunteers who had recently been vaccinated against COVID-19. METHODS The ipsilateral and contralateral axillae of 101 volunteers who received the COVID-19 vaccine were evaluated using B-mode and Doppler US examinations. The volunteers were asked when and to which arm the vaccine had been applied, and the type and dose of the vaccine were recorded. It was also questioned whether the individual experienced any side effects after vaccination, such as pain, tenderness, fever, and redness at the injection site. In addition, the demographic data of the participants, such as age and gender were recorded. RESULTS The B-mode US examinations revealed that the long- and short-axis diameters, size, cortical thickness and asymmetric cortical thickening of the left axillary lymph nodes were significantly higher compared to the right side in individuals having received the CoronaVac vaccine (p<0.05). When the individuals were evaluated separately according to gender, the frequency of cortical thickness and asymmetric cortical thickening in the left axillary lymph nodes was higher than on the right side in both males and females (p=0.011). CONCLUSION It should be kept in mind that ipsilateral reactive lymphadenopathy may develop after the COVID-19 vaccine.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-armed, waitlist, randomized trial design tested Tele-Savvy, an online adaptation of a successful in-person psychoeducation program, the Savvy Caregiver. Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in seven weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N=261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the three time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with DSMB approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions. RESULTS: Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care-recipients behaviors and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period. Next steps entail finding alternate ways to deliver the program to those with connectivity and/or time constraint problems.","output":"Results of a Randomized Trial Testing the Efficacy of Tele-Savvy, an Online Synchronous/Asynchronous Psychoeducation Program for Family Caregivers of Persons Living with Dementia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a result of COVID-19, the last few weeks have necessitated a reevaluation of the sedation paradigm for gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures.

OBJECTIVE To develop and implement a digital slide-based virtual surgical pathology clinical elective to meet the demand for meaningful and robust virtual clinical electives in response to the temporary suspension of in-person clinical rotations at JHUSOM. DESIGN The Virtual Surgical Pathology (VSP) elective was modeled after the in-person surgical pathology elective, to include virtual previewing and sign-out with standardized cases supplemented by synchronous and asynchronous pathology educational content. RESULTS Validation of existing web communications technology and slide scanning systems was performed by feasibility testing. Curriculum development included drafting of course objectives and syllabus, Blackboard course site design, electronic-lecture creation, communications with JHUSOM leadership, scheduling, and slide curation. Subjectively, the weekly schedule averaged 35-40 hours to asynchronous, synchronous, and independent content, approximately 10-11 hours of which were synchronous. As of February 2021, VSP has hosted 35 JHUSOM and eight non-JHUSOM students, who have provided positive subjective and objective course feedback. CONCLUSIONS The Johns Hopkins VSP elective provided meaningful clinical experience to 43 students in a time of immense online education need.

The \\"alternative asset revolution\\" is gaining traction in the property investment space internationally among institutional investors due to the shifting investment attitudes towards the alternative property sectors. Australia's $205bn healthcare property sector is at the forefront of this revolution due to its societal significance, as well as its attractive investment qualities. This paper investigates the institutional investor management of the Australian healthcare property sector via both the direct and listed channels and empirically analyses its investment attributes. Design/methodology/approach Using the unique Morgan Stanley Capital International/Property Council of Australia quarterly data set for Australian direct healthcare property over 2006-2020, the risk-adjusted performance and portfolio diversification potential direct healthcare property and listed healthcare were assessed. A constrained mean-variance portfolio optimisation framework was used to develop a six-asset portfolio scenario to analyse the portfolio added-value benefits of both direct healthcare property and listed healthcare in a mixed-asset investment strategy. A similar set of analysis was performed using the post-global financial crisis (GFC) quarterly time series of 2009-2020 to investigate the healthcare asset class' performance dynamics in the post-GFC investment timeframe. Findings The results indicate that direct healthcare property and listed healthcare offer two key advantages for institutional investors in managing their property portfolios: (1) a stable yet superior risk-adjusted performance and (2) significant portfolio diversification potential in managing their property portfolios. Importantly, both direct healthcare property and listed healthcare provided valuable contributions in strengthening an investment portfolio's performance. The post-GFC sub-period analysis revealed a consistent conclusion regarding the healthcare asset class's performance attributes. Originality/value This is the first research that provides an independent empirical examination of the strategic importance of Australian healthcare property as a maturing alternative property sector that can serve both investment and environmental, social and governance goals of investors.

PATIENTS Forty patients, aged 18 to 75 years with a BMI 18.5 to 35.0 kg m requiring general anaesthesia for elective surgery were recruited and randomised into two groups. INTERVENTIONS Once apnoeic after induction of general anaesthesia, face mask ventilation began with pressure controlled ventilation, at a peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O. Each patient was ventilated for three 1-min intervals with the head position alternated every minute: group A, mask ventilation was performed with a neutral head position for 1 min, followed by an axial head position rotated 45 to the right for 1 min and then returned to the neutral position for another 1 min. In group B, the sequence of head positioning was rotated  neutral  rotated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Expiratory tidal volume, measured with a respiratory inductive plethysmograph. RESULTS Two patients were excluded due to protocol violation; thus, data from 38 patients were analysed.

METHODS: The participants in this study represent a diverse group of interprofessional health care faculty enrolled in a transformational leadership course (Paths to Leadership [PTL]) when the pandemic first appeared. Three months into the pandemic, the leadership cohort was invited to participate in this qualitative study, exploring four questions: Q1: How have you transformed your working styles in response to the pandemic? Q2: How have you adjusted your personal life in response to the pandemic? Q3: How have you used leadership skills learned from PTL during the pandemic? and Q4: What lessons have you learned from the pandemic? Participant narratives were analyzed by a team of nurse researchers using conventional qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Themes for Q1 (Working Styles) included: shifted from face-to-face to telework, faced novel disease and decisions, worked more from home, and challenged to maintain contact with professional peers and team. Themes for Q2 (Personal Life) included: accommodate adults working and children learning from home, looked for and found the positive, and continue to struggle.

All eligible articles stress the importance of the negative-pressurized environment to deal with perioperative care of Covid-19 patients. In general, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and video laryngoscopy is also essential. Conclusion: The best protective suit to avoid health-care personnel from getting Covid-19 infection is proper training and self-discipline. This combined with cooperative, honest patients and proper PPE supply is vital in efforts to reduce the spread of the disease. Negative-pressure chambers, both in operating rooms and intensive care units, are essential in this pandemic. Unfortunately, they are not easily available in underdeveloped and developing countries. ? 2020 Bali Journal of Anesthesiology ;Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","output":"Perioperative safety during Covid-19 pandemic: A review article"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 is mostly symptomatic, but a wide range of medications are under investigation against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Although pregnant women are excluded from clinical trials, they will inevitably receive therapies whenever they seem effective in nonpregnant patients and even under compassionate use. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature on placental transfer and pregnancy safety data of drugs under current investigation for coronavirus disease 2019. Results: Regarding remdesivir, there are no data in pregnant women. Several other candidates already have safety data in pregnant women, because they are repurposed drugs already used for their established indications. Thus, they may be used in pregnancy, although their safety in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 may differ from conventional use. These include HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir that have low placental transfer, interferon that does not cross the placental barrier, and hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine that has high placental transfer. There are also pregnancy safety and placental transfer data for colchicine, steroids, oseltamivir, azithromycin, and some monoclonal antibodies. However, some drugs are strictly prohibited in pregnancy because of known teratogenicity (thalidomide) or fetal toxicities (renin-angiotensin system blockers). Other candidates including tocilizumab, other interleukin 6 inhibitors, umifenovir, and favipiravir have insufficient data on pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion: In life-threatening cases of coronavirus disease 2019, the potential risks of therapy to the fetus may be more than offset by the benefit of curing the mother. Although preclinical and placental transfer studies are required for a number of potential anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 drugs, several medications can already be used in pregnant women.","output":"Placental transfer and safety in pregnancy of medications under investigation to treat coronavirus disease 2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab (TCZ) reduces mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TCZ versus placebo/control, for treatment of adults with COVID-19. Primary outcome was 28-30 days all-cause mortality. Search was conducted up to April 1(st) 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled. We performed subgroup analysis for patients with critical illness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, assessing 6,481 patients with mostly severe non-critical COVID-19 infection. TCZ was associated with a reduction in all-cause 28C30-day mortality compared to placebo/control (RR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.96). Among the subgroup of critically ill patients no reduced mortality was demonstrated (RR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.74-1.19). No mortality benefit with TCZ was demonstrated in trials that used steroids for >80% of patients. TCZ was associated with significantly reduced risk for mechanical ventilation (MV); for combined endpoint of death or MV; and for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. No significant difference in adverse events was demonstrated. Risk of serious superinfection was significantly lower with TCZ (RR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.35-0.93). CONCLUSION: The treatment with TCZ reduces 28-30 days all-cause mortality, ICU admission, superinfections, MV and the combined endpoint of death or MV. Among critically ill patients, and when steroids were used for most patients, no mortality benefit was demonstrated.

Since then Mexico has observed a sustained elevation in the number of COVID-19 deaths. Mexicos delayed response to the COVID-19 pandemic until late March 2020 hastened the spread of the virus in the following months. However, the government followed a phased reopening of the country in June 2020 despite sustained virus transmission. In order to analyze the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, we systematically generate and compare the 30-day ahead forecasts of national mortality trends using various growth models in near real-time and compare forecasting performance with those derived using the COVID-19 model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. We also estimate and compare reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on methods that rely on both the genomic data as well as case incidence data to gauge the transmission potential of the virus. Moreover, we perform a spatial analysis of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico by analyzing the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level, using techniques from functional data analysis. The early estimate of reproduction number indicates sustained disease transmission in the country with R~1.3. However, the estimate of R as of September 27, 2020 is ~0.91 indicating a slowing down of the epidemic. The spatial analysis divides the Mexican states into four groups or clusters based on the growth rate curves, each with its distinct epidemic trajectory. Moreover, the sequential forecasts from the GLM and Richards model also indicate a sustained downward trend in the number of deaths for Mexico and Mexico City compared to the sub-epidemic and IHME model that outperformed the others and predict a more stable trajectory of COVID-19 deaths for the last three forecast periods.","output":"Transmission dynamics and forecasts of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico, March 20-November 11, 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The beginning of 2020 has seen the emergence of coronavirus outbreak caused by a novel virus called SARS-CoV-2.

However, it is a growing new surgical concept in China. Several technical challenges hinder the safe clinical application of NOTES. This study investigated transvaginal endoscopic cholecystectomy performed with the assistance of a single umbilical trocar and achieved helpful initial clinical experience. METHODS From May 2009 to April 2010, a total of 43 transvaginal human cholecystectomies were performed. A single umbilical trocar was used for safe access and laparoscopic assistance during the operation. After the gallbladder had been removed through the vagina, the colpotomy was closed with absorbable stitches under direct vision. In addition, Student's t-test was performed for two samples to estimate the superiority of NOTES over a conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) operation. RESULTS The procedure was successfully completed for all the patients. No intra- or post-operative complications occurred. The patients recovered promptly after surgery, and all were satisfied with ideal cosmetic outcomes. The postoperative pain, hospital stay, and cost of hospitalization with NOTES were much less than with conventional LC operations. CONCLUSIONS Although endoscopic instruments specifically designed for NOTES are not available, the addition of an umbilical trocar is an optimal way to allow safe performance of NOTES procedures in an easily reproducible manner. The authors' initial experience demonstrates that this hybrid technique is potentially feasible and effective for reducing postoperative pain and recovery times while improving the cosmetic results of transvaginal cholecystectomy.","output":"Transvaginal laparoscopically assisted endoscopic cholecystectomy: preliminary clinical results for a series of 43 cases in China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden spread of the virus and the rapid increase in the number of patients infected with coronavirus could not but affect the work of cardiology and cardiac surgery departments, catheterization laboratories, electrophysiology laboratories, in which surgical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias is performed. After the announcement of quarantine in Ukraine, our department of arrhythmias introduced a set of measures to prevent infection of the staff and patients. All operations are carried out in full compliance with epidemic rules. Every patient, even with a negative PCR test, is considered conditionally infected. This allowed the entire staff to work for a long period with a minimal risk of infection and to maintain an uninterrupted cycle of specialized care for patients with cardiac arrhythmias in the city of Odessa, the Odessa region. In accordance with the recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology, we urgently developed and communicated to all cardiologists, emergency doctors, general practitioners clear criteria for the urgency of patients with arrhythmias and indications for hospitalization. We were able not only to reduce the total number of operations, but even to increase in comparison with last year and perform the largest number of operations for cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disturbances in all the years of our work: 856 procedures in one operating room compared to 828 operations in 2018 and 798 operations in 2019. The golden rule during the coronavirus pandemic is to carry out surgical treatment on the day of admission, i.e. one-day operation. During the pandemic, as a result of the limited availability of consultative and diagnostic assistance to patients with cardiovascular diseases, it is necessary to look for new forms of interaction between the medical care system and the population.

Cerebrovascular endothelial damage increases the risk of stroke in COVID-19 patients, which makes prompt diagnosis important. Endothelial dysfunction can be evaluated by using transcranial Doppler ultrasound to study cerebral hemodynamic reserve, but there are few of these studies in patients with COVID-19, and the technique is not included in COVID-19 action and follow-up guidelines nationally or internationally. OBJECTIVE Estimate baseline cerebral hemodynamic patterns, cerebral hemodynamic reserve, and breath-holding index in recovered COVID-19 patients. METHOD We conducted an exploratory study in 51 people; 27 men and 24 women 20-78 years of age, divided into two groups. One group comprised 25 recovered COVID-19 patients, following clinical and epidemiological discharge, who suffered differing degrees of disease severity, and who had no neurological symptoms or disease at the time they were incorporated into the study. The second group comprised 26 people who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who tested negative by RT-PCR at the time of study enrollment. Recovered patients were further divided into two groups: those who had been asymptomatic or had mild disease, and those who had severe or critical disease. We performed transcranial Doppler ultrasounds to obtain baseline and post-apnea tests of cerebral hemodynamic patterns to evaluate cerebral hemodynamic reserve and breath-holding indices. We characterized the recovered patient group and the control group through simple descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations). RESULTS There were no measurable differences in baseline cerebral hemodynamics between the groups. However, cerebral hemodynamic reserve and breath-holding index were lower in those who had COVID-19 than among control participants (19.9% vs. 36.8% and 0.7 vs. 1.2 respectively). These variables were similar for patients who had asymptomatic or mild disease (19.9% vs.19.8%) and for those who had severe or critical disease (0.7 vs. 0.7). CONCLUSIONS Patients recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection showed decreased cerebral hemodynamic reserve and breath-holding index regardless of the disease's clinical severity or presence of neurological symptoms. These abnormalities may be associated with endothelial damage caused by COVID-19. It would be useful to include transcranial Doppler ultrasound in evaluation and follow-up protocols for patients with COVID-19.","output":"Cerebral Hemodynamic Reserve Abnormalities Detected Via Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound in Recovered COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the rising complexity and processing power of modern computer systems, the amount of MCU on a single PCB also rises.

This endothelial dysfunction is associated with the phlogistic phenomenon of cytokine storms, thrombotic complications, abnormal coagulation, hypoxemia, and multiple organ failure. The mechanisms surrounding COVID-19 associated endotheliitis have been widely attributed to ACE2-mediated pathways. However, integrins are emerging as possible receptor candidates for SARS-CoV-2, and their complex intracellular signaling events are essential for maintaining endothelial homeostasis. Here, we showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 depends on its RGD motif to drive barrier dysregulation by hijacking integrin V3, expressed on human endothelial cells. This triggers the redistribution and internalization of major junction protein VE-Cadherin which leads to the barrier disruption phenotype. Both extracellular and intracellular inhibitors of integrin V3 prevented these effects, similarly to the RGD-cyclic peptide compound Cilengitide, which suggests that the spike proteinthrough its RGD motifbinds to V3 and elicits vascular leakage events. These findings support integrins as an additional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, particularly as integrin engagement can elucidate many of the adverse endothelial dysfunction events that stem from COVID-19.","output":"Molecular Cross-Talk between Integrins and Cadherins Leads to a Loss of Vascular Barrier Integrity during SARS-CoV-2 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: This study explored gender differences in anxiety, depression, and nursing needs among isolated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, with a particular focus on the influencing factors.

Two general underlying mechanisms should be considered. One would be the anti-infectious and immunomodulatory action that it exerts by improving intercellular barriers by stimulating innate immunity, as well as by modulating adaptive immunity. Also, vitamin D reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (INF). More recently, multiple pleiotropic effects have been demonstrated on the actions of vitamin D at the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory level with positive results in studies with influenza, coronavirus, and other respiratory infections. An inverse relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the prevalence of the respiratory infectious disease has been described. Of interest, another mechanistic approach responds to considering the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is exacerbated in COVID-19 infection because the virus binds to the enzyme ACE2, making more angiotensin II available to cause damage. Vitamin D inhibits mediators of RAAS C present in all cells of the body C and by inhibiting ACE activity and increasing ACE2, it lowers angiotensin II levels. We present studies with proposals for recommended doses of vitamin D, and although a single guideline is not specified, the possible benefits are promising. Finally, the purpose of this review is to share this idea with health professionals to ignite the debate and call for critical reflection, so that it can contribute to the undertaking of more and better clinical designs to validate the benefits of using high doses of vitamin D for the benefit of public health and especially in times of crisis for COVID-19.","output":"Vitamin D high doses supplementation could represent a promising alternative to prevent or treat COVID-19 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2, like any other virus, continues to mutate as it spreads, according to an evolutionary process. Unlike any other virus, the number of currently available sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in public databases such as GISAID is already several million. This amount of data has the potential to uncover the evolutionary dynamics of a virus like never before. However, a million is already several orders of magnitude beyond what can be processed by the traditional methods designed to reconstruct a virus's evolutionary history, such as those that build a phylogenetic tree. Hence, new and scalable methods will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of viral sequences being collected. Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a k-mer based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of each variant in different locations - something which is important for vaccine development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of information gain.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  prospective randomized study included 134 patients who were treated in the epidemic season of influenza and ARVI in 20182019. All patients were examined for the presence of influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses in nasopharyngeal swabs by PCR. Patients of the main group received enisamium iodide along with symptomatic therapy, the control group received only symptomatic therapy. The primary parameter of the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated on the scale of the general severity of the manifestations of ARVI (Total Symptom Score TSS) from the 2nd to the 4th day and by the secondary criteria of effectiveness: assessment of the duration of ARVI, the severity of fever, the proportion of patients with normal body temperature, the duration of the main clinical symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections, the proportion of patients in whom complications requiring antibiotics were noted, the dynamics of interferon status on the 6th day. To conduct a statistical analysis, depending on the efficiency parameter, the ANCOVA method with a fixed group factor and an initial score on the TSS severity scale was used as covariates, a criterion for comparing quantitative indicators in two independent groups. RESULTS According to the results of the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter, the median (interquartile range) of the average score on the scale of the general severity of ARVI manifestations in the main group was 4.33 (3.675.83), in the comparison group 6.00 (4.677.25; p0.001). The duration of systemic and local manifestations of acute respiratory viral infections was statistically significantly less in the main group (p=0.002 and p=0.019, respectively). Prescription of additional therapy was required in 2 (2.9%) patients of the main group (patients taking enisamium iodide), compared with 8 (11.9%) patients in the control group. Serum levels of interferon ? and interferon ? on the last day of treatment were statistically significantly higher in patients of the main group compared with the control group (p0.001). Treatment (excellent) was evaluated by 42 (62.7%) patients, while in the control group only 17 (25.8%) patients gave similar ratings. Both patients (p0.001) and doctors (p0.002) rated therapy tolerance better in the study group. CONCLUSION The results confirmed the safety and effectiveness of enisamium iodide as a treatment for ARVI and influenza. The antiviral, interferonogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of the drug are involved in the formation of an antiviral response and reduce the risk of complications, which makes it possible to reduce the number of symptomatic agents used.","output":"[Evaluation of the effectiveness of ARVI treatment regimen including etiotropic (enisamium iodide) and symptomatic treatment]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) or COVID\\\\19 has caused a worldwide pandemic.

Current exercise provision is time-limited, and delivered in the absence of strategies to support long-term adherence to exercise. With a growing Parkinsons population, there is a need to develop long-term sustainable approaches to exercise delivery. The primary aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a multicomponent intervention (PDConnect) aimed at promoting physical activity, and self-management for PwP. METHODS: A convergent fixed parallel mixed methods design study will be undertaken. The study aims to recruit 30 PwP, who will be randomly allocated into two groups: (i) the usual care group will receive physiotherapy once a week for six weeks delivered via Microsoft Teams. (ii) The PDConnect group will receive physiotherapy once a week for six weeks which combines exercise, education and behaviour change interventions delivered by NHS Parkinsons specialist physiotherapists via Microsoft Teams. This will be followed by 12 weekly sessions of group exercise delivered on Microsoft Teams by fitness instructors specially trained in Parkinsons. Participants will be then contacted by the fitness instructors once per month for three months by video conferencing to support exercise engagement. Primary feasibility data will be collected during the study, with acceptability assessed via semi-structured interviews at the end. Secondary outcomes encompassing motor, non-motor and health and well-being measures will be assessed at baseline, at six, 18, and 30 weeks.

These patients were compared with patients who underwent SILC (22 patients) or 4PLC (11 patients) in a concurrent, randomized, controlled trial. Demographic data, operative time, numerical pain scales, complications, and return to work were recorded. RESULTS Mean age (TVC: 33.5  3.0 year; SILC: 38.4  3.3 year; 4PLC: 35.5  4.1 year; p = 0.58) and mean BMI (TVC: 28.8  1.5 kg/m(2); SILC: 31.8  1 kg/m(2); 4PLC: 31.4  2.2 kg/m(2); p = 0.35) were not statistically significant. However, mean operative time (TVC: 67  3.9 min; SILC: 48.9  2.6 min; 4PLC: 42.3  3.9 min; p < 0.001) was significantly longer for TVC. Numerical pain scales showed significantly lower pain scores on POD 1 and 3 for TVC compared with SILC and 4PLC (TVC: 4.1  0.5 and 2.9  0.7; SILC: 6.1  0.5 and 5.3  0.5; 4PLC: 5.7  0.4 and 4.7  0.3; p = 0.02) with equilibration of pain scores by days 14 and 30.

We conducted an updated meta-analysis to assess the effect of corticosteroids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception to January 2021 via Ovid to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of patients with ARDS. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included the number of ventilator-free days at day 28, oxygenation improvement (PaO2/FIO2 ratios), and adverse events. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1371 participants were analyzed. The pooled analysis revealed that glucocorticoid use was associated with reduced mortality [relative risk (RR), 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.93; P < 0.01; I2 = 37], and the statistical power was confirmed by trial sequential analysis. Glucocorticoids might also significantly increase the number of ventilator-free days at day 28 (mean deviation 3.66 days, 95% CI 2.64-4.68; P < 0.01) and improve oxygenation (standardized mean difference 4.17; 95% CI 2.32-6.02; P < 0.01). In addition, glucocorticoid use was not associated with increased risks of new infection (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.70-1.01; P = 0.07) and hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.99-1.23; P = 0.06).

Available research on active surveillance among hospitalized adult patients suffering from SARI in China is limited. This pilot study aimed to identify associated etiologies and describe the demographic, epidemiological and clinical profiles of hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years in Jinshan, Shanghai. METHODS: Active surveillance was conducted at 1 sentinel hospital in Jinshan district, Shanghai, from April 2017 to March 2018. Hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old were enrolled, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected within 24 hours of admission and tested for multiple respiratory viruses (including 18 common viruses) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was obtained from case report forms. RESULTS: In total, 397 SARI patients were enrolled; the median age was 68 years, and 194 (48.9%) patients were male. A total of 278 (70.0%) patients had at least one underlying chronic medical condition. The most frequent symptoms were cough (99.2%) and sputum production (88.4%). The median duration of hospitalization was 10 days. A total of 250 infection patients (63.0%) were positive for at least one pathogen, of whom 198 (49.9%) were positive for a single pathogen and 52 (13.1%) were positive for multiple pathogens. The pathogens identified most frequently were M. pneumoniae (23.9%, 95/397), followed by adenovirus (AdV) (11.6%, 46/397), influenza virus A/H3N2 (Flu A/H3N2) (11.1%, 44/397), human rhinovirus (HRhV) (8.1%, 32/397), influenza virus B/Yamagata (Flu B/Yamagata) (6.3%, 25/397), pandemic influenza virus A/H1N1 (Flu A/pH1N1) (4.0%, 16/397), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1 (2.0%, 8/397), human coronavirus (HCoV) type NL63 (2.0%, 8/397), HCoV 229E (1.5%, 6/397), HCoV HKU1 (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 3 (1.5%, 6/397), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (1.5%, 6/397), PIV 4 (1.3%, 5/397), HCoV OC43 (1.0%, 4/397), influenza virus B/Victoria (Flu B/Victoria) (0.5%, 2/397), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type B (0.5%, 2/397), and human bocavirus (HBoV) (0.3%, 1/397). The seasonality of pathogen-confirmed SARI patients had a bimodal distribution, with the first peak in the summer and the second peak in the winter. Statistically significant differences were observed with respect to the rates of dyspnea, radiographically diagnosed pneumonia and the presence of at least one comorbidity in patients who were infected with only M. pneumoniae, AdV, HRhV, Flu A/H3N2, Flu A /pH1N1 or Flu B/Yamagata. The differences in the positivity rates of the above 6 pathogens among the different age groups were nonsignificant. CONCLUSIONS: M. pneumoniae, AdV and Flu A/H3N2 were the main pathogens detected in hospitalized SARI patients aged over 16 years old in Jinshan district, Shanghai.

Yet, as for many countries in southern Africa, we have yet to see full implementation and universal access to services for girls and women. This article in offering reflections from the past 25 years, notes how the new democratic government set about replacing the apartheid policy of population control after 1994. It is argued that despite progress, population control remains embedded within programming for sexual and reproductive health and rights in South Africa. The contextual barriers represented by the gender effects of the HIV epidemic for women, government denialism and poor financing as well as navigation of donor practices are inextricably entwined with the realisation of sexual and reproductive health and rights over this period. What is of concern is the influence and dependence on international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and donors in policy, programming and implementation, particularly against the history of 'Gag laws' imposed by conservative governments, effectively rolling back reproductive services and therefore rights. Two related reproductive health indicators, contraception and abortion, are tracked noting how these have been framed, programmed, developed and also changed over the past quarter of a century in South Africa. Within a human rights perspective together with a social justice rubric, narrating the key struggles for reproductive justice provides an opportunity to review sexuality and reproduction from the individual to a wider context, locating struggles and challenges within families, communities and society. While there have been substantial changes and reforms over this time systemic injustices persist.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of allogenic HSCT recipients age 18 years at Oregon Health and Science University Hospital (OHSU) between 2010C2015. During the study period, OHSU standard practice was to preemptively treat CMV-viremic patients (quantitative PCR assay  200 copies/mL or consecutive PCR assays <200 copies/mL) with first-line valganciclovir or ganciclovir and second line foscarnet if there were contraindications to first-line agents. Study data were collected from an electronic health record repository and local Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database. Primary outcomes were clinical manifestations of CMV disease, death, and cause of death within 1 year of transplant. RESULTS: Among 409 HSCT recipients, mean age was 53 (standard deviation: 13) years and 41% were female. 192 (47%) patients had CMV viremia and the median (interquartile range) time to CMV reactivation was 42 (31C53) days (Figure 1). Patients with acute myeloid leukemia were significantly less likely to have CMV reactivation (39% vs. 55%, P < 0.01) and those with myelodysplastic syndromes had a non-significantly higher risk (24% vs. 17%, P = 0.06). 4 (1%) patients had a documented clinical manifestation of CMV disease (3 pneumonia and 1 pancreatitis). One-year mortality was 36% (148/409); there was no significant difference in mortality (37.5% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.60) or cause of death (P = 0.30) between patients with and without CMV reactivation (Figure 2). The most frequent causes of death among CMV viremic patients were recurrent/persistent disease (35%), acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD) (22%), infection (19%), and chronic GVHD (11%). CMV was documented as the primary cause of death for 2 patients. CONCLUSION: Nearly half of HSCT recipients had CMV reactivation and more than a third died within one year of transplant. However, incidence of CMV disease was rare and reactivation was not associated with increased mortality. Further study is needed to identify risk factors for CMV reactivation, infection and mortality in this population. DISCLOSURES: J. P.

This virus is able to attack the cells of the airway epithelium by binding to the transmembrane angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In the current study, we experimented a food supplement containing alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol as active compounds for the improvement of the defenses against the SARS-CoV-2. Hydroxytyrosol has anti-viral properties and is able to reduce the serum lipids in mice fed with high-cholesterol diet, and -cyclodextrin has the ability to deplete sphingolipids and phospholipids from the cellular membranes. The aim of the present preliminary open non-controlled interventional study was to evaluate the efficacy of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Fifty healthy volunteers at a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection from Northern Cyprus and six positive individuals for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR assay were enrolled in this study. The in silico prediction analysis was performed using the bioinformatic tool D3DOCKING to evaluate the interactions of hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with proteins involved in the biological cycle of SARS-CoV-2 in the humans. RESULTS: The 50 volunteers did not become positive in 15 days for SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay after the administration of the compound for two weeks, despite they were at higher risk of infection than the general population. Interestingly, in the cohort of six positive patients, two patients were administered with the spray and became negative after five days of spray administration, despite the viral load was higher in the treated subjects than the patients that did not take the compound and that became negative after ten days. In addition, we have identified the presence of possible direct interactions among hydroxytyrosol and alpha-cyclodextrin with the viral protein Spike and the human proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2. CONCLUSIONS: We preliminary reported on the results of the possible role of alpha-cyclodextrin and hydroxytyrosol in improving defenses against SARS-CoV-2. The next step would be the administration of the compound on a larger cohort in a controlled study and see whether there is a reduced infection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in the treated subjects than in the non-treated individuals.

Given that LTACHs provide more intensive care and thus receive over triple the reimbursement of SNFs for comparable diagnoses, we sought to compare outcomes and spending between LTACH versus SNF transfer. METHODS: Using Medicare claims linked to electronic health record (EHR) data from six Texas Hospitals between 2009 and 2010, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients hospitalized on a medicine service in a high-LTACH use region and discharged to either an LTACH or SNF and followed for one year. The primary outcomes included mortality, 60-day recovery without inpatient care, days at home, and healthcare spending RESULTS: Of 3503 patients, 18% were transferred to an LTACH. Patients transferred to LTACHs were younger (median 71 vs. 82 years), less likely to be female (50.5 vs 66.6%) and white (69.0 vs. 84.1%), but were sicker (24.3 vs. 14.2% for prolonged intensive care unit stay; median diagnosis resource intensity weight of 2.03 vs. 1.38). In unadjusted analyses, patients transferred to an LTACH vs. SNF were less likely to survive (59.1 vs. 65.0%) or recover (62.5 vs 66.0%), and spent fewer days at home (186 vs. 200). Adjusting for demographic and clinical confounders available in Medicare claims and EHR data, LTACH transfer was not significantly associated with differences in mortality (HR, 1.12, 95% CI, 0.94C1.33), recovery (SHR, 1.07, 0.93C1.23), and days spent at home (IRR, 0.96, 0.83C1.10), but was associated with greater Medicare spending ($16,689 for one year, 95% CI, $12,216C$21,162). CONCLUSION: LTACH transfer for Medicare beneficiaries is associated with similar clinical outcomes but with higher healthcare spending compared to SNF transfer. LTACH use should be reserved for patients who require complex inpatient care and cannot be cared for in SNFs.

METHODS: This is a 2-points cross-sectional study (5 years apart; 2014-2019) conducted among PICUs and SCICUs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Children who have stayed in PICU for more than 21 days were included. RESULTS: Out of the 11 units approached, 10 (90%) agreed to participate. The prevalence of LSP in all these hospitals decreased from 32% (48/150) in 2014 to 23.4% (35/149) in 2019. The length of stay ranged from 22 days to 13.5 years. The majority of LSP had a neuromuscular or cardiac disease and were admitted with respiratory compromise. Ventilator-associated pneumonia was the most prevalent complication (37.5%). The most commonly used resources were mechanical ventilation (93.8%), antibiotics (60.4%), and blood-products transfusions (35.4%). The most common reason for the extended stay was medical reasons (51.1%), followed by a lack of family resources (26.5%) or lack of referral to long-term care facilities (22.4%).

BACKGROUND: Patients with ostomies experience increased comfort and satisfaction when nurses are confident in their knowledge and skills. DESIGN: A descriptive, cross-sectional design was used to conduct the research. The study included a convenience sample of 214 staff nurses from five hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The researchers used a survey questionnaire to gauge participants' confidence in their knowledge and skills, as well as identify any perceived barriers to ostomy care. RESULT: Overall, 95.1% of participants worked in adult care and 82.2% worked in surgical areas. There were significant relationships between the nurses' confidence in their ostomy care knowledge and skills and their years of nursing experience and having received ostomy care training in nursing school (p < .05); however, the nurses' level of education had no correlation (p > .05).

These psychological problems have been seen in either normal people during the lockdown (who are waiting to get infected with COVID-19) and patients with COVID-19 (who are waiting for death). These psychological problems adversely affect immune functions causing more increase in the severity of COVID-19 associated disorders and death rates. Increasing the aerobic capacity is one of the effective methods that could be used to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression. Besides, increasing the aerobic capacity increases immune functions through autonomic regulation. Thus, this review was developed to summarize the effect of increasing the aerobic capacity on psycho-immune hormones commonly disturbed in people during the lockdown or patients with COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS This review was carried out by searching through Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials, literature reviews, and systematic reviews. The search included the possible effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the functions of psycho-immune hormones. RESULTS This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity can decrease psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 and increase immune functions by modulating the levels of glucocorticoid, oxytocin, insulin, thyroid hormones. CONCLUSIONS This review demonstrated that increasing the aerobic capacity is a recommended treatment for decreasing the psychological problems commonly seen in people with COVID-19 because it has the potential for decreasing psychological problems and improving immune functions which would help counter COVID-19.","output":"Effects of increasing aerobic capacity on improving psychological problems seen in patients with COVID-19: a review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The purpose of this study was to examine the association between loneliness and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.

Participants were asked if they felt loneliness in a single-item question. The Kessler 6 (K6) was used to assess psychological distress defined as K6 scores of 5 or higher, and 13 or higher. The odds ratios (ORs) of psychological distress associated with loneliness were estimated using a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustment for age, sex, marital status, equivalent income, educational level, smoking, alcohol consumption, job type, number of workplace employees, and cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 in the prefecture. Communication with friends, acquaintances, and family was strongly associated with psychological distress, so we adjusted for these factors and eating meals alone. Results showed a significant association between loneliness and psychological distress (OR = 36.62, 95%CI = 32.95-40.69). Lack of friends to talk to, lack of acquaintances to ask for help, and lack of people to communicate with through social networking sites were all strongly associated with psychological distress, as were family time and solitary eating.

Design Observational study of death, respiratory illness and COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results among residents and staff during nursing home outbreaks in 2020. Setting and Participants 93 chronically ventilated nursing home patients and 1151 non-ventilated patients living among three separate nursing homes on Long Island, New York as of March 15, 2020. Illness, PCR results, and antibody studies among staff are also reported. Measurements Death rate among chronically ventilated and non-ventilated patients between March 15 and May 15, 2020 compared to the same time in 2019. Prevalence of PCR positivity among ventilated and non-ventilated patients in 2020. Reported illness, PCR positivity and antibody among staff. Results Total numbers of deaths among chronically ventilated nursing home patients during this timeframe were similar to the analogous period 1 year earlier (9 of 93 in 2020 versus 8 of 100 in 2019 p=0.8) whereas deaths among non-ventilated patients were greatly increased (214 of 1151 in 2020 versus 55 of 1189 in 2019, p<0.0001). No ventilated patient deaths were clinically judged to be COVID-19 related. No clusters of COVID-19 illness could be demonstrated among ventilated patients. Surveillance PCR testing of ventilator patients failed to reveal COVID-19 positivity (none of 84 ventilator patients versus 81 of 971 non-ventilator patients, p=0.0002). Illness and evidence of COVID-19 infection was demonstrated among staff working both in non-ventilator and in ventilator units. Conclusions and Implications COVID-19 infection resulted in illness and death among non-ventilated nursing home residents as well as among staff. This was not observed among chronically ventilated patients. The mechanics of chronic ventilation appears to protect chronically ventilated patients from COVID-19 disease.","output":"Absence of COVID-19 Disease Among Chronically Ventilated Nursing Home Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Introduction and Aim] In Europe, Australia, and North and South America, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) at home is a common practice for patients with lysosomal diseases. In Japan, on the other hand, patients need to visit a specialized hospital every one to two weeks for regular ERT. For the past 10 years, we have been proposing to the government, authorities, and academic societies to realize ERT at home, and under the circumstances of the spread of the COVID-19 in 2020, the need for ERT at home has increased. The purpose of this study was to investigate the patient burden of ERT in Japan for patients with lysosomal diseases (Fabry disease, Gaucher disease, Pompe disease, and MPS) who belong to four major lysosomal disease patient groups in Japan, and to clarify the need for enzyme replacement therapy at home. [Results] In January 2021, we conducted a questionnaire survey of lysosome disease patients and their families via four lysosome disease patient organizations (194 patients in total). Among the patients with lysosomal disease, 57% of them needed to be accompanied by their families. In addition, it took about 40 min each way to visit a specialized hospital and 246 min to stay in the hospital. In Japan, 67% of the patients preferred to receive ERT at a place other than a specialized hospital (home, clinic, school, office, etc.). [Conclusions] It is clear that lysosomal disease patients and their families in Japan are burdened by ERT. As a result of our work to date, in March 2021, 11 enzymes approved in Japan for lysosomal disease will be available for use by home physicians.

In the absence of high-quality evidence, understandably the recommendations from various organizations are cautious. Several randomized controlled trials are underway but shall take time to conclude. We therefore undertook a meta-analysis to ascertain the role of CS in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Data Sources: Electronic databases, including Pubmed, Cochrane library and Embase, were searched, using the keywords of interest and the PICO search technique, from inception to 12th April 2020. Study Selection: Studies highlighting the use of CS in coronavirus infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and COVID-19 were selected based on pre-determined inclusion criteria. Data extraction: Data was extracted into an excel sheet and transferred to comprehensive meta-analysis software version 3, Biostat Inc., Englewood, NJ, USA, for analysis. Data synthesis: Five studies with SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the meta-analysis. The rate ratio (RR) for mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.26 (95% CI: 0.96-1.65, I2: 74.46), indicating lack of benefit of CS therapy on mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19. The RR for mortality on analysis of the three studies that particularly reported on patients with significant pulmonary compromise secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection was neutral (RR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.63-1.33, I2: 63.38). Conclusions: The use of CS in critically ill patients with COVID-19 did not improve or worsen mortality. Pending further information from controlled studies, CS can be used in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with critical illness related corticosteroid insufficiency and moderate to severe ARDS without the risk of increased mortality.","output":"The role of corticosteroids in the management of critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Post-randomisation exclusions in randomised controlled trials are common and may include participants identified as not meeting trial eligibility criteria after randomisation. We report how a decision might be reached and reported on, to include or exclude these participants. We illustrate using a motivating scenario from the BREATHE trial (Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02426112) evaluating azithromycin for the treatment of chronic lung disease in people aged 6-19 years with HIV in Zimbabwe and Malawi. KEY POINTS: Including all enrolled and randomised participants in the primary analysis of a trial ensures an unbiased estimate of the intervention effect using intention-to-treat principles, and minimises the effects of confounding through balanced allocation to trial arm. Ineligible participants are sometimes enrolled, due to measurement or human error. Of 347 participants enrolled into the BREATHE trial, 11 (3.2%) were subsequently found to be ineligible based on lung function criteria. We assumed no safety risk of azithromycin treatment; their inclusion in the trial and subsequent analysis of the intervention effect therefore mirrors clinical practice. Senior trial investigators considered diurnal variations in the measurement of lung function, advantages of retaining a higher sample size and advice from the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Trial Steering Committee, and decided to include these participants in primary analysis. We planned and reported analyses including and excluding these participants, and in our case the interpretation of treatment effect was consistent. CONCLUSION: The decision, by senior investigators, on whether to exclude enrolled participants, should reflect issues of safety, treatment efficacy, statistical power and measurement error. As long as decisions are made prior to finalising the statistical analysis plan for the trial, the risk of exclusions creating bias should be minimal. The decision taken should be transparently reported and a sensitivity analysis can present the opposite decision.","output":"Exclusion of enrolled participants in randomised controlled trials: what to do with ineligible participants?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Misalignment between lifestyle behaviors and endogenous circadian rhythms is associated with elevated nocturnal blood pressure (BP) in experimental studies; however, less is known about free-living (i.e. nonlaboratory) circadian disruption and nocturnal BP. Additionally, sex-specific cardiovascular implications of circadian disruption are unclear. OBJECTIVE To examine the associations between rest--activity rhythms (RAR), a field-based estimate of circadian disruption, and nocturnal BP characteristics in male and female young adults. METHODS Fifty participants (20  1 years; 20 men/30 women) underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring following 14 days of wrist actigraphy. RAR variables of interdaily stability (day-to-day consistency in RAR), intradaily variability (within-day fragmentation of RAR), and relative amplitude (difference between peak vs. trough activity) were derived from actigraphy. Multivariable regression models of mean nocturnal SBP, DBP, and SBP dipping were generated to test main associations with RAR variables, and sex  RAR interactions. Daytime BP, race, BMI, physical activity, sleep duration, alcohol, caffeine, and sodium intake were considered as covariates. RESULTS In the full sample, no main associations between RAR and nocturnal BP characteristics were found. Sex interacted with RAR such that in women, higher interdaily stability ( = -5.39, 95% CI = -10.04 to -0.73, P = 0.024) and relative amplitude ( = -4.78, 95% CI = -9.22 to -0.34, P = 0.036) were both associated with lower nocturnal SBP. Sex-stratified multivariable models of nocturnal BP also revealed associations between interdaily stability and relative amplitude with SBP dipping in women (all P  0.01). No associations were apparent in men.

Complication rates, operative closure time, length of hospitalisation and costs were evaluated. The study cohort (group A) of 20 consecutive patients reconstructed using barbed stitches for suturing was prospectively compared to a control cohort (group B) of 20 consecutive patients reconstructed using conventional vicryl stitches. All patients were affected by squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and underwent different types of glossectomy and reconstruction with free flaps. This analysis demonstrates the efficacy of the barbed suture compared with a standard monofilament stitch in terms of lower complication rate (15% group A, 30% group B), intra-operative closure times (486 minutes group A, 517 minutes group B), and length of hospitalisation (average length of hospitalisation 14.60 days group A, 16.85 days group B). These factors coupled with the use of a lower number of stitches compared with the standard stitches may compensate the increased cost of the barbed suture. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the use of unidirectional barbed stitches for suturing of a free flap to the recipient site reduces the complication rate, principally in terms of dehiscence and fistula incidence, and reduces intra-operative time and length of hospitalisation. Based on these results and on the literature, the use of unidirectional barbed stitches can be considered as a safe and efficient alternative to conventional stitches for suturing of free flaps to local tissue.","output":"Barbed suture in oral cavity reconstruction: preliminary results."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Appendicitis is common and delayed presentation results in complicated appendicitis with increased morbidity. This study investigates the effect of the Movement Control Order (MCO) during the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and severity of appendicitis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study including 193 patients diagnosed with appendicitis was conducted at four hospitals in Pahang, Malaysia. Those who presented between 1 February 2020 and 17 March 2020 were included in the pre-MCO group and those between 18 March 2020 and 30 April 2020 in the MCO group. The definitions of simple and complicated appendicitis were based on the Sunshine Appendicitis Grading Score. The primary outcome was the incidence of complicated appendicitis, and the secondary outcomes were length of stay, a composite of surgical morbidities and a composite of organ failure. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients in the pre-MCO group and 88 in the MCO group were analysed. The incidence of complicated appendicitis was 33% and it was higher in the MCO than in the pre-MCO group (44% versus 23%, P = 0.002). The MCO period was independently associated with complicated appendicitis in the logistic regression (P = 0.001). It was also associated with prolonged length of stay (3.5 days versus 2.4 days, P < 0.001) and higher overall surgical morbidity (19% versus 5%, P = 0.002).

A possible link between community and suicide is social capital imprinted in social connectedness.

A total of 908 participants were included to assess cross-sectional association of social capital at individual level with suicide ideation by comparing between poor (government-leased apartments) and non-poor communities (nongovernment-leased apartments). Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine various social capital dimensions in relation to suicide ideation. Suicide ideation was far higher among those living in the poor communities (poor communities 12%; non poor communities 6.3%) and the level of social capital was lower in the poor communities. Nevertheless, the protective effect of social capital, in particular, the cognitive dimension against suicide ideation was demonstrated only in the poor communities (eg, odds ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.12C0.58 for trust in the poor communities). Low income was significantly associated with suicide ideation only in the poor communities, but depression and resilience were associated with suicide ideation both in the poor and non-poor communities. To increase the reliability of the results, established measures based on relevant literature were utilized, but measures on bridging social capital and social network might have relatively low reliability. As to protection against suicide ideation, the extent of reliance on social capital was higher in poor communities than in non-poor communities, in particular, the cognitive dimension was likely to activate in this regard.","output":"Small but protective social capital against suicide ideation in poor communities: A community-based cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presented unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems worldwide.

Optimal progress toward ending the HIV epidemic requires strategies that will interrupt transmission pathways in hotspot locations like Harris County, TX. Researchers are calling for public health interventions that can prevent HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) transmission; thus, we launched the first video log (vlog)-based, pilot HIV prevention intervention. METHODS: In a prospective. randomized controlled trial of two educational intervention strategies delivered as vlogs eligible participants were randomized to either 1) an interactive gaming, education-based strategy, or 2) a storytelling, education-based strategy. Eligible participants were cisgender Black women being seen in the emergency department (ED) for a non-emergent condition who reported recent condomless heterosexual sex, were ages 18C45, and had social media access. Enrolled women completed a screening assessment, informed consent, randomization, and 10-item pre-and-post assessments with true/false statements before and after viewing a brief vlog on a tablet device to identify changes in knowledge before and after being educated on HIV/STI transmission. RESULTS: Twenty-six women were randomized to the Taboo group, an interactive gaming, education-based strategy, (14 [53.8%]), or to storytelling, an education-based strategy using non-fictional and fictional case scenarios (12 [46.2%]). Taboo participants self-identified as African-American (12 [85.7%]), Black (1 [7.1%]) or other (1 [7.1%]), were younger (28.6% were  30 years), single (57.1%), reported a previous STI (8 [57.1%]), and were likely employed (57.2%). Storytelling participants self-identified as African-American (7 [58.3%]) or Black (5 [41.7%]), were older (49.9% were  30 years), in a relationship but not married (50%), and half were unemployed. Highest level of education and monthly income varied. The storytelling strategy increased knowledge in two areas and the Taboo strategy increased knowledge in one. No intervention effect was identified in three areas, and a significant decrease in knowledge (P < .0001) was discerned in eight areas for Taboo and six areas for storytelling.

This new technology has been used during cardiac arrest (CA) because of its ability to give measures in low-blood-flow situations. The aim of this study was to assess the evidence regarding the association between the types of NIRS measurements (mean, initial, and highest values) and resuscitation outcomes (return of spontaneous circulation [ROSC], survival to discharge, and good neurologic outcome) in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS This review was registered (Prospero CRD42015017380) and is reported as per the PRISMA guidelines. Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched. All studies, except case reports and case series of fewer than five patients, reporting on adults that had NIRS monitoring during CA were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers assessed the quality of the included articles and extracted the data. The outcome effect was standardized using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS Twenty nonrandomized observational studies (15 articles and five conference abstracts) were included in this review, for a total of 2,436 patients. We found a stronger association between ROSC and mean NIRS values (SMD = 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.92 to 1.74) than between ROSC and initial NIRS measurements (SMD = 0.51; 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.78). There was too much heterogeneity among the highest NIRS measurements group to perform meta-analysis. Only two of the 75 patients who experienced ROSC had a mean NIRS saturation under 30%. Patients who survived to discharge and who had good neurologic outcome displayed superior combined initial and mean NIRS values than their counterparts (SMD = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.34 to 1.92; and SMD = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.14 to 3.10). CONCLUSIONS Patients with good resuscitation outcomes have significantly higher NIRS saturations during resuscitation than their counterparts. The types of NIRS measurements during resuscitation influenced the association between ROSC and NIRS saturation. Prolonged failure to obtain a NIRS saturation higher than 30% may be included in a multimodal approach to the decision of terminating resuscitation efforts (Class IIb, Level of Evidence C-Limited Data).","output":"Near-infrared Spectroscopy Monitoring During Cardiac Arrest: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Follicular keratosis (FK) is a poorly understood disorder presenting with multiple, grouped hyperkeratotic follicular papules typically affecting the chin or jawline.

In recent years, increasing evidence demonstrates that d-3HB can induce pleiotropic effects on the human body which are highly beneficial for improving physical and metabolic health. Conventional ketogenic diet (KD) or exogenous ketone salts (KS) and esters (KE) have been used to increase serum d-3HB level. However, strict adaptation to the KD was often associated with poor patient compliance, while the ingestion of KS caused gastrointestinal distresses due to excessive consumption of minerals. As for ingestion of KE, subsequent degradation is required before releasing d-3HB for absorption, making these methods somewhat inferior. This review provides novel insights into a biologically synthesized d-3HB (d-3-hydroxybutyric acid) which can induce a faster increase in plasma d-3HB compared to the use of KD, KS, or KE. It also emphasizes on the most recent applications of d-3HB in different fields, including its use in improving exercise performance and in treating metabolic or age-related diseases. Ketones may become a fourth micro-nutrient that is necessary to the human body along with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Indeed, d-3HB being a small molecule with multiple signaling pathways within the body exhibits paramount importance in mitigating metabolic and age-related diseases. Nevertheless, specific doseCresponse relationships and safety margins of using d-3HB remain to be elucidated with more research.

A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between vitamin D serum levels and SO2 (p=0.05), PaO2 (p=0.03), PaO2/FiO2 (p=0.02). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D serum levels and severity of radiologic pulmonary involvement: vitamin D was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with either diffuse/ severe interstitial lung involvement (p=0.05) or multiple lung consolidations (p=0.0001) than in those with mild radiological lung involvement. Significantly lower vitamin D serum levels were found in COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization, compared to those who survived (median 3 vs 8 ng/ml, p=0.05). Finally, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D serum levels and D-dimer (p=0.04), C-reactive protein (p=0.04) and disease duration (p=0.05). Conclusion: This study confirms that severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with more severe lung involvement, longer disease duration and risk of death in elderly COVID-19 patients.","output":"Vitamin d deficiency is mainly associated with severe lung involvement, longer disease duration and risk of death in elderly COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This mixed methods study examined parent\\\\reported child screen media use before and during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic by examining 2019C2020 changes in parent perceptions of media, screen media use (SMU), and problematic media use (PMU) in children aged 2C13 years (N = 129; 64 boys, 64 girls, 1 nonbinary; 90.7% White, 4.6% Hispanic/Latino, 0.8% Black, 8.5% multiethnic; primarily middle\\\\to\\\\high income).

Methods: In this study, twenty-five healthy subjects working in a SARS-COV-2 serodiagnostic assay development project were enrolled, and their sign and symptoms were followed up to six months. Three subjects showed COVID-19-like symptoms, and three subjects' antibody dynamics were followed over 120 days by analyzing 516 samples. We have developed 12 different types of in-house ELISAs to observe the kinetics of IgG, IgM, and IgA against four SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely nucleocapsid, RBD, S1, and whole spike (S1+S2). For the development of these assays, 30-104 pre-pandemic samples were taken as negative controls and 83 RT-qPCR positive samples as positive ones. Results: All three subjects presented COVID-19-like symptoms twice, with mild symptoms in the first episode were severe in the second, and RT-qPCR confirmed the latter. The initial episode did not culminate with any significant antibody development, while a multifold increase in IgG antibodies characterized the second episode.

We surveyed oncology stakeholders in order to assess their attitudes pertaining to social media and how it has been affected during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 40-item survey was distributed to stakeholders from 8 July to 22 July 2020 and was promoted through the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the OncoAlert Network. RESULTS: One thousand and seventy-six physicians and stakeholders took part in the survey. In total, 57.3% of respondents were medical oncologists, 50.6% aged <40 years, 50.8% of female gender and mostly practicing in Europe (51.5%). More than 90% of respondents considered social media a useful tool for distributing scientific information and for education. Most used social media to stay up to date on cancer care in general (62.5%) and cancer care during COVID-19 (61%) given the constant flow of information. Respondents also used social media to interact with other oncologists (78.8%) and with patients (34.4%). Overall, 61.1% of respondents were satisfied with the role that social media was playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 41.1% of respondents reported trouble in discriminating between credible and less credible information and 30% stated social networks were a source of stress. For this reason, one-third of respondents reduced its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding meeting attendance, a total of 59.1% of responding physicians preferred in-person meetings to virtual ones, and 51.8% agreed that virtual meetings and social distancing could hamper effective collaboration. CONCLUSION: Social media has a useful role in supporting cancer care and professional engagement in oncology. Although one-third of respondents reported reduced use of social media due to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority found social media useful to keep up to date and were satisfied with the role social media was playing during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 on social media as perceived by the oncology community: results from a survey in collaboration with the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the OncoAlert Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding the properties exhibited by Spatial-temporal evolution of cyber attacks improve cyber threat intelligence.

Novel risk factors, often new to science, were identified, the role and significance of already known factors better comprehended, and occupational groups endangered by biological hazards more thoroughly recognized. Novel viruses and prions, emerging in different parts of the world, may pose a particular threat to health and life of health care workers, agriculture workers and veterinarians. A new coronavirus (SCoV) that evoked a rapid outbreak of disease described as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the first half of 2003 may serve as an example. The disease was particularly common among health care workers. Previously discovered zoonotic viruses, Nipah virus in pigs and Hendra virus in horses, may be a cause of fatal encephalitis in animal farmers. Hantaviruses (Puumala, Hantaan, Sin Nombre and others) infecting field rodents may be a cause of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in farmers and laboratory workers. Prions responsible for inducing a zoonotic variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) are considered to be a potential cause of work-related infections in agricultural and health care workers, however, this assumption has not as yet been supported by any conclusive evidence. In many countries, blood-borne occupational infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major epidemiological problem among health care workers, mostly because no vaccine against this virus has been produced to date. Vaccinations effectively restricted the number of occupational infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and work-related infections with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are very rare. Hazardous bioserosols, occurring in many work environments, pose an occupational health hazard of particular importance. Many new biological factors present in organic dusts that may induce work-related allergic and immunotoxic diseases among farmers and workers of the agricultural and wood industries have been identified. Droplet aerosols, which are generated from water, oils, oil-water emulsions and other liquids in various work environments, may contain infectious agents (Legionella spp.) as well as allergic and/or toxic agents.

Recent research has shown that the chest Xrays of patients suffering from COVID19 depicts certain abnormalities in the radiography. However, those approaches are closed source and not made available to the research community for re-producibility and gaining deeper insight. The goal of this work is to build open source and open access datasets and present an accurate Convolutional Neural Network framework for differentiating COVID19 cases from other pneumonia cases.

Antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is vital but there are limited randomized clinical trial data supporting AMS interventions such as prospective audit and feedback (PAF). High quality data to demonstrate safety and efficacy of AMS PAF in hospitalized COVID-19 patients are needed. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a prospective, multi-center, non-inferiority, pragmatic randomized clinical trial evaluating AMS PAF intervention plus standard of care (SOC) versus SOC alone. We include patients with microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Eligible ward beds and critical care unit beds will be randomized prior to study commencement at each participating site by computer-generated allocation sequence stratified by intensive care unit versus conventional ward in a 1:1 fashion. PAF intervention consists of real time review of antibacterial prescriptions and immediate written and verbal feedback to attending teams, performed by site-based AMS teams comprised of an AMS pharmacist and physician. The primary outcome is clinical status at post-admission day 15 measured using a 7-point ordinal scale. Patients will be followed for secondary outcomes out to 30 days. A total of 530 patients are needed to show a statistically significant non-inferiority, with 80% power and 2.5% one-sided alpha assuming standard deviation of 2 and the non-inferiority margin of 0.5. DISCUSSION: This study protocol presents a pragmatic clinical trial design with small unit cluster randomization for AMS intervention in hospitalized COVID-19 that will provide high-level evidence and may be adopted in other clinical situations.

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms connecting these GI symptoms to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections remain elusive. Previous studies indicate that the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into intestinal cells leads to downregulation of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors resulting in impaired barrier function. While intestinal ACE2 functions as a chaperone for the amino acid transporter B0AT1, the B0AT1/ACE2 complex within the intestinal epithelium acts as a regulator of gut microbiota composition and function. Alternations to the B0AT1/ACE2 complex lead to microbial dysbiosis through increased local and systemic immune responses. Previous studies have also suggested that altered serotonin metabolism may be the underlying cause of GI disorders involving diarrhea. The findings of elevated plasma serotonin levels and high fecal calprotectin in COVID-19 patients with diarrhea indicate that the viral infection evokes a systemic inflammatory response that specifically involves the GI. Interestingly, the elevated proinflammatory cytokines correlate with elevated serotonin and fecal calprotectin levels further supporting the evidence of GI inflammation, a hallmark of functional GI disorders. Moreover, the finding that rectal swabs of COVID-19 patients remain positive for SARS-CoV-2 even after the nasopharynx clears the virus, suggests that viral replication and shedding from the GI tract may be more robust than that of the respiratory tract, further indicating fecal-oral transmission as another important route of viral spread.

The present review focuses on applying cheminformatics strategies to characterize, prioritize, and optimize NPs to develop new lead compounds against antimicrobial resistance pathogens. Moreover, case studies where these strategies have been used to identify potential drug candidates, including a few selected open-access tools commonly used for these studies, are briefly outlined.","output":"Cheminformatic Characterization of Natural Antimicrobial Products for the Development of New Lead Compounds"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The low sensitivity and false-negative results of nucleic acid testing greatly affect its performance in diagnosing and discharging patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Chest computed tomography (CT)-based evaluation of pneumonia may indicate a need for isolation. Therefore, this radiologic modality plays an important role in managing patients with suspected COVID-19. Meanwhile, deep learning (DL) technology has been successful in detecting various imaging features of chest CT. This study applied a novel DL technique to standardize the discharge criteria of COVID-19 patients with consecutive negative respiratory pathogen nucleic acid test results at a square cabin hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DL was used to evaluate the chest CT scans of 270 hospitalized COVID-19 patients who had two consecutive negative nucleic acid tests (sampling interval >1 day). The CT scans evaluated were obtained after the patients second negative test result. The standard criterion determined by DL for patient discharge was a total volume ratio of lesion to lung <50%. RESULTS: The mean number of days between hospitalization and DL was 14.3 ( 2.4). The average intersection over union was 0.7894. Two hundred and thirteen (78.9%) patients exhibited pneumonia, of whom 54.0% (115/213) had mild interstitial fibrosis. Twenty-one, 33, and 4 cases exhibited vascular enlargement, pleural thickening, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, respectively. Of the latter, 18.8% (40/213) had a total volume ratio of lesions to lung 50% according to our severity scale and were monitored continuously in the hospital. Three cases had a positive follow-up nucleic acid test during hospitalization. None of the 230 discharged cases later tested positive or exhibited pneumonia progression. CONCLUSION: The novel DL enables the accurate management of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and can help avoid cluster transmission or exacerbation in patients with false-negative acid test.","output":"Novel Deep Learning Technique Used in Management and Discharge of Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"GRANDMA is a network of 25 telescopes of different sizes, including both photometric and spectroscopic facilities. The network aims to coordinate follow-up observations of gravitational-wave candidate alerts, especially those with large localisation uncertainties, to reduce the delay between the initial detection and the optical confirmation. In this paper, we detail GRANDMA's observational performance during Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo Observing Run 3 (O3), focusing on the second part of O3; this includes summary statistics pertaining to coverage and possible astrophysical origin of the candidates. To do so, we quantify our observation efficiency in terms of delay between gravitational-wave candidate trigger time, observations, and the total coverage. Using an optimised and robust coordination system, GRANDMA followed-up about 90 % of the gravitational-wave candidate alerts, i.e. 49 out of 56 candidates. This led to coverage of over 9000 deg2 during O3. The delay between the gravitational-wave candidate trigger and the first observation was below 1.5 hour for 50 % of the alerts. We did not detect any electromagnetic counterparts to the gravitational-wave candidates during O3, likely due to the very large localisation areas (on average thousands of degrees squares) and relatively large distance of the candidates (above 200 Mpc for 60 % of BNS candidates). We derive constraints on potential kilonova properties for two potential binary neutron star coalescences (GW190425 and S200213t), assuming that the events' locations were imaged.","output":"GRANDMA Observations of Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's Third Observational Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals with underlying chronic skin conditions, notably atopic dermatitis (AD), are disproportionately affected by infections from members of the herpesviridae, papovaviridae, and poxviridae families. Many patients with AD experience recurrent, widespread cutaneous viral infections that can lead to viremia, serious organ complications, and even death. Little is known about how the type 2 inflammatory environment observed in the skin of AD patients impacts the susceptibility of epidermal cells (keratinocytes) to viral pathogens. Herein, we studied the susceptibility of keratinocytes to the prototypical poxvirus, vaccinia virus (VV)-the causative agent of eczema vaccinatum-under conditions that simulate the epidermal environment observed in AD. Treatment of keratinocytes with type 2 cytokines (IL-4 and -13) to simulate the inflammatory environment or a tight junction disrupting peptide to mirror the barrier disruption observed in AD patients, resulted in a differentiation-dependent increase in susceptibility to VV. Furthermore, pan JAK inhibition was able to diminish the VV susceptibility occurring in keratinocytes exposed to type 2 cytokines. We propose that in AD, the increased viral susceptibility of keratinocytes leads to enhanced virus production in the skin, which contributes to the rampant dissemination and pathology seen within patients.","output":"Conditions That Simulate the Environment of Atopic Dermatitis Enhance Susceptibility of Human Keratinocytes to Vaccinia Virus."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media use has spiked around the world during the COVID-19 global pandemic as people reach out for news, information, social connections, and support in their daily lives.

To achieve its own replication and spread, it simultaneously depends on and subverts cellular mechanisms. At the early stage of infection, SARS-CoV-2 expresses the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), which inhibits host translation by blocking the mRNA entry tunnel on the ribosome; this interferes with the binding of cellular mRNAs to the ribosome. Viral mRNAs, on the other hand, overcome this blockade. We show that NSP1 enhances expression of mRNAs containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader. The first stem-loop (SL1) in viral leader is both necessary and sufficient for this enhancement mechanism. Our analysis pinpoints specific residues within SL1 (three cytosine residues at the positions 15, 19 and 20) and another within NSP1 (R124) which are required for viral evasion, and thus might present promising drug targets. Additionally, we carried out analysis of a functional interactome of NSP1 using BioID and identified components of anti-viral defense pathways. Our analysis therefore suggests a mechanism by which NSP1 inhibits the expression of host genes while enhancing that of viral RNA. This analysis helps reconcile conflicting reports in the literature regarding the mechanisms by which the virus avoids NSP1 silencing.","output":"The key features of SARS-CoV-2 leader and NSP1 required for viral escape of NSP1-mediated repression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Stroke survivors receive considerable rehabilitation efforts as inpatients, but one-on-one therapy decreases after discharge. The gap between the amount of required therapy and the lack of its availability in this phase of care may be partly overcome by self-practice. However, patient's adherence to prescribed programs is often low. While single studies have examined factors affecting adherence in this specific case, they have not been reviewed and synthesised previously. METHODS: A thematic synthesis of qualitative studies explored factors affecting stroke survivors' adherence to prescribed, recovery-oriented self-practice. Five databases were systematically searched for references: Medline, Psycinfo, CINAHL, Embase, and ASSIA. Quality assessment was undertaken using the CASP tool. RESULTS: From 1308 references, 68 potential papers were read in full, and 12 were included in the review. An overarching theme was identified as: \\"Tailoring and personalization rather than standardization.\\" It was informed by the following three analytical themes: \\"The meaning of 'self' in self-practice,\\" \\"Identifying self-practice as a team effort,\\" and \\"Self-practice that is grounded in one's reality.\\" CONCLUSION: To have a positive effect on adherence to self-practice, clinicians are advised to spend time learning about each individual's life circumstances, so they can tailor proposed exercise programs to patients' personal situations, preferences, and needs.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe topic of patient's adherence to self-practice of prescribed exercise is a common concern, often voiced by frustrated rehabilitation health professionals. Bridging the gap between the patient's needs for post-discharge intensive therapy and the inability of healthcare systems to provide it could be filled partly by self-practice.Adherence to self-practice has become even more essential since the COVID 19 pandemic and the decrease in face-to-face delivery of rehabilitation due to social distancing requirements.Adherence to exercise is a broad topic. Reasons for poor adherence differ between patient populations and the exercises they are prescribed. This study focuses on post-discharge stroke survivors' adherence to recovery targeted exercise that could be described as repetitive and less physically demanding movements and functions.Reviewed studies were qualitative and usually included a relatively small number of participants within a specific context. Using thematic synthesis, we combined these small pieces of the puzzle into a larger picture, to produce recommendations that could be drawn on by clinicians to improve self-practice adherence.","output":"Understanding the facilitators and barriers of stroke survivors' adherence to recovery-oriented self-practice: a thematic synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This year marked a number of milestones in critical care.

METHODS: This is a case-control study in women with and without gestational hypertensive disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR during pregnancy. Patients were matched by gestational age at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. We performed an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in placenta. RESULTS: A total of 28 women were enrolled. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester and the remaining 12 patients in the other trimesters.

There were significant differences between the 2 periods regarding the number of hospitalized patients, the number of patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery, and the total number of surgeries performed. Due to the restrictions imposed, there was an increase in the average monthly mortality rate and a decrease in the average length of hospital stay. Covid-19 pandemic led to a severe activity restriction of the surgery clinics due to the restrictions imposed by the authorities and the reorganization of the clinics to comply with the epidemiological requirements. Also, the limitation of patients' access to surgical treatment and their fear of coming in contact with the hospital environment led to their presentation in more advanced stages of the disease, with more severe symptoms and a higher mortality rate during the pandemic.","output":"Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on a general surgery clinic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global financial crisis of just over a decade ago exposed longer-term systemic problems in global capitalism of which two of the most prominent are the slowdown in the underlying trend rate of productivity growth, alongside a rise in economic and spatial inequalities in many advanced economies. The Covid-19 pandemic looks set to further amplify these problems. This Editorial begins by discussing the scale of the productivity slowdown and of the widening inequalities that have emerged, particularly with regard to their spatial dimension: that is how the uneven and slow development of productivity and rise in inequalities have played out across and within regions and cities. It then briefly considers underlying factors that lie behind these trends, including financialisation / financial globalization, the diminishing role of organised labour, segmentation of the labour market favouring workers who play a key role in financialisation, together with the increasing polarisation within societies according to skill and, crucially, the impact of changing industrial composition particularly as it relates to the rise of the high-tech sectors. The Editorial then examines in what ways the slowdown of productivity and widening of economic and spatial inequalities, may be interrelated, and questions the notion of any efficiency-equity trade-off. Lastly, it considers whether the inclusive growth agenda can potentially reconcile the two ambitions of improving productivity performance and lessening inequalities, reflecting on what inclusive growth could mean, and what it could imply in terms of policy. Thus far, it appears that an inclusive growth agenda has only gained some traction at the subnational level, which seems to reflect C at least in part C attempts by cities and regions to address gaps in policy left by national governments.","output":"Rethinking the political economy of place: challenges of productivity and inclusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"All known recently emerged human coronaviruses likely originated in bats Here, we used a single experimental platform based on human lung-only mice (LoM) to demonstrate efficient in vivo replication of all recently emerged human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) and two highly relevant endogenous pre-pandemic SARS-like bat coronaviruses Virus replication in this model occurs in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the virus or the host Our results indicate that bats harbor endogenous coronaviruses capable of direct transmission into humans Further detailed analysis of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in vivo infection of LoM human lung tissue showed predominant infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type II pneumocytes present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection was highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained Type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response Finally, we evaluated a pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for coronavirus infection Our results show that prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801, an oral broad spectrum antiviral currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19, dramatically prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and thus has significant potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19","output":"Acute SARS-CoV-2 Infection is Highly Cytopathic, Elicits a Robust Innate Immune Response and is Efficiently Prevented by EIDD-2801"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: Atherosclerosis has been reported as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population. As a phenotype of atherosclerosis, carotid plaque and its influence factors are rarely discussed among dialysis patients. The study aimed to investigate the prognosis-predictive significance of carotid plaques in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and explore risks factors for carotid plaque-presence. METHODS: It was an observational, prospective study. Patients that had undergone stable peritoneal dialysis for at least 3 months were recruited and divided into two subgroups: group with carotid plaques and group without carotid plaques. Cox regression model was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Pathogenic factors correlated to the plaque-occurrence were explored by logistic regression and verified by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: A total of 233 PD patients were recruited. The cohort was followed for up to 86 months. The carotid plaque-presence turned out to be an independent risk factor both of cardiovascular events (HR:2.659; 95%CI: 1.231-5.741; p=0.013) and cardiovascular mortality (HR:3.716; 95%CI: 1.168-11.823; p=0.026). The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 (ApoB/ApoA1) ratio was significantly associated with the presence of carotid plaques. ROC analysis indicated that the AUC of the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was higher than that of the traditional lipid metabolism index for detecting plaque-presence. CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque-presence can predict cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in PD patients. The ApoB/ApoA1 ratio is significantly correlated to the carotid plaques and the ApoB/ApoA1 ratio had a greater sensitivity than traditional lipid indices for predicting plaque presence.","output":"Prognostic significance of carotid plaque-presence in peritoneal dialysis patients and its association with the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, undocumented immigrants in the United States were vulnerable both to unemployment and to COVID-19 infection if they did remain employed, because of the sectors that employ them.

As microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a major driver of neurodegeneration, here we interrogated whether SARS-CoV-2 can promote microglial NLRP3 inflammasome activation utilising a model of human monocyte-derived microglia. We identified that SARS-CoV-2 isolates can bind and enter microglia, triggering inflammasome activation in the absence of viral replication. Mechanistically, microglial NLRP3 could be both primed and activated with SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in a NF-{kappa}B and ACE2-dependent manner. Notably, virus- and spike protein-mediated inflammasome activation in microglia was significantly enhanced in the presence of -synuclein fibrils, which was entirely ablated by NLRP3-inhibition. These results support a possible mechanism of microglia activation by SARS-CoV-2, which could explain the increased vulnerability to developing neurological symptoms akin to Parkinsons disease in certain COVID-19 infected individuals, and a potential therapeutic avenue for intervention. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) principally affects the lungs, however there is evidence that the virus can also reach the brain and lead to chronic neurological symptoms. In this study, we examined the interaction SARS-CoV-2 with brain immune cells, by using an ex-vivo model of human monocyte-derived microglia. We identified robust activation of the innate immune sensor complex, NLRP3 inflammasome, in cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2. This was dependent on spike protein-ACE2 receptor interaction and was potentiated in the presence of -synuclein. We therefore identify a possible mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 and increased vulnerability to developing neurological dysfunction. These findings support a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 driven neurological manifestations, through use of NLRP3 inflammasome or ACE2 inhibitors.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 drives NLRP3 inflammasome activation in human microglia through spike-ACE2 receptor interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and disability worldwide.

However, what determines whether early metastasis of choriocarcinoma has occurred is unknown. The emerging role of miRNA in regulating cancer development and progression has been recognized. miR-373 has been shown to play pivotal roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, whether miR-373 functions to promote choriocarcinoma metastasis is not clear. The purpose of this study is to determine the function of miR-373-3p in the progression of this cancer. METHODS: In this study, we first compared epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, which were inversely correlated with miR-373-3p expression in trophoblast and choriocarcinoma cell lines. Using PCR and Western blot, upregulation of miR-373-3p was observed to inhibit EMT progression. Similarly, gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that ectopic miR-373-3p overexpression inhibited the migration by transwell methods of choriocarcinoma cells. RESULTS: Our results revealed that miR-373-3p acted as an EMT inhibitor in JEG-3 and JAR cells; this was due to its mediation of the transforming growth factor-? (TGF?) signaling pathway, which was responsible for EMT. miRNA microarray analysis demonstrated that miR-373-3p interacted with the 3' untranslated region of TGF?R2 mRNA, and then Western blot and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays verified this interaction.

These multi-country production processes are known as global value chains (GVCs). While it is generally accepted that GVCs increase productivity, by allowing producers to reap the gains from their individual comparative advantage, there is disagreement on the effects they have on macroeconomic volatility. In particular, some have argued that GVCs are a double-edged sword: they increase productivity, but also increase volatility. In this paper, we show that the relationship between GVC integration and volatility is ambiguous in theory, and insignificant in the data. This supports our headline conclusion that there is no compelling reason to fear the double-edged sword: a blanket reduction in GVC integration would impose economic costs without necessarily, or significantly, reducing economic volatility. Another feature of todays GVCs is their concentration around a few central hubs. This has led to a discussion of alternative industrial policies that can reshape GVCs in the longer-run, in particular re-shoring and diversification. Within our model, policies to re-shore production lead to an increase in aggregate volatility, as they effectively increase the concentration of value chains on domestic sources. On the other hand, diversification of GVCs among foreign suppliers can lower volatility, by lowering the exposure to any single country. Finally, while the debate around the effects of trade on business-cycle volatility pre-dates the Covid-19 pandemic, recent events have increased the broader discussion of safe trade openness. We discuss the scope for policy actions to make trade safe and open, drawing out an analogy with the financial sector reforms enacted following the global financial crisis.

The development of early diagnosis and disease severity prediction methods can reduce the burden on the health care system and increase the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation of patients with severe cases. This study aims to develop and validate an ensemble machine-learning model based on clinical and immunological features for severity risk assessment and post-COVID rehabilitation duration for SARS-CoV-2 patients. The dataset consisting of 35 features and 122 instances was collected from Lviv regional rehabilitation center. The dataset contains age, gender, weight, height, BMI, CAT, 6-minute walking test, pulse, external respiration function, oxygen saturation, and 15 immunological markers used to predict the relationship between disease duration and biomarkers using the machine learning approach. The predictions are assessed through an area under the receiver-operating curve, classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score performance metrics.

We evaluated how different nonpharmaceutical interventions could be used to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and reduce the burden on the health care system. METHODS: We used an age-structured compartmental model of COVID-19 transmission in the population of Ontario, Canada. We compared a base case with limited testing, isolation and quarantine to scenarios with the following: enhanced case finding, restrictive physical-distancing measures, or a combination of enhanced case finding and less restrictive physical distancing. Interventions were either implemented for fixed durations or dynamically cycled on and off, based on projected occupancy of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We present medians and credible intervals from 100 replicates per scenario using a 2-year time horizon. RESULTS: We estimated that 56% (95% credible interval 42%-63%) of the Ontario population would be infected over the course of the epidemic in the base case. At the epidemic peak, we projected 107 000 (95% credible interval 60 760-149 000) cases in hospital (non-ICU) and 55 500 (95% credible interval 32 700-75 200) cases in ICU. For fixed-duration scenarios, all interventions were projected to delay and reduce the height of the epidemic peak relative to the base case, with restrictive physical distancing estimated to have the greatest effect. Longer duration interventions were more effective. Dynamic interventions were projected to reduce the proportion of the population infected at the end of the 2-year period and could reduce the median number of cases in ICU below current estimates of Ontario's ICU capacity. INTERPRETATION: Without substantial physical distancing or a combination of moderate physical distancing with enhanced case finding, we project that ICU resources would be overwhelmed.

RESULTS A total of 375 patients were included in the final analysis of whom 35 (9%) developed moderate-severe AKI within 12 hours. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for [TIMP-2]?[IGFBP7] alone was 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.90; p < 0.0001). Biomarker performance was robust in sensitivity analysis across predefined subgroups (urgency and type of surgery). CONCLUSION For postoperative surgical intensive care unit patients, a single urinary TIMP2?IGFBP7 test accurately identified patients at risk for developing AKI within the ensuing 12 hours and its inclusion in clinical risk prediction models significantly enhances their performance.

How transformative are our fundamental textbook bases to offer the new knowledge that the digital economy imposes? Bearing in mind previous questions, the aim of this paper is to highlight the gap that exists between economic theory and economic practice in terms of insufficient theoretical scope of the digital economy (DE) and its study, and DEs increasing participation in global practice as an economy based on innovation and new technologies. In the analysis, the authors concentrate on two levels: (1) they analyse the specifics of DE and in that context, they evaluate the applicability of traditional economic theory;(2) they review the representation of DE in university textbooks. Based on the results, the authors conclude that DE possesses specific attributes, and it is necessary to include these as mandatory lessons in university textbooks on the level of basic studies. They suggest some areas for which economic theory should be better explained and supplemented in future research (proposing appropriate guidelines for future efforts in theoretical work). Moreover, through a systematic literature review, the authors approach 90 basic university textbooks in economics and by analysing their content, they prove that DE is not sufficiently represented in them. The results of the paper suggest that economics textbooks, and thus the curricula of basic studies, should be supplemented with chapters on the digital economy, which will affect the modernization and adequacy of theory with practice.","output":"Is Economic Theory, Presented in Basic Academic Textbooks, Applicable to the Digital Economy?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 has had a profound effect on mental health. Liaison psychiatry teams assess and treat people in mental health crises in emergency departments (EDs) and on hospital wards. During the first pandemic wave, new Mental Health Crisis Assessment Services (MHCAS) were created to divert people away from EDs. Our objective was to describe patterns in referrals to psychiatric liaison services across the North Central London care sector (NCL) and explore the impact of a new MHCAS. METHODS: Retrospective study using routinely collected data (ED and ward referrals) from five liaison psychiatry services across NCL (total population 1.5 million people). We described referrals (per week and month) by individual liaison services and cross-sector, and patterns of activity (January 1st 2020 -September 31st 2020, weeks 1C39) compared with the same period in 2019. We calculated changes in the proportion of ED attendees (all-cause) referred to liaison psychiatry. RESULTS: From 2019C2020, total referrals decreased by 16.5% (12,265 to 10,247), a 16.4% decrease in ED referrals (9528 to 7965) and 16.6% decrease in ward referrals (2737 to 2282). There was a marked decrease in referrals during the first pandemic wave (March/April 2020), which increased after lockdown ended. The proportion of ED attendees referred to liaison psychiatry services increased compared to 2019. CONCLUSIONS: People in mental health crisis continued to seek help via ED/MHCAS and a higher proportion of people attending ED were referred to liaison psychiatry services just after the first pandemic wave.

Both the natural course of the disease and the treatment drugs used have effects on ventricular repolarization. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of repolarization parameters obtained from surface electrocardiography (ECG) on prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS Participants were 205 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 diagnosis. The 12-lead surface ECG was obtained from each patient on admission. The ECG results were evaluated against the patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes by experienced cardiology specialists. RESULTS The mean age was higher in the non-survivor group compared to the survivor group (57.4  15.7 vs. 65.6  16.6; p = 0.001). The demographical characteristics were similar between the survivor and non-survivor groups. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that age (OR: 1.041; p = 0.009), D-dimer (OR: 1.002; p = 0.031), high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) (OR: 1.010; p = 0.041), pneumonia on computed tomography (CT) (OR: 4.985; p < 0.001), the peak-to-end interval of the T wave (Tp-e) (OR: 3.421; p < 0.001), and Tp-e/QTc ratio (OR: 1.978; p = 0.013) were statistically significant independent predictors in terms of determining mortality.

METHODS: We obtained and analyzed anonymized data on psychiatric admissions (n = 4550) from 12 general hospital psychiatric wards (GHPWs) in different Italian regions (catchment area = 3.71 millions of inhabitants). Using a mixed-effects Poisson regression model, we compared admission characteristics across three periods: (a) March 1CJune 30, 2018 and 2019; (b) March 1CApril 30, 2020 (i.e., lockdown); and (c) May 1CJune 30, 2020 (i.e., post-lockdown). RESULTS: During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 41% reduction (IRR = 0.59; p < 0.001, CI: 0.45C0.79) in psychiatric admissions in the enrolled GHPWs with respect to the 2018 and 2019 control period. Conversely, admission rates in the post-lockdown period were similar to those observed in the control period. Notably, a consistent and significant reduction in psychiatric hospitalizations of older patients (aged >65 years) was observed in the lockdown (40%; IRR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.44C0.82) and post-lockdown (28%; IRR = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.54C0.96) periods. Long-stay admissions (>14 days) increased (63%; IRR = 1.63; 95% CI: 1.32C2.02) during the lockdown and decreased by 39% thereafter (IRR = 0.61; 95% CI: 0.49C0.75). A significant 35% increase in patients reporting suicidal ideation was observed in the post-lockdown period, compared to the rate observed in the 2018 and 2019 control period (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.01C1.79). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 lockdown was associated with changes in the number of psychiatric admissions, particularly for older patients and long-stay hospitalizations. Increased admission of patients reporting suicidal ideation in the post-lockdown period merits special attention.

However, they are tested for certification using a variety of standardized test methods, creating challenges for the comparison of differently certified products. We have performed systematic experiments to quantify and understand the differences between standardized test methods for N95 respirators (NIOSH TEB-APR-STP-0059 under US 42 CFR 84), medical face masks (ASTM F2299/F2100), and COVID-19-related barrier face coverings (ASTM F3502-21). Our experiments demonstrate the role of face velocity, particle properties (mean size, size variability, electric charge, density, and shape), measurement techniques, and environmental preconditioning. The measured filtration efficiency was most sensitive to changes in face velocity and particle charge. Relative to the NIOSH method, users of the ASTM F2299/F2100 method have commonly used non-neutralized (highly charged) aerosols as well as smaller face velocities, each of which may result in approximately 10% higher measured filtration efficiencies. In the NIOSH method, environmental conditioning at elevated humidity increased filtration efficiency in some commercial samples while decreasing it in others, indicating that measurement should be performed both with and without conditioning. More generally, our results provide an experimental basis for the comparison of respirators certified under various international methods, including FFP2, KN95, P2, Korea 1st Class, and DS2.","output":"Systematic experimental comparison of particle filtration efficiency test methods for commercial respirators and face masks (preprint)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionNon-communicable diseases (NCDs) are still a major public health problem in Indonesia.

However, it is unclear whether NCD risk factors are also risks for new COVID-19 infection. This study aimed to obtain the NCD risk profiles among universitys employees and its association with COVID-19 infection. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2021. Participants were administrative employees of Universitas Indonesia (UI), Depok City, West Java. Assessment of NCDs risk factors was based on the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance (WHO STEPS). Demographics, working and medical history data were obtained electronically by using a Google Form. Physical and laboratory examination were done in the Integrated Post for NCDs. Risks were expressed as adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) and 95% confidence interval (CI) in multivariate analyses. ResultsA total of 613 employees were enrolled. Men were predominant (54.8%) and about 36% of them work in shift as security personnel. About 66.7% were overweight or obese and 77.8% had hypertension. There were 138 (22.8%) employees who had COVID-19 infection. Nearly all (95.6%) have completed COVID-19 vaccination. At-risk waist circumference (ORadj 1.74, 95% CI 1.17-2.60, p=0.007) and total cholesterol level of 200-239 mg/dL (ORadj 2.24, 95% CI 1.15-4.33, p=0.017) were independent risk factors, but shift work (ORadj 0.54, 95% CI 0.24-0.84, p=0.006) was protective to COVID-19 infection. ConclusionThe prevalence of NCDs risk factors among university administrative employees was high, increasing the risk for COVID-19 infection.

Extensive efforts have been made in the past decade to elucidate the relationship between resource allocation and phenotypic patterns of microorganisms. Despite these exciting developments, there is still a lack of explicit comparison between potentially competing propositions and a lack of synthesis of inter-related proposals and findings. RESULTS: In this work, we have reviewed resource allocation-derived principles, hypotheses and mathematical models to recapitulate important achievements in this area. In particular, the emergence of resource allocation phenomena is deciphered by the putative tug of war between the cellular objectives, demands and the supply capability. Competing hypotheses for explaining the most-studied phenomenon arising from resource allocation, i.e. the overflow metabolism, have been re-examined towards uncovering the potential physiological root cause. The possible link between proteome fractions and the partition of the ribosomal machinery has been analysed through mathematical derivations. Finally, open questions are highlighted and an outlook on the practical applications is provided. It is the authors' intention that this review contributes to a clearer understanding of the role of resource allocation in resolving bacterial growth strategies, one of the central questions in microbiology. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the importance of resource allocation in understanding various aspects of cellular systems. Several important questions such as the physiological root cause of overflow metabolism and the correct interpretation of 'protein costs' are shown to remain open. As the understanding of the mechanisms and utility of resource application in cellular systems further develops, we anticipate that mathematical modelling tools incorporating resource allocation will facilitate the circuit-host design in synthetic biology.","output":"Understanding and mathematical modelling of cellular resource allocation in microorganisms: a comparative synthesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is no standardized or validated definition or measure of \\"child-appeal\\" used in food and beverage marketing policy or research, which can result in heterogeneous outcomes.

To date, it is still not clear whether cerebrovascular manifestations are caused by direct viral action or indirect action mediated by inflammatory hyperactivation, and in some cases, the association may be casual rather than causal. Objective: To conduct a systematic review on the cerebrovascular events in COVID-19 infection. Evidence review: A comprehensive literature search on PubMed was performed including articles published from January 1, 2020, to July 23, 2020, using a suitable keyword strategy. Additional sources were added by the authors by reviewing related references. The systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Only articles reporting individual data on stroke mechanism and etiology, sex, age, past cardiovascular risk factors, COVID symptoms, admission NIHSS, D-dimer levels, and acute stroke treatment were selected for the review. Articles that did not report the clinical description of the cases were excluded. A descriptive statistical analysis of the data collected was performed. Finding: From a total of 1,210 articles published from January 1, 2020, to July 23, 2020, 80 articles (275 patients), which satisfied the abovementioned criteria, were included in this review. A total of 226 cases of ischemic stroke (IS), 35 cases of intracranial bleeding, and 14 cases of CVST were found. Among patients with IS, the mean age was 64.16 14.73 years (range 27C92 years) and 53.5% were male. The mean NIHSS score reported at the onset of stroke was 15.23 9.72 (range 0C40). Primary endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) was performed in 24/168 patients (14.29%), intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) was performed in 17/168 patients (10.12%), and combined IVT+EVT was performed in 11/168 patients (6.55%). According to the reported presence of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (105 patients), 31 patients (29.52%) underwent primary EVT or bridging. Acute intracranial bleeding was reported in 35 patients: 24 patients (68.57%) had intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), 4 patients (11.43%) had non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and the remaining 7 patients (20%) had the simultaneous presence of SAH and ICH.

We exposed IL-6 to hypochlorous acid (HOCl) in vitro at concentrations reported to develop in vivo. After HOCl treatment, binding of IL-6 to IL-6R was reduced in a dose-dependent manner using a bioassay with human cells engineered to provide a luminescence response to signal transduction upon receptor activation. Similar results followed the exposure of IL-6 to N-chlorotaurine (NCT) and hypobromous acid (HOBr), two other reactive species produced in vivo. SDS-PAGE analysis of HOCl-treated IL-6 showed little to no fragmentation or aggregation up to 1.75 mM HOCl, suggesting that the modifications induced at concentrations below 1.75 mM took place on the intact protein.

Since the detection of the first COVID-19 case on 5th March 2020, the Royal Government of Bhutan implemented a number of containment measures including border closure and national lockdowns. Against the backdrop of this global COVID-19 pandemic response, there was a sudden surge of locally-transmitted malaria cases between June to August 2020. There were 20 indigenous cases (zero Plasmodium falciparum and 20 Plasmodium vivax) from a total of 49 cases (seven P. falciparum and 42 P. vivax) in 2020 compared to just two from a total of 42 in 2019. Over 80% of the cases were clustered in malaria endemic district of Sarpang.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to document the change in diet quality and in food insecurity observed during the COVID-19-related early lockdown. We hypothesized that the lockdown was associated with a deterioration in overall diet quality and an increase in food insecurity. METHODS: Data are from a COVID-19 subsample of NutriQubec, a web-based cohort destined to study temporal changes in dietary habits among adults in Quebec, Canada. Participants completed questionnaires before (between June 2019 and February 2020) and during (April to May 2020) early lockdown, including a validated web-based 24-h recall (n = 853) and a questionnaire on food security (n = 922). Primary study outcomes were temporal changes in diet quality measured by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)-2015 and in the prevalence of food insecurity. RESULTS: There was a small increase in the HEI-2015 during the COVID-19 early lockdown compared with baseline (+1.1 points; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.5), mostly due to small improvements in the intakes of whole grains, greens and beans, refined grains, total vegetables, total dairy, seafood and plant proteins, added sugar, and total protein subscores of the HEI-2015. Exploratory analyses suggested that individuals aged 18-29 y (+3.6 points; 95% CI: 2.4, 4.7), participants with lower education (+1.9 points; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.6), or with obesity (+3.8 points; 95% CI: 2.7, 4.8) showed particularly important increases in the HEI-2015. The prevalence of food insecurity was reduced from 3.8% at baseline to 1.0% during the early lockdown (prevalence ratio = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.94). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to our hypotheses, diet quality has slightly improved and prevalence of food insecurity was reduced in this sample of adults from Quebec during the COVID-19-related early lockdown.

Case-based cadaveric MRI visualization and extended reality (XR) technology enhances learning experiences in medicine. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that a virtual, multi-departmental workflow utilizing MRI, XR technology, and a patient group, represented by the John A. Burns School of Medicine (JABSOM) Willed Body Program, supplements case-based learning and promotes student exploration and engagement equally in cross-cultural cohorts represented by American and Turkish medical students. Virtual case-based learning activities were developed and presented to American medical students at JABSOM and Turkish medical students, selected based on education and English proficiency, via Zoom. Subject, medical history, and physical exam data were presented to students who were then divided into breakout rooms where hypotheses regarding cadaveric, neurological findings were generated. Students then reviewed radiology and pathology reports and accessed relevant 3D segmented, photogrammetric and illustrative models. An optional survey was completed to evaluate student opinion based on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons between groups were performed using a non-parametric Mann Whitney U test. Data was reported as mean, median (min-max), and percentile. Significant differences (two-tailed P) less than 0.05 were significant. Results revealed significant differences between American (n=40) and Turkish (n=16) student opinion. The Turkish scale was significantly higher when asked if MRI scans of cadavers were useful as online learning tools (p =0.002), if MRI scans of cadavers provided an understanding of relevant anatomy (p<0.001), if 3D models provided a better understanding of anatomical relationships (p<0.001), whether students would like more interactive sessions using MRI scans (p<0.001), and if students would use similar resources in the future (p<0.001). The American scale was higher when asked if students were able to communicate effectively with their breakout groups (p=0.037). The learning activity was positively received by both cohorts as shown by no average score less than a 4 out of 5 for each question. The American scales may have been lower due to having previous experience with similar activities, whereas the learning activity was novel and exciting to Turkish students. Differences in communicating effectively in breakout rooms can be explained by the fact that American students were broken into longitudinal dissection groups, whereas Turkish students were randomly assigned. Based on these results, case-based learning, utilizing MRI and XR technology, enhances the learning experience of medical students and can be expanded to cross-cultural student populations.","output":"Cross-cultural classroom: Virtual case-based learning utilizing MRI and extendedreality technology delivered to American and Turkish medical students"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the year 2020, a pandemic situation occurs throughout the world with COVID-19.It is a virus which can be transmitted from person to another with cough or sneeze.

METHODS: This was a cross\\\\sectional study of subjects aged 0 to 17 years with JDM enrolled to the CLR from 2010 to 2015. Access to care was measured by calculating the distance from the subject zip code of residence to the treating pediatric rheumatology center and determining the state density of pediatric rheumatologists based on the 2015 American College of Rheumatology Workforce Study. Delay was categorized as early (<30 days), typical (1\\\\3 months), moderate (3\\\\12 months), and severe (>12 months). Ordered generalized additive models were used to determine the association between these measures and diagnostic delays. RESULTS: The median time to diagnosis was 3.1 months; 37.2% of patients experienced moderate delays, and 14.6% experienced severe delays. In a univariate analysis, younger age of disease onset and male sex were associated with delays. Using a generalized additive model accounting for age, sex, race, and ethnicity, increasing distance from treating pediatric rheumatologist and younger age at disease onset were associated with diagnostic delay. There was no association between the state density of rheumatologists and diagnostic delays in this model. CONCLUSION: In the CLR, we found moderate to severe diagnostic delays in the majority of subjects with JDM. Our data suggest that access to care, measured as the distance traveled to treating rheumatologist, is an important factor associated with delays in care but also highlight age as a contributing factor, suggesting that JDM may be less recognizable in young children.","output":"Access to Care and Diagnostic Delays in Juvenile Dermatomyositis: Results From the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance Legacy Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic offers many lessons and reaffirms the value of innovations we had been reluctant to pursue.","output":"A Flower Blooms in the Bitter Soil of the Covid-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in different countries found an increase in anxiety, stress, and an exacerbation of previous mental health problems.

This allows us to evaluate if the production of biofuels in a climate-constrained scenario can co-output biomaterials, being also driven by hydrocarbons/carbohydrates liquid streams made available from the transition to electromobility. The analysis was implemented through the incorporation of a materials module in the Brazilian Land Use and Energy System model. The findings show that bio-based petrochemicals account for 33% of the total petrochemical production in a stringent carbon dioxide mitigation scenario, in 2050. Most of this comes as co-products from facilities that produce advanced fuels as the main product. Moreover, from 2040 mobility electrification leads to the repurpose of ethanol for material production, compensating for the fuel market loss. Finally, the emergence of biorefineries to provide bio-based energy and feedstock reduces petroleum refining utilization in 2050, affecting the production of oil derivatives for energy purposes, and, hence, the GHG emissions associated with their production and combustion.

Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were used to assess willingness to participate among adults aged 50 and older, by race/ethnicity (n = 4694). RESULTS: Our sample was 42.0% non-Hispanic White, 52.8% non-Hispanic Black, and 5.2% Hispanic.

The leading ten indicators were: Diabetes care, childhood obesity, adult obesity, distribution of healthcare personnel, fatal childhood injuries, cigarette smoking, infant mortality, ability to afford care, access to psychotherapy and distribution of hospital beds. Agreement among raters, measured as intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), was 0.75. CONCLUSION: A diverse range of consultants reached a consensus on the most important national equity indicators, including both clinical and system indicators.

We surveyed the mutational profiles of Delta VOC genomes between September 2020 and mid-August 2021 and identified a previously unreported mutation pattern at amino acid position 142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike protein which demonstrated multiple rounds of mutation from G142 to D142 and back. This pattern of frequent back mutations was observed at multiple time points and across Delta VOC sub-lineages. The etiology for these recurrent mutations is unclear but raises the possibility of host-directed editing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Within Delta VOC this mutation is associated with higher viral load, further enhanced in the presence of another NTD mutation (T95I) which was also frequently observed in these cases. Protein modeling of both mutations predicts alterations of the surface topography of the NTD by G142D, specifically disturbance of the 'super site' epitope that binds NTD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). The appearance of frequent and repeated G142D followed by D142G back mutations is previously unreported in SARS-CoV-2 and may represent viral adaptation to evolving host immunity characterized by increasing frequency of spike NAbs, from both prior infection and vaccine-based immunity. The emergence of alterations of the NTD in and around the main NAb epitope is a concerning development in the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which may contribute to increased infectivity, immune evasion and 'breakthrough infections' characteristic of Delta VOC. Future vaccine and therapy development may benefit by recognizing the emergence of these novel spike NTD mutations and considering their impact on antibody recognition, viral neutralization, infectivity, replication, and viral load.","output":"Spike Protein NTD mutation G142D in SARS-CoV-2 Delta VOC lineages is associated with frequent back mutations, increased viral loads, and immune evasion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in significant global morbidity, mortality, and societal disruption.

By analyzing genetic variation, this study explores the genetic and phylogenetic relationship among ascarids from 11 different hosts. This study collected ascarid samples from the feces of nine animal species in Changsha Ecological Zoo of Hunan Province and two animal kinds in the College of Veterinary Medicine of Hunan Agricultural University. The mitochondrial gene (pcox1) and ribosomal ITS sequences were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed by PCR to identify the species of the samples. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on two genes (cox1 and ITS) by the Neighbor-joining method, and the phylogenetic relationship was analyzed. The sequencing results showed that the sequence lengths of pcox1 and ITS genes in the samples were 441 bp and 838-1,177 bp, respectively. The difference rates were 0.00-1.70% in pcox1 gene and 0.00-7.30% in ITS gene. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ascarid worms from the white lion, Northeast tiger, South China tiger and cheetah were identified as Toxascaris leonina. Ascarids from the zebra were identified as Parascaris equorum, while those from chicken and peacocks were identified as Ascaridia galli. Ascarids of wolf and dog origin were Toxocara canis, the snake ascarids belonged to Ophidascaris filaria, and the bear ascarids belonged to Baylisascaris transfuga. There was a significant gap between different kinds of ascarid worms. We found that these two mitochondrial genes pcox1 and ITS showed a common characteristic that the intraspecific differences were significantly smaller than the interspecific differences, confirming that these two genes could be used as interspecific genetic markers for molecular identification of different ascarids origins. The intraspecific variation rate of the ITS gene was higher than that of pcox1, indicating that ITS can also be used in the genetic research of Ascaris species development.

In periodontal disease, inflammation and microbial dysbiosis occur, which can lead to compromised barrier function of the gingival epithelia. Here, we tested the hypotheses that infection of cultured human gingival epithelial cells with Porphyromonas gingivalis disrupts barrier function by inducing epigenetic alterations and that these effects can be blocked by inhibitors of DNA methylation. METHODS: Primary human gingival epithelial (HGEp) cells were infected with P. gingivalis either in the presence or absence of the non-nucleoside DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors RG108, (-) epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), or curcumin. Barrier function was assessed as transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). DNA methylation and mRNA abundance were quantified for genes encoding components of three cell-cell junction complexes, CDH1, PKP2, and TJP1. Cell morphology and the abundance of cell-cell junction proteins were evaluated by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Compared to non-infected cells, P. gingivalis infection decreased TEER (P < 0.0001) of HGEp cells; increased methylation of the CDH1, PKP2, and TJP1 (P < 0.0001); and reduced their expression (mRNA abundance) (P < 0.005). Pretreatment with DNMT inhibitors prevented these infection-induced changes in HGEp cells, as well as the altered morphology associated with infection. CONCLUSION: Pathogenic infection induced changes in DNA methylation and impaired the barrier function of cultured primary gingival epithelial cells, which suggests a mechanism for systemic consequences of periodontal disease. Inhibition of these events by non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors represents a potential strategy to treat periodontal disease. This article is protected by copyright.

In total, 8 587 samples were analysed during this period, of which 1 974 (23%) were positive for the novel influenza variant. The analysis of results obtained using rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) revealed a global sensitivity of 49.4% (vs. molecular qRT-PCR detection), strongly correlated with age groups (varying from 30% to 58% for patients >40 age and <10, respectively), indicating that RIDTs can be helpful in accelerating the management of suspected cases. Epidemiological analysis showed that the winter influenza wave began in October in Marseille (i.e. 2 to 3 months earlier than usual seasonal influenza outbreaks) and that the majority of autochthonous cases were observed in patients younger than 20 years old, with a low number of cases in patients over 60 years old. In November 2009, 22.2% (167/754) of patients with a laboratory diagnosis of influenza A/H1N1 infection were hospitalized, of which 9% (15/167) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU).

METHODS: Retrospective, multicentric study recruiting Italian MS patients treated with rituximab, ocrelizumab and cladribine. RESULTS: We included 931 MS patients from 15 centers. All but 38 patients performed a complete HBV screening. Patients age > 50 years was significantly associated with no history of vaccination and HBsAb titres < 100 mIU at baseline (p < 0.001).

In this context, we characterized the cecal and lung microbiomes of SARS-CoV-2-challenged K18-hACE2 transgenic mice in the presence or absence of treatment with the M(pro) inhibitor GC-376. Cecum microbiome showed decreased Shannon and inverse (Inv) Simpson diversity indexes correlating with SARS-CoV-2 infection dosage and a difference of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity distances among control and infected mice. Bacterial phyla such as Firmicutes, particularly, Lachnospiraceae and Oscillospiraceae, were significantly less abundant, while Verrucomicrobia, particularly, the family Akkermansiaceae, were increasingly more prevalent during peak infection in mice challenged with a high virus dose. In contrast to the cecal microbiome, the lung microbiome showed similar microbial diversity among the control, low-, and high-dose challenge virus groups, independent of antiviral treatment. Bacterial phyla in the lungs such as Bacteroidetes decreased, while Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were significantly enriched in mice challenged with a high dose of SARS-CoV-2.

This paper examines the literature on remote working to identify the factors crucial for managing a remote workforce. This study uses the complex adaptive systems theory as a foundation to build a framework that organisations can use to manage their remote workforce, focusing on three outcomes: employee engagement, collaboration and organisational agility. Design/methodology/approach: Bibliometric analysis was conducted on the research published in Scopus journal in the area of remote work, followed by critical literature analysis. Findings: The bibliometric analysis identified five clusters that reflect five organisational factors which the management can align to achieve the desired outcomes of engagement, collaboration and agility: technology orientation, leadership, HRM practices, external processes and organisational culture. The present findings have important implications for managing the remote workforce. Originality/value: The five factors were mapped to propose a conceptual model on engaging individual employees, fostering team collaboration and building organisational agility while working remotely.

Our study revealed that there was wide genetic diversity and high prevalence of the virus in the pig population. All five of the known PAstVs genotypes (1C5) prevailed in the pig population of Guangxi province and were distributed in all age groups of pigs, from suckling piglets to sows, with PAstV2 (47.7%), PAstV1 (26.2%) and PAstV5 (21.5%) seen predominantly. Phylogenetic analysis of partial ORF1b and partial capsid sequences from fecal and serum samples revealed that they were divided into the five lineages. Among these genotypes, based on partial ORF2 genes sequencing 23 strains were grouped as PAstV1, including 6 serum-derived strains, and were regarded as the causative agents of viremia in pigs.

A 3% drop in oxygen saturation (SpO2) has been suggested as cause for concern in COVID-19 (2). Field walking tests are often used in respiratory disease to assess desaturation. However these tests can be impractical to perform as an inpatient due to space, equipment and technical skill requirements. The aim of this project was to use a simple sit-to-stand test to evaluate exercise-induced oxygen desaturation to inform home oxygen prescription. Methods: Patients were invited to perform a 1 minute sit-to stand test (1minSTS). Tests were performed at the bedside, around the time of hospital discharge, by the inpatient therapy team at a large teaching hospital (Leicester, UK). All but 2 patients were normoxive at rest (87 and 89%). SpO2 was recorded before, during and after each test. A standard height chair and stopwatch were required.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are widely deployed to augment clinicians in their complex decision-making processes. Despite published success stories, the poor usability of many CDSSs has contributed to fragmented workflows and alert fatigue. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the application of a user-centered design (UCD) process in the development of a standards-based medication recommender for type 2 diabetes mellitus in a simulated setting. The prototype app was evaluated for effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. METHODS: We conducted interviews with 8 clinical leaders with 8 rounds of iterative user testing with 2-8 prescribers in each round to inform app development. With the resulting prototype app, we conducted a validation study with 43 participants. The participants were assigned to one of two groups and completed a 2-hour remote user testing session. Both groups reviewed mock patient facts and ordered diabetes medications for the patients. The Traditional group used a mock electronic health record (EHR) for the review in Period 1 and used the prototype app in Period 2, while the Tool group used the prototype app during both time periods. The perceived cognitive load associated with task performance during each period was assessed with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index. Participants also completed the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire and Kano Survey. RESULTS: Average SUS scores from the questionnaire, taken at the end of 5 of the 8 user testing sessions, ranged from 68-86. The results of the validation study are as follows: percent adherence to evidence-based guidelines was greater with the use of the prototype app than with the EHR across time periods with the Traditional group (prototype app mean 96.2 vs EHR mean 72.0, P<.001) and between groups during Period 1 (Tool group mean 92.6 vs Traditional group mean 72.0, P<.001). Task completion times did not differ between groups (P=.23), but the Tool group completed medication ordering more quickly in Period 2 (Period 1 mean 130.7 seconds vs Period 2 mean 107.7 seconds, P<.001). Based on an adjusted  level owing to violation of the assumption of homogeneity of variance (Ps>.03), there was no effect on screens viewed and on perceived cognitive load (all Ps>.14). CONCLUSIONS: Through deployment of the UCD process, a point-of-care medication recommender app holds promise of improving adherence to evidence-based guidelines; in this case, those from the American Diabetes Association. Task-time performance suggests that with practice the T2DM app may support a more efficient ordering process for providers, and SUS scores indicate provider satisfaction with the app.","output":"Developing a User-Centered Digital Clinical Decision Support App for Evidence-Based Medication Recommendations for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Prototype User Testing and Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet network to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their interaction over time in relation to the pandemics emergence. We identify several stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to international groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national elites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community received disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information from international health organizations or scientific authorities to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged time.

Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) offer a perspective for pregnancy, but the outcome rate is still suboptimal. The trace elements (TE), copper (Cu), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) are essential for fertility and development. We hypothesized that TE concentrations are related to oocyte quality and growth and affect pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing ART. Concentrations of TE were measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence. Extracellular glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3) and selenoprotein P (SELENOP) were determined as additional Se biomarkers. Corresponding serum and follicular fluid (FF) samples were available from women with (n = 20) and without (n = 20) PCOS diagnosis undergoing hormone treatment within the ART procedure, respectively, and FF samples were classified into five groups based on morphological assessment. Serum showed higher TE concentrations than FF, and TE levels correlated positively between both matrices. Individual FF from the same women showed surprisingly high variability in TE concentration, and follicles without oocytes displayed the lowest TE concentrations. Both Se biomarkers GPX3 and SELENOP were present in FF and correlated positively to Se concentrations. Some notable relationships were observed between morphokinetic parameters, TE concentrations, and GPX3 activity. A slightly depressed serum Zn concentration was observed in PCOS. Our results indicate a direct relationship between TE in serum and FF, positive correlations between the three Se biomarkers in FF, and high variability between the FF from the same woman with the lowest TE concentrations in the follicles with the poorest quality. The differences observed in relation to PCOS diagnoses appear relatively minor.

New methods that improve the overall detection capabilities of these systems can have a broad practical impact. Furthermore, most current generation surveillance systems are vulnerable to dramatic and unpredictable shifts in the health-care data that they monitor. These shifts can occur during major public events, such as the Olympics, as a result of population surges and public closures. Shifts can also occur during epidemics and pandemics as a result of quarantines, the worried-well flooding emergency departments or, conversely, the public staying away from hospitals for fear of nosocomial infection. Most surveillance systems are not robust to such shifts in health-care utilization, either because they do not adjust baselines and alert-thresholds to new utilization levels, or because the utilization shifts themselves may trigger an alarm. As a result, public-health crises and major public events threaten to undermine health-surveillance systems at the very times they are needed most. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To address this challenge, we introduce a class of epidemiological network models that monitor the relationships among different health-care data streams instead of monitoring the data streams themselves. By extracting the extra information present in the relationships between the data streams, these models have the potential to improve the detection capabilities of a system. Furthermore, the models' relational nature has the potential to increase a system's robustness to unpredictable baseline shifts. We implemented these models and evaluated their effectiveness using historical emergency department data from five hospitals in a single metropolitan area, recorded over a period of 4.5 y by the Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated Surveillance real-time public healthCsurveillance system, developed by the Children's Hospital Informatics Program at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology on behalf of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. We performed experiments with semi-synthetic outbreaks of different magnitudes and simulated baseline shifts of different types and magnitudes. The results show that the network models provide better detection of localized outbreaks, and greater robustness to unpredictable shifts than a reference time-series modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated network models of epidemiological data streams and their interrelationships have the potential to improve current surveillance efforts, providing better localized outbreak detection under normal circumstances, as well as more robust performance in the face of shifts in health-care utilization during epidemics and major public events.","output":"An Epidemiological Network Model for Disease Outbreak Detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article considers the effects that the Covid-19 pandemic may have on those aspects of international commerce and trade that are most relevant to New Zealand's economic future It covers changes to international political economy and the likely impacts of the huge international policy response Businesses are starting to trade differently, people no longer cross borders so freely, there is changed use of technology, there are challenges for the financial sector, and governments are taking on new roles and issuing huge amounts of debt Bilateral trade tensions are becoming more acute People are going to have to live through disruption and pay for this pandemic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Policy Quarterly is the property of Victoria University of Wellington, Institute of Policy Studies and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Globalisation in the Time of Coronavirus or One Hundred Years of Solitude for New Zealand?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that infects ~60% of adults in developed countries and more than 90% in developing countries.

Substantial progress is being made in understanding the natural history and pathogenesis of HCMV infection and disease in the immunocompromised host. Serial measures of viral load defined the dynamics of HCMV replication and are now used routinely to allow intervention with antiviral drugs in individual patients.

There are few such studies, particularly from low or middle-income countries. Brazil is currently a hotspot for COVID-19 globally. We aimed to investigate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody prevalence by city and according to sex, age, ethnicity group, and socioeconomic status, and compare seroprevalence estimates with official statistics on deaths and cases. METHODS: In this repeated cross-sectional study, we did two seroprevalence surveys in 133 sentinel cities in all Brazilian states. We randomly selected households and randomly selected one individual from all household members. We excluded children younger than 1 year. Presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed using a lateral flow point-of-care test, the WONDFO SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Test (Wondfo Biotech, Guangzhou, China), using two drops of blood from finger prick samples. This lateral-flow assay detects IgG and IgM isotypes that are specific to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Participants also answered short questionnaires on sociodemographic information (sex, age, education, ethnicity, household size, and household assets) and compliance with physical distancing measures. FINDINGS: We included 25a??025 participants in the first survey (May 14-21) and 31a??165 in the second (June 4-7). For the 83 (62%) cities with sample sizes of more than 200 participants in both surveys, the pooled seroprevalence increased from 19% (95% CI 17-21) to 31% (28-34). City-level prevalence ranged from 0% to 254% in both surveys. 11 (69%) of 16 cities with prevalence above 20% in the first survey were located in a stretch along a 2000 km of the Amazon river in the northern region. In the second survey, we found 34 cities with prevalence above 20%, which included the same 11 Amazon cities plus 14 from the northeast region, where prevalence was increasing rapidly. Prevalence levels were lower in the south and centre-west, and intermediate in the southeast, where the highest level was found in Rio de Janeiro (75% [42-122]). In the second survey, prevalence was similar in men and women, but an increased prevalence was observed in participants aged 20-59 years and those living in crowded conditions (44% [35-56] for those living with households with six or more people). Prevalence among Indigenous people was 64% (41-94) compared with 14% (12-17) among White people. Prevalence in the poorest socioeconomic quintile was 37% (32-43) compared with 17% (14-22) in the wealthiest quintile. INTERPRETATION: Antibody prevalence was highly heterogeneous by country region, with rapid initial escalation in Brazil's north and northeast. Prevalence is strongly associated with Indigenous ancestry and low socioeconomic status.

METHODS: To evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of HAdV-ARI in the Korean military, we analyzed respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (RV-PCR) results, pneumonia surveillance results, and severe HAdV cases from all 14 Korean military hospitals from January 2013 to May 2018 and compared these data with nationwide RV surveillance data for the civilian population. RESULTS: A total of 14,630 RV-PCRs was performed at military hospitals. HAdV (45.4%) was the most frequently detected RV, followed by human rhinovirus (12.3%) and influenza virus (6.3%). The percentage of the military positive for HAdV was significantly greater than the percentage of civilians positive for HAdV throughout the study period, with a large outbreak occurring during the winter to spring of 2014 to 2015.

The Mixed Methods Assessment Tool (MMAT) was used to appraise the quality of the studies. RESULTS: Five articles were included for the systematic review. The results showed that the e-health literacy of Chinese older adults was low. Based on the social-ecological model, the influencing factors at the individual level included age, gender, educational attainment, socioeconomic status, physical and psychological conditions, frequency of internet use, and credibility perception of online health resources; at the interpersonal level, the influencing factors included marital status, being the family carer and being taught how to use internet to find health resources; at the social/community level, influencing factors included language barriers and cultural barriers. CONCLUSION: Current e-health literacy among Chinese older adults is low, which is affected by a number of factors. Medical staff should provide detailed health information with guaranteed accuracy and reliability for elderly people. It is necessary to develop intervention programs tailored to varied educational needs of the elderly with different backgrounds (i.e., age, gender, educational attainment, and socioeconomic status) need to be developed in the near future.

Persistently small average effects for full models argue for a new research paradigm to understand what interventions within models work best, for which families, in which contexts, why, and how. Historically, the complexity and proprietary nature of most evidence-based models have been barriers to such research. To address this, stakeholders are building the Precision Paradigm, a common framework and language to define and test interventions and their mediators and moderators. This observational study used portions of an early version of the Precision Paradigm to describe models intended behavioral pathways to good birth outcomes and their stance on home visitors use of specific intervention technique categories to promote families progress along intended pathways. METHODS: Five evidence-based home visiting models participated. Model representatives independently completed three structured surveys focused on 41 potential behavioral pathways to good birth outcomes, and 23 behavior change technique categories. Survey data were used to describe and compare models intended behavioral pathways, explicit endorsement of behavior change technique categories, expectations for home visitors relative emphasis in using endorsed technique categories, and consistency in endorsing technique categories across intended pathways. RESULTS: Models differed substantially in nearly all respects: their intended pathways to good birth outcomes (range 16C41); the number of technique categories they endorsed in any intended pathway (range 12C23); the mean number of technique categories they endorsed per intended pathway (range 1.5C20.0); and their consistency in endorsing technique categories across intended pathways (22%-100% consistency). Models were similar in rating nearly all behavior change technique categories as at least compatible with their model, even if not explicitly endorsed. CONCLUSIONS: Models successfully used components of the Precision Paradigm to define and differentiate their intended behavioral pathways and their expectations for home visitors use of specific technique categories to promote family progress on intended pathways. Use of the Precision Paradigm can accelerate innovative cross-model research to describe current models and to learn which interventions within home visiting work best for which families, in which contexts, why and how.

Misinformation about abortion is pervasive and propagated by state-mandated scripts that contain abortion myths. We sought to investigate womens knowledge of abortion laws in their state. Our secondary objective was to describe womens ability to discern myths about abortion from facts about abortion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study of English- and Spanish-speaking women aged 18-49 in the United States. We enrolled members of the GfK KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally-representative online sample. Our primary outcome was the proportion of correct answers to 12 questions about laws regulating abortion in a respondents state. We asked five questions about common abortion myths. We used descriptive statistics to characterize performance on these measures and bivariate and multivariate modeling to identify risk factors for poor knowledge of state abortion laws. RESULTS: Of 2223 women contacted, 1057 (48%) completed the survey. The mean proportion of correct answers to 12 law questions was 18% (95% CI 17-20%). For three of five assessed myths, women endorsed myths about abortion over facts. Those who believe abortion should be illegal (aOR 2.18, CI 1.40-3.37), and those living in states with neutral or hostile state policies toward abortion (neutral aOR 1.99, CI 1.34-2.97; hostile aOR 1.6, CI 1.07-2.36) were at increased odds of poor law knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Women had low levels of knowledge about state abortion laws and commonly endorse abortion myths. Womens knowledge of their states abortion laws was associated with personal views about abortion and their state policy environment. IMPLICATIONS: Supporters of reproductive rights can use these results to show policy makers that their constituents are unlikely to know about laws being passed that may profoundly affect them. These findings underscore the potential benefit in correcting widely-held, medically-inaccurate beliefs about abortion so opinions about laws can be based on fact.","output":"Women's knowledge of their state's abortion regulations.

Recently, a ARVC risk score was proposed to predict the 5-year risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ARVC. However, CMR features such as fibrosis, fat infiltration, and left ventricular (LV) involvement were not considered. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to evaluate the prognostic role of CMR phenotype in patients with definite ARVC and to evaluate the effectiveness of the novel 5-year ARVC risk score to predict cardiac events in different CMR presentations. METHODS A total of 140 patients with definite ARVC were enrolled (mean age 42  17 years, 97 males) in this multicenter prospective registry. As per study design, CMR was performed in all the patients at enrollment. The novel 5-year ARVC risk score was retrospectively calculated using the patient's characteristics at the time of enrollment. During a median follow-up of 5 years (2 to 8 years), the combined endpoint of sudden cardiac death, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator intervention, and aborted cardiac arrest was considered. RESULTS CMR was completely negative in 14 patients (10%), isolated right ventricular (RV) involvement was found in 58 (41%), biventricular in 52 (37%), and LV dominant in 16 (12%). During the follow-up, 48 patients (34%) had major events, but none occurred in patients with negative CMR. At Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with LV involvement (LV dominant and biventricular) had a worse prognosis than those with lone RV (p < 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, the LV involvement, a LV-dominant phenotype, and the 5-year ARVC risk score were independent predictors of major events. The estimated 5-year risk was able to predict the observed risk in patients with lone RV but underestimated the risk in those with LV involvement. CONCLUSIONS Different CMR presentations of ARVC are associated with different prognoses. The 5-year ARVC risk score is valid for the estimation of risk in patients with lone-RV presentation but underestimated the risk when LV is involved.","output":"Prognostic Value of Magnetic Resonance Phenotype in Patients With Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Correction to the entitled AI-Enabled Global Longitudinal Strain Quantification in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients with Myocardial Injury by Hawkes et al. in the paper ASE 2021 Original Science Presentations, published in the June 2021 issue of JASE (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2021;34: e51).

We studied the case of France, where the independent Scientific Council on COVID-19 was appointed by President Macron on March 12, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey on a representative sample of the French adult population. METHODS: Our data were collected by the French Institute of Public Opinion using a self-administered online questionnaire. This was completed by a sample of 1016 people stratified to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, and so on. We conducted statistical analysis using Python (PandasSciPyStatsmodels) with Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to control for statistical significance. RESULTS: Intense media coverage has given the council a very high public profile, with three respondents out of four (73%) having heard about it. Perceptions are positive but complex. French citizens expect science to be important in political decision-making. Four of five (81.5%) want political decisions, in general, to be based on scientific knowledge. But one in two (55%) says that the government has not relied enough on science and only 36% are satisfied with the government's crisis management to date. Although most feel that the council has a legitimate advisory role even in situations of uncertainty (only 15% disagree), it is not perceived as fully independent. Only 44% think that it directly represents the scientific community, and only one of three people considers it completely independent from the government (39%) and the pharmaceutical industry (36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that while the transparency of scientific advice is important, it alone cannot ensure public confidence in political decision-making. We suggest that efforts made today to instill a science-savvy public cultureone that allows the complex articulation between scientific knowledge, uncertainty, and political decision-making to be understood and accounted for would greatly benefit evidence-based policy in future crises.","output":"Public perceptions of scientific advice: toward a science savvy public culture?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A test's negative predictive value-the probability that a negative result is a true negative result-is dependent on the prevalence of the condition. The present pandemic circumstances present us with unique challenges. False negatives in current testing methodology are to be expected.[1] Thus, a rigorous and contextual interpretation of a negative test result is necessary. Blood hypercoagulability and the risk of thrombosis are well documented in cases of the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.[2] The systemic inflammatory response is associated with endothelial upregulation of proinflammatory mediators that lead to in situ thrombi, as well as a generalized disseminated intravascular coagulation. As many as 31% of ICU patients with COVID-19 have been reported to have thrombotic complications. More specifically, cerebral thrombotic complications confined to the arterial bed have been well described.[3, 4]. The case described shows that milder forms of coronavirus infection may lead to other types of critical and unusual thrombotic complications. An otherwise healthy 47-year-old Caucasian woman developed fever and respiratory signs and symptoms consistent with a possible case of COVID-19 infection in late March of 2020. Interstitial opacities were seen on radiographic examination. Two COVID-19 PCR nasopharyngeal tests were negative, and she recovered at home over the following 2 weeks. Three weeks later, she developed headaches, expressive aphasia, and a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient was treated for a possible ischemic stroke with alteplase thrombolysis at a local hospital. After subsequent transfer and evaluation, a diagnosis of a left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis with adjacent cortical edema was made. On review of her history, the patient denied taking any form of hormonal contraception, and did not have personal, or family history indicative of thrombophilia. She recovered fully after anticoagulation with enoxaparin and subsequent dabigatran. Prior to discharge a COVID-19, IgG antibody test was reported as positive. Decontextualized and overly simplistic interpretation of COVID-19 negative tests amidst a pandemic is problematic. In addition to the obvious infection control issues associated with the resulting lack of isolation and contract tracing, it may deprive some patients of the opportunity to receive antithrombotic therapy. Prophylactic and therapeutic regimens for hospitalized patients are in evolution, and have been associated with improved clinical outcomes.[5] We are aware that the role of anticoagulation in outpatient cases is not well studied, but we believe it deserves proper investigation.

Some studies suggest infants might be at increased risk for severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19. Our objective was to describe the clinical and laboratory features of young infants admitted to a hospital system with COVID-19. METHODS: An observational retrospective study was performed in infants 1 year of age admitted with COVID-19 from March 1, 2020 to May 30, 2021. Data was extracted into a REDCap database and analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Sixteen infants < 1 year were hospitalized with COVID-19. Fever, poor feeding, and respiratory symptoms were the most common presenting symptoms (Table 1). Two required pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) care, three required oxygen support, and one was intubated. There were no deaths. Five infants with echocardiograms performed showed normal findings. Four infants received Remdesivir without side effects. CONCLUSION: Infants with COVID-19 can present with severe disease requiring ICU care and oxygen support. In our experience, a large proportion of infants developed hematologic abnormalities, but none had cardiac involvement.

However, it is unclear if NA can be safely stopped in such patients after cytotoxic therapies or during immunosuppressive therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively evaluated 133 patients who initiated NA therapy between 2007 and 2018. A total of 103 patients were positive for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) at baseline, and NA therapy was started before cytotoxic or immunosuppressive therapy (preventive group). Thirty patients with resolved HBV infection were treated with NA therapy after HBV reactivation (on-demand group). Virological relapse was defined as a serum HBV DNA level >20 IU/mL. RESULTS NA therapy was stopped in 12 (12%) patients (preventive group), and in 16 (53%) patients (on-demand group). After the cessation of NA therapy, the cumulative rates of relapse were 36% and 39% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. High levels of HBsAg both at baseline and at the cessation of NA therapy were related to the occurrence of relapse. Relapse did not occur in patients with HBsAg levels <20 IU/mL (preventive group). HBV relapse occurred in five (33%) patients in the on-demand group. Relapse occurred only in anti-HBs-negative patients at the cessation of NA therapy.

Design/methodology/approach: Participants were 155 employees from 31 teams from a branch of a multinational pharmaceutical company located in an EU country. The company faces constant legal, regulatory and technology-related changes after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic outbreak. Data were collected in three waves, approximately three weeks apart between March 2020 and May 2020. To test the mediating effect of workplace belongingness were performed first C a series of regression analyses C and second, bootstrapping to assess the statistical significance of the indirect effect (Preacher and Hayes, 2008). Findings: Workplace belongingness mediates the relationship between inclusive leadership and employees change participation. Further, the research findings provide support that meaning-making moderates the relationship between workplace belongingness and change participation as well as the indirect relationship between inclusive leadership and change participation through workplace belongingness such that the positive relationships are stronger when meaning-making is higher. Practical implications: The results indicate that should leaders and change management practitioners manage to influence positively employees' workplace belongingness by employing inclusive practices and procedures;leaders and change management practitioners will increase the level of participation during change and further the results note from an applied perspective the importance of mean-making as a facilitating factor during change in organizational settings. Relevant suggestions are made. Originality/value: The findings provide new insights into how inclusive leadership and workplace belongingness can affect employees' change participation.

Physical performance was assessed at baseline and after each phase by means of a countermovement jump and the estimated squat 1-repetition maximum. RESULTS: A reduction in training workloads was observed in all participants during the lockdown (-63.7%), which was accompanied by a reduced heart rate variability in all but one participant (-2.0%). A significant reduction was also observed for countermovement jump (-6.5%) and 1-repetition maximum performance (-11.5%), which decreased in all but one participant after the lockdown. However, after the retraining phase, all measures returned to similar values to those found at baseline. At the individual level, there were divergent responses, as exemplified by one athlete who attenuated the reduction in training workloads and increased her performance during the lockdown and another one who markedly reduced his workload and performance, and got injured during the retraining phase.

METHODS: We conducted an online survey in the UK (N = 1088) and Turkey (N = 3936), and gathered information on participants' willingness to vaccinate for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, beliefs on the origin of the novel coronavirus, and several behavioural and demographic predictors (such as anxiety, risk perception, government satisfaction levels) that influence vaccination and origin beliefs. RESULTS: In all, 31% of the participants in Turkey and 14% in the UK were unsure about getting themselves vaccinated for a COVID-19 vaccine. In both countries, 3% of the participants rejected to be vaccinated. Also, 54% of the participants in Turkey and 63% in the UK believed in the natural origin of the novel coronavirus.

Whilst this led to an increase in performance, it had its limitations as the rule produces ground instances which (i) can be overly specific, thus not useful in proof search, and (ii) contribute to the already problematic search space explosion as many new instances are introduced. This paper begins by introducing that specifically addresses these two concerns as it produces general solutions and it is a simplification rule, i.e. it replaces an existing clause by a simpler one. Encouraged by initial success with this new rule, we performed an experiment to identify further common cases where the complex structure of theory terms blocked existing methods. This resulted in four further simplification rules for theory reasoning. The resulting extensions are implemented in the Vampire theorem prover and evaluated on SMT-LIB, showing that the new extensions result in a considerable increase in the number of problems solved, including 90 problems unsolved by state-of-the-art SMT solvers.","output":"Making Theory Reasoning Simpler"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose - This paper proposes a thorough investigation of the impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on consumer behavior and the inventory management of the retail pharmaceutical stores in Bangladesh.

Materials and methods The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched until 1 May 2020, for studies examining the proportion of positive chest imaging findings in asymptomatic cases diagnosed with COVID-19 and a random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was performed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Results Among 858 non-duplicate studies, seven studies with a total of 231 asymptomatic cases met the inclusion criteria. In the primary analysis, the pooled estimate of the overall rate of positive chest computed tomography (CT) findings among asymptomatic cases was 63% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44C78%). Among 155/231 cases that were followed up for later symptom development, 90/155 remained asymptomatic and 65/155 developed symptoms during the study period (that ranged between seven and 30 days of follow-up). The pooled estimate of the rate of positive chest CT findings was 62% (95% CI: 38C81%) in cases that remained asymptomatic, while it was 90% (95% CI: 49C99%) in cases that developed symptoms. Among CT findings, the pooled estimate of the overall rate of ground-glass opacities (GGO) at CT alone was 71% (95% CI: 50C86%). Among other CT findings reported, 22/231 patients had GGO with consolidation, 7/231 patients had stripe shadows with or without GGO, and 8/231 patients had GGO with interlobular septal thickening. Among initially asymptomatic cases with positive CT findings, the pooled estimate of the overall rate of later symptom development was 26% (95% CI: 14C43%). Conclusion In COVID-19, asymptomatic cases can have positive chest CT findings, and COVID-19 should be considered among cases with CT abnormalities even when there are no other symptoms. There is a need for close clinical monitoring of asymptomatic cases with radiographic findings as a significant percentage will develop symptoms.","output":"Chest CT findings in asymptomatic cases with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nonhepatotropic viruses such as adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, flaviviruses, filoviruses, and human herpes virus, and bacteria such as Coxiella burnetii, can cause liver injury mimicking acute hepatitis.

When spleen cells were treated with CAF supernatant, the proliferation of T cells was inhibited as determined by flow cytometry. After cinnamaldehyde treatment, this immunosuppressive function of CAFs was partially reversed. To explore the molecular mechanism, Western blotting and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were applied, and TLR4-dependent signaling pathway-related protein and mRNA levels were quantified. Results: Cinnamaldehyde acted on the TLR4-dependent signaling pathway, altering the function of CAFs such that its supernatant no longer inhibited the proliferation of T cells. Conclusion: These data indicate that cinnamaldehyde can modify the functions of CAFs, which may be helpful for treating tumors.

In parallel, by screening the immunogenic SARS-CoV-2 spike derived epitopes provided in the literature, we chose a set of epitopes believed to induce immunogenic response. Next, we provided the selected epitopes from both approaches, we performed immunoinformatic analysis that map identically to antigen regions and have antigenic properties. Finally, by suggesting a screened set of epitopes, we designed a novel virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine, optimized to be produced in plants by using molecular farming biotechnology techniques.

The overall (5 years) survival rate of PC is less than 9% and is anticipated to be aggravated in the future due to the lack of molecular acquaintance and diagnostic tools for its early detection. Multiple factors are involved in the course of PC development, including genetics, cigarette smoking, alcohol, family history, and aberrant epigenetic signatures of the epigenome. In this review, we will mainly focus on the genetic mutations and epigenetic signature of PC. Multiple tumor suppressor and oncogene mutations are involved in PC initiation, including K-RAS, p53, CDKN2A, and SMAD4. The mutational frequency of these genes ranges from 50 to 98% in PC. The nature of mutation diagnosis is mostly homozygous deletion, point mutation, and aberrant methylation. In addition to genetic modification, epigenetic alterations particularly aberrant hypermethylation and hypomethylation also predispose patients to PC. Hypermethylation is mostly involved in the downregulation of tumor suppressor genes and leads to PC, while multiple genes also represent a hypomethylation status in PC. Several renewable drugs and detection tools have been developed to cope with this aggressive malady, but all are futile, and surgical resection remains the only choice for prolonged survival if diagnosed before metastasis. However, the available therapeutic development is insufficient to cure PC. Therefore, novel approaches are a prerequisite to elucidating the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying PC progression for healthier lifelong survival.","output":"An overview of genetic mutations and epigenetic signatures in the course of pancreatic cancer progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of directional atherectomy (DA) for endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in infrainguinal arteries in patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia. BACKGROUND To date, no prospective, multicenter, independently-adjudicated study has evaluated the effectiveness and durability of DA in the treatment of PAD. Previous DA studies have not been prospectively powered to evaluate any differences in outcomes in patients with and without diabetes. METHODS DEFINITIVE LE (Determination of EFfectiveness of the SilverHawk(?) PerIpheral Plaque ExcisioN System (SIlverHawk Device) for the Treatment of Infrainguinal VEssels / Lower Extremities) prospectively enrolled subjects at 47 multinational centers with an infrainguinal lesion length up to 20 cm. Primary endpoints were defined as primary patency at 12 months for claudicants and freedom from major unplanned amputation for critical limb ischemia (CLI) subjects. A pre-specified statistical hypothesis evaluated noninferiority of primary patency in diabetic versus nondiabetic claudicants. Independent angiographic and sonographic core laboratories assessed outcomes, and events were adjudicated by a clinical events committee. RESULTS A total of 800 subjects were enrolled. The 12-month primary patency was 78% (95% confidence interval: 74.0% to 80.6%) in claudicants, with a 77% rate in the diabetic subgroup versus 78% in the nondiabetic subgroup (noninferior, p < 0.001). The rate of freedom from major unplanned amputation of the target limb at 12 months in CLI subjects was 95% (95% confidence interval: 90.7% to 97.4%). Periprocedural adverse events included embolization (3.8%), perforation (5.3%), and abrupt closure (2.0%). The bail-out stent rate was 3.2%. CONCLUSIONS The DEFINITIVE LE study demonstrated that DA is a safe and effective treatment modality at 12 months for a diverse patient population with either claudication or CLI. Furthermore, DA was shown to be noninferior for treating PAD in patients with diabetes compared with those without diabetes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the microcosmic changes and tissue damage of fusion regions with various parameters of injury. Ex vivo colons of pigs were fused serosa-serosa on two carrier rings, which were installed on a homemade anastomotic device. Five levels of compressive pressure from 171 to 313 kPa were applied for 5s to fuse the colons under radiofrequency power of 160 W, and then the collagen denaturation of the fused region was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Light microscopy was utilized to observe histological slices that were stained with picrosirius red in order to visualize the tissue injuries under two levels of radiofrequency power (120 vs. 140 W) and operation time (5 vs. 10s). Transmission electron micrographs showed that increased compressive pressure led to thicker denatured collagen fibrils and wider gaps between each collagen fibril. Serosa adhesion regions appeared abundant in collagen. No histological differences were observed when 120 W of power was applied for 5 and 10s. Significant muscle cracking occurred when colons were fused using 140 W for 5s. When the operation time was extended to 10s, 140 W led to tight fusion and less splitting on muscles. These results suggest that higher compressive pressure results in more severe collagen unfolding and also reduces collagen crosslinking in fused colons. Improved radiofrequency power along with operation time could avoid tissue injury upon radiofrequency-induced colonic anastomoses.","output":"Histological characteristics of collagen denaturation and injuries in bipolar radiofrequency-induced colonic anastomoses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 1.8 million deaths, with a fatality rate of 2.5% in more than 200 countries as of January 4, 2021.

Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and possible predictors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted to King Fahad (KFH), Ohood, and Miqat hospitals in Madina, Saudi Arabia. Methods This retrospective observational study to investigate the clinical characteristic and possible predictors associated with mortality for those 119 mild, moderate, or critically ill patients confirmed by laboratory results to have COVID-19 who were admitted to three hospitals in Madina, Saudi Arabia, from March 25, 2020, to July 30, 2020. Data were collected from December 1, 2020, to December 14, 2020. Results Of the 119 patients included in the study, the mean age was 54.2 (15.7) years, with 78.2% survivors and 21.8% non-survivors. The demographic analysis indicated that the likelihood of mortality for patients in the older age group (i.e., 65 years) was five times higher than those in the younger age group (OR = 5.34, 95% CI 1.71C16.68, p = 0.004).

However, how MAT changes the 3D morphology of the AT during repeated loading remains unclear. This study compared the AT longitudinal, transverse and volume strains during repeated loading of the tendinopathic AT with those of the contralateral tendon in people with unilateral MAT. Ten adults with unilateral MAT performed 10 successive 25 s submaximal (50%) voluntary isometric plantarflexion contractions with both legs. Freehand 3D ultrasound scans were recorded and used to measure whole AT, free AT and proximal AT longitudinal strains and free AT cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume strains. The free AT experienced higher longitudinal and CSA strain and reached steady state following a greater number of contractions (five contractions) in the tendinopathic AT compared with the contralateral tendon (three contractions). Further, free tendon CSA and volume strain were greater in the tendinopathic AT than in the contralateral tendon from the first contraction, whereas free AT longitudinal strain was not greater than that of the contralateral tendon until the fourth contraction. Volume loss from the tendon core therefore preceded the greater longitudinal strain in the tendinopathic AT. Overall, these findings suggest that the tendinopathic free AT experiences an exaggerated longitudinal and transverse strain response under repeated loading that is underpinned by an altered interaction between solid and fluid tendon matrix components. These alterations are indicative of accentuated poroelasticity and an altered local stress-strain environment within the tendinopathic free tendon matrix, which could affect tendon remodelling via mechanobiological pathways.","output":"The tendinopathic Achilles tendon does not remain iso-volumetric upon repeated loading: insights from 3D ultrasound."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PurposeThis paper aims to contribute to the emerging literature on accounting education in the COVID-19 context.

Studies with qualitative methodology, chapters of books, meeting proceedings, and abstracts were excluded. RESULTS In this study, 12 articles comprising 745 individuals were included. More than half of the articles observed lower QoL in individuals with recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) or junctional EB (JEB). Three articles indicated that EB affected QoL more in women than in men, and one article identified that children with EB suffered more than adults with the disease. Pain was frequently reported. Seven articles identified difficulty in sports, two identified a need for bathing assistance, and three identified eating difficulties. Additionally, participants reported that family relationships and friendships were affected, and they experienced feelings of anxiety and depression. Some of the instruments used evaluated QoL in general dermatologic conditions, and one was specific to EB. CONCLUSION QoL is more affected in people who have RDEB and JEB.

In virus-infected cells, MHV nsp15 distributed unevenly throughout the cytoplasm but predominantly in the perinuclear region. When expressed as N-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion, it predominantly formed speckles in the cytoplasm. In contrast, SARS-CoV and TGEV EGFP-nsp15s distributed smoothly in the whole cell and did not form speckles. Deletion mapping experiments identified two domains responsible for the speckle formation in MHV EGFP-nsp15: Domain I (aa101C150) and Domain III (aa301C374). Interestingly, Domain II (aa151C250) had an inhibitory effect on Domain III- but not Domain I-mediated speckle formation. Expression of a small (35aa) sequence in Domain III alone was sufficient to form speckles for all 3 viral nsp15s. However, addition of surrounding sequences in Domain III abolished the speckle formation for TGEV nsp15 but not for MHV and SARS-CoV nsp15s. Further domain swapping experiments uncovered additional speckle-inducing and -suppressive elements in nsp15s of SARS-CoV and TGEV. Homotypic interaction involving Domain III of MHV nsp15 was further demonstrated biochemically. Moreover, the biological functions of the expressed nsp15s were assessed in MHV-infected cells. It was found that the effects of EGFP-nsp15s on MHV replication were both virus species- and nsp15 domain-dependent. Collectively these results thus underscore the differential biochemical and biological functions among the nsp15s of MHV, TGEV and SARS-CoV in host cells.","output":"Comparative In Vivo Analysis of the Nsp15 Endoribonuclease of Murine, Porcine and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although viruses are widely distributed in fungi, their biological significance to their hosts is still poorly understood. A large number of fungal viruses are associated with latent infections of their hosts. With the exception of the killer-immune character in the yeasts, smuts, and hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus, fungal properties that can specifically be related to virus infection are not well defined. Mycoviruses are not known to have natural vectors; they are transmitted in nature intracellularly by hyphal anastomosis and heterokaryosis, and are disseminated via spores. Because fungi have a potential for plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange during extended periods of their life cycles and because they produce many types of propagules (sexual and asexual spores), often in great profusion, mycoviruses have them accessible to highly efficient means for transmission and spread. It is no surprise, therefore, that fungal viruses are not known to have an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Although extracellular transmission of a few fungal viruses have been demonstrated, using fungal protoplasts, the lack of conventional methods for experimental transmission of these viruses have been, and remains, an obstacle to understanding their biology. The recent application of molecular biological approaches to the study of mycoviral dsRNAs and the improvements in DNA-mediated fungal transformation systems, have allowed a clearer understanding of the molecular biology of mycoviruses to emerge. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the genome organization and expression strategies of the yeast L-A virus and the unencapsidated RNA virus associated with hypovirulence in the chestnut blight fungus. These recent advances in the biochemical and molecular characterization of the genomes of fungal viruses and associated satellite dsRNAs, as they relate to the biological properties of these viruses and to their interactions with their hosts are the focus of this chapter.","output":"New Developments in Fungal Virology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China was seriously affected by air pollution in the past decade, especially for particulate matter (PM) and emerging ozone pollution recently. In this study, we systematically examined the spatiotemporal variations of six air pollutants and conducted ozone prediction using machine learning (ML) algorithms in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. The annual-average concentrations of CO, PM10, PM2.5 and SO2 decreased at a rate of 141, 11.0, 6.6 and 5.6a?g/m3/year, while a pattern of initial increase and later decrease was observed for NO2 and O3_8a?h. The concentration of SO2, CO and NO2 was higher in Tangshan and Xingtai, while northern BTH region has lower levels of CO, NO2 and PM. Spatial variations of ozone were relatively small in the BTH region. Monthly variations of PM10 displayed an increase in March probably due to wind-blown dusts from Northwest China. A seasonal and diurnal pattern with summer and afternoon peaks was found for ozone, which was contrast with other pollutants. Further ML algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) model and Decision tree (DT) regression showed good ozone prediction performance (daily: R2a?=a?0.83 and 0.73, RMSEa?=a?30.0 and 37.3a?g/m3, respectively; monthly: R2a?=a?0.93 and 0.88, RMSEa?=a?12.1 and 15.8a?g/m3, respectively) based on 10-fold cross-validation. Both RF model and DT regression relied more on the spatial trend as higher temporal prediction performance was achieved. Solar radiation- and temperature-related variables presented high importance at daily level, whereas sea level pressure dominated at monthly level. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity in variable importance was further confirmed using case studies based on RF model. In addition, variable importance was possibly influenced by the emission reductions due to COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its possible weakness to capture ozone extremes, RF model was beneficial and suggested for predicting spatiotemporal variations of ozone in future studies.","output":"Spatiotemporal variations of air pollutants and ozone prediction using machine learning algorithms in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region from 2014 to 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Videolaryngoscope is regarded as the standard of care for airway management in well-resourced setups however the technology is largely inaccessible and costly in middle and low-income countries. An improvised and cost-effective form of customized videolaryngoscope was proposed and studied for patient care in underprivileged areas however there were no distinct conclusions on its performances. METHOD: The study follows PRISMA guidelines for systematic review and the protocol in International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews. The primary aim was to assess the first attempt success of customized videolaryngoscope for endotracheal intubation. The secondary objective was to evaluate the number of attempts, laryngoscopic view in terms of Cormack Lehane score and Percentage of glottic opening, use of external laryngeal maneuver and stylet and, the airway injuries after the endotracheal intubation. RESULT: Five studies were analyzed for risk of bias using the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for cross-sectional studies. Most of the studies had a poor to a fair level of evidence with only one study with a good level of evidence. Certainty of evidence was very low for all eligible studies when graded using the Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach for systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: The certainty of the evidence regarding performance of custom-made videolaryngoscope compared to conventional laryngoscope was very low and the study was performed in small numbers with fair to the poor risk of bias. It was difficult to establish and do further analysis regarding whether the customized form of videolaryngoscope will improve the first attempt success rate for tracheal intubation, reduce the number of attempts, improve the laryngoscopic view, require fewer external aids and reduce the incidences of airway injury with the given low-grade evidence.

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study on the clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of a series of the 100 confirmed patients with COVID-19. These patients were admitted to the hospitals affiliated to Babol University of Medical Sciences (Ayatollah Rohani, Shahid Beheshti and Yahyanejad hospitals) form 25 February 2020 to 12 March 2020. RESULTS Nineteen patients died during hospitalization and 81 were discharged. Non-survivor patients had a significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (MD: 46.37, 95% CI: 20.84, 71.90; P= 0.001), white blood cells (WBCs) (MD: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.53, 4.67; P< 0.001) and lower lymphocyte (MD: -8.75, 95% CI: -12.62, -4.87; P< 0.001) compared to survivor patients Data analysis showed that comorbid conditions (aRR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.09, 8.21, P= 0.034), higher CRP levels (aRR: 1.02, 95%CI: 1.01, 1.03, P= 0.044), and lower lymphocyte (aRR: 0.82, 95%CI: 0.73, 0.93, P= 0.003) were associated with increased risk of death.

We hypothesized that achieving glycemic control soon after admission, in both intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU settings, could affect outcomes in patients with COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed pooled data from the Glytec national database including 1,544 patients with COVID-19 from 91 hospitals in 12 states. Patients were stratified according to achieved mean glucose category in mg/dL (&#8804;7.77, 7.83-10, 10.1-13.88, and >13.88 mmol/L; &#8804;140, 141-180, 181-250, and >250 mg/dL) during days 2-3 in non-ICU patients or on day 2 in ICU patients. We conducted a survival analysis to determine the association between glucose category and hospital mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 18.1% (279/1,544) of patients died in the hospital. In non-ICU patients, severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose [BG] >13.88 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) on days 2-3 was independently associated with high mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 7.17; 95% CI 2.62-19.62) compared with patients with BG <7.77 mmol/L (140 mg/dL). This relationship was not significant for admission glucose (HR 1.465; 95% CI 0.683-3.143). In patients admitted directly to the ICU, severe hyperglycemia on admission was associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.44-6.88). This relationship was not significant on day 2 (HR 1.40; 95% CI 0.53-3.69). Hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL) was also associated with increased mortality (odds ratio 2.2; 95% CI 1.35-3.60).

Although mortality is low, mild to moderate COVID-19 may progress to severe or even critical stages in about one week. This poses a substantial burden on the health care system, and ultimately culminates in death or incapacitation and hospitalization. Therefore, pharmacological treatment is paramount for patients with this condition, especially those with recognized risk factors to disease progression. We conducted a comprehensive review in the medical literature searching for randomized studies carried out in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. A total of 14 randomized studies were identified, enrolling a total of 6848 patients. Nine studies (64%) were randomized, placebo-controlled trials, whereas five were open-label randomized trials (35%). We observed that Bamlanivimab and nitazoxanide reduced viral load, whereas ivermectin may have shortened time to viral clearance; Interferon Beta-1 reduced time to viral clearance and vitamin D reduced viral load; Favirapir, peginterferon, and levamisole improved clinical symptoms, whereas fluvoxamine halted disease progression; inhaled budesonide reduced the number of hospitalizations and visits to emergency departments; colchicine reduced the number of deaths and hospitalizations. Collectively, therefore, these findings show that treatment of early COVID-19 may be associated with reduced viral load, thus potentially decreasing disease spread in the community. Moreover, treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 may also be associated with improved clinical symptoms, hospitalization, and disease progression. We suggest that colchicine, inhaled budesonide, and nitazoxanide, along with nonpharmacological measures, based on efficacy and costs, may be used to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in middle-income countries.","output":"Pharmacological Treatment of Patients with Mild to Moderate COVID-19: A Comprehensive Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Keywords: Rehabilitation;Innovation;Flexibility Purpose: To demonstrate that our Trust can run a cost efficient elective orthopaedic service delivering a high volume of in-patient and day-case operations, optimising resources to assist with clearing the backlog of patients due to COVID-19 pandemic. The aim was to complete 100 arthroplasties in seven days. The project was entitled BONES week. Methods: Overall planning utilised a multidisciplinary approach. From a rehabilitation perspective the pathway was divided into three stages. For each stage, national guidelines were adhered to. Pre-operatively: All patients had a therapy telephone pre-assessment to identify equipment and care needs and clarify patient expectations. Equipment was in situ prior to admission and referrals for care commenced reducing post-operative interventions and minimising delays in discharge. Post operatively: Day 0 physiotherapy assessments, multiple physiotherapy inputs including exercise classes, regular ice treatments were undertaken. Simplification of documentation to increase efficiency. Full seven day extended hours physiotherapy service implemented to enhance treatments capabilities. On site stock of orthotic and ADL equipment to decrease delivery time. Follow up: Trust affiliated community therapy team with acute therapy-led rapid handover provided next day treatments. To enable this service to be provided, therapy staffing was tripled in line with increased demand. The staff was sourced from redeployment and locum agencies. Results: 135 arthroplasties and 85 day cases completed in 7 days. Improved patient care and experience, reduced length of stay, better utilisation of theatre space and resources. The average length of stay decreased by 1.5 days and three day 0 discharges completed. Conclusion(s): With sufficient planning and staffing we have demonstrated that a cost efficient high turnover elective orthopaedic service is possible without compromising patient care. The expectation of 100 arthoplasties was exceeded. A decreased length of stay was demonstrated as achievable with the right resources in place. Suggestions for the future include early access to TCI list for pre-operative assessment, late shift physiotherapy to allow early initiation of therapy input and reduce movement of patients between wards. Improvements in timing of check X-rays to prevent unnecessary delays in therapy. The introduction of an online pre-operative education video to Trust website.

The people of Hubei province perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma due to the geographic linkage to COVID-19. Perceived courtesy stigma refers to the perception of stigma of people who are associated with COVID-19 (e.g., the geographic linkage). Affiliate stigma is the internalization and psychological responses of perceived courtesy stigma among the associates. OBJECTIVE: The current study aims to reveal different patterns of perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma among people who are at high risk of contagion of COVID-19, and to examine the possible risk factors. METHOD: A sample including 2813 adults who located in Hubei Province, China (female: n = 2,184, 77.64%; male: n = 629, 22.36%; mean age = 37.85 years, SD = 6.61 years, range = 18-63 years) were employed in the current study, using latent profile analysis for searching stigma profiles. RESULTS: Three profiles of stigma were found: the \\"Denier\\" (35.98%), \\"Confused moderate\\" (48.13%) and \\"Perceiver\\" (15.89%) displaying the low, moderate and high level of perceived courtesy and affiliate stigma, respectively. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that generally people with a high level of education, perceived threats, anxiety symptoms, and familiarity with quarantined cases have a high likelihood to be distributed into the \\"Perceiver\\". DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the issues of COVID-19-related stigma and provide evidence for launching effective health actions to promote a cohesive society and culture of health. The media can transmit scientific knowledge, promote positive interactions and social cohesion between the stigmatized group and the dominant group, and create spaces for stories that nurture group identification among the implicated people. Future studies should use more representative sample and improve the measures.","output":"COVID-19-related stigma profiles and risk factors among people who are at high risk of contagion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Israel recently initiated a rapid nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign to immunize persons 16 years of age and used exclusively PfizerCBioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine according to schedule (two doses, 21 days apart). We provide the first estimates of the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by a nationwide vaccination campaign. Methods: We used national surveillance data from the first 112 days (Dec 20, 2020 ? Apr 10, 2021) of Israels vaccination campaign to estimate averted burden of four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19-related hospitalizations, severe or critical hospitalizations, and deaths. The direct effects of the immunization program were estimated for all susceptible individuals (i.e., no previous evidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection) who were at least partially vaccinated (defined as receipt of at least one dose with 14 days after the first dose). Cases averted were estimated based on cumulative daily, age-specific rate differences comparing rates among unvaccinated to those who were at least partially vaccinated for each of the four outcomes and the (age-specific) size of the susceptible population and proportion that was at least partially vaccinated. Findings: Through Apr 10, 2021, we estimated that Israels vaccination campaign averted 158,665 (95% uncertainty range: 115,899?201,431) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 24,597 (6,622?42,571) hospitalizations, 17,432 (3,065?31,799) severe and critical hospitalizations, and 5,533 (-1,146?12,213) deaths. Of these, 66% of hospitalizations and 91% of deaths averted were among those 65 years of age. Seventy-three percent of SARS-CoV-2 infections and 79% of COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths averted stemmed from the protective effects in fully vaccinated persons. Interpretations: Without vaccination, Israel would have likely experienced triple the number of hospitalizations and deaths compared to what actually occurred during their largest wave of SARS-CoV-2 to date, which would have likely overwhelmed the healthcare system. Indirect effects and long-term benefits of the program, which could be substantial, were not included in these estimates and warrant future research.

Therefore, we studied the frequency of viruses causing influenza-like illnesses (ILI) among participants in a randomised controlled trial at the Hajj 2013. We recruited 1038 pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, Australia and Qatar during the first day of Hajj and followed them closely for four days. A nasal swab was collected from each pilgrim who developed ILI. Respiratory viruses were detected using multiplex RT-PCR. ILI occurred in 112/1038 (11%) pilgrims.

METHODS: Different mixed materials including P sorbent, natural organic carbon (C), and an oxidizing agent were applied in a 1-year pilot-scale experiment. RESULTS: The addition of iron-rich (IR) clay and Phoslock agent promoted the formation of iron bound P (Fe(OOH)~P) and calcium bound P (CaCO(3)~P) in sediments, respectively. IR clay offered more advantages in immobilization of phosphorus as refractory P, and the Phoslock agent more effectively reduced the risk of P release into water, which was expressed as a low equilibrium P concentration (EPC(0)). Mixtures of sugarcane (SU) detritus and IR clay exhibited high carbohydrate (CHO) contents, which further fuelled both denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This indicated that the SU dosage should be controlled to avoid DNRA over denitrification. Attention should be given to the fact that SU introduction significantly promoted the generation of an anaerobic state, leading to the desorption and release of Fe(OOH)~P, which could be alleviated by using Oxone. Multienzyme activity analysis showed that P and N transformation shifted from P desorption to organic P hydrolysis and from ammonification to denitrification and DNRA, respectively. CONCLUSION: We recommend the use of P sorbent and organic C combined with oxidizing agents as effective mixed materials for sediment remediation, which could enhance P adsorption and provide electron donors for denitrification, while also avoiding the generation of anoxia.","output":"Mechanisms and risks of joint control of nitrogen and phosphorus through sediment capping technology in a pilot-scale study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the pandemic, the world's media have publicized preliminary findings suggesting that tobacco use is protective against COVID-19 An ad hoc multidisciplinary group was created to address the major public health implications of this messaging Key messages of this commentary are as follows: (1) The COVID-19 crisis may increase tobacco consumption and decrease access to healthcare As a result, smoking-related morbidity and mortality could increase in the coming months and years;(2) Smoking and tobacco-related diseases are prognostic factors for severe COVID-19;and (3) In theory, smokers may be at lower risk of COVID-19 infection because of having fewer social contacts In conclusion, tobacco control is a greater challenge than ever in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic Public decision-makers must be vigilant in ensuring that public health practices are consistent and compliant with the principles of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control In addition, researchers and the media have a responsibility to be cautious in communicating preliminary results that may promote non-evidence-based research, self-destructive individual behaviours, and commercial agendas","output":"Tobacco and COVID-19: a crisis within a crisis?

Actions are being implemented to keep health care systems from being overstretched and to curb the outbreak. Any policy responses aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus and mitigating its immediate effects on health care systems require a firm basis of information about the absolute number of currently infected people, growth rates, and locations/hotspots of infections. The only way to obtain this base of information is by conducting numerous tests in a targeted way. Currently, in Ghana, there is a centralized testing approach, that takes 4-5 days for samples to be shipped and tested at central reference laboratories with results communicated to the district, regional and national stakeholders. This delay in diagnosis increases the risk of ongoing transmission in communities and vulnerable institutions. We have validated, evaluated and deployed an innovative diagnostic tool on a mobile laboratory platform to accelerate the COVID-19 testing. A preliminary result of 74 samples from COVID-19 suspected cases has a positivity rate of 12% with a turn-around time of fewer than 3 hours from sample taking to reporting of results, significantly reducing the waiting time from days to hours, enabling expedient response by the health system for contact tracing to reduce transmission and additionally improving case management.

In addition, ZIKV can also induce GuillainCBarr syndrome, which is an autoimmune disease with neurological symptoms. The recent description of the first local infections of ZIKV in the European continent together with the expansion of one of its potential vectors, the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), invite us to be prepared for future outbreaks of ZIKV in this geographical region. However, the antigenic similarities of ZIKV with other flaviviruses can lead to an immune cross-reactivity with other circulating flaviviruses inducing, in some cases, flavivirus-disease exacerbation by antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, which is a major concern for ZIKV vaccine development. Until now, West Nile virus (WNV) is the main medically relevant flavivirus circulating in the Mediterranean Basin. Therefore, anticipating the potential scenario of emergency vaccination against ZIKV in areas of Europe where WNV is endemic, in this investigation, we have evaluated the cross-reactivity between WNV and our previously developed ZIKV vaccine candidate based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vector expressing ZIKV structural proteins (MVA-ZIKV). To this end, mice were first immunized with MVA-ZIKV, subsequently challenged with WNV, and then, the ZIKV- and WNV-specific immune responses and protection against WNV were evaluated. Our results indicate low cross-reactivity between the MVA-ZIKV vaccine candidate and WNV and absence of ADE, supporting the safety of this ZIKV vaccine candidate in areas where the circulation of WNV is endemic.","output":"Low Immune Cross-Reactivity between West Nile Virus and a Zika Virus Vaccine Based on Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prone position ventilation has become an important part of lung protective ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients.

Adequately treating HIV early renders the infection a chronic medical condition and allows PLHIV with a suppressed viral load (PLHIV-s) to live normal lives. Despite this, safety concerns and a lack of high-level data have hindered the use of systemic psoriasis therapies in PLHIV-s. OBJECTIVES: We aim to provide a structured framework that supports healthcare professionals and patients discussing the risks and benefits of systemic psoriasis therapy in PLHIV-s. Our goal was to address the primary question, are responses to systemic therapies for the treatment of psoriasis in PLHIV-s similar to those in the non-HIV population? METHODS: We implemented an inference-based approach relying on indirect evidence when direct clinical trial data were absent. In this instance, we reviewed indirect evidence supporting inferences on the status of immune function in PLHIV. Recommendations on systemic treatment for psoriasis in PLHIV were derived using an inferential heuristic. RESULTS: We identified seven indirect indicators of immune function informed by largely independent bodies of evidence: (1) functional assays, (2) vaccine response, (3) life expectancy, (4) psoriasis manifestations, (5) rate of infections, (6) rate of malignancies, and (7) organ transplant outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-related benefits and risks when treating a patient with systemic psoriasis therapies are similar for non-HIV patients and PLHIV with a suppressed viral load and normalized CD4 counts. Prior to initiating psoriasis treatment in PLHIV, HIV replication should be addressed by an HIV specialist. Exercise additional caution for patients with a suppressed viral load and discordant CD4 responses on antiretroviral therapy.

Survey measures included demographic characteristics; exposure to COVID-19; impact of COVID-19 on employment, finance, and work and social adjustment; loneliness, thwarted belongingness, and health behavior changes as modifiable factors. Outcome measures were psychological distress and wellbeing. RESULTS: Linear regression models revealed that COVID-19 related work and social adjustment difficulties, financial distress, loneliness, thwarted belongingness, eating a less healthy diet poorer sleep and being female were all associated with increased psychological distress and reduced wellbeing (p < 0.05). Psychological distress was more elevated for those with high difficulties adjusting to COVID-19 and high levels of thwarted belongingness (p < 0.005).

Piroxicam (Px) loaded P/Z hydrogel microspheres (P/Z HM) were developed, and their extended-release pharmacokinetic properties were evaluated. METHODS Experiments were executed under three different conditions: in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Then, the in vitro-in vivo correlations (IVIVC) and ex vivo - in vivo correlations (EVIVC) were examined. RESULTS Analysis of drug release mechanisms were evaluated by fitting the in vitro data into the Ritger-Peppas equation, showing the contribution of both polymers' relaxation and drug diffusion from the hydrogel microspheres. The fraction absorbed in vivo was determined by the deconvolution of plasma concentration data using the Loo-Riegelman method. After oral single-dose administration of the two formulations, their basic independent model parameters were calculated. CONCLUSION P/Z HM had different drug release behaviors in in vitro and in vivo conditions. However, the ex vivo and in vivo characteristics were similar (R2 = 0.99). This seemed reasonable to use the ex vivo method to predict the in vivo drug absorption behavior during the polymeric drug delivery system developmental studies. The P/Z HM formulation maintained the drug dose at the colon site for a long duration and could be applied for delivery of active pharmaceutical and food ingredients to the colon site.","output":"Evaluation of Extended-Release of Piroxicam Loaded Pectin-Zein Hydrogel Microspheres: In Vitro, Ex Vivo, and In Vivo Studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Worldwide spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused overwhelming mortality rate during preceding half of the year 2020 Although coronavirus infection was known for mostly respiratory tract involvement, novel COVID-19 pandemic showed excessive cardiac mortality and arrhythmic complications We aimed to summarize current literature and emphasize on underlying pathological mechanisms and global point of view to coronavirus and arrhythmia relationship","output":"Arrhythmias in COVID-19: Clinical significance and management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SOURCE CITATION: Madhi SA, Baillie V, Cutland CL, et al.

Anxiety developed in the general public and physicians faced a huge challenge in many aspects. We conducted this prospective study to develop a scoring system based on the clinical manifestations for predicting the results of influenza rapid testing, as a surrogate of influenza rapid testing, to lower the anxiety and decrease the burden for the test. METHODS: From September 1, 2009 to October 5, 2009, pediatric patients who received influenza rapid tests were enrolled, and questionnaires were recorded and analyzed in the first 2 weeks. A further scoring system was conducted to predict the results of influenza rapid tests and validated in the next 3 weeks. RESULTS: Eight hundred and forty-five children were enrolled in our study. In the first phase, data from 506 patients showed that those with age  5 years, fever  38C, contact history of influenza A infection, myalgia, lethargy, sore throat, cough, and headache had a higher risk of positive results (odds ratio: 1.1C2.53). A scoring system was designed, with 5 points indicating acceptable sensitivity (69.5%) and specificity (63.6%). Three hundred and thirty-nine patients in the second phase were enrolled to validate the scoring system and the positive and negative predictive values were 52.0% and 73.8%. CONCLUSION: The emergence of H1N1v infection is not only an important medical issue, but also a socioeconomic problem. Based on easily available clinical information, we develop a scoring system as a preliminary screening tool for the general public and first-line health care providers to evaluate the possibility of influenza virus infection. Although this study was limited by the sensitivity of rapid tests, this type of model may be a surrogate weapon when faced with overwhelming pandemic infection in the future, especially in areas with scarce medical resources.","output":"A scoring system for predicting results of influenza rapid test in children: A possible model facing overwhelming pandemic infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic urges the extremely sensitive and prompt detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

To further complicate this, the Omicron variant, with numerous spike mutations, has emerged. These circumstances have created the need to assess the potential of immune evasion by the Omicron in individuals with various immune histories. Methods The neutralization susceptibility of the variants including the Omicron and their ancestor was comparably assessed using a panel of plasma/serum derived from individuals with divergent immune histories. Blood samples were collected from either mRNA vaccinees or from those who suffered from breakthrough infections by the Alpha/Delta with multiple time intervals following vaccination. Findings The Omicron was highly resistant to neutralization in fully vaccinated individuals without a history of breakthrough infections. In contrast, robust cross-neutralization against the Omicron were induced in vaccinees that experienced breakthrough infections. The time interval between vaccination and infection, rather than the variant types of infection, was significantly correlated with the magnitude and potency of Omicron-neutralizing antibodies. Conclusions Immune histories with breakthrough infections can overcome the resistance to infection by the Omicron, with the vaccination-infection interval being the key determinant of the magnitude and breadth of neutralization. The diverse exposure history in each individual warrants a tailored and cautious approach to understanding population immunity against the Omicron and future variants.

MATERIAL AND METHODS An open-label, randomized, low-interventional study included patients with moderate new coronavirus infection COVID-19 over 18 years of age of both sexes. IFN- 500,000 IU was administered s/c, daily, once a day, during 5 days. RESULTS IFN-y in addition to complex therapy of the disease resulted in more favorable changes in the stabilization of vital signs, as well as in reduced length of fever and hospital stay by 2 days what allows suggesting a positive effect of this substance on the recovery processes in patients with moderate COVID-19.

There is no report on XA presenting as a functioning adrenal mass in the literature. We present a case of XA mimicking a functioning adrenocortical carcinoma. CASE REPORT: A 52-year-old man presented with right flank pain, fever, vomiting, and loss of appetite for 2 weeks. He had signs of dehydration and elevated blood glucose level. Ultrasonography revealed a right adrenal mass. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed lobulated and necrotic mass replacing the right suprarenal gland and encasing the right renal vein, adjacent inferior vena cava, psoas, and diaphragm. There was loss of fat planes with liver and upper pole of the right kidney. Biochemical evaluation indicated increased serum and urine cortisol levels. As a sequel to hypercortisolism-induced hyperglycemia, he developed spontaneous chest wall abscess and bilateral sudden vision loss due to vitreous hemorrhages. Pus and blood culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Adrenal suppressant ketoconazole was administered for better glycemic control. With a diagnosis of locally advanced adrenocortical malignancy, right radical adreno-nephrectomy was performed, and cut section revealed a pus collection of around 100 mL. Histopathology examination showed xanthogranulomatous inflammation involving adrenal gland, Gerota's fascia, psoas, and lymph nodes. Postoperatively, the patient recovered satisfactorily with favorable glycemic control.

Methods: Statewide cohort of all adult residents in Indiana tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1 and December 31, 2020, linked to electronic health records. Primary measures were per capita rates of infection, hospitalization, and death. Age adjusted rates were calculated for multiple time periods corresponding to public health mitigation efforts. Results: Morbidity and mortality increased over time with notable differences among sub-populations. Initially, per capita hospitalizations among racial minorities were 3-4 times higher than whites, and per capita deaths among urban residents were twice those of rural residents. By fall 2020, per capita hospitalizations and deaths in rural areas surpassed those of urban areas, and gaps between black/brown and white populations narrowed. Cumulative morbidity and mortality were highest among minority groups and in rural communities.

Previous proof of formal reductive incompleteness and necessary meta-consideration in determining reductive logical consistency, permits the meta-construction of adjacent possible meta-reductive paradigms. An imagined Meta-Reductive Paradigm then allows for a search in an adjacent possible conceptual space, beyond the boundary of the Reductive Paradigm, looking for possible adaptations that might enhance the resilience of individual and community level responses to the Covid-19 pandemic and economic crisis. Unrecognized formal incompleteness of reductive scientific Logic is related to the unresolved integration of Reductive Science and Complexity Science. The lack of integration of these two broad areas of scientific interest, is in part associated with a diminished interest in formal reductive logic and its properties, particularly in the Complexity Sciences. The failure to sustain a strong link to rigorous reductive logic could indirectly relate to diminished public trust in scientific and medical information, with consequent political failure to effectively integrate scientific and medical advice in response to the Covid-19 situation. Careful meta-consideration reveals a subtle way to address formal reductive incompleteness and meta-construct an adjacent possible Meta-reductive CAS Model (MCAS) and Meta-reductive Paradigm (MRP). The strong link to logic and differentiated truth and proof in the proposed MCAS and MRP can integrate willful, intentional, brain, mind and consciousness in Nature, as well as spell-out a number of scientific and social adaptations that could improve the integration of medical and scientific information in the political management of the Covid-19 crisis, increasing the chance that humanity will be better prepared for the next pandemic or next urgent global crisis. ? 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Pandemic Preparation, Consciousness and Complex Adaptive Systems Through the Lens of a Meta-reductive Scientific Paradigm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Decrease of seismic noise level, after reduction of traffic due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been observed worldwide.

MAIN TEXT We searched five electronic databases. We included case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies that included a headache and back pain free group, reporting on any association between persistent LBP and primary headache disorders. Methodological quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Our primary outcome was the association between primary headache disorders and persistent LBP. Our secondary outcomes were any associations between severity of LBP and severity of headache, and the relationship between specific headache sub-types classified as per International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria and persistent LBP. We included 14 studies. The sizes of the studies ranged from 88 participants to a large international study with 404, 206 participants. Odds ratios for the association were between 1.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.11) and 8.00 (95% CI 5.3-12.1). Study heterogeneity meant statistical pooling was not possible. Only two studies presented data investigating persistent LBP and chronic headache disorders in accordance with ICDH criteria.

Still, theres no specific drug or preventive medication to treat ZIKA infection despite comprehensive analysis by the researchers. This study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of some plant derived bioactive compounds against ZIKV by using both structure and ligand based virtual screening methods. A number of 35 plant metabolites were screened against ZIKA NS2B-NS3 protease (5LC0), Envelop protein (5JHM), Capsid protein (5YGH) and NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein (5U04) employing molecular docking approach. Results showed that there have been four metabolites, i.e. Chicoric acid, Luteone, Reserpine and Rosmarinic acid provide highest binding affinity to targeted ZIKV proteins. Crucial binding sites and drug surface hotspots are unraveled for every targeted viral protein. The ADME study showed that neither of the candidate compounds had side effects that would reduce their drug-like properties. As compared, the toxicity pattern analysis has unmasked the non-toxic essence of top drug candidates. The RMSD values of ligand-macromolecule complexes were 2 ? apart from Envelop protein- Chicoric Acid, although the RMSF values showed normal atomic fluctuations within the molecular dynamics analysis, with the exception of Envelop protein- Chicoric Acid. The expected majority of the target class the highest drug candidates is enzyme classes (e.g. protease, hydrolase, phosphatase). In addition, the drug similarity prediction revealed several structural analogs from drugbank such as Isoformononetin (DB04202), Deserpidine (DB01089) and Rescinnamine (DB01180) etc. and these analogs could even be an option for the treatment of ZIKV infections.

This study aimed to characterize differences in gastrointestinal endoscopies in the New York metropolitan region before, during, and after the first wave of the pandemic. Methods Across three hospitals, we compared demographics, indications, and yield of endoscopies before and after March 16, 2020, the date on which elective procedures were cancelled, as well as a recovery period for five months after they were resumed. Results A total of 9,401 procedures before and 332 procedures were performed during the first wave. Females comprised 57% and 44% of patients (p <0.01), respectively. There was a decline in the proportion of Black (15% vs. 7%, p <0.02) and Hispanic patients (29% vs. 16%, p <0.02) undergoing outpatient procedures. There was a significant rise in urgent indications such as bleeding and jaundice. There was an increase in the diagnostic yield of all esophagogastroduodenoscopies for bleeding (p <0.01) and in outpatient endoscopic ultrasounds for malignancy (p = 0.01), but no increase in yield of inpatient colonoscopy for bleeding. Review of 7,475 procedures during the recovery period showed a return to many non-urgent indications, but still showed decreased proportions of Hispanic and male patients compared to the pre-pandemic period. Discussion / Conclusion Lower proportions of Black and Hispanic patients underwent outpatient endoscopies during and after the first wave. The proportion of procedures done for emergent indications, and their diagnostic yield, increased during the pandemic, suggesting a higher threshold to perform endoscopy.

It contributes to the understanding of medical explanation, both at the general level of the causes of diseases and at the individual level of the diagnoses of particular cases of a disease. The syntactic, model-theoretic, paradigm, and third-world accounts fail to capture the complexity of medical theories and explanations. Explanations of a disease do not always need to go down to the deep biochemical level displayed. Depending on the problem and audience at hand, a medical explanation may operate at a superficial levelfor example, when physicians tell their patients how they got sick. The most important task in medical research after determining the cause of a disease is developing a treatment for it. While drug discovery used to be largely a matter of serendipity or exhaustive search, current pharmaceutical research is based on a deep understanding of the molecular bases of a disease. Once investigators identify the way defective pathways lead to various diseases, they can search selectively for drugs that correct the defects. Psychology and the other fields of cognitive science have contributed to the powerful theories of mental representation and processingfor example, the theories of concepts, rules, images, and neural networks.","output":"4 What is a medical theory?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Location-based games (LBGs) are typically played outdoors, as moving in the game is done by moving in the real world. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people were advised and even forced by governments to stay home and avoid social contact to slow down the spreading of the virus. The major LBG developers reacted by making in-game adjustments that allow playing from home, while still maintaining some incentives for players to go outdoors and socialise. For investigating factors influencing intention to play LBGs socially during the on-going pandemic, we collected cross-sectional survey data (N=855) from Finnish players of the most popular LBG, Pokmon GO. The results showed that perceived severity of the pandemic and a positive attitude towards both governmental measures and in-game changes for combatting COVID-19 predicted intention to reduce social playing. Fear of missing out and deficient self-regulation increased playing intensity, which in turn negatively correlated with the intention to reduce social playing. Our findings demonstrate the influence that LBGs can have on human behaviour even during global crises such as COVID-19.

After a viral infection, one of the genes activated by IFN induction is the IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) that encodes an ubiquitin-like protein that undergoes a reversible post-translational modification (ISGylation). ISG15 can also act unconjugated, intracellularly and secreted, acting as a cytokine. Although ISG15 has an essential role in host-defense responses to microbial infection, it remains to be defined its role as immunomodulator in the vaccine field. In this investigation, we showed that ISG15 exerts an immunomodulatory role in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines. In mice, after priming with a DNA-ISG15 vector mixed with a DNA expressing HIV-1 gp120 followed by a booster with an MVA vector expressing HIV-1 antigens, both ISG15 conjugated (ISG15-wt) or unconjugated (ISG15-mut) act as immune adjuvants by increasing the magnitude and quality of HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, with ISG15-wt providing better immunostimulatory activity than ISG15-mut. The HIV-1 Env-specific CD8 T cell responses showed a predominant T effector memory (TEM) phenotype in all groups. Moreover, the amount of DNA-gp120 used to immunize mice could be reduced 5-fold after mixing with DNA-ISG15 without affecting the potency and the quality of the HIV-1 Env-specific immune responses. Our study clearly highlights the potential use of the IFN-induced ISG15 protein as immune adjuvant to enhance immune responses to HIV antigens, suggesting that this molecule might be exploitable for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccine approaches against pathogens.IMPORTANCE Our study described the potential role of ISG15 as an immunomodulatory molecule in the optimization of HIV/AIDS vaccine candidates. Using a DNA prime/MVA boost immunization protocol, our results indicated an increase in the potency and the quality of the HIV-1 Env-specific CD8 T cell response. These results highlight the adjuvant potency of ISG15 to elicit improved viral antigen presentation to the immune system, resulting in an enhanced HIV-1 vaccine immune response.

The Spanish Government obliges the entire population to remain confined to their homes, with the exception of essential basic services, to stop the spread of COVID-19. Home isolation implies a notable physical deconditioning. Telerehabilitation methods have reported positive experiences, and we propose to study in affected patients of COVID-19, due to the general house confinement of the entire Spanish population. METHODS: Patients will be recruited in the regions of Andalusia, Murcia, and Valencia (Spain). Patients will remain confined to their homes, and there, they will carry out their assigned exercise program, which will be controlled telematically. Evaluators will attend to carry out all measurements at the beginning, during, and end of the study, telematically controlled. The patients will be randomly divided into three groups, two of them will perform a home exercise program (breathing exercises or non-specific exercises for muscle toning) and the third group will perform sedentary activities, using mental activation techniques, and will act as a sham group. We will evaluate respiratory variables and other variables of the physical state through physical tests, effort, and perceived fatigue. The data will be statistically analyzed, and the hypotheses will be tested between the groups, using the SPSS software, v.24, considering a 95% confidence interval. DISCUSSION: We will analyze the results, in terms of the level of fatigue and perceived exertion, physical health, and maintenance of respiratory activity of two types of exercise programs, toning and respiratory, applied in patients affected by COVID-19 during the period of home confinement. We intend to investigate a field not previously studied, such as the repercussion of carrying out a toning and respiratory exercise program in these patients, in historical circumstances that no one had previously observed in Spain, since the general population has never been forced to remain confined in their homes, due to a pandemic infection, by a coronavirus (COVID-19). Observing the effects that these two home exercise programs could produce in patients infected with COVID-19, we will try to better analyze and understand the mechanisms that are associated with the worsening of breathing in this type of patient.

There were 6 male and 5 female patients, with age range of 16-72 years old and median age of 53 years old. Five patients underwent CIFA Type B and D, and the other 6 underwent CIFA A and B. All patients were followed up regularly by CT and MRI to observe possible recurrence. Results: Among the 5 patients with CIFA Type B and D, 3 were giant cell tumor and 2 were giant cell reparative granuloma, and median maximum cross-section size was 42 mm46 mm (range from 37 mm18 mm to 56 mm53 mm). Among the 6 patients with CIFA Type A and B, 4 were paraganglioma of head and neck, 1 was schwannoma of skull base, 1 was petrous cholesteatoma, and median maximum cross-section size was 43 mm36 mm (range from 24 mm22 mm to 63 mm35 mm). Nine patients underwent complete resection of the tumor in the first stage. In 2 patients, the extracranial parts were removed in the first stage, and the intracranial part was removed in the second stage. Tympanum and ossicular reconstruction were done in one of the CIFA Type B and group D, and 1 year's postoperative hearing was mild conductive hearing loss. There was no cerebrospinal fluid leakage of all patients. All the 5 patients with normal facial nerve function before surgery recovered to H-B grade  to  within 3 months after surgery. Among the 4 patients whose preoperative facial nerve function were grade , 2 recovered to grade I after surgery and the other 2 were still grade . For the patient whose preoperative facial nerve function was grade , his postoperative recovery was grade . There was 1 patient whose pre-operative FN function was H-B grade , and the post-operative FN function was grade  due to FN resection. Except for 2 cases with cochlear involved before surgery, cochleae of the other 9 cases were preserved. The follow-up time was 14 to 58 months. No recurrence was observed in all patients. Conclusions: The CIFA can safely and completely remove the extensive lesions that invade the skull base, and the facial nerve function can be well protected and recovered intro-and post-operation. Appropriate use of combined IFA can not only achieve good exposure and complete resection of lesions, but also create conditions for functional reconstruction.","output":"[Surgery technique of combined different infratemporal fossa approaches for lesions in lateral skull base]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Design of microfluidic biochips has led to newer challenges to the EDA community due to the availability of various flow-based architectures and the need for catering to diverse applications such as sample preparation, personalized medicine, point-of-care diagnostics, and drug design. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has increased the demand for low-cost diagnostic lab-on-chips manifold. Sample preparation (dilution or mixing of biochemical fluids) is an indispensable step of any biochemical experiment including sensitive detection and successful assay execution downstream. Although for valve-based microfluidic biochips various design automation tools are currently available, they are expensive, and prone to various manufacturing and operational defects. Additionally, many problems are left open in the domain of free-flowing biochips, where only a single layer of flow-channels is used for fluid-flow devoid of any kind of control layer/valves. In this work, we present a methodology for designing a free-flowing biochip that is capable of performing fluid dilution according to users requirement. The proposed algorithm for sample preparation utilizes the Farey-sequence arithmetic of fractions that are used to represent the concentration factor of the target fluid. We also present the detailed layout design of a free-flowing microfluidic architecture that emulates the dilution algorithm. The network is simulated using COMSOL multi-physics software accounting for relevant hydrodynamic parameters. Experiments on various test-cases support the efficacy of the proposed design in terms of accuracy, convergence time, reactant cost, and simplicity of the fluidic network compared to prior art.","output":"Sample Preparation Meets Farey Sequence: A New Design Technique for Free-Flowing Microfluidic Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Given the expectations regarding continued improvement in sports relay broadcasting, research related to Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) relay broadcasting is necessary for it to align with the priorities of viewers.

We commenced virtual reviews as an innovative way of offering the service at our large adult CF centre (350 pwCF), and maintained this for most pwCF when shielding ended in August 2020. We now report on the initial impact of this system on patient engagement with physiotherapy. Method: We compared outpatient clinic contacts pre-COVID (01/01/2020C17/03/2020) with remote contacts during shielding (18/3/20C31/7/20) and also when shielding had ended (up to 30/9/20), specifically looking at physiotherapy input. Results: Pre-COVID, there were 324 face-to-face clinic visits, where 244 pwCF (75%) accessed a physiotherapist, 9 (3%) declined review, and in 71 (22%) cases it was not offered due to lack of capacity. During shielding, in 424 virtual clinics, 352 pwCF (83%) accessed a physiotherapist, 64 (15%) declined/did not access physio, and 10 (2%) were not offered review. Once shielding ended, in 281 virtual clinics, 234 pwCF (83%) accessed physio review, 45 (16%) declined/did not access review and 7 (3%) were not offered review. Conclusion: We found virtual clinics during the COVID pandemic a useful way of providing physiotherapy review for our pwCF, and indeed it helped improve capacity.

There was no difference between vaccine groups in serum antibody responses or the kinetics of the early PBMC-derived B cell responses. Although our sample cohort was small, these data are different from profiles in younger individuals at early time points post-immunisation and suggest that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines may not quantitatively enhance the generation of memory responses in the elderly.","output":"The early kinetics of circulating pneumococcal-specific memory B cells following pneumococcal conjugate and plain polysaccharide vaccines in the elderly."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It is often assumed that traditional forms of media such as books enhance well-being, whereas new media do not.

A three-phase online Delphi process and virtual consensus meeting sought consensus over the investigation, management, and research priorities from multidisciplinary clinicians caring for children with PIMS-TS. We used 140 consensus statements to derive a consensus management pathway that describes the initial investigation of children with suspected PIMS-TS, including blood markers to help determine the severity of disease, an echocardiogram, and a viral and septic screen to exclude other infectious causes of illness. The importance of a multidisciplinary team in decision making for children with PIMS-TS is highlighted throughout the guidance, along with the recommended treatment options, including supportive care, intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and biological therapies.

The median age was 43 years (range, 29-68 years), and the majority were male (62%). At the time of the survey, nearly all participants self-reported an outbreak in their country (99.7%). Personal protective equipment was available to all participants, of which surgical mask was the most common (n = 308; 90%). Telemedicine, in the form of phone or video encounters, was common and implemented by 80% (n = 273). Testing patients with cancer for COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction before systemic treatment was not routinely implemented: 58% reported no routine testing, 39% performed testing in selected patients, and 3% performed systematic testing in all patients. The most significant factors influencing an oncologist's decision making regarding choice of systemic therapy included patient age and comorbidities (81% and 92%, respectively). Although hormonal treatments and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were considered to be relatively safe, cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune therapies were perceived as being less safe or unsafe by participants. The vast majority of participants stated that during the pandemic they would use less chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and steroids. Although treatment in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and first-line metastatic disease was less affected, most of the participants stated that they would be more hesitant to recommend second- or third-line therapies in metastatic disease.

Second, most governments that have implemented multiple stay-at-home orders over the course of the pandemic have become less sensitive to case levels (insofar as they implement subsequent restrictions at progressively higher case levels), apart from a small number of contrast cases which have mostly eliminated domestic community transmission. Third, pandemic policies are increasingly specific to subnational levels, and there is often significant heterogeneity with regard to policy approaches even within the same country.","output":"A year of living distantly: global trends in the use of stay-at-home orders over the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Most research on loneliness comes from the health sciences, statistically seeking to measure the health-related effects of feeling alone or isolated. There is a need to expand on this understanding and explore loneliness as a more complex social phenomenon. In this article, we present a qualitative design for studying the intersection between loneliness, technology and culture. Conceptualising this as the cultural dialectic between loneliness and technology, we aim to unpack the reciprocal ways by which understandings of loneliness shape technology, while technologies also affect societys understandings of loneliness. In elucidating this dialectic, we aim to develop new knowledge and a novel theoretical framework for understanding loneliness and its technological solutions, which, in turn, can enable better solutions to contemporary problems of loneliness. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will adopt a qualitative approach that combines interviews, participant observation and textual analysis to explore loneliness and its technological solutions from the perspectives of policy-makers, producers, professionals and users in Norway and the UK. The data will be analysed through an analytical framework combining insights from discourse theory and philosophical debates on presence, which will allow us to capture and rethink fundamental assumptions about loneliness and technology. Outcomes will be revised understandings of loneliness, relevant to researchers, entrepreneurs, policy-makers, clinicians, educators and the broader public. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project has been evaluated and approved by the data protection officer at Oslo Metropolitan University and by the Norwegian Social Science Data Services. Additional ethical approval for data collection in the UK has been provided by the University of Oxford Interdivisional Research Ethics Committee.

Twelve variables, including demographic (the population density, percentage of 65 years and over, percentage of non-Hispanic White, percentage of Hispanic, percentage of non-Hispanic Black, and percentage of Asian individuals), air toxins (PM2.5), climate (precipitation, humidity, temperature), behavior and comorbidity (smoking rate, cardiovascular death rate) were gathered and considered as potential risk factors. Based on four geographical detectors (risk detector, factor detector, ecological detector, and interaction detector) provided by the novel Geographical Detector technique, we assessed the spatial risk patterns of COVID-19 mortality and identified the effects of these factors. This study found that population density and percentage of non-Hispanic Black individuals were the two most important factors responsible for the COVID-19 mortality rate. Additionally, the interactive effects between any pairs of factors were even more significant than their individual effects. Most existing research examined the roles of risk factors independently, as traditional models are usually unable to account for the interaction effects between different factors. Based on the Geographical Detector technique, this studys findings showed that causes of COVID-19 mortality were complex. The joint influence of two factors was more substantial than the effects of two separate factors.

METHODS: Change in volumes and hospitalization were assessed for statistical significance using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors model from January 2018 to December 2020. RESULTS: The pandemic's impact on volumes and hospitalization varied by site. In Denver (CO), there was a statistically significant 9% decrease in overall volumes, although an 18% increase in hospitalizations was not significant. In New York City (NY), there was a significant 7% decrease in volumes as well as a significant 6% decrease in hospitalizations. In Portland (OR), volumes decreased by 4% and hospitalizations increased by 6% although differences did not reach statistical significance.

To analyze progress in organizational structures, mechanisms, strategies, and enabling factors and barriers towards gender mainstreaming (GM) in health in Guatemala, Guyana, and Peru, given GMs role in addressing gender inequalities in health as a key structural driver of health equity. METHODS. Data was obtained through a grey literature review of laws, policies, and/or program documents and semi-structured qualitative interviews with 37 informants. Analysis was based on a theoretical framework including 7 categories considered essential to advance GM in the health sector. RESULTS. Despite significant efforts and accumulated experiences of GM in health, structural barriers include: wider societal challenges of transforming gender unequal power relations; health system complexity combined with the low technical, political, and financial capacity of institutional structures tasked with GM; and limited coordination with (often weak) National Womens Machineries (NWMs). In some contexts, barriers are compounded by limited understanding of basic concepts underlying GM (at times exacerbated by misunderstandings related to intersectionality and/or engagement with men) and the absence of indicators to measure GMs concrete results and impact. CONCLUSIONS. Successful GM requires a more strategic and transformational agenda, developed and implemented in coordination with NWMs and civil society and with reference to external bodies (e.g. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women) to go beyond process, with clearer distinction between gender sensitivity and gender transformation, and definition of expected results and indicators to measure advances. These then could be better documented and systematized, enabling GM to be more broadly understood and operationalized as a concrete instrument towards health equity.","output":"Igualdad de gnero y equidad en salud: lecciones estratgicas de las experiencias de los pases en la incorporacin de la perspectiva de gnero en la salud"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Talking about dying, death, and loss may be difficult.

The aims were to evaluate (1) safety and technical feasibility; (2) procedural duration; and (3) subjective workload assessment of EUS-guided intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (EIPS). METHODS Five Yorkshire pigs were used in the study. The HV or inferior vena cava (IVC) was identified using a linear-array echoendoscope and accessed with a 19-G FNA needle preloaded with a digital pressure wire. Mean pressure was recorded. The needle was advanced into the PV, where pressure measurements were again taken, and ultimately exchanged over a guidewire. A lumen-apposing metal stent was deployed under EUS and fluoroscopic guidance, with distal and proximal ends positioned inside the PV and HV (IVC), respectively. Dilation was performed, and pressure measurements repeated. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (TLI) was scored. Animals survived 2 weeks before necropsy. RESULTS EIPS was successful in 5 out of 5 pigs. Mean time required for EUS identification, needle access, pressure measurement, and stent placement was 43 (31-55) minutes. NASA TLI scores revealed moderate workload. Mean baseline pressure measurements were PV 7.0 (5-9) and HV/IVC 5.0 (3-7) mm Hg and PV 6.3 (5-7) and HV/IVC 6.0 (4-7) mm Hg after. All animals survived 2 weeks. No bleeding was seen on necropsy. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of EIPS using LAMS, with direct portal pressure measurement, in a survival model. In addition, the procedure was performed quickly with moderate technical demand.","output":"EUS-guided intrahepatic portosystemic shunt with direct portal pressure measurements: a novel alternative to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While the importance of viral infections is well studied in domestic cats, only limited information is available on their occurence and prevalence in the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), parvovirus (FPV), immunodeficiency virus (FIV), leukemia virus (FeLV), and FeLV antigenemia in 51 European wildcat sera. Samples were collected between 1996 and 1997 from wildcat populations in France, Switzerland, and Germany. Antibodies to FCoV were detected in two cats (4%) and FCoV RNA was detected in feces of one of these two cats. Antibodies to FCV, FHV and FPV were found at relatively low frequencies of 16%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. Antibodies to FIV were not detected. Although antigen and antibodies to FeLV were detected in 49%, and 75%, respectively, no evidence of FeLV-associated pathology was found. From the low prevalence of FCoV, FCV, FHV and FPV infections and from the fact that the European wildcats live solitarily, it was concluded that these viral infections do not spread readily within a population. Therefore, it may be assumed that release into the wild of European wildcats bred in captivity would not bring about a high risk of introducing of these viral infections to the free-ranging wildcats. As an exception, wildcats should be tested for absence of FIV infection before release if they were at risk to acquire this infection from domestic cats.","output":"Viral infections in free-living populations of the European wildcat."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In South Korea, 13 745 cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had been reported as of 19 July, 2020. To examine spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we aimed to present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 in the country. METHODS: Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers and doubling time for COVID-19 in Korea. RESULTS: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu had yet to experience a second wave of the disease. During the first wave, mean Rt for these areas reached 3.5-4.4, and doubling time ranged from 2.8 to 4.6 days.

Computational approaches combined with in vitro studies can be used to predict and validate the potential for an approved drug to interact with additional (often unwanted) targets and identify potential safety-related concerns. Potential off-targets of the JAK inhibitors baricitinib and tofacitinib were identified using two established machine learning approaches based on ligand similarity. The identified targets related to thrombosis or viral infection/reactivation were subsequently validated using in vitro assays. Inhibitory activity was identified for four drug-target pairs (PDE10A [baricitinib], TRPM6 [tofacitinib], PKN2 [baricitinib, tofacitinib]). Previously unknown off-target interactions of the two JAK inhibitors were identified. As the proposed pharmacological effects of these interactions include attenuation of pulmonary vascular remodeling, modulation of HCV response, and hypomagnesemia, the newly identified off-target interactions cannot explain an increased risk of thrombosis or viral infection/reactivation.

Onset is typically between the ages of 20 and 30 years. It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, notably due to its effects on the cardiovascular system. It has a poorly understood global epidemiology. Our objective was to systematically review the available evidence in order to calculate the incidence rate of TAK. METHODS: Three databases (MEDLINE, PubMed and Embase) were searched in November 2019 and the results were screened by two reviewers. A random effects meta-analysis was then conducted in R to calculate the overall incidence rate. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2). The quality of the studies was assessed using an adapted NewcastleCOttawa scale. Further subgroup analyses were performed by quality, sex, research setting and geographical location. Publication bias was assessed using a Beggs funnel plot. RESULTS: The incidence rate for TAK was 1.11 per million person-years (95% CI 0.70C1.76). The heterogeneity in the data was extremely high in all analyses, which suggests that there was considerable variation in incidence rates across the different populations studied. TAK was found to be more common in women (incidence rate 2.01 per million person-years, 95% CI 1.39C2.90). CONCLUSIONS: TAK is an extremely rare disease. It affects women more commonly than men.

Corticosteroids reduce mortality in COVID-19 patients in need of supportive oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation. It is essential that a COPD patient who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 is closely followed over time because any delay in diagnosis and initiation of appropriate therapy could negatively affect his/her prognosis.

This paper is a retrospective estimate of the probability of an infectious passenger in the air travel system transmitting the SARS-CoV-2 virus to a fellow passenger. METHODS: Literature was reviewed from May-September 2020 to identify COVID-19 cases related to air travel. The studies were limited to publicly available literature for passengers; studies of flight crews were not reviewed. A novel quantitative approach was developed to estimate air travel transmission risk that considers secondary cases, the overall passenger population, and correction factors for asymptomatic transmission and underreporting. RESULTS: There were at least 2866 index infectious passengers documented to have passed through the air travel system in a 1.4 billion passenger population. Using correction factors, the global risk of transmission during air travel is estimated at 1:1.7 million; acknowledging that assumptions exist around case detection rate and mass screenings. Uncertainty in the correction factors and a 95% credible interval indicate risk ranges from 1 case for every 712,000 travelers to 1 case for every 8 million travelers.

The objective of this study was to understand the acceptability of a new treatment for depressed adolescents in primary care settings. METHODS: Adolescents participating in a 10-week MBSG treatment were interviewed to understand their perspectives on the acceptability and effectiveness of the treatment. Interviews were collected at post-intervention and at a 3-month follow-up visit. RESULTS: A total of 39 adolescents completed both the post-intervention and 3-month follow-up interview. At post-intervention and follow-up, 84% of adolescents stated the MBSGs helped them. When asked how the MBSGs helped them, 3 areas were identified: learning new MBSG activities and skills, social connection with others within the group, and outcomes related to the group. Many adolescents reported no concerns with the MBSGs (49% at post- intervention; 62% at follow-up). Those with concerns identified certain activities as not being useful, wanting the group to be longer, and the time of group (after school) being inconvenient. Most adolescents reported that their life had changed because of the group (72% at post-intervention; 61% at follow-up), and when asked how, common responses included feeling less isolated and more hopeful. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents found the MBSGs to be helpful and acceptable as a treatment option for depression in primary care.

The expert sample was created through a contact network in vaccine development and supplemented with corresponding authors of recent scholarly review articles on vaccine development. RESULTS: In aggregate, lay people gave responses that were within 3 months of experts, tending to be later than experts for early milestones and earlier for later milestones. Median lay best estimates for when a vaccine would be available to the public were 08/2021 and 09/2021 for the US and Canadian samples, compared with 09-10/2021 for the experts. However, many individual lay responses showed more substantial disagreement with expert opinions, with 54% of lay best estimates of when a vaccine would be available to the public being before the median expert soonest estimate or after the median expert latest estimate. Lay people were much more pessimistic about vaccine development encountering setbacks than experts (median probability 59% of boxed warning compared with only 30% for experts).

We conducted an online survey of active clinician members of the Parkinson Study Group (PSG) to evaluate the adoption of various non-face-to-face methods in clinical practice and research in PD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted a survey using the open-access online SurveyMonkey tool (http://www.surveymonkey.com). The survey had 27 items and was designed to elucidate clinical/research care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was sent to 414 active PSG members with weekly reminders and it remained accessible for 30 days from May 2020. RESULTS We received 142 responses, of which 133 (93.7%) provided demographic data. The clinical use of virtual visits via synchronous video conferencing increased from 39.5% pre-COVID-19 to 94.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lack of access for patients (68.2%) and patient resistance (51.4%) were the top barriers for its use. Approximately 70% respondents stated that 75-100% of their research activities were suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many sites had to fill out protocol deviations (38.2%), protocol exceptions (25.5%) or change their research profile due to layoffs (16.8%).

METHODOLOGY This study was conducted using daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 collected from the official Ministry of Health, Malaysia (MOH) and John Hopkins University websites. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was fitted to the training data of observed cases from 22 January to 31 March 2020, and subsequently validated using data on cases from 1 April to 17 April 2020. The ARIMA model satisfactorily forecasted the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases from 18 April 2020 to 1 May 2020 (the testing phase). RESULTS The ARIMA (0,1,0) model produced the best fit to the observed data with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) value of 16.01 and a Bayes Information Criteria (BIC) value of 4.170. The forecasted values showed a downward trend of COVID-19 cases until 1 May 2020.

This study aims to characterize AFP trajectories after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and examine its impact on clinical outcomes. Methods: This longitudinal, multicenter, retrospective, cohort study examined data from the electronic medical record system of four hospitals in China between January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2016. A latent class growth mixed model was applied to distinguish potential AFP dynamic changing trajectories. The multivariable Cox models were used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% CIs for overall survival. Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted analyses were performed to eliminate unmeasured confounders through marginal structural models. Findings: A total of 881 patients, who had intermediate-stage HCC with AFP repeatedly measured 3 to 10 times, were included in the study. Three distinct trajectories were identified using the latent class growth mixture model: high-rising (25.7%; n = 226), low-stable (58.7%; n = 517), and sharp-falling (AFP serological response, 15.6%; n = 138). Compared with the low-stable class, the aHRs for death were 5.13 (3.71, 7.10) and 0.52 (0.33, 0.81) for the high-rising and sharp-falling class, adjusted by gender, baseline major tumor size, intrahepatic lesions number, and logAFP(smooth). Furthermore, high-rising class had a significantly higher HR in the subgroup of female patients (10.60, 95%CI: 6.29, 17.86), age<55 (6.78, 95%CI: 4.79, 9.59) and Child-Pugh class B (23.01, 95%CI:8.07, 65.63) (P = 0.014, 0.046 and 0.033 for interaction, respectively). Trajectories of AFP had the highest relative importance of each parameter to survival, including largest tumor size, intrahepatic lesions number, Child-Pugh class, and baseline AFP.

While determination of neutralizing antibodies via virus neutralization tests are laborious, assays to determine the antibody levels serologically are fully automated and widely available. Correlations between these methodologies were recently given by the manufacturers, however performance in samples close to the cut off value have not yet been fully validated. Thus, we analysed 22 borderline and low positive (<100 BAU/ml) samples and 9 high positive ( 100 BAU/ml) from infected and/or vaccinated individuals and compared the SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay (Abbott), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG (Diasorin), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche), and SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Siemens) with results obtained from a virus neutralization test. Based on the cut off values given by Abbott, Diasorin, Roche, and Siemens, the positive serologic results were concordant with the virus neutralization test in 100%, 76%, 88%, and 71%, respectively, while in turn, negative ones were in agreement in 29%, 79%, 93%, and 86%, respectively. In conclusion, weakly positive, serologic results are challenging to correctly predict the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Our study suggests, that different cut off values (for positivity vs. presence of neutralizing antibodies) could improve the test's performance, but determination thereof requires more samples to be analysed.","output":"Borderline and weakly positive antibody levels against the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit limited agreement with virus neutralization titres"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses extraordinary public health challenges. In order to respond to such challenges, most democracies have relied on so-called 'evidence-based' policies, which supposedly devolve to science the burden of their justification. However, the biomedical sciences can only provide a theory-laden evidential basis, while reliable statistical data for policy support is often scarce. Therefore, scientific evidence alone cannot legitimise COVID-19 public health policies, which are ultimately based on political decisions. Given this inevitable input on policy-making, the risk of arbitrariness is ubiquitous and democratic scrutiny becomes essential to counter it.

We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of early tracheostomy compared to late tracheostomy on COVID-19 patients outcomes. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus database, along with medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Research Square, from December 1, 2019, to August 24, 2021. Early tracheostomy was defined as a tracheostomy conducted 14 days or less after initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Late tracheostomy was any time thereafter. Duration of IMV, duration of ICU stay, and overall mortality were the primary outcomes of the meta-analysis. Pooled odds ratios (OR) or the mean differences (MD) with 95%CIs were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Fourteen studies with a cumulative 2371 tracheostomized COVID-19 patients were included in this review. Early tracheostomy was associated with significant reductions in duration of IMV (2098 patients; MD ? 9.08 days, 95% CI ? 10.91 to ? 7.26 days, p < 0.01) and duration of ICU stay (1224 patients; MD ? 9.41 days, 95% CI ? 12.36 to ? 6.46 days, p < 0.01). Mortality was reported for 2343 patients and was comparable between groups (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.79C1.51, p = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that, compared with late tracheostomy, early tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients was associated with shorter duration of IMV and ICU stay without modifying the mortality rate.

We aimed at evaluating the impact of vitamin D levels on the biomarkers of acute-phase response, inflammation and glucose metabolism in a large cohort of diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing coronary angiography were included. Diabetes mellitus was defined as previous diagnosis, specific treatment administration (oral drug or insulin), fasting glycaemia >6.99 mmol/L or HbA1c >48 mmol/L. Glucose parameters, white blood cells, Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and vitamin D were measured at admission. Vitamin D levels were measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay kit LIAISON? Vitamin D assay (Diasorin Inc). RESULTS: We included 1472 diabetic patients and 2499 non-diabetic patients that were divided according to vitamin D tertiles. Among diabetic patients, lower levels of vitamin D were associated with female gender (P = .02), obesity (P = .004), active smoking and acute presentation (P < .001) and with a more atherogenic metabolic profile. The levels of white blood cells, leucocytes subfamilies, and inflammatory parameters significantly correlated with vitamin D levels in both patients with and without diabetes (diabetic: P = .012 for WBC, P = .004 for NLR and P < .001 for MLR and C-reactive protein, non-diabetic: P < .001 for WBC; NLR, MLR and C-reactive protein, respectively). Among diabetic patients, results were confirmed at multivariate analysis with no significant interaction according to glycaemic control. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that, among patients with cardiovascular disease, vitamin D deficiency is associated with metabolic dysregulation and with an elevation of cellular and humoural inflammatory parameters, especially among diabetics, although not being dependent from glycaemic control.","output":"Association of lower vitamin D levels with inflammation and leucocytes parameters in patients with and without diabetes mellitus undergoing coronary angiography"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this introduction to the special issue on systematic reviews on emerging learning environments and technologies, we introduce best practices for conducting systematic reviews and meta-analysis and discuss the need for a systematic review on emerging learning environments and technologies.

A majority of people with NDs receive care and support from the family, but there is no tool in Spain with which to measure whole-family QOL. The aim of this study was the translation, cultural adaptation, and validation of the FQOLSCDementia into Spanish to assess FQOL among family members of individuals with NDs who live in the SpainCPortugal cross-border area. METHOD: The Spanish version was translated and adapted following the international guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation tests. A sample of 300 family caregivers was interviewed, applying an adapted version of the Family Quality Survey (FQOLSCDementia). Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to validate the factor structure, and convergent validity was examined with Pearsons correlation coefficients of the global FQOL with the domains. Internal consistency reliability was determined using Cronbachs alpha. RESULTS: The domain structure of the FQOLSCND showed a good fit. In the convergent validity, it was found that the total score and the subscale domain scores were associated with the global FQOL score, except for the Values domain. Internal consistency of nine domain subscales was strong ( = 0.80 to 0.91), and excellent for the total FQOL ( = 0.85) and the global FQOL ( = 0.87).

Although coronaviruses typically infect the upper or lower respiratory tract, the virus RNA can be detected in plasma. The risk of transmitting coronavirus via transfusion of blood products remains. As more asymptomatic infections are identified in COVID-19 cases, blood safety has become particularly important. Methylene blue (MB) photochemical technology has been proven to inactivate lipid-enveloped viruses with high efficiency and safety. The present study aimed to investigate the SARS-CoV-2 inactivation effects of MB in plasma. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 virus strain was isolated from Zhejiang University. The live virus was harvested from cultured VERO-E6 cells, and mixed with MB in plasma. The MB final concentrations were 0, 1, 2, and 4 M. The \\"BX-1 AIDS treatment instrument\\" was used at room temperature, the illumination adjusted to 55,000  0.5 million Lux, and the plasma was irradiated for 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mins using light at a single wavelength of 630 nm. Virus load changes were measured using quantitative reverse transcription- PCR. RESULTS: BX-1 could effectively eliminate SARS-CoV-2 within 2 mins in plasma, and the virus titer declined to 4.5 log10 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose)/mL. CONCLUSION: BX-1 is based on MB photochemical technology, which was designed to inactivate HIV-1 virus in plasma. It was proven to be safe and reliable in clinical trials of HIV treatment. In this study, we showed that BX-1 could also be applied to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.

In cell culture, CCHFV is sensed by the cytoplasmic RNA sensor retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) molecule and its adaptor molecule mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein. MAVS initiates both type I interferon (IFN-I) and proinflammatory responses. Here, we studied the role MAVS plays in CCHFV infection in mice in both the presence and absence of IFN-I activity. MAVS-deficient mice were not susceptible to CCHFV infection when IFN-I signaling was active and showed no signs of disease. When IFN-I signaling was blocked by antibody, MAVS-deficient mice lost significant weight, but were uniformly protected from lethal disease, whereas all control mice succumbed to infection. Cytokine activity in the infected MAVS-deficient mice was markedly blunted. Subsequent investigation revealed that CCHFV infected mice lacking TNF- receptor signaling (TNFA-R-deficient), but not IL-6 or IL-1 activity, had more limited liver injury and were largely protected from lethal outcomes. Treatment of mice with an anti-TNF- neutralizing antibody also conferred partial protection in a post-virus exposure setting. Additionally, we found that a disease causing, but non-lethal strain of CCHFV produced more blunted inflammatory cytokine responses compared to a lethal strain in mice. Our work reveals that MAVS activation and cytokine production both contribute to CCHFV pathogenesis, potentially identifying new therapeutic targets to treat this disease.","output":"The host inflammatory response contributes to disease severity in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infected mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the end of 2019, the clinical presentation of the disease showed a great heterogeneity with a diverse impact among different subpopulations. Emerging evidence from different parts of the world showed that male patients usually had a longer disease course as well as worse outcome compared to female patients. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this difference might be a fundamental step for more effective and personalized response to this disease outbreak. For that reason, here we investigate the molecular basis of gender variations in mortality rates related to COVID-19 infection. To achieve this, we used publicly available lung transcriptomic data from 141 females and compare it to 286 male lung tissues. After excluding Y specific genes, our results showed a shortlist of 73 genes that are differentially expressed between the two groups. Further analysis using pathway enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of a group of genes that are involved in the regulation of hydrolase activity including (CHM, DDX3X, FGFR3, SFRP2, and NLRP2) in males lungs compared to females. This pathway is believed to be essential for immune response and antimicrobial activity in the lung tissues. In contrast, our results showed an increased upregulation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), a member of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that plays a role in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity modulation in male lungs compared to females. Finally, our results showed a differential expression of genes involved in the immune response including the NLRP2 and PTGDR2 in lung tissues of both genders, further supporting the notion of the sex-based immunological differences. Taken together, our results provide an initial evidence of the molecular mechanisms that might be involved in the differential outcomes observed in both genders during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Our results suggest a crisis signal effect of Italy's COVID-19 lockdown, as support for the incumbent increased in other European countries after the Italian lockdown. Importantly, these findings suggest that incumbents can benefit from a crisis, even when their own performance in response to the crisis is not yet fully clear. As such our findings cast some doubt on the assumption underlying classic models of accountability that ordinary citizens can disentangle performance signals from exogenous shocks, i.e. events largely outside of the control of incumbents.","output":"Crisis Signaling: How Italy's Coronavirus Lockdown Affected Incumbent Support in Other European Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The novel strain SARS-CoV-2 of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) became pandemic in end of 2019 with an unprecedented global crisis by infecting around 11 million people in more than 200 countries. The condition has now been provoked by the demand, supply, and liquidity shocks that COVID-19 has attacked lives of an incredible population. OBJECTIVES: Therefore, researchers are trying to encode and understand the viral genome sequence along with various potential targets to explore the transmission mechanism and the mode of treatment for COVID-19. The important structural proteins such as nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M), an envelope protein (E), and spike protein (S) related to covid-19 are discussed in this manuscript. METHODS: The topology of these various targets has been explored utilizing structure-based design and crystallographic studies. RESULTS: The literature reported that the N protein process viral genome to the host cell during replication. The \\"N terminal domain\\" and \\"C terminal domain\\" contribute towards the localization in the endoplasmic region and dimerization respectively. The M protein determines the shape of coronavirus and also assists the S protein to integrate with the Golgi-endoplasmic region complex leading to the stabilization of the virion. The smallest hydrophobic viroporin termed \\"E\\" takes part in morphogenesis and pathogenesis during intracellular infection. The viral spike (S) protein attaches the cellular receptors and initiates virus-cell membrane fusions. The main protease in the proteolytic process during viral gene expression and replication has also been discussed. CONCLUSION: Currently there is no permanent cure and treatment of COVID-19 hence researchers are repurposing the suitable combination of drugs including antiviral, antimalarial, antiparasitic, and antibacterial, hypertensive receptor blockers, immunosuppressant, anti-arthritis drug, including ayurvedic formulations. In brief, it is justified that, for complete recovery, there is a need for deep and elaborate studies on genomic sequences and invading mechanisms in the host cell.","output":"Exploring the COVID-19 Potential Targets: Big Challenges to Quest Specific Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The low-profile Neuroform Atlas stent can be deployed directly without an exchange maneuver by navigating into the Gateway balloon. This retrospective study assessed the safety and efficacy of Neuroform Atlas stenting as a rescue treatment after failure of mechanical thrombetomy (MT) for large artery occlusion. METHODS Between June 2018 and December 2019, a total of 31 patients underwent Neuroform Atlas stenting with prior Gateway balloon angioplasty after failure of conventional MT caused by residual intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Primary outcomes were successful recanalization and patency of the vessel 24 hours after intervention. Secondary outcomes were vessel patency after 14 days and 3-month modified Rankin Scale. Peri-procedural complications, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and 3-month mortality were reviewed. RESULTS With a 100% of successful recanalization, median value of stenosis was reduced from 79.0% to 23.5%. Twenty-eight patients (90.3%) showed tolerable vessel patency after 14 days. New infarctions occurred in three patients (9.7%) over a period of 14 days; two patient (6.5%) underwent stent occlusion at 24 hours, and the other patient (3.2%) with delayed stent occlusion had a non-symptomatic dot infarct. There were no peri-procedural complications. Two patients (6.5%) developed an ICH immediately after the procedure with one of them is symptomatic. CONCLUSION Neuroform Atlas stenting seems to be an effective and safe rescue treatment modality for failed MT with residual ICAS, by its high successful recanalization rate with tolerable patency, and low peri-procedural complication rate. Further multicenter and randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm our findings.","output":"Preliminary Experience of Neuroform Atlas Stenting as a Rescue Treatment after Failure of Mechanical Thrombectomy Caused by Residual Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Was there quality in the Chinese epidemiological surveillance system during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Several studies have investigated orofacial injuries during contact sports in different countries, but there is a lack of data that is specific for French handball players. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of orofacial injuries and the proportion of handball players using a mouthguard in Eastern France. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected from handball players aged over 15 years old from five handball clubs in the Lorraine Region (Eastern France). A questionnaire containing 26 questions about the general characteristics of participants, orofacial injury experiences, emergency procedures following tooth avulsion, and use of mouthguards was self-administered. RESULTS Two hundred and sixty-three handball players, of which 76.8% (202) were males, aged 23  8 years on average, with a mean playing experience of 11  6 years, participated in the study. Among them, 24.7% (65) reported at least one orofacial injury. A total of 237 orofacial injuries was declared. The main types of orofacial injuries including lip, cheek and tongue injuries were reported by 18.6% of handball players (49); dental injuries were reported by 9.9% (26) and injuries to the temporomandibular joint were reported by 4.9% (13). Most participants knew about mouthguards (97.3%, 254) and considered them efficient for preventing dental injuries in handball (95.3%, 242/254), but only 3.0% (8) used them. CONCLUSION The prevalence of orofacial injuries among French handball players was high while mouthguards were very rarely used.

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is necessary to adequately evaluate the characteristics and outcomes of the population with asthma in the population tested for and diagnosed as having COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To perform a study to assess the impact of asthma on COVID-19 diagnosis, presenting symptoms, disease severity, and cytokine profiles. METHODS: This was an analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of patients suspected of having COVID-19 who presented for COVID-19 testing at a tertiary medical center in Missouri between March 2020 and September 2020. We classified and analyzed patients according to their pre-existing asthma diagnosis and subsequent COVID-19 testing results. RESULTS: Patients suspected of having COVID-19 (N = 435) were enrolled in this study. The proportions of patients testing positive for COVID-19 were 69.2% and 81.9% in the groups with asthma and without asthma, respectively. The frequencies of relevant symptoms were similar between the groups with asthma with positive and negative COVID-19 test results. In the population diagnosed as having COVID-19 (n = 343), asthma was not associated with several indicators of COVID-19 severity, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, death due to COVID-19, and in-hospital mortality after multivariate adjustment. Patients with COVID-19 with asthma exhibited significantly lower levels of plasma interleukin-8 than patients without asthma (adjusted P = .02). CONCLUSION: The population with asthma is facing a challenge in preliminary COVID-19 evaluation owing to an overlap in the symptoms of COVID-19 and asthma.

During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some case reports have shown a temporal association between TM and COVID-19 vaccine. We aimed to report a case of TM with a temporal association with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222, Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine in a Brazilian public hospital. Case Presentation: A 27-year-old woman experienced fever, low back pain and urinary retention 3 weeks after the first dose of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. Two days later, she experienced decreased strength of the lower limbs associated with paresthesia of the distal extremities. At the hospital, there was progression of weakness associated with anesthesia in T4-L1. Magnetic resonance imaging findings were suggestive of demyelination and acute inflammation. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed monomorphonuclear pleocytosis, increased protein and decreased glucose. Gram stain, oligoclonal bands, anti-aquaporin-4 antibody, and screening for infectious agents and connective tissue disease were all negative. During treatment, the patient received 5-day pulse therapy with methylprednisolone, acyclovir and 7-day plasmapheresis. Despite all treatments, she persisted with lower limb plegia, areflexia and anesthesia at the level of T4. She was discharged with a monthly cyclophosphamide plan and outpatient follow up. Conclusions: In the absence of other causes, the diagnosis of TM was made with evidence of a possible temporal association with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine. It is important to emphasize that it is a temporal association only and the benefits of vaccination continue to outweigh the risk of TM. ? 2021 Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology","output":"Transverse myelitis and coronavirus disease 2019 vaccine: A temporal association"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flax industry has an adverse effect on health status of exposed workers especially in developing countries with lack of appropriate safety measures to identify the health hazards, health disorders among workers in flax and oil company, and to assess the applied safety measures in the factory.

The study was conducted from August 2018 to December 2019 on 353 workers out of 400 workers. An interview questionnaire and clinical medical examination were done to assess the health status of exposed workers. Check list from occupational safety and health administration (OSHA) standards was filled by researcher to check safety measures in work place environment. Respiratory manifestations were detected in 65% of the examined workers in flax manufacturing departments while allergic manifestations were more obvious in formaldehyde factory department. Approximately one quarter of workers complained that personal protective equipments are not available. Regarding the mask for dust, nearly half (44.5%) of the workers rarely used them, and only 7.1% always use them. Byssinosis was obvious among workers in flax manufacturing and particle board manufacturing department with statistically significant differences between the four departments, in which 36.9% and 24.1% of workers in these two departments suffered from chest tightness, respectively. The safety measures were inadequate in flax manufacturing departments and to somewhat sufficient in formaldehyde factory department.

However, evidence for children and adolescents is still inconclusive. In this population-based study, we examine the proportion of children and adolescents reporting persistent symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, as assessed by serological status, and compare this to a seronegative control group. Methods: We conducted a serosurvey in June-July 2021, recruiting 660 children and adolescents from 391 households selected randomly from the Geneva population. We tested participants for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting the nucleocapsid (N) protein to determine previous infection. A parent filled a questionnaire including questions on COVID-19-related symptoms lasting at least 2 weeks. Findings: Among children seropositive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the sex- and age-adjusted prevalence of symptoms lasting longer than two weeks was 18.3%, compared to 11.1% among seronegative children (prevalence difference ({Delta}aPrev)=7.2%, 95%CI:1.5-13.0). Main symptoms declared among seropositive children were fatigue (11.5%) and headache (11.1%). For 8.6% (aPrev, 95%CI: 4.7-12.5) of seropositives, these symptoms were declared to be highly limiting of daily activities. Adolescents aged 12-17 years had a higher adjusted prevalence of persistent symptoms (aPrev=29.1%, 95%CI:19.4-38.7) than younger children. Comparing seropositive and seronegative adolescents, the estimated prevalence of symptoms lasting over four weeks is 4.4% ({Delta}aPrev, 95%CI:-3.8-13.6). Interpretation: A significant proportion of children aged 12 to 17 years had symptoms lasting over two weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an estimated prevalence of symptoms lasting over 4 weeks of 4.4% in this age group. This represents a large number of adolescents in absolute terms, and should raise concern in the context of unknown long-term evolution of symptoms. Younger children appear to experience long-lasting symptoms less frequently, as no difference was observed between the seropositive and seronegative sample.

Its inflammatory characteristics are incompletely understood. Objectives: To define the cytokine profile of COVID-19 and to identify evidence of immunometabolic alterations in those with severe illness. Methods: Levels of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and sTNFR1 (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1) were assessed in plasma from healthy volunteers, hospitalized but stable patients with COVID-19 (COVID(stable) patients), patients with COVID-19 requiring ICU admission (COVID(ICU) patients), and patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring ICU support (CAP(ICU) patients). Immunometabolic markers were measured in circulating neutrophils from patients with severe COVID-19. The acute phase response of AAT (alpha-1 antitrypsin) to COVID-19 was also evaluated. Measurements and Main Results: IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and sTNFR1 were all increased in patients with COVID-19. COVID(ICU) patients could be clearly differentiated from COVID(stable) patients, and demonstrated higher levels of IL-1, IL-6, and sTNFR1 but lower IL-10 than CAP(ICU) patients. COVID-19 neutrophils displayed altered immunometabolism, with increased cytosolic PKM2 (pyruvate kinase M2), phosphorylated PKM2, HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor-1), and lactate. The production and sialylation of AAT increased in COVID-19, but this antiinflammatory response was overwhelmed in severe illness, with the IL-6:AAT ratio markedly higher in patients requiring ICU admission (P < 0.0001). In critically unwell patients with COVID-19, increases in IL-6:AAT predicted prolonged ICU stay and mortality, whereas improvement in IL-6:AAT was associated with clinical resolution (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The COVID-19 cytokinemia is distinct from that of other types of pneumonia, leading to organ failure and ICU need.

At least 10 metals are essential for human life and about 46 other non-essential metals (including radionuclides) are also used in drug therapies and diagnostic agents. These include platinum drugs (in 50% of cancer chemotherapies), lithium (bipolar disorders), silver (antimicrobials), and bismuth (broad-spectrum antibiotics). While the quest for novel and better drugs is now as urgent as ever, drug discovery and development pipelines established for organic drugs and based on target identification and high-throughput screening of compound libraries are less effective when applied to metallodrugs. Metallodrugs are often prodrugs which undergo activation by ligand substitution or redox reactions, and are multi-targeting, all of which need to be considered when establishing structureCactivity relationships.

Theoretical research in psychology shows that ones emotional state can influence his/her temporal orientation. We hypothesize that measuring human temporal orientation can benefit from concurrent learning of emotion. To test this hypothesis, we propose a deep learning-based multi-task framework where we concurrently learn a unified model for temporal orientation (our primary task) and emotion analysis (secondary task) using tweets. Our multi-task framework takes users tweets as input and produces three temporal orientation labels (past, present or future) and four emotion labels (joy, sadness, anger, or fear) with intensity values as outputs. The classified tweets are then grouped for each user to obtain the user-level temporal orientation and emotion. Finally, we investigate the associations between the users temporal orientation and their emotional state. Our analysis reveals that joy and anger are correlated to future orientation while sadness and fear are correlated to the past orientation.","output":"Investigating the impact of emotion on temporal orientation in a deep multitask setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Early excision and autografting are standard care for deeper burns.

Cohort studies involving over 20 patients with cancer were included. The characteristics of the patients and studies, treatment types, mortality, and other additional outcomes were extracted and pooled for synthesis. RRs and forest plots were adopted to present the results. The literature quality and publication bias were assessed using NOS and Egger's test, respectively. RESULTS: We analyzed the data from 29 studies, with 5121 cancer patients with COVID\\\\19 meeting the inclusion criteria. There were no significant differences in mortality between patients receiving anticancer treatment and those not (RR 1.17, 95%CI: 0.96C1.43, I(2)=66%, p = 0.12). Importantly, in patients with hematological malignancies, chemotherapy could markedly increase the mortality (RR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.90C3.78, I(2)=0%, p < 0.00001). In patients with solid tumors, no significant differences in mortality were observed (RR 1.16, 95% CI: 0.57C2.36, I(2)=72%, p = 0.67).

A scoping literature review design was used to support the discussion. Systematic literature searches conducted in April 2020 in two electronic databases, PubMed/Medline and PsychInfo, produced 2044 hits but only a handful of empirical papers, from which seven well-focused articles were identified. The concept of moral injury was considered under other concepts as well such as stress of conscience, regrets for ethical situation, moral distress and ethical suffering, guilt without fault, and existential suffering with inflicting pain. Nurses had witnessed these difficult ethical situations when faced with unnecessary patient suffering and a feeling of not doing enough. Some cases of moral distress may turn into moral residue and end in moral injury with time, and in certain circumstances and contexts. The association between these concepts needs further investigation and confirmation through empirical studies; in particular, where to draw the line as to when moral distress turns into moral injury, leading to severe consequences.

The survey focused on direct cost drivers/indirect cost drivers. Acquisition costs of medicines were not included due to data not being available publicly. Wider policy implications linked to the pandemic were also explored.

The interviews were undertaken virtually during April 2020 From interview(n=20) results a simple cost analysis was developed plus a qualitative analysis of reports on wider policy/patient impacts. RESULTS: Key findings included evidence of significant variation in local infusion tariffs UK wide, with interviewees reporting that not all actual costs incurred are captured in published tariff costs. A cost analysis showed administration costs 50% lower in the subcutaneous compared to infusion routes, with most patients administering subcutaneous medicines themselves. Other indirect benefits to this route included less pressure on infusion unit waiting times/reduced risk of COVID\\\\19 infection plus reduced patient out of pocket costs.

Face masks can cause discomfort which may lead to general irritation resulting in potential anxiety and subsequent distraction from instructional material delivered in a school setting (Lee et al., 2005). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of wearing a facial covering and the impacts on memory, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and emotional state on a 5-point Likert scale (Buron p=0.058). However, vocabulary memory recall was more accurate in the masked condition (8.06 words  2.20 vs. 6.72 words  2.43;p=0.001).

We also documented the time taken to diagnose missed abortion or molar pregnancy to check if a delay in diagnosis can explain the increase in HM incidence. RESULTS: Between 2016 and 2019, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of molar pregnancy. A further increase occurred in 2020 (odds ratio = 2.071).

A nano--TCP scaffold was prepared by coating the surface of a collagen scaffold with a nanosize -TCP dispersion. Scaffolds were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, compressive testing, cell seeding and rat subcutaneous implant testing. Then, nano--TCP scaffold, nano--TCP scaffold loaded with FGF-2 and noncoated collagen scaffold were implanted into a dog one-wall infrabony defect model. Histological observations were made at 10 d and 4 wk postsurgery. RESULTS Scanning electron microscopy images show that TCP nanoparticles were attached to collagen fibers. The nano--TCP scaffold showed higher compressive strength and cytocompatibility compared with the noncoated collagen scaffold. Rat subcutaneous implant tests showed that the DNA contents of infiltrating cells in the nano--TCP scaffold and the FGF-2-loaded scaffold were approximately 2.8-fold and 3.7-fold greater, respectively, than in the collagen scaffold. Histological samples from the periodontal defect model showed about five-fold greater periodontal tissue repair following implantation of the nano--TCP scaffold loaded with FGF-2 compared with the collagen scaffold.

We argue that the role of financial control in shaping well-being outcomesdespite being less recognized in the literature than the role of financial fragilityis equally or even more important. Our study is a longitudinal cohort study that made use of observational data. Two waves of the Well-Being Survey data from 1448 U.S. adults were used in the analysis. Impacts of financial fragility and financial control on 17 well-being outcomes were examined, including emotional well-being (nine outcomes), physical well-being (four outcomes), social well-being (two outcomes), in addition to an unhealthy days summary measure and the flourishing index. Financial fragility was shown to be on average less influential for the well-being outcomes than financial control. Our results suggest that financial control plays a protective role for complete well-being. Less evidence in support of a harmful role of financial fragility for well-being is provided. Tests for moderation effects revealed no interaction between financial control and financial fragility within our sample, indicating that financial control did not modify the relationship between financial fragility and well-being.","output":"The Role of Financial Fragility and Financial Control for Well-Being"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Subclinical left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) is a prelude to symptomatic heart failure (HF). We hypothesised that screening-guided treatment with spironolactone would prevent incident HF in at-risk patients. METHODS We randomised asymptomatic, community-dwelling subjects aged 65 years old, with at least one non-ischaemic HF risk factor (hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus or obesity) to echocardiography-guided therapy or usual care. Spironolactone therapy was triggered by the detection of subclinical LVD (GLS 16% or diastolic abnormalities (at least one of E/e'>15, E/e' >10 with left atrial enlargement [LAE] or impaired relaxation [E/A <0.8, IR], LAE with IR), or borderline GLS (17%) with IR or borderline GLS with LAE. The primary outcome was incident HF at 24 months. Secondary outcomes were change in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and change in LV function. RESULTS LVD was identified in 161 (46%) of 349 participants (age 70 years [68-73], 201 (58%) women). The trial was stopped because of a 55% rate of spironolactone discontinuation, due primarily to decline in renal function. Incident HF developed in 11 (3.5%) of 310 participants completing follow-up, with no difference between usual care and intervention (4 [2.5%] vs. 7 [4.7%], p=0.29), decline in 6MWT distance (p=0.28), persistent or new LVD (p=0.58), nor change in GLS with intervention (p=0.15). A per-protocol analysis of 131 patients with baseline LVD and a follow-up echocardiogram, showed resolution of LVD with spironolactone therapy (61% vs 33%, p=0.01). CONCLUSION The study was underpowered to determine whether screening-guided spironolactone therapy reduced incident HF because spironolactone was frequently discontinued due to renal function criteria. However, LVD resolved in more patients treated with spironolactone than in untreated patients. Future trials should use less conservative renal criteria for spironolactone discontinuation.","output":"Screening-Guided Spironolactone Treatment of Subclinical Left Ventricular Dysfunction for Heart Failure Prevention in At-risk Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Quinoline is an ubiquitous pollutant widely spread in the environment, which can be eliminated efficiently by microbial degradation In this study, two quinoline-degrading Comamonas sp strains Z1 and Z3 were isolated from activated sludge, and the degradation characteristics and genome annotation were investigated in detail RESULTS: Strain Z1 exhibited a superior capacity for quinoline degradation, which could completely degrade 50C300 mg L?1 quinoline within 8C24 h, whereas strain Z3 required 14C36 h to remove 50C200 mg L?1 quinoline The suitable pHs for strains Z1 and Z3 were 8 0 and 7 0, respectively, and metal ions such as Mn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Co2+ and Hg2+ could greatly inhibit bacterial growth and quinoline degradation Intermediates of 2-hydroxyquinoline, 2,8-dihydroxyquinoline, 8-hydroxycoumarin, 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acids and 2-hydroxy-6-oxonona-2,4-diene-1,9-dioate were detected by liquid chromatography coupled to Q-Exactive high-resolution mass spectrometry Thus, the biodegradation of quinoline by Comamonas sp strains possibly proceeded via the 8-hydroxycoumarin pathway Genomic sequencing of strains Z1 and Z3 revealed a similar pattern, and a large number of functional genes were predicted to participate in degradation of aromatics The key genes responsible for quinoline degradation also were identified, such as qor, mhp and bph Furthermore, quinoline 2-oxidoreductase (Qor) from strains Z1 and Z3 displayed 47 74%C61 17% similarities with previously reported Qor, which catalyzed the first step of quinoline degradation, and the maximal specific activity in cell-free extracts of strains Z1 and Z3 was 0 264 and 0 062 U mg protein?1, respectively CONCLUSION: This study should provide efficient microbial resources and useful genomic information for quinoline bioremediation ? 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","output":"Comparative characterization and functional genomic analysis of two Comamonas sp. strains for biodegradation of quinoline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has affected the daily activities of people across the globe The effects of the pandemic have not just been medical, but also societal and economical The responses of government and the public have varied in different countries Measures have ranged from improving hygiene, information dissemination, and social distancing to more radical measures such as social isolation, quarantine and lockdown The disease and human responses have had consequences on the way we live, work, eat and rest Life and livelihoods have been affected This article highlights how the response to the pandemic has affected various aspects of healthcare and ethical dilemmas this has raised As the pandemic progresses, awareness and evaluation of the unintended consequences of the pandemic and responses on our health and healthcare systems are needed Discussing these points and being aware of the ethical issues may help countries and policy makers plan suitable strategies to mitigate these collateral effects, especially as the pandemic continues It is hoped that this article will support healthcare workers, especially those in primary and secondary healthcare, as they overcome various challenges to treat patients with existing and prior diseases, and encourage them to advocate for robust and sustainable healthcare systems for public health This would then help effectively combat future epidemics Most importantly, it can mitigate the adverse collateral effects on healthcare that the public are experiencing and the treatment dilemmas that family and primary care physicians are facing","output":"Collateral effects and ethical challenges in healthcare due to COVID-19 - a dire need to support healthcare workers and systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini dilakukan untuk memberikan informasi bahwa COVID-19 tidak hanya memberikan dampak negatif terhadap sektor usaha tetapi juga memberikan dampak positif.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a single center retrospective cohort study of pregnant patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection between April 2020 and December 2020. Fifty patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection between April and November were used to create the prediction model. Initial clinical characteristics identified at the time of diagnosis were compared between patients who required ARS and patients who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, using patients diagnosed between April and November 2020. Risk factors associated with ARS requirement were used to create the Obstetric Warning Score (OWS). The OWS score was then validated using 30 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection in December 2020. Receiver operator curve (ROC) was generated to evaluate the test characteristics of OWS compared to other scoring systems including the Early Warning Score (EWS), the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) and the Maternal Early Warning Criteria (MEWC). RESULTS: Women who required ARS were more likely to present with dyspnea (100% vs. 33.3%, p<0.001), have higher heart rate (113.4 bpm vs. 93 bpm, p<0.001), respiratory rate (23.5 bpm vs. 17.7 bpm, p<0.001), temperature (99.1 F vs. 98.3 F, p=0.004) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) (7.4 mg/dL vs. 2.4 mg/dL, p<0.001). Furthermore, 88.2% of ARS patients showed chest x-ray findings consistent with pneumonia, compared to 20.0% of non-ARS patients (p<0.001). All ARS patients presented with at least one COVID-19 symptom, while 51.5% of non-ARS patients were symptomatic (p<0.001). The OWS model included 1 point each for HR > 100 bpm, temperature > 99.0 F, CRP >2.0 mg/dL, respiratory rate between 20 and 24 bpm, complaints of dyspnea and positive chest x-ray. Respiratory rate >24 bpm was assigned 2 points. The AUC for OWS is 0.97 compared with 0.72 for EWS, 0.92 for NEWS2 and 0.85 for MEWC.

Visits included collection of the following patient-reported outcome measures: nasal obstructive symptom evaluation (NOSE), nasal obstruction visual analog scale (VAS), and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Adverse events were evaluated at each visit. One-hundred-eleven participants with implants were followed. Of the 111, 90 completed the 12-month visit and 70 completed the 24-month visit. NOSE responder rates are greater than 80% at all follow-ups through 24 months.

A total of 63% of the viral contigs corresponded to PBVs, comprising 274 segment 1 and 56 segment 2 sequences. Unexpectedly, four unsegmented PBV genomes were also detected and confirmed by PCR and resequencing. According to the phylogenetic analysis, the following nine PBV assortment types are proposed: C1:GI, C2:GIV, C4:GI, C4:GV, C5:GI, C7:GI, C8:GIV, C8:GV and C8:GII. We hypothesize a model of segmentation for the PBV genome, mediated by a 6-bp direct repeat sequence, GAAAGG. The model is supported by detection of the segmentation-associated sequence GAAAGG not only in the 5 untranslated regions of segment 1 (221 in 289) and segment 2 (57 in 80) of bi-segmented PBVs but also in the 5 untranslated regions and junction sequences between the capsid and RdRp genes of unsegmented PBVs. Therefore, with RNA sequencing, we found an unexpected biodiversity of PBVs in M. himalayana, indicating that M. himalayana is a special host for PBVs. We also proposed a putative model of how bi-segmented PBVs could be converted into unsegmented PBVs, which sheds new light on the processes of RNA virus genome evolution.","output":"Marmota himalayana in the QinghaiCTibetan plateau as a special host for bi-segmented and unsegmented picobirnaviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) range from moderate to critical conditions, leading to death in some patients, and the early warning indicators of the COVID-19 progression and the occurrence of its serious complications such as myocardial injury are limited.

Here, we investigate the localization of viral RNA synthesis and the link with replication organelles in host cells. We have shown that sites of viral RNA synthesis and virus-related dsRNA are associated with one another and, significantly, that they are located within a membrane-bound compartment within the cell.

We are concerned about the patient's safety during the operation. All surgical centres have received instructions to discontinue all elective surgery operations, although urgent surgical cases are still being carried out. This procedure should not be delayed in orthopaedic issues such as fracture repositioning surgery, as the unionization process is ongoing. METHODS: We gather review articles from a variety of sources. The keywords Ethics, COVID-19, Elective Surgery, and Orthopedic Surgery were used to filter the documents. We found 863 documents and then set the criteria for including documents that we thought eligible for review articles, such as research journals and newspaper pieces from reliable sources, resulting in the discovery of 40 papers that met our requirements. RESULT: We will discuss four basic principles of medical ethics: beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice. Orthopaedic surgeons will face many decisions that will challenge these ethical principles, especially in performing elective surgery during a pandemic. CONCLUSION: Physicians must protect the most vulnerable, but they are under no obligation to administer treatment they believe to be ineffective. In individuals who are positive for COVID-19, orthopaedic surgical procedures have a significant mortality rate. Surgical leaders must remain attentive, and surgical services must be reintroduced gradually and carefully. A good option is to carry out treatment at a different place and time and ensure that the patient has tested negative for COVID-19 before the procedure, thereby creating safety for patients and health workers.","output":"A medical ethics review of elective orthopaedic surgery management during the pandemic COVID-19 Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compared the phenotype, diversity, and antigen specificity of T cells in the breastmilk and peripheral blood of lactating individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination.

Overabundant breastmilk clones were observed in all individuals, were structurally diverse, and contained CDR3 sequences with known epitope specificity including to SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Spike-specific TCRs were more frequent in breastmilk compared to blood and expanded in breastmilk following a third mRNA vaccine dose. Our observations indicate that the lactating breast contains a distinct T cell population that can be modulated by maternal vaccination with potential implications for infant passive protection.

This is a serious systematic error, which can compromise the results of the entire pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 research. In the present work, we therefore study the thermodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in its environment, from air to endosome and endosome-independent cell entry pathways. In the study of the thermodynamics of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in air, the presence of pollen, bacteria, other viruses, spores, dust, but more particularly, that of nanoparticles of health interest at the same scale threshold as the spike proteins of the pandemic virus, such as particulate matter, cannot be neglected. This work therefore starts from a comparative study of the air environments in China and Italy, the first countries affected by the infection. Currently, a correlation between the spread of infection and pollution is still very controversial. But our paper is not concerned with this. We propose some methodological notes which lead us to the formulation of a general mathematical apparatus (an energy landscape theory), suitable to explain at the molecular level the energetic configurations of the quasi-species of the pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 in its environment. We focus on complexes between the viral particle and other objects in its environment at the scale threshold of the spikes of the viral particle. Then, we wondered if such complexes can lead to the generation of more aggressive viral variants and how to predict their populations and energy configurations, in order to plan an adequate prophylaxis.","output":"Methodological notes on pandemic virus SARS-CoV-2 research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Cancer care has been disrupted by the response of health systems to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during lockdowns. The aim of our study is to analyse the impact of the pandemic on the incidence of cancer diagnosed in primary care. Design: Time-series study of malignant neoplasm and diagnostic procedures, using data from the primary care electronic health records from January 2014 to September 2020. Setting: Primary care, Catalonia, Spain Participants: People older than 14 years and assigned in one of the primary care practices of the Catalan Institute of Health with a new diagnosis of malignant neoplasm. Main outcome measures: We obtained the monthly expected incidence of malignant neoplasms using a temporary regression, where the response variable was the incidence of cancer from 2014 to 2018 and the adjustment variables were the trend and seasonality of the time series. Excess or lack of malignant neoplasms were defined as the number of observed minus expected cases, globally and stratified by sex, age, type of cancer, and socioeconomic status. Results: Between March and September 2020 we observed 8,766 (95% CI: 4,135 to 13,397) less malignant neoplasm diagnoses, representing a reduction of 34% (95% CI: 19.5% to 44.1%) compared to the expected. This underdiagnosis was greater in individuals aged more than 64 years, men, and in some types of cancers (skin, colorectal, prostate). Although the reduction was predominantly focused during the lockdown, expected figures have not yet been reached (40.5% reduction during the lockdown and 24.3% reduction after that). Conclusions: Reduction on cancer incidences has been observed during and after the lockdown. Urgent policy interventions are necessary to mitigate the indirect effects of COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures on other diseases and some strategies must be designed in order to reduce the underdiagnosis of cancer.","output":"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related control measures on cancer diagnosis in Catalonia:A time-series analysis of primary care electronic health records covering about 5 million people."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Synthetic Carbohydrate receptors (SCRs) that selectively recognize cell-surface glycans could be used for detection, drug delivery, or as therapeutics. Here we report the synthesis of seven new C 2h symmetric tetrapodal SCRs. The structures of these SCRs possess a conserved biaryl core, and they vary in the four heterocyclic binding groups that are linked to the biaryl core via secondary amines. Supramolecular association between these SCRs and 5 biologically relevant C 1 -O-octyloxy glycans, /-glucoside ( /-Glc ), /-mannoside ( /-Man ), and -galactoside ( -Gal ), was studied by mass spectrometry, 1 H NMR titrations, and molecular modeling. These studies revealed that selectivity can be achieved in these tetrapodal SCRs by varying the heterocyclic binding group.

OBJECTIVES: To present a model for rapid palliative care workforce expansion under crisis conditions, utilizing supervised advanced psychiatry trainees to provide primary palliative services in the acute care and emergency setting. METHODS: In response to the New York City COVID-19 surge, advanced psychiatry trainees at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Irving Medical Center were rapidly trained and redeployed to a newly formed psychiatry-palliative care liaison team. Under the supervision of consultation-liaison psychiatrists (who also served as team coordinators), these trainees provided circumscribed palliative care services to patients and/or their families, including goals of care discussions and psychosocial support. Palliative care attendings remained available to all team members for more advanced, specialized supervision. RESULTS: The psychiatry-palliative care liaison team effectively provided palliative care services during the early phase and peak of New York Citys COVID-19 crisis, managing up to 16 new cases per day and provided longitudinal follow-up, thereby enabling palliative care specialists to focus on providing services requiring specialist-level palliative care expertise. CONCLUSION: By training and supervising psychiatrists and advanced psychiatry trainees in specific palliative care roles, palliative care teams could more effectively meet markedly increased service needs of varying complexity during the COVID-19 crisis. As new geographic regions experience possible COVID-19 surges in the coming months, this may serve as a model for rapidly increasing palliative care workforce.","output":"The Creation of a Psychiatry-Palliative Care Liaison Team: Utilizing Psychiatrists to Extend Palliative Care Delivery and Access during the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 12-year-old girl with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection presented as phlegmasia cerulea dolens with venous gangrene.

Changes in family routines and experiences of COVID-19-related stress might negatively impact the quality of parenting and the parent-adolescent relationship. However, using active coping strategies might be associated with limited negative or even positive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. This longitudinal, multi-informant, and pre-registered study used data of 240 mostly Dutch parents (85% mothers; Mage = 44.2 years old) and adolescents (50% girls; Mage = 11.4 years) from diverse SES backgrounds. Using Latent Change Score models, we examined how parent-reported parenting (i.e., positive parenting and discipline practices) and adolescent-reported relationship quality (i.e., support and negative interaction) changed from pre-COVID-19 (Fall 2019) to the COVID-19 period (Spring 2020). Moreover, we investigated whether parents' and adolescents' level of COVID-19-related stress was associated with the change in relationships, and whether active coping moderated the association between stress and changes in relationships. Results showed average decreases in support, positive parenting, and negative interactions between parents and adolescents. COVID-19-related stress was not a direct predictor of relationship changes and there was little evidence of moderating effects. Only adolescents' use of active coping strategies moderated the effect of stress on positive parenting. For high active coping adolescents, the link between stress and change in positive parenting was negative, whereas for low active coping adolescents this link was positive. The findings suggest that parent-adolescent relationships during a pandemic need attention, especially for adolescents with high stress levels and using active coping strategies.

STUDY DESIGN: We used data on adolescents aged 15-19 from the 2006-2010 (n=4,662), 2011-2015 (n=4,134), and 2015-2019 (n=3,182) National Surveys of Family Growth. We used logistic regression to identify changes between periods in sexual behaviors and contraceptive use by gender, and for some measures by age. We estimated probabilities of age at first penile-vaginal intercourse with Kaplan-Meier failure analysis. RESULTS: Over half of adolescents have engaged in at least one of the sexual behaviors measured. Males reported declines in sexual behaviors with a partner of a different sex. Adolescent males reported delays in the timing of first penile-vaginal intercourse. Adolescent females reported increases from 2006-2010 to 2015-2019 in use at last intercourse of any contraceptive method (86%, 95%CI 83-89; 91%, 95%CI 88-94), multiple methods (26%, 95%CI 22-31; 36%, 95%CI 30-43), and IUDs or implants (3%, 95%CI 1-4; 15%, 95%CI 11-20). Adolescent males reported increases in partners' use of IUDs or implants use from <1% to 5% and recent declines in condom use at last intercourse (78%, 95%CI 75-82, 2011-2015; 72%, 95%CI 67-77, 2015-2019). Condom consistency declined over time. Males were more likely than females to report condom use at last intercourse and consistent condom use in the last 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: These findings identify declines in male adolescent sexual experience, increased contraceptive use overall, and declines in consistent condom use from 2006 to 2019.

The aim of this study was to assess the information available on national and international aesthetic surgery society websites on the current pandemic of COVID-19. METHODS: National and international aesthetic surgery society websites were assessed with regard to COVID-19 information. RESULTS: Thirty-one per cent of nations had aesthetic surgery society websites. Twenty-two per cent of national society websites had a specific COVID-19 section. Seventeen per cent of these websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines available; of these websites with guidelines, 77% had a specific COVID-19 section advising to provide only urgent or emergent care and 46% provided their sovereign state's directives to provide only urgent or emergent care. Two international aesthetic surgery society websites had COVID-19-specific guidelines, and one of the two had significant educational resources.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. METHOD: In 2018 and 2019, the glaucoma fellowship interviews were conducted in-person in a one-to-one format, whereas in 2020, interviews were virtual and in a multiple (interviewers)-to-one (candidate) format. We compared ranking ranges of interviewers within the same virtual room (WSR) and not within the same virtual room (NWSR) to assess the effect of WSR versus NWSR on ranking variabilities. We also compared ranking categories (accept, alternate, and pass) agreements between 2018, 2019, and 2020 to assess the effect of virtual versus in-person interviews on ranking variabilities. RESULTS: NWSR and WSR mean rankings differed by 1.33 (95% confidence interval difference 0.61 to 2.04, p = 0.0003), with WSR interviewers having less variability than NWSR pairs. The variability between 2018/2019 (in-person interviews) and 2020 (virtual interviews) showed no differences between in-person and virtual interviews (weighted Kappa statistic 0.086 for 2018, 0.158 for 2019, and 0.101 for 2020; p < 0.05 for all years). The overall least attractive candidate has the lowest variability; the most attractive candidate has the second lowest variability. CONCLUSION: Grouping interviewers WSR during the interview decreased ranking variabilities compared to NWSR, while a change from in-person to virtual interview format did not increase the ranking variabilities. This suggests that the decreased nonverbal interactions in virtual interviews do not decrease interviewers' perceptions as applied to preliminary rankings.","output":"The Effect of Changing Fellowship Interview Format on Candidate Ranking Variabilities: The COVID-19 Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic reliability and practicability of self-collected oropharyngeal swab samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection as self-sampling could enable broader testing availability and reduce both personal protective equipment and potential exposure. METHODS: Hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients were asked to collect two oropharyngeal swabs (SC-OPS1/2), and an additional oropharyngeal swab was collected by a health care professional (HCP-OPS). SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing for samples from 58 participants was performed, with a 48-h delay in half of the self-collected samples (SC-OPS2). The sensitivity, probability of concordance, and interrater reliability were calculated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess predictive factors. Practicability was evaluated through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The test sensitivity for HCP-OPS, SC-OPS1, and SC-OPS2 was 88%, 78%, and 77%, respectively. Combining both SC-OPS results increased the estimated sensitivity to 88%. The concordance probability between HCP-OPS and SC-OPS1 was 77.6% and 82.5% between SC-OPS1 and SC-OPS2, respectively. Of the participants, 69% affirmed performing future self-sampling at home, and 34% preferred self-sampling over HCP-guided testing. Participants with both positive HCP-OPS1 and SC-OPS1 indicating no challenges during self-sampling had more differences in viral load levels between HCP-OPS1 and SC-OPS1 than those who indicated challenges. Increasing disease duration and the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG correlated with negative test results in self-collected samples of previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals. CONCLUSION: Oropharyngeal self-sampling is an applicable testing approach for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. Self-sampling tends to be more effective in early versus late infection and symptom onset, and the collection of two distinct samples is recommended to maintain high test sensitivity.

Monocytopenia is especially observed in patients with severe infection. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effects of monocytopenia on survival in patients presenting with the suspicion of Covid-19. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with Covid-19 who received inpatient or outpatient treatment in the pandemic clinic of Umraniye Training and Research Hospital between April 2020 and July 2020 were included in our retrospective cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups, severe and non-severe. Demographic data, laboratory parameters, those who were monocytopenic at presentation, those who developed monocytopenia during follow-up, and those with persistent monocytopenia were noted. RESULTS: The study included 471 patients with a mean age of 50.4  18.2 years. Sixty-seven (14.2%) patients had severe and 404 (85.8%) had non-severe disease. The minimum value of monocytes detected during the follow-up in severe patients was significantly lower (p < 0.001). As patients were grouped into those with monocytopenia at the time of admission, those with monocytopenia developing during their follow-up, and those whose monocytopenia at admission persisted, they were compared with regards to the presence or absence of severe disease. Newly developing monocytopenia and persistent monocytopenia were significant in patients with severe disease (p < 0.001, p = 0,001 respectively). Also, among non-surviving patients, there was a significant difference in survival times in the monocytopenia group (p = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: In our study, we found more developing and persistent monocytopenia in the severe group, and the survival time was low, especially in those with newly developing monocytopenia.

It is intended to improve patient understanding of medicines and resolve adherence issues. Objective To explore MedsCheck from the community pharmacists' perspective, focusing on the perceived effectiveness of the program, barriers to its optimal delivery, and the integration with other services. Setting Individual interviews in one territory and a national online survey of Australian community pharmacists. Method Using a mixed-method triangulation design, the interviews and the survey were conducted concurrently. The interviews were semi-structured, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. The survey, comprising closed and open-ended questions, was quantitatively and thematically analysed. The findings were first analysed separately and finally integrated by searching for convergence, complementarity, and discrepancy. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' perceptions of the effectiveness and barriers of MedsCheck. Results Eight interviews were conducted, and 232 survey responses collected. In the interviews, themes related to perceived benefits (appreciation, reduced confusion, and strengthening relationships), barriers (lack of controls, lack of staff, lack of awareness, and lack of understanding of scope of services), and the integration with other services (strong link with dose administration aids) emerged, which mostly correlated with the survey's results. Ten percent of surveyed respondents did not provide the MedsCheck service; their main reason being insufficient staffing. Of the pharmacists offering the service, 76% strongly agreed that patients were benefitting. MedsCheck reviews were usually initiated by pharmacy staff. Fifty-three percent of respondent pharmacists never or only sometimes reported the review outcomes to the patient's general practitioner. Conclusion The pharmacists believed that MedsCheck is useful to improve patients' understanding and management of their medicines. However, there are currently barriers to the effective delivery of the service, including workload issues, lack of patient awareness, and the service's integration with the broader care of the patient. If these were appropriately addressed, the in-pharmacy medication review program could help pharmacists to better engage with patients and general practitioners and enhance understanding of medication and adherence.","output":"Exploring pharmacists' views on an in-pharmacy medication review program in Australia using a mixed-methods design."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that also have anti-inflammatory/ immunomodulatory properties, and have been suggested as an adjunct therapy for COVID-19.

A retrospective study showed favorable effects for statins in SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSION Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a high risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic complications and pleiotropic effects of statins may help manage the COVID-19. There is growing evidence that supports the need for trials of statin treatment in COVID-19 infection.","output":"The Potential Impact of Statins in the Treatment of Patients with COVID-19 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Both the COVID-19 pandemic and its management have had a negative impact on mental health worldwide. There is a growing body of research on mental health as it relates to the pandemic. The objective of this study is to use bibliometric analyses to assess the mental health research output related to the COVID-19 pandemic and compare it to that of the West Africa Ebola and H1N1 outbreaks. METHODOLOGY: We performed comprehensive searches in Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases, and included all types of documents related to the three outbreaks published since the respective beginnings up to August 26, 2020. RESULTS: Despite the shorter time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to Ebola and H1N1, we found a much greater number of mental health documents related to COVID-19 (n = 3070) compared to the two other outbreaks (127 for Ebola and 327 for H1N1). The proportion of documents in the top 10% journals was 31% for COVID-19, 24% for Ebola, and 40% for H1N1. Authors affiliated with institutions located in high-income countries published or contributed to 79% of all documents followed by authors from upper-middle-income countries (23%), lower-middle-income countries (10%), and low-income countries (2%). Approximately 19% of the documents reported receiving funding and 23% were the product of international collaboration. CONCLUSION: Mental health research output is already greater for COVID-19 compared to Ebola and H1N1 combined. A minority of documents reported funding, was the product of international collaboration, or was published by authors located in low-income countries during the three outbreaks in general, and the COVID-19 pandemic in particular.","output":"Mental health research in response to the COVID-19, Ebola, and H1N1 outbreaks: A comparative bibliometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This supplement contains the abstracts of the best oral and e-poster presentations of the 33rd Annual Meeting of the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) The content of this supplement shows that despite all of the difficulties that the pandemic has generated for researchers in the field of childhood disability, who have had to delay or strongly modify their projects, for example due to limitations to live interactions with research participants related with social distancing measures, their research has continued to thrive Among all of the original contributions to this supplement a number of abstracts directly tackle the effects that COVID-19 has had on children with disabilities, their families, and their care, demonstrating how responsive and adaptive our research community can be when faced with such a major public health crisis [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Forewords"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent outbreaks of infectious diseases caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have sounded a piercing alarm for the need of new effective antimicrobial agents to guard public health.

Our study aimed to develop a decisional algorithm able to predict pregnancy and live birth rates after controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) phase, helping the physician to decide whether to perform oocytes pick-up continuing the ongoing ART path. METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis of real-world data was carried out including all fresh ART cycles performed in 1998C2020. Baseline characteristics, ART parameters and biochemical/clinical pregnancies and live birth rates were collected. A seven-steps systematic approach for model development, combining linear regression analyses and decision trees (DT), was applied for biochemical, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. RESULTS: Of fresh ART cycles, 12,275 were included. Linear regression analyses highlighted a relationship between number of ovarian follicles > 17 mm detected at ultrasound before pick-up (OF17), embryos number and fertilization rate, and biochemical and clinical pregnancy rates (p < 0.001), but not live birth rate. DT were created for biochemical pregnancy (statistical powerCSP:80.8%), clinical pregnancy (SP:85.4%), and live birth (SP:87.2%). Thresholds for OF17 entered in all DT, while sperm motility entered the biochemical pregnancys model, and female age entered the clinical pregnancy and live birth DT. In case of OF17 < 3, the chance of conceiving was < 6% for all DT. CONCLUSION: A systematic approach allows to identify OF17, female age, and sperm motility as pre-retrieval predictors of ART outcome, possibly reducing the socio-economic burden of ART failure, allowing the clinician to perform or not the oocytes pick-up.","output":"The (decision) tree of fertility: an innovative decision-making algorithm in assisted reproduction technique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The overuse of low value medical tests and treatments drives costs and patient harm.

Thus, online views have become the dominant force in current public opinion. However, the rapid fermentation of polarized public opinion makes it very easy for actual topic views to go to extremes. Significantly, negative information seriously affects the healthy development of the social opinion ecology. Therefore, it is beneficial to maintain national credibility, social peace, and stability by exploring the communication structure of online public opinions, analyzing the logical model of extreme public attitudes, and guiding the communication of public opinions in a timely and reasonable manner. Starting from the JCA model and BA network, this paper explores the specific attributes of individuals and opinion network nodes. By incorporating parameters such as individual conformity and the strength of individual online relationships, we established a model of online group attitude polarization, then conducted simulation experiments on the phenomenon of online opinion polarization. Through simulations, we found that individual conformity and the difference in environmental attitude greatly influence the direction of opinion polarization events. In addition, crowd mentality makes individuals spontaneously choose the side of a particular, extreme view, which makes it easier for polarization to form and reach its peak.","output":"A Novel Public Opinion Polarization Model Based on BA Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 10-year-old male with prolonged fever, rash, and conjunctivitis presented to the emergency department with concern for Kawasaki disease, found to have myocarditis and PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Kawasaki Disease Features and Myocarditis in a Patient with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in 2019 has spread worldwide and continues to cause great threat to peoples' health as well as put pressure on the accessibility of medical systems. Early prediction of survival of hospitalized patients will help the clinical management of COVID-19, but such a prediction model which is reliable and valid is still lacking. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 628 confirmed cases of COVID-19 using positive RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China. These patients were randomly grouped into a training cohort (60%) and a validation cohort (40%). In the training cohort, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were utilized to identify prognostic factors for in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19. A nomogram based on the three variables was built for clinical use. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC), concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve were used to evaluate the efficiency of the nomogram in both the training and validation cohorts. RESULTS: Hypertension, higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and increased NT-proBNP value were found to be significantly associated with poorer prognosis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The three predictors were further used to build a prediction nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram in the training and validation cohorts was 0.901 and 0.892, respectively. The AUC in the training cohort was 0.922 for 14- day and 0.919 for 21-day probability of in-hospital survival, while in the validation cohort was 0.922 and 0.881, respectively. Moreover, the calibration curve for 14- day and 21-day survival also showed high coherence between the predicted and actual probability of survival. CONCLUSION: We managed to build a predictive model and constructed a nomogram for predicting in-hospital survival of patients with COVID-19.

We investigated whether the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) can be detected in serum and plasma samples during the early stages of SARS and studied the potential prognostic implications of such an approach. Methods: We developed two real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays, one for the polymerase and the other for the nucleocapsid region of the virus genome, for measuring the concentration of SARS-CoV RNA in serum/plasma samples from SARS patients. Plasma samples were obtained from 12 confirmed SARS patients on the day of hospital admission, as well as on days 7 and 14 after fever onset. Serum samples were also obtained from 23 confirmed SARS patients on the day of hospital admission, 11 of whom subsequently required intensive care. Viral RNA was extracted from the plasma/serum samples. The extracted RNA was subjected to analysis by the RT-PCR assays. Results: The RT-PCR system for the polymerase region detected SARS-CoV RNA in 50% of plasma and 78% of serum samples from SARS patients during the first week of illness. The detection rates for plasma dropped to 25% at day 14 after fever onset. The median serum SARS-CoV concentrations in patients who required and did not require intensive care unit admission during the course of hospitalization were 5800 and 140 copies/mL, respectively (MannCWhitney test, P <0.005). These data were confirmed by the RT-PCR system for the nucleocapsid region, which showed an even higher detection rate of 87%. The correlation between the results obtained by the two RT-PCR systems was high (Pearson correlation analysis, r = 0.998; P <0.001).

Here, we propose the use of tandem mass spectrometry to detect SARS-CoV-2 marker peptides in nasopharyngeal swabs. We documented that the signal from the microbiota present in such samples is low and can be overlooked when interpreting shotgun proteomic data acquired on a restricted window of the peptidome landscape. In this proof-of-concept study, simili nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with different quantities of purified SARS-CoV-2 viral material were used to develop a nanoLC-MS/MS acquisition method, which was then successfully applied on COVID-19 clinical samples. We argue that peptides ADETQALPQR and GFYAQGSR from the nucleocapsid protein are of utmost interest as their signal is intense and their elution can be obtained within a 3 min window in the tested conditions.

The CCVAF framework uses information and communication technology (ICT) to assess climate change vulnerabilities among rural farmers by integrating both community level and individual household level indicators. The CCVAF was instantiated into a GIS-based web application named THRIVE for different decision-makers to better assess how climate change is affecting rural farmers in Western Honduras. Qualitative evaluation of the THRIVE showed that it is an innovative and useful tool.

The factors associated with adverse reactions after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been sufficiently evaluated. Methods: We used the Disease Analyzer database (IQVIA) to identify 531,468 individuals who received a total of 908,869 SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations in 827 general practices in Germany between April and September 2021. Cox regression models were used to analyze the frequency of vaccination-related side effects reported within 14 days after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, as well as subjects demographic characteristics and comorbidities. Results: The total number of side effects documented was 28,287 (3.1% of all vaccinations). Pain in the limb (24.3%), fatigue (21.0%), dizziness (17.9%), joint pain (15.7%), fever (9.5%), nausea (7.5%), and myalgia (6.4%) were the most common side effects documented among the 12,575 vaccinations with definite side effects. In the multivariate regression analysis, young age was associated with much higher odds of reported side effects (OR(18C30 years): 4.45, OR(31C40 years): 3.50, OR(41C50 years): 2.89).

Finally, the male sex was associated with increased odds of reported side effects (OR: 1.17). Conclusion: Our study, based on a large outpatient database from Germany, identified young age, male sex, and pre-existing comorbidities such as dementia, somatoform disorders, anxiety disorders, and depression as factors associated with vaccine-related adverse events diagnosed in GP practices.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of palliative care consultation on the incidence of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed and comfort care received at the end-of-life in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We used the Society of Critical Care Medicines COVID-19 registry to extract clinical data on patients hospitalized with COVID-19 between March 31st, 2020 to March 17th, 2021 and died during their hospitalization. The proportion of patients who received palliative care consultation was assessed in patients who did and did not receive CPR (primary outcome) and comfort care (secondary outcome). Propensity matching was used to account for potential confounding variables. Measurements and Main Results: 3,227 patients were included in the analysis. There was no significant difference in the incidence of palliative care consultation between the CPR and no-CPR groups (19.9% vs. 19.4%, p = 0.8334). Patients who received comfort care at the end-of-life were significantly more likely to have received palliative care consultation (43.3% vs. 7.7%, p < 0.0001). After propensity matching for comfort care on demographic characteristics and comorbidities, this relationship was still significant (43.2% vs. 8.5%; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Palliative care consultation was not associated with CPR performed at the end-of-life but was associated with increased incidence of comfort care being utilized.

A survey was distributed to site principal investigators to measure contextual elements related to care pathway implementation. Questions included the inner setting measures of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), study-specific potential barriers and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical research. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare characteristics of institutions that agreed that their department supported the implementation of symptom management care pathways vs. institutions that did not agree. Results: Of the 25 sites, one withdrew because of resource constraints and one did not respond, leaving 23 institutions. Among the seven CFIR constructs, the least supported was implementation climate; 57% agreed there was support, 39% agreed there was recognition and 39% agreed there was prioritization for symptom management care pathway implementation at their institution.

Nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) have been put forward as potential regulators of inflammation and of ACE2 expression. As vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) activates nAChRs, we aimed to investigate whether VNS can be instrumental in affecting intestinal epithelial ACE2 expression. Methods: C By using publicly available datasets we qualified epithelial ACE2 expression in human intestine, and assessed gene co-expression of ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 priming Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2) with nAChRs in intestinal epithelial cells. Next, we investigated mouse and human ACE2 expression in intestinal tissues after chronic VNS via implanted devices. Results: C We show co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with nAChRs and 7 nAChR in particular in intestinal stem cells, goblet cells, and enterocytes. However, VNS did not affect ACE2 expression in murine or human intestinal tissue, albeit in colitis setting. Conclusions: C ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are specifically expressed in epithelial cells of human intestine, and both are co-expressed with nAChRs. However, no evidence for regulation of ACE2 expression through VNS could be found.

To prevent aerosol splatter, use of high-volume suction was preferred by 49% of dental surgeons. Conclusion: In our study, we concluded that dental surgeons, who come under high risk category;had good basic knowledge about COVID-19 disease process as well as transmission. However, it is imperative that these clinicians need to be extra cautious in handling cases during this pandemic time and limit the disease spread as well.","output":"Knowledge, perception, and attitude on conservative and endodontic practice on COVID pandemic situation: A qualitative research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Vitamin D deficiency and immune dysregulation are reciprocally linked In turn, associations between Vitamin D deficiency and the course of several infections, including influenza, as well as certain cancers and metabolic conditions have been previously reported African-Americans are known to have a higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency than Caucasians We are now analyzing racial differences in 25-OH-D deficiency in US Veterans, who have a more homogeneous access to laboratory testing and Vitamin D supplementation than the general population Methods: The study is based on analysis of electronic medical records In a sample of 2,399,411 Veterans [age (SD)= 62 2(15)} who had at least one blood 25-OH-D result during FY2001-FY2014, the lowest level was seasonally adjusted and analyzed Odds of having a seasonally adjusted blood level of 25-OH-D level &lt;20ng/ml (deficiency) were compared between African-American and other racial groups using logistic regressions with adjustment for gender and age Results: The mean (SD) of 25-OH-D blood level was 22 6(12) African-Americans had higher odds of deficient 25-OH-D than White Veterans (OR 3 44 95% CI 3 40-3 46, p&lt;0 0001), and all other race groups (p&lt;0 0001) Conclusions: Study is limited by not adjusting for BMI/obesity The robust racial-differences identified, if not minimized through treatment and prevention, may lead to racial discrimination through increased morbidity and mortality from certain infections, malignancies, neuropsychiatric and metabolic disease associated with deficient Vitamin D Additional studies are necessary to identify more definitively if racial differences in Vitamin D deficiency could also contribute to the reported higher COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in African-Americans Supported By: Rocky Mountain MIRECC for Suicide Prevention Keywords: Vitamin D, African American, Racial Differences, US Veterans","output":"Among US Veterans, Higher Rates of Vitamin D Deficiency in African Americans"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guanxin-Shutong capsule (GXSTC), a combination of Mongolian medicines and traditional herbs, has been clinically proven to be effective in treating cerebrovascular diseases (CBVDs). However, the underlying pharmacological mechanisms of GXSTC in CBVDs remain largely unknown. In this study, a combination of systems pharmacology and experimental assessment approach was used to investigate the bioactive components, core targets, and possible mechanisms of GXSTC in the treatment of CBVDs. A total of 15 main components within GXSTC were identified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and a literature research. Fifty-five common genes were obtained by matching 252 potential genes of GXSTC with 462 CBVD-related genes. Seven core components in GXSTC and 12 core genes of GXSTC on CBVDs were further determined using the protein-protein interaction (PPI) and component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis results predicted that the molecular mechanisms of GXSTC on CBVDs were mainly associated with the regulation of the vascular endothelial function, inflammatory response, and neuronal apoptosis. Molecular docking results suggested that almost all of core component-targets have an excellent binding activity (affinity < ?5 kcal/mol). More importantly, in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) -injured rats, GXSTC significantly improved the neurological function, reduced the infarct volume, and decreased the percentage of impaired neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting results indicated that GXSTC markedly upregulated the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), while downregulating the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and transcription factor AP-1 (c-Jun) in MCAO-injured rats. These findings confirmed our prediction that GXSTC exerts a multi-target synergetic mechanism in CBVDs by maintaining vascular endothelial function, inhibiting neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory processes. The results of this study may provide a theoretical basis for GXSTC research and the clinical application of GXSTC in CBVDs.","output":"Investigation of the Multi-Target Mechanism of Guanxin-Shutong Capsule in Cerebrovascular Diseases: A Systems Pharmacology and Experimental Assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We explored the collateral harm in Dutch children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic from experience of paediatricians via an open question distributed via the website of the Dutch Paediatric Society.

The meetings were attended by 168 health professionals, scientists, academics, ethicists, religious leaders, and other community members representing 40 countries in these regions. Methods: We reviewed the meeting reports, notes and stories and mapped outcomes to the key ethical challenges for pandemic influenza response described in the World Health Organizations (WHOs) guidance, Ethical Considerations in Developing a Public Health Response to Pandemic Influenza: transparency and public engagement, allocation of resources, social distancing, obligations to and of healthcare workers, and international collaboration. Results: The important role of transparency and public engagement were widely accepted among participants. However, there was general agreement that no \\"one size fits all\\" approach to allocating resources can address the variety of economic, cultural and other contextual factors that must be taken into account. The importance of social distancing as a tool to limit disease transmission was also recognized, but the difficulties associated with this measure were acknowledged. There was agreement that healthcare workers often have competing obligations and that government has a responsibility to assist healthcare workers in doing their job by providing appropriate training and equipment. Finally, there was agreement about the importance of international collaboration for combating global health threats. Conclusion: Although some cultural differences in the values that frame pandemic preparedness and response efforts were observed, participants generally agreed on the key ethical principles discussed in the WHOs guidance.

Stress echocardiography is one of the most widely used cardiac tests in the NHS. We assessed the impact of the first (W(1)) and second (W(2)) waves of the pandemic on the ability to deliver stress echocardiography. METHODS: Clinical echocardiography teams in 31 NHS hospitals participating in the EVAREST study were asked to complete a survey on the structure and delivery of stress echocardiography as well as its impact on patients and staff in July and November 2020. Results were compared to stress echocardiography activity in the same centre during January 2020. RESULTS: 24 completed the survey in July, and 19 NHS hospitals completed the survey in November. A 55% reduction in the number of studies performed was reported in W(1), recovering to exceed pre-COVID rates in W(2). The major change was in the mode of stress delivery. 70% of sites stopped their exercise stress service in W(1), compared to 19% in W(2). In those still using exercise during W(1), 50% were wearing FFP3/N95 masks, falling to 38% in W(2). There was also significant variability in patient screening practices with 7 different pre-screening questionnaires used in W(1) and 6 in W(2). CONCLUSION: Stress echocardiography delivery restarted effectively after COVID-19 with adaptations to reduce transmission that means activity has been able to continue, and exceed, pre-COVID-19 levels during the second wave.

METHODS In this retrospective, single center cohort study, we included all adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted to a Neuro-COVID Unit from February 21, 2020, who had been discharged or died by April 5, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data were extracted from medical records and compared (FDR-corrected) to those of neurologic patients without COVID-19 admitted in the same period. RESULTS One hundred seventy-three patients were included in this study, of whom 56 were positive for COVID-19 while 117 were negative for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 were older (77.0, IQR 67.0-83.8 vs 70.1, IQR 52.9-78.6, p = 0.006), had a different distribution regarding admission diagnoses, including cerebrovascular disorders (n = 43, 76.8% vs n = 68, 58.1%), and had a higher quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score on admission (0.5, IQR 0.4-0.6 vs 0.9, IQR 0.7-1.1, p = 0.006). In-hospital mortality rates (n = 21, 37.5% vs n = 5, 4.3%, p < 0.001) and incident delirium (n = 15, 26.8% vs n = 9, 7.7%, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in the COVID-19 group. COVID-19 and non-COVID patients with stroke had similar baseline characteristics but patients with COVID-19 had higher modified Rankin scale scores at discharge (5.0, IQR 2.0-6.0 vs 2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0, p < 0.001), with a significantly lower number of patients with a good outcome (n = 11, 25.6% vs n = 48, 70.6%, p < 0.001). In patients with COVID-19, multivariable regressions showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with higher qSOFA scores (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.21-16.5; p = 0.025), lower platelet count (0.98, 0.97-0.99; p = 0.005) and higher lactate dehydrogenase (1.01, 1.00-1.03; p = 0.009) on admission.

This paper explores assembly operators perceptions of cognitive/mental workload to provide a holistic understanding of the work conditions that affect cognitive demands and performance. While the physical loading aspects of assembly work are well known, most empirical literature dealing with cognitive/mental loading in manufacturing tends to examine a few particular aspects, rather than address the issue with a holistic system view. This semi-structured interview study, involving 50 industrial assembly operators from three Swedish companies, explores how assemblers perceive that their cognitive performance and well-being is influenced by a wide variety of factors within the context of mechanical product assembly. The interview transcripts were analysed using a priori coding, followed by bottom-up Thematic Analysis. The results indicate that a variety of systemic effects on assemblers cognitive performance can be classified as job demands or resources. Quite often, the absence of a resource mirrors a related demand, and good assembly conditions, as described by the interviewees, often re-frame demands as desirable challenges that foster motivation and positive feelings towards the work. The identified demands and resources stem from task design, timing, physical loading, intrinsic and extrinsic motivators, social teamwork and the products interface design. Despite organisational differences and conditions between the three companies that took part in the study, the results are largely consistent.","output":"Cognitive Ergonomics of Assembly Work from a Job DemandsCResources Perspective: Three Qualitative Case Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Il CoViD-19 contamina i corpi, ma anche le anime.

RESULTS Questionnaires were obtained from 30 subjects (mean age 33  11 y) using NIV for 12  7 y. Fifteen subjects used NIV for > 20 h/day, and 11 were totally ventilator-dependent. The subject-reported benefits of mouthpiece ventilation were a reduction in dyspnea (73%) and fatigue (93%) and an improvement in speech (43%) and eating (27%). The bench study showed that none of the ventilators, even those with mouthpiece ventilation software, were able to deliver mouthpiece ventilation without alarms and/or autotriggering in each condition. Alarms and/or ineffective triggering or autotriggering were observed in 135 of the 198 conditions. The occurrence of alarms was more common with a large mouthpiece without a filter compared to a small mouthpiece with a filter (P < .001), but it was not related to the patient profile, the ventilatory mode, or the type of ventilator.

The determination of glycan composition is highly important regarding their development and production. Therefore, there is a demand for analytical techniques enabling rapid and reliable glycoprofiling of therapeutic proteins. For the investigation of changes in glycan structures, we have employed two platforms: lectin-based protein microarray, and MALDI-MS. In lectin-based microarray analysis, the samples of IgA were printed on the microarray slide, incubated with the set of lectins with various specificity and evaluation of changes in glycosylation was based on differences in reactivity of samples with lectins. MALDI-MS was used for N-glycan analysis of IgA1 samples. IgAs are effective as therapeutic agents in defense against viruses that use sialic acid as a receptor. Dimeric IgA1 antibodies were produced by stable cell line IgA1/2G9 on the basal medium at different conditions (different supplementation and feeding) and we also evaluated the effect of different conditions on lactate production, which correlates with IgA productivity. Decrease of lactate levels was observed during supplementation with succinic acid, asparagine, or with mannose feeding. We found by lectin-based microarray analysis that the metabolic shift from glutamine to asparagine or feeding with glucose caused increase of high mannose type glycans what was confirmed also by MALDI-MS. Among other changes in IgA glycosylation determined by lectin-based protein microarray were, for example, reduced galactosylation after supplementation with succinic acid and increase of both sialylation and galactosylation after supplementation with glutamine and feeding with mannose.

The current management of acute appendicitis is increasingly controversial as non-operative management gains favor. Although rare, appendiceal neoplasms are often found as an incidental finding in the setting of appendectomy. Criteria and screening for appendiceal neoplasms are not standardized among surgical societies. METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried for all patients who underwent appendectomy over a 9-year period (2010C2018). Over the same time period, patients who underwent appendectomy in two municipal hospitals in The Bronx, New York City, USA were reviewed. RESULTS: We found a 1.7% incidence of appendiceal neoplasms locally and a 0.53% incidence of appendiceal tumors in a national population sample. Both groups demonstrated an increased incidence of appendiceal carcinoma by age. This finding was most pronounced after the age of 40 in both local and national populations. In our study, the incidence of appendiceal tumors increased with each decade interval up to the age of 80 and peaked at 2.1% in patients between 70 and 79 years.

Many studies reported on the association of COVID-19 with pregnancy specific adverse outcomes but prediction models utilizing large cohort of pregnant women are still lacking for estimating the risk of maternal morbidity and other adverse events. Objective The main aim of this study was to develop a prediction model to quantify the risk of progression to critical COVID-19 and intensive care unit admission in pregnant women with symptomatic infection. Study design This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study including eight hospitals from four countries (UK, Austria, Greece and Turkey). Data extraction was from February 2020 until May 2021. Included were consecutive pregnant and early postpartum women (within 10 days of birth), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome was progression to critical illness requiring intensive care. Secondary outcomes included maternal death, preeclampsia and stillbirth. The association between the primary outcome and 12 candidate predictors with known association with severe COVID-19 in pregnancy, was analyzed with log-binomial mixed-effects regression and reported as adjusted risk ratios (aRR). All potential predictors were evaluated in one model and only baseline factors in another. Predictive accuracy were assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC). Results Of 793 pregnant women positive for SARS-CoV-2 and symptomatic, 44 (5.5%) were admitted to intensive care, of whom 10 died (1.3%). The mini-COvid Maternal Intensive Therapy model included demographic and clinical variables available at disease onset: maternal age (aRR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.07C1.95, P=0.015); body-mass index (aRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.06C1.66, P=0.010); and diagnosis in the third trimester of pregnancy (aRR: 3.64, 95% CI: 1.78C8.46, P=0.001). The optimism-adjusted AUROC was 0.73. The full-COvid Maternal Intensive Therapy model included body-mass index (aRR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.07C1.95, P=0.015), lower respiratory symptoms (aRR: 5.11, 95% CI: 1.81C21.4, P=0.007), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (aRR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.36C1.89, P<0.001); and serum C-reactive protein (aRR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.15C1.44, P<0.001), with an optimism-adjusted AUROC 0.85. Neither model showed signs of poor fit (P>0.05). Categorization as high risk by either model was associated with a shorter diagnosis to ICU admission interval (log-rank test P<0.001, both), higher maternal death (5.2% vs. 0.2%; P<0.0001) and preeclampsia (5.7% vs. 1.0%; P=0.0003). A spreadsheet calculator is available for risk estimation. Conclusion At presentation with symptomatic COVID-19, pregnant and recently postpartum women can be stratified into high and low-risk for progression to critical disease, even where resources are limited.

During the lockdown caused by this disease, many financial losses have been inflicted on people and all industries. One of the fastest ways to save these industries from the COVID-19 is to provide a reliable solution for people's health assessment. In this article, blockchain technology is used to propose a model which provides and validates the health certificates for people who travel or present in society. For this purpose, we take advantage of blockchain features in protecting people's privacy. Since a variety of antibody and human health proving tests against the virus are developing, this study tries simultaneously to design an integrated and secure system to meet the authenticity and accuracy of different people's health certificates for the companies requiring these certifications. In this system, on the one hand, there are qualified laboratories that are responsible for performing standard testing and also providing results to the system controller. Finally, people are considered as the end-user of the system. To provide test information for the entities, the mechanism of KYC tokens will be used based on the Stellar private blockchain network. In this mechanism, the user will buy a certain amount of KYC tokens from the system controller. These tokens are charged in the user's wallet, and the user can send these tokens from his wallet to any destination company, to exchange the encrypted health certificate information. Finally, considering the appropriate platform provided by blockchain technology and the requirement of a reliable and accurate solution for issuing health certificates during the Covid-19 pandemic or any other disease, this article offers a solution to meet the requirements.","output":"A Secure and Efficient Approach for Issuing KYC Token As COVID-19 Health Certificate Based on Stellar Blockchain Network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two experienced radiologists reviewed chest radiographs of 28 patients with SARS. Each lung was divided into upper, middle, and lower zones. A SARS-related lesion in each zone was scored using a four-point scale: zero to three. The mean and maximal radiographic scores were analyzed statistically to determine if the scorings were related to the laboratory data and clinical course. RESULTS: Forward stepwise multiple linear regression showed that the mean radiographic score correlated most significantly with the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001). The second most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the number of days of intubation (p = 0.025). The maximal radiographic score correlated best with the percentage of lymphocytes in a leukocyte count (p < 0.001), while the second most significant factor was the number of hospitalized days (p < 0.001) and the third most significant factor was the absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.013). The mean radiographic scores of the patients who died, with comorbidities and without a comorbidity were 11.1, 6.3 and 2.9, respectively (p = 0.032).

It also includes the updated and extended results of the econometric analysis of VAT Gap determinants initiated and initially reported in the 2018 Report (Poniatowski et al., 2018). As a novelty, the econometric analysis to forecast potential impacts of the coronavirus crisis and resulting recession on the evolution of the VAT Gap in 2020 is reported.In 2018, most European Union (EU) Member States (MS) saw a slight decrease in the pace of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, but the economic conditions for increasing tax compliance remained favourable. We estimate that the VAT total tax liability (VTTL) in 2018 increased by 3.6 percent whereas VAT revenue increased by 4.2 percent, leading to a decline in the VAT Gap in both relative and nominal terms. In relative terms, the EU-wide Gap dropped to 11 percent and EUR 140 billion. Fast estimates show that the VAT Gap will likely continue to decline in 2019.Of the EU-28, the smallest Gaps were observed in Sweden (0.7 percent), Croatia (3.5 percent), and Finland (3.6 percent), the largest C in Romania (33.8 percent), Greece (30.1 percent), and Lithuania (25.9 percent). Overall, half of the EU-28 MS recorded a Gap above 9.2 percent. In nominal terms, the largest Gaps were recorded in Italy (EUR 35.4 billion), the United Kingdom (EUR 23.5 billion), and Germany (EUR 22 billion).The Policy Gap and its components remained stable. For the EU overall, the average Policy Gap level was 44.24 percent. Of this, in 2018, 10.07 percentage points were due to the application of various reduced and super-reduced rates (the Rate Gap) and 34.17 were due to the application of exemptions without the right to deduct.The results of the econometric analysis show that the VAT Gap is influenced by a group of factors relating to the current economic conditions, institutional environment, and economic structure as well as to the measures and actions of tax administrations. Out of a broad set of tested variables, GDP growth and general government balance appeared to explain a substantial set of VAT Gap variation across time and countries. Within the control of tax administrations, share of IT expenditure proved to have the highest statistical significance in explaining the size of the VAT Gap. In addition, the VAT Gap appeared to be inter-related with the values of risky imports of goods, indicating the role of fraud in driving the overall share of the VAT Gap.Since the COVID-19 recession will likely have a dire impact on the EU economies, the VAT Gap in 2020 is forecasted to increase. If the EU economy contracts by 7.4 percent in 2020 and the general government deficit jumps as forecasted in the Spring Forecast of the European Commission, the Gap could increase by 4.1 percentage points year-over year up to 13.7 percent and EUR 164 billion in 2020. The hike in 2020 could be more pronounced than the gradual decrease of the Gap observed over the three preceding years. Moreover, a return to the VAT Gap levels observed in 2018 and 2019 will take time and require significant action from tax administrations.This Report has been written for the European Commission, DG TAXUD, for the project TAXUD/2019/AO-14, Study and Reports on the VAT Gap in the EU-28 Member States, and is a follow-up to the seven reports published between 2013 and 2019.","output":"Study and Reports on the VAT Gap in the EU-28 Member States: 2020 Final Report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM There have been increasing reports in the literature highlighting the complication of V-loc? associated small bowel obstruction in patients after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy.

We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD is associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augments neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines are comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans.

We conducted a questionnaire survey related to risk perception of COVID-19, precautionary behavior, and physical activity. RESULTS: There were 187 patients (61.1%) with estimated glomerular filtration rate of <45 mL/min/1.73 m(2). This population showed a higher degree of risk perception for COVID-19 than the general population. Age was the most significant determinant of risk perception among CKD patients. During the pandemic, social distancing and hygiene-related behavior were significantly increased (p < 0.001). The frequency of exercise was decreased only in those who took regular exercise, without diabetes, or with a lower Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (p < 0.001), with no change among the other groups. Socioeconomic status and comorbidities significantly affected behavioral characteristics regardless of the category. Education and income were significantly associated with precautionary behaviors such as staying at home and hand sanitizer use. Patients with higher CCI status significantly increased frequency of exercise (adjusted odds ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.01C4.38).

In a total of thirty specimens examined, nineteen (63.3%) were infected by an undescribed parasite species belonging to the genus Myxobolus. Plasmodial development was asynchronous, with young development in the periphery and mature myxospores in the central area and without projections and microvilli in the plasmodial wall. Mature myxospores were ovoid in shape and measured 7.9  0.2 m (7.6-8.1 m) in length and 5.4  0.1 m (5.0-5.6 m) in width. The two polar capsules were equal in size, occupying a little more than half of the myxospore body, measuring 4.0  0.2 m (3.9-4.1 m) in length and 1.7  0.1 m (1.5-1.8 m) in width. The polar tubules coiled in six turns, perpendicular to the long axis of polar capsule. Phylogenetic analysis placed the new species within a clade containing nine myxobolid species from South American characiforms fish and appears as a close species of Myxobolus pantanalis. Nevertheless, the sequences of the new species and M. pantanalis have a large genetic divergence of 13.5% in their SSU rDNA.

Millions of people are medically examined, and their data keep piling up awaiting classification. The data are typically both incomplete and heterogeneous which hampers classical classification algorithms. Some researchers have recently modified the popular KNN algorithm as a solution, where they handle incompleteness by imputation and heterogeneity by converting categorical data into numbers. In this article, we introduce a novel KNN variant (KNNV) algorithm that provides better results as demonstrated by thorough experimental work. We employ rough set theoretic techniques to handle both incompleteness and heterogeneity, as well as to find an ideal value for K. The KNNV algorithm takes an incomplete, heterogeneous dataset, containing medical records of people, and identifies those cases with COVID-19. We use in the process two popular distance metrics, Euclidean and Mahalanobis, in an effort to widen the operational scope. The KNNV algorithm is implemented and tested on a real dataset from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology. The experimental results show that it can efficiently and accurately classify COVID-19 cases. It is also compared to three KNN derivatives. The comparison results show that it greatly outperforms all its competitors in terms of four metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, and F-Score. The algorithm given in this article can be easily applied to classify other diseases. Moreover, its methodology can be further extended to do general classification tasks outside the medical field.","output":"Accurate Classification of COVID-19 Based on Incomplete Heterogeneous Data using a KNN Variant Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Endobronchial tuberculosis (TB) is an uncommon manifestation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Pakistan in Asian countries is considered the third country with higher number of cases of coronavirus with more than 200,000. Recently, many mathematical models have been considered to better understand the coronavirus infection. Most of these models are based on classical integer-order derivative which can not capture the fading memory and crossover behavior found in many biological phenomena. Therefore, we study the coronavirus disease in this paper by exploring the dynamics of COVID-19 infection using the non-integer Caputo derivative. In the absence of vaccine or therapy, the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is examined on the dynamics of theCOVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. First, we construct the model in integer sense and then apply the fractional operator to have a generalized model. The generalized model is then used to present the detailed theoretical results. We investigate the stability of the model for the case of fractional model using a nonlinear fractional Lyapunov function of Goh-Voltera type. Furthermore, we estimate the values of parameters with the help of least square curve fitting tool for the COVID-19 data recorded in Pakistan since March 1 till June 30, 2020 and show that our considered model give an accurate prediction to the real COVID-19 statistical cases.

All LNs harvested during surgery require tissue processing and subsequent microscopic histopathologic assessment to determine the nodal stage. In this study, we investigated the use of the fluorescent tracer cetuximab-800CW to discriminate between tumor-positive and tumor-negative LNs before histopathologic examination. Here, we report a retrospective ad hoc analysis of a clinical trial designed to evaluate the resection margin in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (NCT02415881). Methods: Two days before surgery, patients were intravenously administered 75 mg of cetuximab followed by 15 mg of cetuximab-800CW, an epidermal growth factor receptorCtargeting fluorescent tracer. Fluorescence images of excised, formalin-fixed LNs were obtained and correlated with histopathologic assessment. Results: Fluorescence molecular imaging of 514 LNs (61 pathologically positive nodes) could detect tumor-positive LNs ex vivo with 100% sensitivity and 86.8% specificity (area under the curve, 0.98). In this cohort, the number of LNs that required microscopic assessment was decreased by 77.4%, without missing any metastases. Additionally, in 7.5% of the LNs false-positive on fluorescence imaging, we identified metastases missed by standard histopathologic analysis. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that epidermal growth factor receptorCtargeted fluorescence molecular imaging can aid in the detection of LN metastases in the ex vivo setting in oral cancer patients.

A variant may grow faster if it produces a larger number of secondary infections (transmissibility advantage) or if the timing of secondary infections (generation time) is better. So far, assessments have largely focused on deriving the transmissibility advantage assuming the generation time was unchanged. Yet, knowledge of both is needed to anticipate impact. Here we develop an analytical framework to investigate the contribution of both the transmissibility advantage and generation time to the growth advantage of a variant. We find that the growth advantage depends on the epidemiological context (level of epidemic control). More specifically, variants conferring earlier transmission are more strongly favoured when the historical strains have fast epidemic growth, while variants conferring later transmission are more strongly favoured when historical strains have slow or negative growth. We develop these conceptual insights into a statistical framework to infer both the transmissibility advantage and generation time of a variant. On simulated data, our framework correctly estimates both parameters when it covers time periods characterized by different epidemiological contexts. Applied to data for the Alpha and Delta variants in England and in Europe, we find that Alpha confers a +54% [95% CI, 45-63%] transmissibility advantage compared to previous strains, and Delta +140% [98-182%] compared to Alpha, and mean generation times are similar to historical strains for both variants.

We aimed to characterize thissurge compared to previous years. METHODS Children discharged from a single tertiary hospital for respiratory illness or selected non-communicable diseases between 2015- 2021 were included, and hospitalization rates were compared. To evaluate whether the current respiratory surge resembles a typical winter, characteristics of the second quarter (Q2,April-June) of 2021 were compared to parallel seasons and to autumn/winter (Q4, October-December) of previous years. RESULTS Respiratory illness showed a seasonal peak, while the pattern of noncommunicable disease was consistent throughout the study period. Respiratory illnesses showed a delayed surge in Q2 2021 (389 patients), with a missing seasonal peak in Q2 and Q4 2020 (135 and 119 patients, respectively). There were more cases of croup in Q2 2021 compared to Q2 and Q4 2015-2019 (26.2 vs. 12.5 and 15.8%, p<0.001), fewer cases of pneumonia (5.9 vs. 15.9 and 11.7%, p<0.001), lower admission rates (22.4 vs. 36.3 and 31.5%, p<0.001), and fewer hypoxemia during hospitalization (6.3 vs. 11.7 and 10%, p<0.001).

Methods: Data came from the 2015 Mexican Health and Aging Study (n = 11,507 adults aged 50 and over). Early- and late-life food insecurity were ascertained by self-report. We evaluated how both measures of food insecurity related to the performance of multiple cognitive tasks (Verbal Learning, Verbal Recall, Visual Scanning, and Verbal Fluency), while controlling for key health and sociodemographic confounders using linear regression. Results: In descriptive analyses, respondents who experienced food insecurity in either early or late life performed significantly worse on all cognitive tasks when compared to the food secure. In models adjusted for health and sociodemographic confounders, early-life food insecurity predicted worse Verbal Learning performance and late-life food insecurity was associated with poorer Visual Scanning performance. Conclusions: Food insecurity was related to poorer cognitive function in a nationally representative sample of older adults in Mexico. However, results suggested that the significance of effects depended on cognitive task and when in the life-course food insecurity was experienced.","output":"Food Insecurity across the Life-Course and Cognitive Function among Older Mexican Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Holy Communion is the oldest Christian practice, through which a gathered group of people partake bread and wine with a shared spoon.

Whether the same occurs during acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and role that IL-10 might play in liver disease is currently unknown. METHODS: Mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, as well as chimpanzees and patients acutely infected with HBV, were used to analyse the role of CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-10 in liver immunopathology. RESULTS: Mouse HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cells produce significant amounts of IL-10 upon in vivo antigen encounter. This is corroborated by longitudinal data in a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV, where serum IL-10 was readily detectable and correlated with intrahepatic CD8(+) T cell infiltration and liver disease severity. Unexpectedly, mouse and human CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-10 was found to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to enhance IL-2 responsiveness, thus preventing antigen-induced HBV-specific effector CD8(+) T cell apoptosis. Accordingly, the use of mouse models of HBV pathogenesis revealed that the IL-10 produced by effector CD8(+) T cells promoted their own intrahepatic survival and, thus supported, rather than suppressed liver immunopathology. CONCLUSION: Effector CD8(+) T cell-derived IL-10 enhances acute liver immunopathology. Altogether, these results extend our understanding of the cell- and tissue-specific role that IL-10 exerts in immune regulation. Lay summary: Interleukin-10 is mostly regarded as an immunosuppressive cytokine. We show here that HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells produce IL-10 upon antigen recognition and that this cytokine enhances CD8(+) T cell survival. As such, IL-10 paradoxically promotes rather than suppresses liver disease.","output":"Effector CD8(+) T cell-derived interleukin-10 enhances acute liver immunopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Searching for a mechanism underlying autoimmunity in autism, we postulated that gliadin peptides, heat shock protein 60 (HSP-60), and streptokinase (SK) bind to different peptidases resulting in autoantibody production against these components. We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens. Dysfunctional membrane peptidases and autoantibody production may result in neuroimmune dysregulation and autoimmunity.","output":"Heat shock protein and gliadin peptide promote development of peptidase antibodies in children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper we introduce a fusion framework for image tampering localization, that moves towards overcoming the limitation of available tools by allowing a synergistic analysis and multiperspective refinement of the final forensic report.

The epidemiologic relevance of such disorders justifies the increasing interest in further understanding the mechanisms underpinning the inflammatory process occurring in such chronic diseases to provide potential novel pharmacological approaches. The most common and effective therapies for controlling inflammation are glucocorticoids; however, a variety of other molecules have been demonstrated to have an anti-inflammatory potential, including neuropeptides. In recent years, the oxytocinergic system has seen an explosion of scientific studies, demonstrating its potential to contribute to a variety of physiological processes including inflammation. Therefore, the aim of the present review was to understand the role of oxytocin in the modulation of inflammation occurring in different chronic diseases. The criterion we used to select the diseases was based on the emerging literature showing a putative involvement of the oxytocinergic system in inflammatory processes in a variety of pathologies including neurological, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders, diabetes and obesity. The evidence reviewed here supports a beneficial role of oxytocin in the control of both peripheral and central inflammatory response happening in the aforementioned pathologies. Although future studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanistic details underlying such regulation, this review supports the idea that the modulation of the endogenous oxytocinergic system might represent a new potential pharmacological approach for the treatment of inflammation.","output":"Targeting the Oxytocinergic System: A Possible Pharmacological Strategy for the Treatment of Inflammation Occurring in Different Chronic Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The autoimmune disease known as Jo-1 positive anti-synthetase syndrome (ASS) is characterized by circulating antibody titers to histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HARS), which may play a role in modulating the non-canonical functions of HARS. Monoclonal antibodies to HARS were isolated by single-cell screening and sequencing from three Jo-1 positive ASS patients and shown to be of high affinity, covering diverse epitope space. The immune response was further characterized by repertoire sequencing from the most productive of the donor samples. In line with previous studies of autoimmune repertoires, these antibodies tended to have long complementarity-determining region H3 sequences with more positive-charged residues than average. Clones of interest were clustered into groups with related sequences, allowing us to observe different somatic mutations in related clones. We postulated that these had found alternate structural solutions for high affinity binding, but that mutations might be transferable between clones to further enhance binding affinity. Transfer of somatic mutations between antibodies within the same clonal group was able to enhance binding affinity in a number of cases, including beneficial transfer of a mutation from a lower affinity clone into one of higher affinity. Affinity enhancement was seen with mutation transfer both between related single-cell clones, and directly from related repertoire sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of somatic hypermutation transfer from repertoire sequences to further mature in vivo derived antibodies, and represents an additional tool to aid in affinity maturation for the development of antibodies.","output":"Isolation of monoclonal antibodies from anti-synthetase syndrome patients and affinity maturation by recombination of independent somatic variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global development of the world's leading countries is accelerating due to the active introduction of innovative information and communication technologies, the growth of global capacity of computer systems, their openness and data transfer speed.

Although there are several different types of luminescent thermometers, recently attention has been focused on a new single-band ratiometric approach, which is based on the excited state absorption phenomenon. Nevertheless, since this process is nontrivial and has not been studied extensively in the context of thermometry to date, a number of studies are necessary to enable the intentional development of highly sensitive thermometers based on this method. One of the important aspects is to investigate the influence of material size and the associated occurrence of surface effects, which is considered in this work. In addition, the research in this paper has been extended to explore the aspect of host material composition. Accordingly, nanocrystals and microcrystals of ?-NaYF4:2%Nd3+, ?-NaGdF4:2%Nd3+, and LiGdF4:2%Nd3+ were investigated in this work.

In this study, a transfer learning method is proposed as a solution to typical problems in the practical application of ML in buildings. Such problems are scaling a model to a different building, collecting ground truth data necessary for training the supervised model, and assuring the model is robust when conditions change. The practical application examined in this work is a deep learning model used for predicting room occupancy using indoor climate IoT sensors. This work proved that it is possible to significantly reduce the length of ground truth data collection to only two days. The robustness of the transferred model was tested as well, where performance stayed on a similar level if a suitable normalization technique was used. In addition, the proposed methodology was tested with room occupancy level prediction, showing slightly lower performance. Finally, the importance of understanding the performance metrics is crucial for market adoption of ML-based solutions in the built environment.

STUDY SAMPLE There were 150 severe cases of COVID-19 requiring hospital admission and 150 mild cases that were managed at home. Controls were 267 adults, 32 of whom had been hospitalised for a non-COVID-19 condition, and a further 85 who worked in hospital settings. RESULTS Deterioration in hearing and/or tinnitus was reported in 8% of the COVID-19 cases (tinnitus had resolved in 2% after the acute phase), with no significant difference between severe and mild cases. Deterioration in hearing or tinnitus was not significantly different from controls. However, rotatory vertigo was reported by 5% in the COVID-19 groups and 1.1% in the controls, and this difference was statistically significant.

Specifically, we analyze by using a Diff-in-Diff model, whether the ideology of each state, measure at three levels, affected the decrease in the NO2 levels observed after the pandemic outbreak in the US. We distinguish three alternative post-Covid periods and results show that the State ideology has a robust negative impact on the NO2 levels.

The antigen targets of immune responses may show polymorphisms that can undermine their recognition by immune effectors and hence render vaccines based on antigens from a single parasite variant ineffective against other variants. This study compared the influence of allelic polymorphisms in Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 (PfAMA1) peptide sequences from three strains of P. falciparum (3D7, 7G8 and FVO) on their function as immunodominant targets of T cell responses in high and low malaria transmission communities in Ghana. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 10 subjects from a high transmission area (Obom) and 10 subjects from a low transmission area (Legon) were tested against 15 predicted CD8 + T cell minimal epitopes within the PfAMA1 antigen of multiple parasite strains using IFN- ELISpot assay. The peptides were also tested in similar assays against CD8 + enriched PBMC fractions from the same subjects in an effort to characterize the responding T cell subsets. RESULTS: In assays using unfractionated PBMCs, two subjects from the high transmission area, Obom, responded positively to four (26.7%) of the 15 tested peptides. None of the Legon subject PBMCs yielded positive peptide responses using unfractionated PBMCs. In assays with CD8 + enriched PBMCs, three subjects from Obom made positive recall responses to six (40%) of the 15 tested peptides, while only one subject from Legon made a positive recall response to a single peptide. Overall, 5 of the 20 study subjects who had positive peptide-specific IFN- recall responses were from the high transmission area, Obom. Furthermore, while subjects from Obom responded to peptides in PfAMA1 from multiple parasite strains, one subject from Legon responded to a peptide from 3D7 strain only.

Diverging from the widely used volatility models that take into account only the elements related to the traded prices, namely the open, high, low, and close prices of a trading day (OHLC), the intrinsic entropy model takes into account the traded volumes during the considered time frame as well. We adjust the intraday intrinsic entropy model that we introduced earlier for exchange-traded securities in order to connect daily OHLC prices with the ratio of the corresponding daily volume to the overall volume traded in the considered period. The intrinsic entropy model conceptualizes this ratio as entropic probability or market credence assigned to the corresponding price level. The intrinsic entropy is computed using historical daily data for traded market indices (S&P 500, Dow 30, NYSE Composite, NASDAQ Composite, Nikkei 225, and Hang Seng Index). We compare the results produced by the intrinsic entropy model with the volatility estimates obtained for the same data sets using widely employed industry volatility estimators.

Objectives: Current, clinically relevant assessment and treatment methods applying immersive VR in forensic or adjacent clinical settings, were analyzed. Methods: This review surveyed the practical use of immersive VR in forensic psychiatry and relevant adjacent psychiatric and forensic fields from 2016 to 2020 and was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Out of the 1,105 journal articles screened, 14 met criteria for inclusion. Four articles described VR interventions directly addressing forensic psychiatric settings (treatment of general aggression and assessment of sexual offenders against children). The majority of the remaining articles were in the clinical domain of psychosis treatment. Several interventions were designed as part of comprehensive treatment programs, and others were intended as one-off assessments or paired with pre-existing psychological treatment. The degree to which the VR simulations were individualized to the user appeared to be largely dependent upon the extent of provider input. A variety of research methodologies were used in the included articles and the majority had limitations common to small-scale, non-randomized studies. None of the studies reported serious adverse effects. Discussion: There is a lack of large randomized controlled trials of current assessments or treatments using VR simulation in forensic psychiatry, let alone those with long-term follow-up, showing clear advantages of VR over standard practice.

Three-quarters of the participants reported undergraduate training in sleep medicine, while less than 60% did not receive any training on sleep disorders during their residencies. Almost half of the participants (45 %) did not feel prepared to treat neurological patients with sleep problems. Only one-third of the participants responded correctly to at least 3 MCQ. Notably, 80 % of participants favoured more education on sleep-wake disorders during the neurology residency. CONCLUSIONS Education and knowledge on sleep-wake disorders in European neurological residents is generally insufficient, despite a strong interest in the topic. The results of our study may be useful to improve the European Neurology curriculum and other postgraduate educational programs.","output":"Awakening to sleep disorders in Europe: survey on education, knowledge, and treatment competence of European residents and neurologists."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purified avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was used to screen a random phage display peptide library.

The QI initiatives, as implementation strategies, include a bundle of evidence-based interventions adapted for implementation in China. During the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, national lockdowns, and altered health care priorities have highlighted the program's importance in improving STEMI care quality. This study aims to minimize the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of STEMI care, by developing interventions that optimize the QI initiatives, implementing and evaluating the optimized QI initiatives, and developing scale-up activities of the optimized QI initiatives in response to COVID-19 and other public health emergencies. METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomized control trial will be conducted in three selected cities of China: Wuhan, Suzhou, and Shenzhen. Two districts have been randomly selected in each city, yielding a total of 24 registered hospitals. This study will conduct a rollout in these hospitals every 3 months. The 24 hospitals will be randomly assigned to four clusters, and each cluster will commence the intervention (optimized QI initiatives) at one of the four steps. We will conduct hospital-based assessments, questionnaire surveys among health care providers, community-based household surveys, and key informant interviews during the trial. All outcome measures will be organized using the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework, including implementation outcomes, service outcomes (e.g., treatment time), and patient outcomes (e.g., in-hospital mortality and 1-year complication). The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research framework will be used to identify factors that influence implementation of the optimized QI interventions. DISCUSSION: The study findings could be translated into a systematic solution to implementing QI initiatives in response to COVID-19 and future potential major public health emergencies.

OBJECTIVE: Summarize the prevalence of risk factors and adverse outcomes and determine their associations in COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science for case-series and observational studies of hospitalized COVID-19 patients through August 31, 2020. Data were analyzed by fixed-effects meta-analysis using Shores adjusted confidence intervals to address heterogeneity. RESULTS: Seventy-seven studies comprising 38906 hospitalized patients met inclusion criteria; 21468 from the US-Europe and 9740 from China. Overall prevalence of death [% (95% CI)] from COVID-19 was 20% (18C23%); 23% (19C27%) in the US and Europe and 11% (7C16%) for China. Of those that died, 85% were aged60 years, 66% were males, and 66%, 44%, 39%, 37%, and 27% had hypertension, smoking history, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic kidney disease (CKD), respectively. The case fatality risk [%(95% CI)] were 52% (46C60) for heart disease, 51% (43C59) for COPD, 48% (37C63) for chronic kidney disease (CKD), 39% for chronic liver disease (CLD), 28% (23C36%) for hypertension, and 24% (17C33%) for diabetes. Summary relative risk (sRR) of death were higher for age60 years [sRR = 3.6; 95% CI: 3.0C4.4], males [1.3; 1.2C1.4], smoking history [1.3; 1.1C1.6], COPD [1.7; 1.4C2.0], hypertension [1.8; 1.6C2.0], diabetes [1.5; 1.4C1.7], heart disease [2.1; 1.8C2.4], CKD [2.5; 2.1C3.0]. The prevalence of hypertension (55%), diabetes (33%), smoking history (23%) and heart disease (17%) among the COVID-19 hospitalized patients in the US were substantially higher than that of the general US population, suggesting increased susceptibility to infection or disease progression for the individuals with comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Public health screening for COVID-19 can be prioritized based on risk-groups. Appropriately addressing the modifiable risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes could reduce morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19; public messaging can be accordingly adapted.","output":"Prevalence and predictors of death and severe disease in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 77 studies and 38,000 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The therapeutic landscape for the treatment of cancer has evolved significantly in recent decades, aided by the development of effective oncology drugs. However, many cancer drugs are often poorly tolerated by the body and in particular the cardiovascular system, causing adverse and sometimes fatal side effects that negate the chemotherapeutic benefits. The prevalence and severity of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity warrants a deeper investigation of the mechanisms and implicating factors in this phenomenon, and a consolidation of scientific efforts to develop mitigating strategies. Aiding these efforts is the emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in recent years, which has allowed for the generation of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs): a human-based, patient-derived, and genetically variable platform that can be applied to the study of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and beyond. After surveying chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and the associated chemotherapeutic agents, we discuss the use of iPSC-CMs in cardiotoxicity modeling, drug screening, and other potential applications. Improvements to the iPSC-CM platform, such as the development of more adult-like cardiomyocytes and ongoing advances in biotechnology, will only enhance the utility of iPSC-CMs in both basic science and clinical applications.","output":"Cardiotoxicity of Antineoplastic Therapies and Applications of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study aimed to determine the association of hyperlipidemia with clinical endpoints among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially those with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes. Methods This multicenter retrospective cohort study included all patients who were hospitalized due to COVID-19 from 21 hospitals in Hubei province, China between December 31, 2019 and April 21, 2020. Patients who were aged < 18 or &#8805; 85 years old, in pregnancy, with acute lethal organ injury (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, severe acute pancreatitis, acute stroke), hypothyroidism, malignant diseases, severe malnutrition, and those with normal lipid profile under lipid-lowering medicines (e.g., statin, niacin, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, and ezetimibe) were excluded. Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis at 1:1 ratio was performed to minimize baseline differences between patient groups of hyperlipidemia and non-hyperlipidemia. PSM analyses with the same strategies were further conducted for the parameters of hyperlipidemia in patients with increased triglyceride (TG), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Mixed-effect Cox model analysis was performed to investigate the associations of the 28-days all-cause deaths of COVID-19 patients with hyperlipidemia and the abnormalities of lipid parameters. The results were verified in male, female patients, and in patients with pre-existing CVDs and type 2 diabetes. Results Of 10 945 inpatients confirmed as COVID-19, there were 9822 inpatients included in the study, comprising 3513 (35.8%) cases without hyperlipidemia and 6309 (64.2%) cases with hyperlipidemia. Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after PSM at 1:1 ratio, hyperlipidemia was not associated with increased or decreased 28-day all-cause death [adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 1.17 (95% CI, 0.95-1.44), P =0.151]. We found that the parameters of hyperlipidemia were not associated with the risk of 28-day all-cause mortality [adjusted HR, 1.23 (95% CI, 0.98-1.55), P = 0.075 in TG increase group; 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.07), P = 0.123 in LDL-C increase group; and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.9-1.39), P = 0.299 in HDL-C decrease group, respectively]. Hyperlipidemia was also not significantly associated with the increased mortality of COVID-19 in patients accompanied with CVDs or type 2 diabetes, and in both male and female cohorts. Conclusion Our study support that the imbalanced lipid profile is not significantly associated with the 28-day all-cause mortality of COVID-19 patients, even in those accompanied with CVDs or diabetes. Similar results were also obtained in subgroup analyses of abnormal lipid parameters. Therefore, hyperlipidemia might be not a major causative factor for poor outcome of COVID-19, which provides guidance for the intervention of inpatients during the epidemic of COVID-19.","output":"Association Analysis of Hyperlipidemia with the 28-Day All-Cause Mortality of COVID-19 in Hospitalized Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a continuous increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Indonesia.

P. aeruginosa formed the most robust biofilm of conspicuous mushroom-like structure at 20C. However, when the temperature increased to 25C, the biofilm formation rapidly decreased. Above 25C, as the temperature rose, the biofilm formation increased again little by little despite its less structured form, indicating that 25C is the low point of biofilm formation. The intracellular c-di-GMP levels also decreased rapidly as the temperature rose from 20 to 25C. The expression of pelA, algD, and pslA encoding Pel, alginate, and Psl, respectively, were also dramatically affected by temperature, in which pelA was regulated in a pattern such as a change in intracellular c-di-GMP levels and the regulation of algD was the most similar to the actual biofilm formation pattern. Total exopolysaccharide production was thermoregulated and followed the regulation pattern of c-di-GMP. Interestingly, the thermoregulation patterns in biofilm formation were different depending on the strain of P. aeruginosa Unlike PAO1, another strain PA14 showed a gradual decrease in biofilm formation and c-di-GMP in the range of 20 - 37C and P. aeruginosa clinical isolates also showed slightly different patterns in biofilm formation with temperature change, suggesting that different strains may sense different temperature ranges for biofilm formation. However, it is obvious that P. aeruginosa forms more biofilms at lower temperatures and temperature is an important factor determining the biofilm formation.Importance Biofilm formation is an important protection mechanism used by most microorganisms and provides cells with many advantages like high infectivity, antibiotic resistance, and strong survivability. Since most persistent bacterial infections are believed to be associated with biofilms, the biofilm control is an important issue in medicine, environmental engineering, and industry. Biofilm formation is influenced by various environmental factors. Temperature is the most direct environmental cue encountered by microorganisms. Here we investigated the temperature effect on the biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa, a notorious pathogen, and found that temperature is an important factor determining the amount and structure of biofilm. Low temperature greatly increases the biofilm formation and gives it a highly conspicuous structure. Although the thermoregulation on biofilm formation is mainly mediated by c-di-GMP, some c-di-GMP-independent regulations were also observed. This study shows how biofilms are formed at various temperatures, and provides new insights to control biofilms using temperature.","output":"Thermoregulation of Biofilm Formation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Early in the pandemic it was suggested that pre-existing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could lead to increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19. NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription. Evidence from community studies, administrative data, and small studies of hospitalised patients suggest NSAIDs are not associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to characterise the safety of NSAIDs and identify whether pre-existing NSAID use was associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods: This prospective, multicentre cohort study included patients of any age admitted to hospital with a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilation, use of supplementary oxygen, and acute kidney injury. NSAID use was required to be within the 2 weeks before hospital admission. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of NSAIDs and adjust for confounding variables. We used propensity score matching to further estimate effects of NSAIDS while accounting for covariate differences in populations. Results: Between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020, we enrolled 78a??674 patients across 255 health-care facilities in England, Scotland, and Wales. 72a??179 patients had death outcomes available for matching; 40a??406 (562%) of 71a??915 were men, 31a??509 (438%) were women. In this cohort, 4211 (58%) patients were recorded as taking systemic NSAIDs before admission to hospital. Following propensity score matching, balanced groups of NSAIDs users and NSAIDs non-users were obtained (4205 patients in each group). At hospital admission, we observed no significant differences in severity between exposure groups. After adjusting for explanatory variables, NSAID use was not associated with worse in-hospital mortality (matched OR 095, 95% CI 084-107; p=035), critical care admission (101, 087-117; p=089), requirement for invasive ventilation (096, 080-117; p=069), requirement for non-invasive ventilation (112, 096-132; p=014), requirement for oxygen (100, 089-112; p=097), or occurrence of acute kidney injury (108, 092-126; p=033). Interpretation: NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. Policy makers should consider reviewing issued advice around NSAID prescribing and COVID-19 severity.

The application of strict lockdown measures disproportionately affected both cancer patient care as well as basic and translational cancer research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Italian Cancer Society (SIC) conducted a survey on the effect of lockdown on laboratories involved in cancer research in Italy. The survey was completed by 570 researchers at different stages of their career, working in cancer centers, research institutes and universities from 19 Italian regions. RESULTS: During the lockdown period, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic emergency on face-to-face research activities was high, with a complete (47.7%) or partial (36.1%) shutdown of the laboratories. In the post-lockdown period, research activities were resumed in most of the respondents institutions (80.4%), though with some restrictions (77.2%). COVID-19 testing was offered to research personnel only in ~50% of research institutions. Overall, the response to the pandemic was fragmented as in many cases institutions adopted different strategies often aimed at limiting possible infections without a clearly defined contingency plan. Nevertheless, research was able to provide the first answers and possible ways out of the pandemic, also with the contribution of many cancer researchers that sacrificed their research programs to help overcome the pandemic by offering their knowledge and technologies.

In this cross-sectional study, 48 patients with COVID-19 whose disease was confirmed by swap testing were evaluated. The demographic information of the individuals, the symptoms of the disease, and the ward in which they were admitted were recorded. Blood samples were taken from patients to test for interleukin-6 levels by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA, Roche Diagnostics). Due to the lack of specific treatment protocols for patients and the use of supportive treatments based on meeting the nutritional needs for all patients, blood albumin levels and nutritional status of patients were also evaluated using Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) Form. Their calorie intake was assessed by calculating the number of calories received based on the type of nutrition and compared to the required amount calculated through the Harris-Benedict equation. 48 laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infected patients were included in the study with the mean age of 46.4  8.3 years. 21 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). There was no significant difference between the ICU admitted and patients admitted inward in terms of demographic characteristics, and history of previous diseases (p &gt; 0.05). The average interleukin 6 (IL-6) in patients was 72.334.4 pg/ml. ICU admitted patients had higher IL6 levels (p=0.001). The mean interleukin 6 level was 89.0434.1 pg/ml in patients admitted for less than 7 days and it was significantly higher (119.228.3) in patients hospitalized for more than 7 days (p=0.001). there was no significant difference in terms of nutritional status and albumin level between ICU admitted and ward admitted patients (p &gt;0.05).

Elderly people with comorbidities are at a higher risk and the different levels of government in Germany reacted jointly to the challenge with social distancing and a lockdown. Little empirical evidence exists about the psychosocial situation of elderly people during this time. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze a) knowledge about, and feelings related to the Corona-pandemic. Describe b) loneliness, depression and anxiety, and, c) the perceived, immediate impact of the lockdown on frequency of social contacts and quality of health care provision of people with cognitive impairment during social distancing and lockdown in the primary care system and daily living at home in Germany. Methods: This analysis is based on data from standardized telephone interviews in a convenience sample of n=141 people with known cognitive impairment in the primary care setting. Participants were recruited from currently running interventional trials. Therefore, data on e.g. cognitive and psychological status prior to the pandemic was available. Attitudes, knowledge about and perceived personal impact of the pandemic, social support, loneliness, anxiety, depression, frequency of social activities due to the pandemic and perceived impact of the pandemic on health care services were assessed during the time of lockdown. Results: The vast majority of participants consider themselves sufficiently informed about Corona (85%) and most think that the measures taken are appropriate (64%). A total of 11% shows one main symptom of a depression according to DSM-V. The frequency of depressive symptoms has not increased between the time before pandemic and lockdown in almost all participants. The sample shows minimal (65.0%) or low levels of anxiety (25%). The prevalence of loneliness is 10%. On average seven activities have decreased in frequency due to the pandemic. Social activities related to meeting people, dancing or birthday visits have decreased significantly. Talking with friends by phone and activities like gardening have increased. Utilization of health care services like day clinics, relief services and prescribed therapies are reported to have worsened due to the pandemic. Also visits to general practitioners decreased. Discussion: The study shows a limited impact of the pandemic on psychological variables including depression, anxiety and loneliness in the short-term. People are well informed but not especially concerned about themselves or others. There is a decrease in social activities as expected, in line with the restrictions imposed. The impact on health care provision is prominent. There is a need for longitudinal studies to assess longer-term effects of the pandemic and social distancing on elderly people with cognitive impairment living at home and their caregivers. There is also a need for qualitative, in-depth studies to further interpret the results. In general, elderly people in the setting under examination and with the limitations of this specific study seem to compensate restrictions during the time of lockdown in Germany rather well.","output":"The situation of elderly with cognitive impairment living at home during lockdown in the Corona-pandemic in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The predominant cause of candidiasis was Candida albicans which has recently changed to non-Candida albicans Candida (NCAC) (i.e., Candida spp. other than the C. albicans). The NCAC spp., earlier considered non-pathogenic or minimally virulent, are now considered a primary cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. Given the NCAC spp.has become more common in clinical cases, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of NCAC spp. in different clinical specimens and assess a few of their virulence factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Routine samples for bacterial culture and sensitivity that showed colony characteristics, like Candida on Blood Agar and microscopic features resembling Candida spp., were processed further. Candida isolates underwent tests for chlamydospore formation and biochemical tests, including sugar fermentation and sugar assimilation tests. These were grown at 42oC, and their colony color was identified using HiCrome(TM) Candida Differential Agar (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India), HiCandida(TM) Identification Kit (HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India), and VITEK-2? Compact (Biomrieux, France). Virulence factors, such as adherence to buccal epithelial cells (ABEC), biofilm formation, hemolytic activity, and production of coagulase enzyme were also tested. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 38.46 years with a male-female ratio of 1.36:1. In total, 137 Candida isolates were recovered; 45.3%, 19.7%, and 13.9% of the isolates were isolated from urine, vaginal swabs, and oropharyngeal swabs, respectively. Moreover, 55 (40.1%) isolates were those of C. albicans and 82 (59.9%) isolates belonged to NCAC spp., with C. tropicalis (23.4%) contributing highest among NCAC species. Furthermore, C. albicans (3; 50%) was the most common spp. in cases of candidemia. Haemolysin production (85.5%) and ABEC (78.2%) were the major virulence factors in C. albicans. C. tropicalis (59.4%) and C. dubliniensis (50%) showed maximum ABEC. Biofilm forming capacity was higher in C. tropicalis (78.1%) than C. albicans (67%). CONCLUSION: Results of this study suggest varied prevalence and virulence based on geographical locations, even within a subcontinent. It clearly indicates the emergence of the NCAC spp. and their predominance in different body fluids.

Nowadays, these dairy products are also important for people with an allergy to cow milk, and these products are an essential part of the local daily diet in regions of the world that are not suitable for cows and goats. Consumption of raw milk and raw milk products has a zoonotic risk, and with regard to sheep, the main pathogens associated with such dairy products are: Brucella melitensis, Campylobacter spp., Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, tick borne encephalitis virus, and Toxoplasma gondii. Especially, young children, elderly people, pregnant women and immunocompromised (YOPI) persons, and those suffering from disease should be aware of the risk of consuming raw milk and raw milk products. This latter risk can be reduced by proper flock health management, prevention of contamination during milking, adequate milk processing, transport, and refrigerated storage. Only processes equaling pasteurization sufficiently reduce zoonotic risks from milk and milk products, but proper cooling is essential and recontamination must be prevented. Therefore, strict hygiene practices throughout the production process and supply chain especially for raw milk and raw dairy products, should be applied. Small scale production systems pose a greater risk compared to industrialized production systems because of a less protocolized and controlled production process. This manuscript describes zoonotic risks of pathogens from sheep and their milk borne transmission. Additionally, routes of contamination, possibilities for multiplication, and prevention measures thereof are described.

Initial data suggest that smoking is a risk factor for COVID-19 symptom severity. Exposure to increased pandemic-related stress and subsequent worry about COVID-19 may amplify the desire to smoke to down-regulate distress. The present investigation sought to test this conceptual model by evaluating worry about COVID-19 in relation to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking, perceived barriers for smoking cessation, and smoking abstinence expectancies. Participants were 219 daily combustible cigarette smokers (55.70% female, Mage = 41.43 years, SD = 11.06). Six separate, two-step hierarchical linear regression models were conducted for each of the criterion variables. As expected, worry about COVID-19 was significantly and positively related to COVID-19 coping motives for smoking and perceived barriers for smoking cessation. Worry about COVID-19 also was a positively significant predictor of smoking abstinence expectancies of negative mood, somatic symptoms, and harmful consequences, but not positive consequences. The present study provides novel empirical evidence that worry about COVID-19 is related to key cognitive-affective smoking processes beyond the effects of age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 exposure, smoking rate, e-cigarette use status, and anxiety symptoms.

The sample consisted of 60 LTC direct care employees, all employed at the same organization, who completed an on-line survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of demographic questions and the Fraboni Scale of Ageism. Twenty-one of these employees participated in a 30-45 minute phone interview. Cultural artifacts were also collected.

Although quantitative results showed no statistical significance, qualitative results suggest that employees do exhibit some ageist attitudes towards the residents for whom they care. Despite evidence that most employees felt a deep connection with residents, they detached themselves from the aging process. The theoretical framework lends hand in explaining how both ableism and ageism appeared to contribute to this detachment. Findings indicated employees interactions and attitudes towards residents were influenced by themes compassionate ageism, ableism, and identity, which resulted in meta theme caregiver validation and reward. Employees received validation and altruistic reward from positive interactions with what they perceived to be ideal residents; those who fit the stereotype of a nursing home resident, such as older, pleasant, and dependent.

Methods: The approach is based on complexity of neuromotor coordination across speech subsystems involved in respiration, phonation and articulation, motivated by the distinct nature of COVID-19 involving lower (i.e., bronchial, diaphragm, lower tracheal) versus upper (i.e., laryngeal, pharyngeal, oral and nasal) respiratory tract inflammation, as well as by the growing evidence of the virus neurological manifestations. Preliminary results: An exploratory study with audio interviews of five subjects provides Cohen's d effect sizes between pre-COVID-19 (pre-exposure) and post-COVID-19 (after positive diagnosis but presumed asymptomatic) using: coordination of respiration (as measured through acoustic waveform amplitude) and laryngeal motion (fundamental frequency and cepstral peak prominence), and coordination of laryngeal and articulatory (formant center frequencies) motion. Conclusions: While there is a strong subject-dependence, the group-level morphology of effect sizes indicates a reduced complexity of subsystem coordination.

HA binds to a virus receptor, a sialoglycoprotein or sialoglycolipid, on the host cell and mediates virus attachment to the cell surface. The hydrolytic enzyme NA cleaves sialic acid from viral receptors and accelerates the release of progeny virus from host cells. In this study, we identified a novel function of HA and NA as machinery for viral motility. HAs exchanged binding partner receptors iteratively, generating virus movement on a receptor-coated glass surface instead of a cell surface. The virus movement was also dependent on NA. Virus movement mediated by HA and NA resulted in a three to four-fold increase in virus internalisation by cultured cells.

The results revealed that 70.92% of respondents perceived a low risk of infection because of COVID-19 with M = 1.77 and SD = 0.583, but authors found the perceived severity score high (M = 3.95, SD = 1.21) among the 60.97% of respondents. Around 95% of respondents were aware of the COVID-19, while almost all respondents knew the medium of infection and symptoms of COVID-19. The behavior of respondents towards COVID-19 infection was positive and was following sufficient precautionary measures suggested by WHO to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection. The results of multiple regression analysis revealed that the demographic features of respondents like age, education were significantly contributing to the KAP of the fisher community. The results confirmed the importance of KAP which is reflected in the behavioral responses of the fishers while tackling the COVID-19 pandemic situation.

The widespread use of payment holidays during the COVID-19 crisis provides a significant case study on the importance of having borrower hardship provisions as a consumer protection tool. This paper compares the pre-pandemic availability of payment holidays in three AsiaCPacific jurisdictions: Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. It evaluates their existing legislative frameworks, as well as regulatory and industry guidelines on borrower hardship, and contrasts this with their use of payment holidays during the pandemic. Where there were existing industry guidelines on borrower hardship, lenders were able to spearhead an industry-wide approach towards payment relief without regulatory intervention by governments. Beyond the pandemic, the paper argues that self-regulation has potential for protecting borrower interests by standardising the scope of, and the procedure for, obtaining hardship relief. It argues that there is a need for a greater prevalence of industry codes of conducts governing lenders approach towards borrower hardship across the AsiaCPacific.","output":"Regulating Borrower Hardship in Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong: Payment Holidays During COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in spine surgeons in Latin America. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to Latin American spine surgeons from April 4 to 6, 2020. Surgeon characteristics were recorded. The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined. All variables were compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons. The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12). Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156). Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111). The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario). Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis). Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores.

A unique finding among COVID-19 patients was a decline of eosinophil levels (eosinopenia). However, results from previous studies on the relationship between eosinopenia and disease severity were inconsistent. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between eosinopenia and COVID-19 mortality as well as the clinical conditions that could potentially lead to mortality. Methods: One hundred ninety patients diagnosed as moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 at hospital admission were enrolled. Data collected from patients' medical records on the second day after hospital admission included medical histories, clinical symptoms, chest images of computed tomography (CT), laboratory examinations, and outcomes. Results: Eosinophil levels were significantly lower in patients with critical disease, when compared to those with moderate and severe diseases. After controlled for confounding factors, i.e., age, gender, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, a progressive decline of eosinophil levels was independently associated with mortality. Moreover, eosinophil levels significantly and positively correlated with platelet and D-dimer levels but significantly and inversely correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase.

The characteristics of common infectious diseases of tourists may provide some clues to identify the high-risk travelers and protect susceptible population. Methods: From among 48,444 travelers screened at Shanghai Port, we analyzed 577 travelers with 590 infectious diseases for age, sex, disease type, and World Health Organization (WHO) regions. We used the Joinpoint Regression Program to identify the average percent changes (APC) in the various trends among these individuals. Results: Hepatitis B, syphilis, and HIV were the most common infectious diseases in travelers entering China, and Hepatitis B, pulmonary tuberculosis, and syphilis in Chinese nationals traveling abroad (overall detection rates, 1.43 and 0.74%, respectively; P < 0.05). Africa (2.96%), the Americas (1.68%), and the Western Pacific (1.62%) exhibited the highest detection rates. This trend did not decrease since the COVID-19 pandemic (P > 0.05) and rather showed an upward trend with increasing age [APC 95% CI = 5.46 (3.41,7.56)%, P < 0.05]. However, there were no evident trends in monthly infection rates of travelers exiting and entering China from different WHO regions (all P > 0.05). Conclusion: Travelers always carry a transmission risk of common infectious diseases. It may be reasonable to adjust strategies for airport screening and quarantine according to the age and departure area of travelers to prevent and control new infectious diseases.","output":"Epidemiological Characteristics of Infectious Diseases Among Travelers Between China and Foreign Countries Before and During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 has weakened the economy of Australia and its capital market since early 2020.

The potential changes in their physical activity, along with their overall physical and psychological well-being, may have ultimately influenced their life satisfaction. These changes included the potential for increased sedentary behaviors. Despite the high health risks associated with these factors during the pandemic, the role of physical activity in early care and education teachers well-being and life satisfaction remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the associations of physical activity and sedentary behaviors with teacher well-being and life satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic. In doing so, we explored two competing models of the relationship between the teachers physical activity, well-being, and life satisfaction, one with physical activity as a mediator and the other with teachers well-being as a mediator. An online survey, that collected information on physical, psychological, and professional well-being, job demands, and life satisfaction, was completed by 1434 US ECE teachers in 46 states. To test our hypothesized models, we conducted confirmatory factor analyses, followed by structural equation modeling. Of the respondents, 77% were overweight or obese and only 39% met the recommended 150 min of moderate physical activity per week. They had a mean life satisfaction score that qualifies as slight satisfaction, they experience moderate stress, and, collectively, are approaching the threshold for depression yet still reflect moderate-to-high work commitment. The empirical test of our competing mediation models found the model where teacher well-being mediated the association between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and life satisfaction was the superior model. The relationships between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and overall well-being suggest that these modifiable risk factors can be addressed such that early care and education teachers can improve their overall physical and psychological well-being, along with their life satisfaction.","output":"Physical Activity, Physical Well-Being, and Psychological Well-Being: Associations with Life Satisfaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Early Childhood Educators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we identify economic transmission channels through which changes in funding liquidity conditions in interbank markets asymmetrically affect volatilities of stock portfolios during the COVID-19 crisis For the purpose of this study, the quantile regression approach is utilized Controlling for macroeconomic factors, we document that volatilities of high-risk portfolios increase more in response to a deterioration in funding liquidity conditions compared to less risky portfolios More importantly, this increase intensifies in high-volatility periods of high-risk portfolios, which implies the impact is stronger during uncertain economic environments, such as the one caused by the COVID-19 outbreak","output":"The Asymmetric Impact of Funding Liquidity Risk on the Volatility of Stock Portfolios during the COVID-19 Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, pressures on almost all health sectors in many countries increased, and physiotherapy interventions were canceled for various reasons.

We evaluated additional risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization and in-hospital mortality in a nationwide US database. METHODS: This retrospective study utilized the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database (January 1, 2019CJuly 15, 2020) containing de-identified nationwide administrative claims, SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test results, and COVID-19 inpatient admissions data. Logistic regression was used to understand risk factors for hospitalization and in-hospital mortality among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in the overall population. Robustness of associations was further confirmed by subgroup and sensitivity analyses in the T2D population. RESULTS: A total of 36,364 people were identified who were either SARS-CoV-2(+) or hospitalized for COVID-19. T2D was associated with increased COVID-19-related hospitalization and mortality. Factors associated with increased hospitalization risk were largely consistent in the overall population and the T2D subgroup, including age, male sex, and these top five comorbidities: dementia, metastatic tumor, congestive heart failure, paraplegia, and metabolic disease. Biguanides (mainly metformin) were consistently associated with lower odds of hospitalization, whereas sulfonylureas and insulins were associated with greater odds of hospitalization among people with T2D. CONCLUSION: In this nationwide US analysis, T2D was identified as an independent risk factor for COVID-19 complications. Many factors conferred similar risk of hospitalization across both populations; however, particular diabetes medications may be markers for differential risk. The insights on comorbidities and medications may inform population health initiatives, including prevention efforts for high-risk patient populations such as those with T2D.

The objective is to estimate the economic viability for residential customers when participating in a renewable energy community (REC), focused on PV electricity sharing. The developed simulation model considers the omission of certain electricity levies as well as the obligatory proximity constraint being linked to grid levels, thus introducing a stepwise reduction of per-unit grid charges as an incentive to keep the inner-community electricity transfer as local as possible. Results show that cost savings in residential RECs cover a broad range from 9 EUR/yr to 172 EUR/yr. The lowest savings are gained by customers without in-house PV systems, while owners of a private PV system make the most profits due to the possibility of selling as well as buying electricity within the borders of the REC. Generally, cost savings increase when the source is closer to the sink, as well as when more renewable electricity is available for inner-community electricity transfer. The presence of a commercial customer impacts savings for households insignificantly, but increases local self-consumption approximately by 10%. Despite the margin for residential participants to break even being narrow, energy community operators will have to raise a certain participation fee. Such participation fee would need to be as low as 2.5 EUR/month for customers without in-house PV systems in a purely residential REC, while other customers could still achieve a break-even when paying 5 EUR/month to 6.7 EUR/month in addition. Those results should alert policy makers to find additional support mechanisms to enhance customers motivations to participate if RECs are meant as a concept that should be adopted on a large scale.","output":"Economic Viability of Renewable Energy Communities under the Framework of the Renewable Energy Directive Transposed to Austrian Law"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Among various cells of tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) macrophages have been shown to play a pivotal role in the prognosis of many malignancies including laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) is associated with LSCC and can impact its prognosis. Local factors, particularly pH, can affect cancer growth by altering TIME and tumor associated macrophages phenotype. However, it is still unknown whether and how LPR affects TIME and macrophages polarization in LSCC. In this study we compared macrophage polarization in LSCC of patients with and without coexisting LPR. Methods: A total of 63 patients with T1-2 LSCC without (the 1st group, 30 patients) and with coexisting LPR (the 2nd group, 33 patients) were enrolled in the study. Only HPV-negative cases of males were included in the study. Immunohistochemistry was performed to visualize CD68 and CD163 macrophages. The number of macrophages was counted at the central tumor clusters (TC), peritumor stroma (TS) and at the intact laryngeal mucosa (IM) taken from the tumor-negative edge. Results: Samples of the 2nd group patients with LSCC and LPR demonstrated significantly (P<0.05) higher inflammatory infiltration of all the evaluated compartments (TC, TS and IM). CD68+ cells count was comparable in TC and IM of the 1st and the 2nd group patients. In contrast, CD163+ cells were more numerous in the 2nd group patients in TC, TS and IM (P<0.001). Moreover, the number of M2 macrophages was significantly higher than M1 macrophages in patients with coexisting LPR. As a result, CD163/CD68 ratio was significantly (P<0.001) higher in LSCC with coexisting LPR. Conclusion: LPR is associated with altered macrophages polarization and increase of M2-type macrophages in LSCC.

Apart from fever and respiratory complications, acute kidney injury has been observed in a few patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Furthermore, according to recent findings, the virus has been detected in urine. Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been proposed to serve as the receptor for the entry of 2019-nCoV, which is the same as that for the severe acute respiratory syndrome. This study aimed to investigate the possible cause of kidney damage and the potential route of 2019-nCoV infection in the urinary system. METHODS We used both published kidney and bladder cell atlas data and new independent kidney single-cell RNA sequencing data generated in-house to evaluate ACE2 gene expression in all cell types in healthy kidneys and bladders. The Pearson correlation coefficients between ACE2 and all other genes were first generated. Then, genes with r values larger than 0.1 and P values smaller than 0.01 were deemed significant co-expression genes with ACE2. RESULTS Our results showed the enriched expression of ACE2 in all subtypes of proximal tubule (PT) cells of the kidney. ACE2 expression was found in 5.12%, 5.80%, and 14.38% of the proximal convoluted tubule cells, PT cells, and proximal straight tubule cells, respectively, in three published kidney cell atlas datasets. In addition, ACE2 expression was also confirmed in 12.05%, 6.80%, and 10.20% of cells of the proximal convoluted tubule, PT, and proximal straight tubule, respectively, in our own two healthy kidney samples. For the analysis of public data from three bladder samples, ACE2 expression was low but detectable in bladder epithelial cells.

A total of 984 patients treated at 55 sites were analyzed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationship between outcome and procedural technique. Results- Of 147 (14.9%) patients with tandem lesions treated, stenting of the extracranial lesion during thrombectomy was performed in 80 patients and withheld in 67 patients. There were no differences between groups with respect to age, ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score), or intravenous-tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) use.

Conclusions- Acute stenting of an extracranial carotid stenosis during neurothrombectomy can be achieved with equal safety compared with no stenting. Carotid stenting in the acute phase may lead to better outcomes; this should ideally be confirmed by randomized trials.","output":"Emergent Management of Tandem Lesions in Acute Ischemic Stroke."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health crisis brought about by Covid-19 has generated a heightened need for information as a response to a situation of uncertainty and high emotional load, in which fake news and other informative content have grown dramatically. The aim of this work is to delve into the understanding of fake news from the perspective of information behaviour by analysing a sample of fake news items that were spread in Spain during the Covid-19 health crisis. A sample of 242 fake news items was collected from the Maldita.es website and analysed according to the criteria of cognitive and affective authority, interactivity, themes and potential danger. The results point to a practical absence of indicators of cognitive authority (53.7%), while the affective authority of these news items is built through mechanisms of discrediting people, ideas or movements (40.7%) and, secondarily, the use of offensive or coarse language (17.7%) and comparison or reference to additional information sources (26.6%). Interactivity features allow commenting in 24.3% of the cases. The dominant theme is society (43.1%), followed by politics (26.4%) and science (23.6%). Finally, fake news, for the most part, does not seem to pose any danger to the health or safety of people C the harm it causes is intangible and moral.

Observers in multiple jurisdictions have already noted the proliferation of delegated legislation during the pandemic and the shortcomings in legislative oversight of the same. To date, however, no close analysis has been conducted of the way in which legislative oversight mechanisms have broken down during the pandemic. This paper provides such an analysis, using examples from Westminster systems adopting the 'legislative model' of providing extraordinary powers. Looking at individual examples from Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the analysis seeks to identify and explain the failures, and relative successes, in different mechanisms for parliamentary oversight, including parliamentary scrutiny committees (pre-existing and ad-hoc), disallowance, and sunset clauses. Although primarily descriptive, the comparative approach analysis permits preliminary conclusions to be drawn as to the way each jurisdiction may improve its methods of parliamentary oversight of delegated legislation. These comparative lessons will be of use both during and beyond the pandemic.","output":"Pandemic Parliamentary Oversight of Delegated Legislation: Comparing the Performance of Westminster Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing public health crisis that has sickened or precipitated death in millions. The etiologic agent of COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), infects the intestinal epithelium, and can induce GI symptoms similar to the human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). An international surveillance epidemiology study (SECURE-IBD) reported that the standardized mortality ratio trends higher in IBD patients (1.5C1.8) and that mesalamine/sulfasalazine therapy correlates with poor outcome. The goal of our study was to experimentally address the relationship between mesalamine and SARS-CoV-2 entry, replication, and/or pathogenesis. METHODS: Viral infection was performed with a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and EGFP (VSV-SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV-2 virus derived from an infectious cDNA clone of 2019n-CoV/USA_WA1/2020. Primary human ileal spheroids derived from healthy donors were grown as 3D spheroids or on 2D transwells. We assessed the effect of 10 mM mesalamine (Millipore Sigma) on viral RNA levels, as well as the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin II-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2), TMPRSS4, Cathepsin B (CTSB) and CTSL by qRT-PCR. 8C12 week old K18-ACE2 were treated orally with PBS or mesalamine at 200 mg/kg daily. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 110(3) FFU of SARS-CoV-2. Mice were weighed daily and viral titers were determined 7 days post infection (dpi) by qRT-PCR. For the intestinal viral entry model, VSV-SARS-CoV-2 was injected into a ligated intestinal loop of anesthetized K18-ACE2 mice and tissues were harvested 6 hours post-infection. RESULTS: We found no change in viral RNA levels in human intestinal epithelial cells in response to mesalamine. Expression of ACE2 was reduced following mesalamine treatment in enteroids, while CTSL expression was increased. Mice receiving mesalamine lost weight at similar rates compared to mice receiving vehicle control. Mesalamine treatment did not change viral load in the lung, heart, or intestinal tissues harvested at 7 dpi. Pretreatment with mesalamine did not modulate intestinal entry of the chimeric VSV-SARS-CoV-2 in K18-ACE2 mice. CONCLUSIONS: Mesalamine did not alter viral entry, replication, or pathogenesis in vitro or in mouse models. Mesalamine treatment reduced expression of the viral receptor ACE2 while concurrently increasing CTSL expression in human ileum organoids.","output":"Mesalamine Reduces Intestinal ACE2 Expression Without Modifying SARS-CoV-2 Infection or Disease Severity in Mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing, the therapeutic gaps in conventional management have highlighted the need for the integration of traditional knowledge systems with modern medicine Ayurvedic medicines, especially Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera (L ) Dunal, WS), may be beneficial in the management of COVID-19 WS is a widely prescribed Ayurvedic botanical known as an immunomodulatory, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and adaptogenic agent The chemical profile and pharmacological activities of WS have been extensively reported Several clinical studies have reported its safety for use in humans This review presents a research synthesis of in silico, in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies on Withania somnifera (L ) Dunal (WS) and discusses its potential for prophylaxis and management of COVID-19 We have collated the data from studies on WS that focused on viral infections (HIV, HSV, H1N1 influenza, etc ) and noncommunicable diseases (hypertension, diabetes, cancer, etc ) The experimental literature indicates that WS has the potential for 1) maintaining immune homeostasis, 2) regulating inflammation, 3) suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines, 4) organ protection (nervous system, heart, lung, liver, and kidney), and 5) anti-stress, antihypertensive, and antidiabetic activities Using these trends, the review presents a triangulation of Ayurveda wisdom, pharmacological properties, and COVID-19 pathophysiology ranging from viral entry to end-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) The review proposes WS as a potential therapeutic adjuvant for various stages of COVID-19 management WS may also have beneficial effects on comorbidities associated with the COVID-19 However, systematic studies are needed to realize the potential of WS for improving clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19","output":"Withania somnifera (L.)

Her medical history included dilated cardiomyopathy and in 2017 she underwent CRT-D implantation for primary prevention; over the past 3 years, she did not experience any ICD intervention. Her home therapy included amiodarone, bisoprolol, warfarin, and trazodone. Baseline ECG obtained 6 month before admission is shown in Figure 1, Panel A. On admission, her ECG showed sinus bradycardia with biventricular pacing and significant QT prolongation (i.e. 640 ms, Figure 1 B). On day 2 of hospitalization, she reported multiple brief episodes of transient loss of consciousness. An interrogation of her device revealed 27 torsade-de-pointes episodes in a 48-hour period, treated with 11 shocks. All episodes were preceded by a variable period of bigeminal rhythm due to one or two premature ventricular beats coupled to the prolonged QT segment of the preceding basic beat in a short-long-short sequence (Figure 2).

Here we investigated the association between a prehospital Hypoxemia Index (HI) and the need for intubation among COVID-19 patients in the prehospital setting. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed COVID-19 patients initially cared for by a Paris Fire Brigade advanced life support (ALS) team in the prehospital setting between 8th March and 18th April of 2020. We assessed the association between HI and prehospital intubation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression model analysis after propensity score matching. Results are expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: We analyzed 300 consecutive COVID-19 patients (166 males (55%); mean age, 64  18 years). Among these patients, 45 (15%) were deceased on the scene, 34 (11%) had an active care restriction, and 18 (6%) were intubated in the prehospital setting. The mean HI value was 3.4  1.9. HI was significantly associated with prehospital intubation (OR, 0.24; 95% CI: 0.12C0.41, p < 10(?3)) with a corresponding area under curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85C0.98). HI significantly differed between patients with and without prehospital intubation (1.0  1.0 vs. 3.6  1.8, respectively; p < 10(?3)). ROC curve analysis defined the optimal HI threshold as 1.3. Bivariate analysis revealed that HI <1.3 was significantly, positively associated with prehospital intubation (OR, 38.38; 95% CI: 11.57C146.54; p < 10(?3)). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that prehospital intubation was significantly associated with HI (adjusted odds ratio (ORa), 0.20; 95% CI: 0.06C0.45; p < 10(?3)) and HI <3 (ORa, 51.08; 95% CI: 7.83C645.06; p < 10(?3)). After adjustment for confounders, the ORa between HI <1.3 and prehospital intubation was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.95C5.08; p < 10(?3)). Conclusion: An HI of <1.3 was associated with a 3-fold increase in prehospital intubation among COVID-19 patients. HI may be a useful tool to facilitate decision-making regarding prehospital intubation of COVID-19 patients initially cared for by a Paris Fire Brigade ALS team.

This is due to the high costs associated with patient-facing functionality, and risks of potentially adverse impacts on health care staff work practices and patient interactions. In contrast, back-end laboratory-based robots dealing with sample extraction and amplification, that effectively integrate with established processes, software, and interfaces to process samples, are much more likely to result in safety and efficiency gains.

The private sector employees may be the worst hit. This is because of the lockdown across many countries, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), leading to income irregularities. Studies exploring private-sector employees concerning housing finance for the houses purchased and how the lockdown has affected their sources of income for repayment plans are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the possible early negative impacts of Covid-19 on private sector employees' housing finance homeownership in KSA. Design/methodology/approach A phenomenology type of qualitative research was used. Data were sourced from three cities (Riyadh, Al-Qassim and Medina) and three mortgage banks across KSA. Virtual interviews via Zoom and WhatsApp video calls were conducted with engaged participants (bankers, government agencies and private sector employees). Thematic analysis was adopted, and the analysed data was presented in themes. Findings Findings show that the partial and full lockdown resulted in income irregularities in many private businesses. Also, findings identified downsizing, leading to large-scale unemployment, half-monthly income for employees, loss of profit, human resources wastage, etc. Findings reveal that because of the economic shock, many homeowners have not been able to meet up with their monthly mortgage repayment obligation. Also, the absence of financial support in form of socioeconomic needs has not helped the matter. Research limitations/implications The paper is limited to the early negative impacts of Covid-19 on private sector employees' housing finance homeownership in KSA and data collected via Zoom and WhatsApp video calls across the three main cities. The recommendations that will emerge from this study may be adopted by other Gulf and Islamic countries with similar homeownership repayment challenges. Practical implications This study would stir key stakeholders, especially the policymakers and mortgage institutions to consider future policy principles that focus on who is at the highest risk for housing-related hardships because of the Covid-19 or future pandemic. The outcome can be used to develop an equitable housing policy framework to foster long-term economic mobility and be validated in the future by scholars.

Following the near-absence of historical examples of the long-time evolution of infectious diseases under similar circumstances, models are crucial to exemplify possible scenarios. Accordingly, in the present work we systematically generalize the popular susceptible-infectedrecovered model to account for mutations leading to repeatedly occurring new strains, which we coarse grain based on tools from statistical mechanics to derive a model predicting the most likely outcomes. The model predicts that mutations can induce a super-exponential growth of infection numbers at early times, which can self-amplify to giant infection waves which are caused by a positive feedback loop between infection numbers and mutations and lead to a simultaneous infection of the majority of the population. At later stages - if vaccination progresses too slowly - mutations can interrupt an ongoing decrease of infection numbers and can cause infection revivals which can occur as single waves or even as whole wave trains featuring alternative periods of decreasing and increasing infection numbers.

SUMMARY: The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is far from being completely understood, and the lack of effective treatments leads to a sense of urgency to develop new therapeutic strategies based on pathophysiological assumptions. The exaggerated cytokine release in response to viral infection, a condition known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or cytokine storm, is emerging as the mechanism leading to ARDS and MOF in COVID-19, thus endorsing the hypothesis that properly timed anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies could improve patients' clinical outcomes and prognosis.

This was also confirmed by longitudinal analyses in Germany (burden assessed three months after SMU and stress symptoms). LIMITATIONS: The mostly female and relatively young sample composition limits the generalizability of present findings. Only two European countries were investigated. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings reveal a potential negative impact of enhanced SMU on individual mental health state and behavior. Additionally, they emphasize the significance of a conscious and cautious use of SM as information source specifically during the pandemic.","output":"The relationship between social media use, stress symptoms and burden caused by coronavirus (Covid-19) in Germany and Italy: A cross-sectional and longitudinal investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: In the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults from vulnerable ethnoracial groups are at high risk of infection, hospitalization, and death We aimed to explore the pandemic's impact on the well-being and cognition of older adults living in the United States (US), Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru Methods: 1,608 (646 White, 852 Latino, 77 Black, 33 Asian;72% female) individuals from the US and four Latin American countries aged &gt;= 55 years completed an online survey regarding well-being and cognition during the pandemic between May and September 2020 Outcome variables (pandemic impact, discrimination, loneliness, purpose of life, subjective cognitive concerns) were compared across four US ethnoracial groups and older adults living in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru Findings: Mean age for all participants was 66 7 (SD = 7 7) years and mean education was 15 4 (SD = 2 7) years Compared to Whites, Latinos living in the US reported greater economic impact (p p 2 = 0 031);while Blacks reported experiencing discrimination more often (p p 2 = 0 050) Blacks and Latinos reported more positive coping (p p 2 = 0 040) Compared to Latinos living in the US, Latinos in Chile, Mexico, and Peru reported greater pandemic impact, Latinos in Mexico and Peru reported more positive coping, Latinos in Argentina, Mexico, and Peru had greater economic impact, and Latinos in Argentina, Chile, and Peru reported less discrimination Interpretation: The COVID-19 pandemic has differentially impacted the well-being of older ethnically diverse individuals in the US and Latin America Future studies should examine how mediators like income and coping skills modify the pandemic's impact Funding: Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Psychiatry","output":"The impact of COVID-19 on the well-being and cognition of older adults living in the United States and Latin America"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the observed SARS-Cov-2 infection rate in healthcare workers (HCWs) according to the ward dedicated or not to care of COVID-19 patients.

Although the presence of the virus has been detected in the myocardium of infected patients, and infection of induced pluripotent cells-derived cardiomyocytes has been demonstrated, the reported expression of ACE2 in cardiac stromal cells suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may determine cardiac injury by sustaining productive infection and increasing inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed expression of ACE2 receptor in primary human cardiac stromal cells derived from cardiospheres, using proteomics and transcriptomics before exposing them to SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Using conventional and high sensitivity PCR methods, we measured virus release in the cellular supernatants and monitored the intracellular viral bioprocessing. We performed high-resolution imaging to show the sites of intracellular viral production and demonstrated the presence of viral particles in the cells with electron microscopy. We finally used RT-qPCR assays to detect genes linked to innate immunity and fibrotic pathways coherently regulated in cells after exposure to the virus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that cardiac stromal cells are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and produce variable viral yields depending on the extent of cellular ACE2 receptor expression. Interestingly, these cells also evolved toward hyper-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic phenotypes independently of ACE2 levels. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection of myocardial stromal cells could be involved in cardiac injury, and explain the high number of complications observed in severe cases of COVID-19. TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: In the present investigation, we provide evidence that human cardiac stromal cells, a major component of the non-contractile cellular fraction in the heart can be infected by SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, in direct relationship to the extent of ACE2 receptor expression. Our work also suggests that these cells, when exposed to the virus, can evolve toward inflammatory and fibrotic phenotypes independently of ACE2. In addition to describing a novel cellular target of SARS-CoV-2 in the human heart, our study generates new hypothesis on potential mechanisms underlying cardiac complications observed in COVID-19 patients.","output":"Human cardiosphere-derived stromal cells exposed to SARS-CoV-2 evolve into hyper-inflammatory/pro-fibrotic phenotype and produce infective viral particles depending on the levels of ACE2 receptor expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, rapidly turned into a pandemic, and is causing a relevant number of critical to severe life-threatening COVID-19 patients.

Doses of <1 TCID(50) of influenza virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus were reported to infect 50% of the tested population. Similarly, low doses of the enteric viruses, norovirus, rotavirus, echovirus, poliovirus, and hepatitis A virus, caused infection in at least some of the volunteers tested. A number of factors may influence viruses infectivity in experimentally infected human volunteers. These include host and pathogen factors as well as the experimental methodology.

COVID-19 patients are among those indicative for heparin treatment. Increased heparin administration among COVID-19 patients increased heparin induced-thrombocytopenia's risk with/without thrombocytopenia. Case presentation: We present a 71-year-old male patient who came to the emergency department (ED) with a COVID-19 clinical manifestation that PCR nasopharyngeal swab confirmed. He was assessed to have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as shown by rapid progression of hypoxemic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrate. He was then treated with moxifloxacin, remdesivir, dexamethasone, heparin pump, and multivitamins. During admission, his respiratory symptoms got worse, so he transferred to the ICU for NIV support. On the ninth day of admission, he had gross hematuria followed by a rapid fall of platelet count. We used two different scoring systems (4Ts and HEP scoring system) to confirm the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Following the discontinuation of heparin injection, the thrombocyte continued to rise, and hematuria disappeared. Conclusion: Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is associated with an increased risk of severe disease and mortality among COVID-19 patients.

Consequently, assessment and training that simultaneously address both gait function and cognition are important to consider in rehabilitation and promotion of healthy aging. For this purpose, a computer game-based rehabilitation treadmill platform (GRP) was developed for dual-task (DT) assessment and training. OBJECTIVE: The first objective was to establish the test-retest reliability of the GRP assessment protocol for DT gait, visuomotor and executive cognitive function in PD patients. The second objective was to examine the effect of task condition [single task (ST) vs. DT] and disease severity (stage 2 vs. stage 3) on gait, visuomotor and cognitive function. METHODS: Thirty individuals aged 55 to 70 years, diagnosed with PD; 15 each at Hoehn and Yahr scale stage 2 (PD-2) and 3 (PD-3) performed a series of computerized visuomotor and cognitive game tasks while sitting (ST) and during treadmill walking (DT). A treadmill instrumented with a pressure mat was used to record center of foot pressure and compute the average and coefficient of variation (COV) of step time, step length, and drift during 1-min, speed-controlled intervals. Visuomotor and cognitive game performance measures were quantified using custom software. Testing was conducted on two occasions, 1 week apart. RESULTS: With few exceptions, the assessment protocol showed moderate to high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values under both ST and DT conditions for the spatio-temporal gait measures (average and COV), as well as the visuomotor tracking and cognitive game performance measures. A significant decline in gait, visuomotor, and cognitive game performance measures was observed during DT compared to ST conditions, and in the PD-3 compared to PD-2 groups. CONCLUSION: The high to moderate ICC values along with the lack of systematic errors in the measures indicate that this tool has the ability to repeatedly record reliable DT interference (DTI) effects over time. The use of interactive digital media provides a flexible method to produce and evaluate DTI for a wide range of executive cognitive activities.

Acquisition of gastrointestinal viruses and parasites was low, while bacterial acquisition ranged from 2.2% for Campylobacter jejuni to 33.0% for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: This preliminary study confirms that Grand Magal pilgrims are likely to be exposed to communicable disease risk as observed in other pilgrimage settings. Further study including larger numbers of pilgrims are needed to investigate potential risk factors for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections at the Grand Magal.","output":"Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections at the 2017 Grand Magal de Touba, Senegal: A prospective cohort survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The novel severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has caused a world-wide pandemic with devastating effects. Fortunately, most children display only mild-to-moderate symptoms, but there are a subset that will have severe symptoms warranting treatment. This review evaluates the current evidence for antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment of acute SARS-COV-2 infections, including coronavirus disease 2019 in pediatrics. RECENT FINDINGS: Treatment recommendations continue to evolve with emerging results from clinical trials. Initial therapies were tailored to repurposed medications, and have now transitioned toward more specific antiviral therapy. In addition to specific antiviral therapy, there is also support to modulate the immune system and reduce inflammatory damage seen in coronavirus disease 2019. Much of the data result from adult studies with subsequent extrapolation to pediatrics. SUMMARY: Recommended therapy will continue to adapt as results return from clinical trials. A continued commitment from the National Institutes of Health and research community to assist in determining optimal therapies for pediatric patients is essential. Until then, most recommendations will likely be informed from the results seen in adult populations.","output":"Acute severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 treatment overview for pediatrics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Laryngoscope blades are often cleaned between cases according to well-defined protocols. However, despite evidence that laryngoscope handles could be a source of nosocomial infection, neither our institution nor the American Society of Anesthesiologists has any specific guidelines for handle disinfection. We hypothesized that laryngoscope handles may be sufficiently contaminated with bacteria and viruses to justify the implementation of new handle-cleaning protocols. METHODS Sixty laryngoscope handles from the adult operating rooms were sampled with premoistened sterile swabs. Collection was performed between cases, in operating rooms hosting a broad variety of subspecialty procedures, after the room and equipment had been thoroughly cleaned for the subsequent case. Samples from 40 handles were sent for aerobic bacterial culture, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for significant isolates. Samples from 20 handles were examined for viral contamination using a polymerase chain reaction assay that detects 17 respiratory viruses. RESULTS Of the 40 samples sent for culture, 30 (75%) were positive for bacterial contamination. Of these positive cultures, 25 (62.5%) yielded coagulase-negative staphylococci, seven (17.5%) Bacillusspp. not anthracis, three (7.5%) alpha-hemolytic Streptococcusspp., and one each (2.5%) of Enterococcusspp., Staphylococcus aureus(S. aureus), and Corynebacteriumspp. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or Gram-negative rods were detected. All viral tests were negative. CONCLUSION We found a high incidence of bacterial contamination of laryngoscope handles despite low-level disinfection. However, no vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Gram-negative rods, or respiratory viruses were detected. Our results support adoption of guidelines that include, at a minimum, mandatory low-level disinfection of laryngoscope handles after each patient use.","output":"Nosocomial contamination of laryngoscope handles: challenging current guidelines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"STUDY OBJECTIVE Outcomes of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest depend on time to therapy initiation. We hypothesize that it would be feasible to select refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients for expedited transport based on real-time estimates of the 911 call to the emergency department (ED) arrival interval, and for emergency physicians to rapidly initiate ECPR in eligible patients. METHODS In a 2-tiered emergency medical service with an ECPR-capable primary destination hospital, adults with refractory shockable or witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomized 4:1 to expedited transport or standard care if the predicted 911 call to ED arrival interval was less than or equal to 30 minutes. The primary outcomes were the proportion of subjects with 911 call to ED arrival less than or equal to 30 minutes and ED arrival to ECPR flow less than or equal to 30 minutes. RESULTS Of 151 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 911 calls, 15 subjects (10%) were enrolled. Five of 12 subjects randomized to expedited transport had an ED arrival time of less than or equal to 30 minutes (overall mean 32.5 minutes [SD 7.1]), and 5 were eligible for and treated with ECPR. Three of 5 ECPR-treated subjects had flow initiated in less than or equal to 30 minutes of ED arrival (overall mean 32.4 minutes [SD 10.9]). No subject in either group survived with a good neurologic outcome. CONCLUSION The Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest trial did not meet predefined feasibility outcomes for selecting out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients for expedited transport and initiating ECPR in the ED. Additional research is needed to improve the accuracy of predicting the 911 call to ED arrival interval, optimize patient selection, and reduce the ED arrival to ECPR flow interval.","output":"Extracorporeal Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest (EROCA): Results of a Randomized Feasibility Trial of Expedited Out-of-Hospital Transport."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid-19 is a new pandemic disease, which is caused by the virus knows as Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

The new coronavirus shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a newly identified bat coronavirus2. While bats may be the reservoir host for various coronaviruses, whether 2019-nCoV has other hosts is still ambiguous. In this study, one coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins showed 100%, 98.2%, 96.7% and 90.4% amino acid identity with 2019-nCoV in the E, M, N and S genes, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference. Comparison of available genomes suggests 2019-nCoV might have originated from the recombination of a Pangolin-CoV-like virus with a Bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histopathological changes, and the circulating antibodies reacted with the S protein of 2019-nCoV. The isolation of a coronavirus that is highly related to 2019-nCoV in the pangolins suggests that these animals have the potential to act as the intermediate host of 2019-nCoV.

Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) have been a focal point in many studies that seek to increase the efficacy of biological control programs by increasing recruitment and retention of natural enemies. Our research sought to explore the role of HIPVs in asparagus agroecosystems to answer the following questions: 1) What is the composition of HIPV produced by asparagus ferns following feeding by a chewing herbivore? 2) Do field deployed lures baited with synthetic asparagus HIPVs attract natural enemies? and 3) Can HIPV lures increase biological control of asparagus pests? Volatiles were field collected from the headspace of healthy asparagus ferns, mechanically damaged ferns, and ferns fed upon by asparagus beetle larvae (Crioceris asparagi L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). We found that asparagus beetle damaged asparagus had significantly higher concentrations of (E)--ocimene, (E,E)--farnesene, and (1)-tetradecanol than healthy or mechanically damaged ferns. Field experiments demonstrated that lures baited with isolates of ocimene and farnesene attracted parasitoids without attracting pests, but had no impact on predator recruitment. Finally, we determined that overall parasitism rates were not increased by synthetic HIPV lures but found evidence that lures may increase parasitism of asparagus miner (Ophiomyia simplex Loew) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) by pteromalids.","output":"Biological Control of Asparagus Pests Using Synthetic Herbivore-Induced Volatiles."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract This article explores the impact of COVID-19 on the higher education crisis and its implications for workforce preparedness and the future of work It takes an integrative look at the evolving role of three primary actors involved in higher education: traditional universities, corporate universities, and educational technology companies, before, during, and after the pandemic We conclude with recommendations for reframing discussions about higher education and workforce preparation to achieve a better balance between the workforce needs of the corporate world and those of society","output":"Education Crisis, Workforce Preparedness, and COVID-19: Reflections and Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Appalachian Kentucky is currently fighting two public health emergenciesCOVID-19 and the opioid epidemicleaving the area strapped for resources to care for these ongoing crises.

We aimed to identify the factors associated with the disease severity of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia induced by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods: We prospectively enrolled a single-center case series of adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital of Jining, Jining City, Shandong Province, China, from January 24 to March 1, 2020. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory findings were compared to investigate the risk factors related with the disease severity of COVID-19 pneumonia patients. Results: We included a total of 78 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, of whom 6 had the severe type. As compared to a moderately ill cohort, our analysis showed that shortness of breath, fatigue, longer days from illness onset to diagnosis confirmed, neutrophil percentages > 70%, neutrophil counts > 6.3  10(9)/L, lymphocyte percentages < 20%, lymphocyte counts < 1.0  10(9)/L, platelet < 100  10(9)/L, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, neutrophil to platelet ratio (NPR) > 2.3, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) > 3.9, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) > 40 U/L, albumin < 40 g/L, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 245 U/L, and glucose > 6.1 mmol/L were predictors of disease severity in COVID-19 pneumonia.
