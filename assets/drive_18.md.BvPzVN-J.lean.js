We investigate here the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and infection threats on the daily evolution of cross-border movements of people during the Covid-19 pandemic. We use a unique database on Facebook users mobility, and rely on regression and machine learning models to identify the role of infection threats and containment policies. Permutation techniques allow us to compare the impact and predictive power of these two categories of variables. RESULTS: In contrast with studies on within-border mobility, our models point to a stronger importance of containment policies in explaining changes in cross-border traffic as compared with international travel bans and fears of being infected. The latter are proxied by the numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths at destination. Although the ranking among coercive policies varies across modelling techniques, containment measures in the destination country (such as cancelling of events, restrictions on internal movements and public gatherings), and school closures in the origin country (influencing parental leaves) have the strongest impacts on cross-border movements. CONCLUSION: While descriptive in nature, our findings have policy-relevant implications. Cross-border movements of people predominantly consist of labor commuting flows and business travels. These economic and essential flows are marginally influenced by the fear of infection and international travel bans. They are mostly governed by the stringency of internal containment policies and the ability to travel.","output":"Cross-border mobility responses to COVID-19 in Europe: new evidence from facebook data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most interventions for mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) have been developed in contexts and with populations that differ significantly from the realities of migration. There is an urgent need for MHPSS in transit; however, transit-specific aspects of MHPSS provision are often neglected due to the inherent challenges transit poses to traditional conceptualizations of practice. The Delphi method, which consisted of three iterative rounds of surveys, was applied with the goal of identifying challenges to and adaptations of MHPSS in the transit context. Twenty-six MHPSS providers working with refugees in 10 European transit countries participated; 69% of participants completed all three survey rounds. There was consensus that a flexible model of MHPSS, which can balance low intensity interventions and specialized care, is needed. Agreement was high for practice-related and sociopolitical factors impacting MHPSS in transit; however, the mandate of MHPSS providers working in the transit context achieved the lowest consensus and is yet to be defined. There is a need to rethink MHPSS in the refugee transit context. Providing MHPSS to refugees on the move has specificities, most of which are related to the instability and uncertainty of the context.

Obstetric reports were with few exceptions characterized by small sample sizes with potentially limited generalizability. In this review, evidence suggests increased susceptibility to COVID-19 in pregnancy; common pregnancy comorbidities may help explain worse outcomes. While the risk of death is low, pregnancy may be associated with increased need for ventilation. Prematurity rates seem to be increased but may be accounted for in part by higher cesarean rates, to a large degree accounted for by elective decision to shorten the course of the labor. Though fetal/neonatal complication rates may be higher in the presence of COVID-19 infection, survival rates seem unaffected and vertical transmission is rare. As the outbreak continues in the USA with resurgence in many other western countries that achieved initial success in suppressing the virus, much remains to be learned. For example, the question related to the degree to pregnancy modifying symptomatology remains open. Currently, routine polymerase chain reaction testing remains limited by supply shortages possibly delaying diagnosis until later in the course of the disorder and thus altering the symptom complex at presentation. To add to the knowledge base, we initiated a regional COVID-19 in pregnancy collaborative observational study with a coordinating center, standardized data collection and a shared database. This was facilitated by a longstanding tradition of collaboration among regional obstetric services. Over an anticipated two-year study duration, we expect to study 400 documented and suspected COVID-19 pregnancies with time and site of services controls for cohort effect and high power to detect several adverse maternal/infant outcomes.

The problem is worsened given the growing demand of Information Technology workers and due to the limited instruction of computer science related content being taught within the high school education curriculum. The result is that incoming college students who are majoring in computer science or in related STEM fields are unprepared. Additionally, the means to adequately meet the employment demand is less likely with the low percentage of workers from under-represented minority (URM) groups in jobs within the computer science related industry. Much research has been done on predicting and improving student's success, particularly with the first programming and algorithms course known as CS1 and being ready to take Calculus. The problem is difficult to understand due to the many factors that exists, such as students having different education backgrounds, not knowing what a computer science education entails, and student support systems at a new school. At our university, for three summers, we offered our incoming engineering students a pre-college 4-week summer experience to better prepare them for their first year. The student population targeted were from under-represented minority groups, first-generation, low-income, and women. The goal of the program was to better prepare the students for success by engaging and advising them with both, computer science and math content by bringing them together as a cohort, which is essential during their first critical year in a computer science engineering field of study. The goal of this paper is to study the attrition rates and gain insight on student success predictors for entering Computer Science students.

Machine learning (ML) models have been proposed to accurately predict COVID-19 disease severity. Previous studies have typically tested only one ML algorithm and limited performance evaluation to \\"area under the curve\\" (AUC). To obtain best results possible, it may be important to try multiple algorithms using machine learning (ML) to optimize performance. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used automated machine learning (autoML) to train various machine learning (ML) algorithms. We selected the model that best predicted the chance of patient survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we investigated which variables (i.e. vital signs, biomarkers, comorbidities, etc.) were most influential in generating an accurate model. METHODS: The data was retrospectively collected at our institution on all patients testing positive for COVID-19 between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020. We collected 48 variables from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity. Patients were followed up for 30 days or death. This data was used for autoML to build 20 ML models with various algorithms. The main performance of ML models was measured by area under the precision recall curve (AUCPR). Subsequently, we established model interpretability to identify and rank variables that drove model predictions using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and partial dependence plot (PDP). Finally, dimensionality reduction was conducted to extract the 10 most influential variables. AutoML was retrained using only these 10 variables and its output models was evaluated against the model that used 48 variables. RESULTS: Input from 4313 patients was used. The best model that autoML generated using 48 variables was the stacked ensemble models (AUCPR = 0.807). The two best independent models were the Gradient Boost Models (GBM) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) models with AUCPR of 0.803 and 0.793, respectively. Deep learning models were significantly inferior with AUCPR = 0.73. The ten most influential variables in generating high performing models were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, age, pulse oximetry, blood urea nitrogen, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, troponin, respiratory rate, and Charlson comorbidity score. When the autoML was retrained with these 10 variables, the stacked ensemble model again performed the best with AUCPR of 0.791. CONCLUSIONS: By using autoML, we have developed high-performing models that predict survival from COVID-19 infection. In addition, we identified important variables that correlated with mortality. This is proof of concept that autoML is an efficient, effective, and informative method to generate ML based clinical decision supporting tools.","output":"Using Automated-Machine Learning to Predict COVID-19 Patient Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"India, the second-most populous country in the world is witnessing a daily surge in the COVID-19 infected cases. India is currently among the worst-hit nations worldwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ranks just behind Brazil and the USA. The prediction of the future course of the pandemic is thus of utmost importance in order to prevent further worsening of the situation. In this paper, we develop models for the past trajectory (March 01, 2020-July 25, 2020) and also make a month-long (July 26, 2020-August 24, 2020) forecast of the future evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in India by using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. We determine the most optimal ARIMA model (ARIMA(7,2,2)) based on the statistical parameters viz. root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination ( R 2 ). Subsequently, the developed model is used to obtain a one month-long forecast for the cumulative cases, active cases, recoveries, and the number of fatalities. According to our forecasting results, India is likely to have 3800,989 cumulative infected cases, 1634,142 cumulative active cases, 2110,697 cumulative recoveries, and 56,150 cumulative deaths by August 24, 2020, if the current trend of the pandemic continues to prevail. The implications of these forecasts are that in the upcoming month, the infection rate of COVID-19 in India is going to escalate, while the rate of recovery and the case-fatality rate is likely to reduce. In order to avert these possible scenarios, the administration and health-care personnel need to formulate and implement robust control measures, while the general public needs to be more responsible and strictly adhere to the established and newly formulated guidelines in order to slow down the spread of the pandemic and prevent it from transforming into a catastrophe.","output":"Mathematical modeling and a month ahead forecast of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: an Indian scenario"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This letter highlights the role of macroeconomic and financial uncertainty in predicting US recessions.

Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined.

Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in a population-based setting across 2 geographically distinct centers (Boston Puerto Rican Health Study [BPRHS], an ongoing study of individuals enrolled between June 1, 2004, and October 31, 2009; and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] study, whose participants were originally sampled between November 24, 1986, and February 10, 1990, and followed up through December 31, 2017). Participants in the BPRHS were 668 Puerto Rican individuals with metabolite profiling living in Massachusetts, and participants in the ARIC study were 2152 individuals with metabolite profiling and long-term follow-up for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2018, to March 13, 2020. Exposure The primary exposure was metabolite profiles across both cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included associations with multisystem cardiometabolic stress and all-cause mortality and incident coronary heart disease (in the ARIC study). Results Participants in the BPRHS (N = 668; 491 women; mean [SD] age, 57.0 [7.4] years; mean [SD] body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 32.0 [6.5]) had higher prevalent cardiometabolic risk relative to those in the ARIC study (N = 2152; 599 African American individuals; 1213 women; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [5.7] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 28.0 [5.5]). Multisystem cardiometabolic stress was defined for 668 Puerto Rican individuals in the BPRHS as a multidimensional composite of hypothalamic-adrenal axis activity, sympathetic activation, blood pressure, proatherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, and inflammation. A total of 260 metabolites associated with cardiometabolic stress were identified in the BPRHS, involving known and novel pathways of cardiometabolic disease (eg, amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation). A parsimonious metabolite-based score associated with cardiometabolic stress in the BPRHS was subsequently created; this score was applied to shared metabolites in the ARIC study, demonstrating significant associations with coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment at a 30-year horizon (per SD increase in metabolomic score: hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.31; P = .045 for coronary heart disease; and hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.24; P < .001 for all-cause mortality). Conclusions and Relevance Metabolites associated with cardiometabolic stress identified known and novel pathways of cardiometabolic disease in high-risk, community-based cohorts and were associated with coronary heart disease and survival at a 30-year time horizon. These results underscore the shared molecular pathophysiology of metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and longevity and suggest pathways for modification to improve prognosis across all linked conditions.","output":"Molecular Signature of Multisystem Cardiometabolic Stress and Its Association With Prognosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: As the COVID-19 pandemic was spreading in 2020, the government imposed national lockdowns. We considered the effects these lockdowns had on the paediatric population, with a specific focus on lower limb orthopaedic trauma. We hypothesise that these restrictions will have altered the mechanisms of injury and reduced the number of referrals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from 28/08/19 to 01/04/21, considering the variations in referrals and operations during these times, and analysed these data using an online statistical calculator. We examined the rate of referrals, types of fractures referred to the centre, mechanism of injury, volume of operations performed, and average wait times to undergo an operation. The data were compared in pre-lockdown and lockdown times. RESULTS: 67 paediatric patients with lower limb fractures were included in this study. Throughout the lockdown periods, the mean age of children referred was younger (6.9 from 11.1) and they were less likely to be injured as a result of sport (p = 0.0493). They were more likely to fracture their lower leg (p = 0.0016) when compared with other anatomical regions. The average weekly rate of referrals dropped (0.84C0.68), but the rate of operations almost quartered (0.39C0.16). The average wait times for operations dropped significantly, with patients waiting 80% less time from the date of their injury. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the prevalence and management of lower limb paediatric trauma.

METHODS In this parallel single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 adult patients with primary varicose veins due to incompetent GSV (CEAP classes C2-4EPAsPr) were included and randomly divided to receive RFA or foam sclerotherapy. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was assessed by the Short Form 36, and the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ) was applied to assess the impact of varicose veins on quality of life of the patients. In addition, pain severity after the procedures was investigated by a visual analog scale (VAS) (range, 0 to 10). The patients were followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months postoperation. GSV reflux and recurrence was assessed by color Doppler ultrasound examination after 6 months. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients in RFA and 27 patients in foam sclerotherapy remained for the final analyses. The time interval from the procedure and recovery to daily normal activities was 1 day in both groups. Mean (SD) pain VAS score in RFA group decreased from preintervention score of 7.35 (3.28) to 1.21 (0.68); P < .0001. Likewise, this score decreased from 6.64 (2.04) to 1.29 (0.91) in foam sclerotherapy group. HRQOL scores increased gradually at 1, 3, and 6 months after the intervention.

Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is an increasing concern about the risk and handling of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, clinical data raised during pandemic suggests that IBD patients do not have an increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection or develop a more severe course of infection. In the present review, we intend to highlight how two potentially important contributors to the inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection in IBD patients, the RAGE axis activation as well as the cross-talk with the renin-angiotensin system, are dampened by the high expression of soluble forms of both RAGE and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2. The soluble form of RAGE functions as a decoy for its ligands, and soluble ACE2 seems to be an additionally attenuating contributor to RAGE axis activation, particularly by avoiding the transactivation of the RAGE axis that can be produced by the virus-mediated imbalance of the ACE/angiotensin II/angiotensin II receptor type 1 pathway.","output":"Receptor for advanced glycation end-products axis and coronavirus disease 2019 in inflammatory bowel diseases: A dangerous liaison?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Climate change and the future of energy has been a divisive, polarizing topic of conversation within Canada, but no more so than within Alberta.

Parents were matched on background characteristics using propensity score matching. We found that harsh parenting levels were significantly elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels. Harsh parenting behaviors with a low prevalence before COVID-19 increased most strongly: shaking, calling names, and calling the child stupid. These results suggest that parental tolerance for children's disobedience is lower under the adverse circumstances of COVID-19 and, as a result, abusive parenting responses are more difficult to inhibit.

We aimed to identify anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in sera collected from 4th November 2019 to 9th March 2020, in order to assess the possible spread of the virus in Italy earlier than the first official national diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were evaluated in retrospective serum samples from 234 patients with liver diseases (Hep-patients) and from 56 blood donors (BDs). We used two rapid serologic tests which were confirmed by a validated chemoluminescence assay. RESULTS: Via rapid tests, we found 10/234 (4.3%) IgG-positive and 1/234 (0.4%) IgM-positive cases in the Hep-patient group. Two/56 (3.6%) IgG-positive and 2/56 (3.6%) IgM-positive cases were detected in BD group. Chemoluminescence confirmed IgG-positivity in 3 Hep-patients and 1 BD and IgM-positivity in 1 Hep-patient. RNAemia was not detected in any of the subjects, rendering the risk of transfusion transmission negligible.

However, the origin of excessive damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is able to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damages in vitro and in vivo. 2-E proteins were found to form a type of pH-sensitive cation channels in bilayer lipid membranes. As observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, heterologous expression of 2-E channels induced rapid cell death in various susceptible cell types and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damages in lung and spleen. A dominant negative mutation lowering 2-E channel activity attenuated cell death and SARS-CoV-2 production. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent cell protective activity in vitro and these activities were positively correlated with inhibition of 2-E channel. Importantly, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of the channel inhibitor effectively reduced both the viral load and secretion of inflammation cytokines in lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2).

Our results showed the lower entry efficiency and less cleavage ability of Omicron than D614G variant. Pseudotype-based neutralizing assay was performed to analyze neutralizing antibodies elicited by previously infection or the RBD-based protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 against the Omicron variant.

Content is varied and includes videos, coaching-type questions, articles and challenges. Themes include civility, gratitude, finding joy, mental health resources, humour, acknowledging and validating our difficult job, and valuing colleagues. As a marker for engagement, 29 emails have been received back in response.There have been 27 messages added to our celebration board.Our Christmas celebration highlighted 27 individuals, and acknowledged the work of the Wellbeing Team. Individuals were sent an email certificate. Comments specific to the wellbeing team included, Thank you for recognising the need and taking time to care for us all and I think both the wellbeing emails and promotion of wellbeing has been fantastic. What may seem like a nice little email can have a huge impact not just on peoples wellbeing but has as a knock on effect their motivation, productivity and general output.Eleven staff completed our survey (15% response rate);72% rated the emails as very or extremely helpful. All responders felt the emails were the right length. 63% felt they were the right frequency, with 36% feeling they were too frequent. Comments on the project were overwhelmingly positive;they included simply knowing that there is someone (some people) who care about us and want to make this a more positive environment J also, the content is great! and I think it is great to raise the wellbeing agenda, such an important and overlooked area.ConclusionsWellbeing is multi-faceted and as such is difficult to measure. We have measured markers for engagement in our project rather than wellbeing per se.There was a low response rate to our survey, though those who did respond were very positive. This is likely to be a confounding factor of the motivation of responders being those who are engaged.

We compared the efficacy of new COVID-19 vaccines to prevent symptomatic and severe disease in the adult population and to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 among the elderly. Leading medical databases were searched until August 30, 2021. Published phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated efficacy of the vaccine to prevent symptomatic and sever COVID-19 in adults were included. Two reviewers independently evaluated the literature search results and independently extracted summary data. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. We performed a network meta-analysis (NMA) according to PRISMA-NMA 2015 to pool indirect comparisons between different vaccines regarding their relative efficacy. The primary outcomes were the efficacy of the vaccine against symptomatic COVID-19 in adults (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021235364). Above 200,000 adult participants from eight phase 3 RCTs were included in NMA, of whom 52% received the intervention (active COVID-19 vaccine). While each of nine vaccines was tested in the unique clinical trial as compared to control, based on indirect comparison, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were ranked with the highest probability of efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 (P-scores 0.952 and 0.843, respectively), followed by Gam-COVID-Vac (P-score 0.782), NVX-CoV23730 (P-score 0.700), CoronaVac (P-score 0.570), BN02 (P-score 0.428), WIV04 (P-score 0.327), and Ad26.COV2.S (P-score 0.198). No statistically significant difference was seen in the ability of the vaccines to prevent symptomatic disease in the elderly population. No vaccine was statistically significantly associated with a decreased risk for severe COVID-19 than other vaccines, although mRNA-1273 and Gam-COVID-Vac have the highest P-scores (0.899 and 0.816, respectively), indicating greater protection against severe disease than other vaccines. In our indirect comparison, the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines, which use mRNA technology, were associated with the highest efficacy to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 compared to other vaccines.

This is associated with increased risk of acquiring fungal opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients which account for high morbidity and mortality rates, if left untreated. The conventional antifungal drugs to treat fungal diseases (mycoses) are increasingly becoming inadequate due to observed varied susceptibility of fungi and their recurrent resistance. RNA interference (RNAi), sequence-specific gene silencing, is emerging as a promising new therapeutic approach. This chapter discusses various aspects of RNAi, viz., the fundamental RNAi machinery present in fungi, in silico siRNA features, designing guidelines and tools, siRNA delivery, and validation of gene knockdown for therapeutics against mycoses. Target gene identification is a crucial step in designing of gene-specific siRNA in addition to efficient delivery strategies to bring about effective inhibition of fungi. Subsequently, designed siRNA can be delivered effectively in vitro either by soaking fungi with siRNA or by transforming inverted repeat transgene containing plasmid into fungi, which ultimately generates siRNA(s). Finally, fungal inhibition can be verified at the RNA and protein levels by blotting techniques, fluorescence imaging, and biochemical assays. Despite challenges, several such in vitro studies have spawned optimism around RNAi as a revolutionary new class of therapeutics against mycoses. But, pharmacokinetic parameters need to be evaluated from in vivo studies and clinical trials to recognize RNAi as a novel treatment approach for mycoses.","output":"Computational Tools: RNA Interference in Fungal Therapeutics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In many parts of the world, including Brazil, uptake for biomedical interventions has been insufficient to reverse the HIV epidemic among key populations at high risk for HIV, including men who have sex with men. Young MSM (YMSM), particularly Black YMSM, have high HIV incidence, low viral suppression, and low preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake and adherence. Therefore, novel approaches to increase the HIV biomedical interventions uptake by YMSM are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: We describe the Conectad@s Project, which aims to: (1) estimate the prevalence and incidence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, the onset of sexual risk behavior, and barriers to biomedical interventions among YMSM aged 18 to 24 years in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and (2) conduct a technology-based adherence intervention study to promote a rapid linkage of YMSM to HIV care or prevention, and support and sustain adherence. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey will be conducted with 400 YMSM recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) adapted for social media-based sampling, preceded by a formative phase. HIV and sexually transmitted infections testing will be conducted, including early HIV infection biomarker detection. Behavioral, partnership, network, and structural measures will be collected through structured questionnaires. All individuals recruited for the survey will have access to HIV risk assessment, antiretroviral therapy (ART), PrEP, prevention counseling, and a technology-based adherence intervention. Those who accept the adherence intervention will receive weekly text messages via a social networking app (WhatsApp) for 24 weeks, with follow-up data collected over 48 weeks. RESULTS: The Conectad@s project has been approved by our local institutional review board (#CAAE 26086719.0.0000.4262) in accordance with all applicable regulations. Questionnaires for the RDS survey and intervention were developed and tested in 2020, formative interviews were conducted in January and February 2021 to guide the development of the RDS, and enrollment is planned to begin in early 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The Conectad@s Project is a vanguard study that, for the first time, will apply digital RDS to sample and recruit YMSM in Brazil and rapidly connect them to ART, PrEP, or prevention counseling through a technology-based adherence intervention. RDS will allow us to estimate HIV prevalence among YMSM and measure HIV infection biomarkers in the context of the onset of risky behavior. The data will lay the groundwork to adapt and implement HIV prevention strategies, identify barriers to the earliest HIV infection diagnosis, immediate ART or PrEP initiation, and detect new clusters of HIV transmission.

The modified online survey comprising 76 questions, subdivided into investigations (16), non-invasive respiratory support (18), basic intensive care unit management of ARDS (20), management of refractory hypoxaemia (8), pharmacotherapy (7) and anticoagulation (7), was completed again. RESULTS Disagreement between experts was significant only when addressing the appropriateness of diagnostic bronchoscopy in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Adherence to existing published guidelines for the management of ARDS for relevant evidence-based interventions was recommended. Responses of the experts to the final survey suggested that the supportive management of ARDS should be the same, regardless of a COVID-19 diagnosis. For patients with ARDS with COVID-19, the panel recommended routine treatment with corticosteroids and a lower threshold for full anticoagulation based on a high index of suspicion for venous thromboembolic disease. CONCLUSION The expert panel found no reason to deviate from the evidence-based supportive strategies for managing ARDS outlined in recent guidelines.","output":"RAND appropriateness panel to determine the applicability of UK guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other strategies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Le monde entier est touch par un bouleversement sans prcdent, cre par un virus incontr?lable et qui a pris le pas sur les thories scientifiques les plus labores.

This study examined trends in health insurance coverage among trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, including differences in demographics and clinical characteristics by insurance type. METHODS: This was a retrospective study on adult patients admitted to six level 1 trauma centers between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2020. The primary exposure was hospital admission date: January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 (Period 1), January 1, 2019 to March 15, 2020 (Period 2), and March 16, 2020 to June 30, 2020 (Period 3). Covariates included demographic and clinical variables. 2 tests examined whether the rates of patients covered by each insurance type differed between the pandemic and earlier periods. Mann-Whiney U and 2 tests investigated whether patient demographics or clinical characteristics differed within each insurance type across the study periods. RESULTS: A total of 31 225 trauma patients admitted between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2019 were included. Forty-one per cent (n=12 651) were admitted in Period 1, 49% (n=15 258) were from Period 2, and 11% (n=3288) were from Period 3. Percentages of uninsured patients increased significantly across the three periods (Periods 1 to 3: 15%, 16%, 21%) (p(trend)=0.02); however, there was no accompanying decrease in the percentages of commercial/privately insured patients (Periods 1 to 3: 40%, 39%, 39%) (p(trend)=0.27). There was a significant decrease in the percentage of patients on Medicare during the pandemic period (Periods 1 to 3: 39%, 39%, 34%) (p<0.01). DISCUSSION: This study found that job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increases of uninsured trauma patients. However, there was not a corresponding decrease in commercial/privately insured patients, as may have been expected; rather, a decrease in Medicare patients was observed. These findings may be attributable to a growing workforce during the study period, in combination with a younger overall patient population during the pandemic.

However, there are safety concerns regarding its QT interval and pro-arrhythmic effects. Objective: This trial aimed to determine the predictors of QT interval prolongation and pro-arrhythmic effects in patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving HCQ. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational study of 45 critically-ill patients hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2 infection and treated with 800 mg of HCQ at day 1 and 400 mg on days 2-5. Clinical aspects and outcomes, basal and final corrected QT (QTc) interval, and the incidence of arrhythmias and arrhythmogenic death were observed. Independent predictors of QTc prolongation were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. QT interval prolongation was considered substantial at final QTc [] 480 ms. Results: The mean age was 60.9 {+/-} 16.67 years and 28 (62.2%) patients were men. Basal QTc was 442 {+/-} 28 ms, and the final QTc interval was 458 {+/-} 34 ms, for a mean QTc interval variation of 15 {+/-} 11 ms. There was no arrhythmogenic death.

BACKGROUND PAOS is a neurodegenerative syndrome in which patients present with apraxia of speech, a motor speech disorder affecting programming and planning of speech. Patients with PAOS predictably develop Parkinsonism. DAT scan is a neuroimaging tool that assesses the integrity of presynaptic dopamine transporters in striatum and is usually abnormal in PSP and CBS. METHODS As part of an NIH-funded grant, we performed a DAT scan on 17 PAOS patients early in the disease course. DaTQUANT software was used to quantify uptake in the left and right caudate and anterior/posterior putamen, with striatum to background ratios (SBRs). The PAOS cohort was compared to 15 PSP and 8 CBS patients. RESULTS Five PAOS patients (29%) showed abnormalities in at least one striatal region on DAT scan. When the five PAOS patients with abnormal DAT were compared to the PSP and CBS patients, the only difference observed was lower uptake in the posterior putamen in PSP (p = 0.03). There were no differences is putamen/caudate ratio or in symmetry of uptake, across all groups. There was also no difference in MDS-UPDRS-III scores between PAOS patients with and without abnormal DAT scans (p = 0.56). CONCLUSIONS Abnormal DAT scan is observed early in the disease course in approximately 30% of PAOS patients, with striatal abnormalities similar to those in PSP and CBS.","output":"Ioflupane 123I (DAT scan) SPECT identifies dopamine receptor dysfunction early in the disease course in progressive apraxia of speech."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global Covid-19 pandemic has interrupted many aspects of life, including education.

However, the process has experienced significant troubles. Therefore, starting in June 2021, multiple-stage random sampling and simple random sampling were used to select a sample of 270 Thai high school students across nine Thai provinces. Using a network of Thai teachers, students were assisted with their questionnaire input using Google Form. LISREL 9.1 software was used to conduct the subsequent goodness-of-fit (GOF) assessment and the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A structural equation model (SEM) was used for the 53-item questionnaire, which contained eight latent variables, 18 observed variables, and ten hypotheses. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the SEM's output and ten hypotheses. After that, it was calculated that the model's causal variables had a positive effect on SS, which had an R(2) of 54%. The analysis also revealed that when ranked by total effect (TE) values, performance expectancy (PE = 0.43) was most significant, followed by actual use (AU = 0.30), learner interaction (LI = 0.18), and behavioral intention (BI = 0.12).

Radiology educators have had to rapidly adapt to a new, virtual educational landscape. We describe our experience restructuring a Trauma and Emergency Radiology Elective to an online format and present survey data obtained from students who completed the course. METHODS: This elective is a 4-week course offered to third and fourth year medical students at a large Level 1 Trauma Center. Changes to the traditional rotation included assigning an increased number of self-study educational resources, independent review of unknown cases using a virtual workstation, and online interactive conferences. At the conclusion of each block, students were asked to complete post-course feedback surveys. RESULTS: Thirteen students enrolled in this online course; 92% submitted post-course surveys. Students strongly agreed that the course was clinically relevant, with accessible, engaging material (average score, 4.92/5), and 91.7% of students were very likely to recommend this rotation to others. Students reported improved post-course confidence in ordering and interpreting imaging studies. A majority (60%) of students who had previously taken an on-site course would have preferred a course that combined traditional and online learning elements. CONCLUSIONS: The success of our online rotation highlights the merits of self-directed learning and flipped-classroom techniques.

METHODS: In total, 224 radiologists from 31 different countries participated in our cross-sectional, web-based survey study. On a 7-point Likert scale, participants had to answer 27 questions about the online teaching situation before/during the pandemic, technical and social aspects of online teaching and the future role of online teaching in radiology. RESULTS: An overwhelming majority stated that radiology is particularly well-suited for online teaching (91%), that online teaching should play a more prominent role after the pandemic (73%) and that lecturers should be familiar with online teaching techniques (89%). Difficulties include a higher workload in preparing online courses (59%), issues with motivating students to follow online courses (56%) and the risk of social isolation (71%).

The aim of our study was to assess changes in BP variability after renal denervation (RDN). In addition, on an exploratory basis, we investigated whether baseline BP variability predicted the BP changes after RDN. METHODS We analyzed 24-h BP recordings obtained at baseline and 6 months after RDN in 167 treatment-resistant hypertension patients (40% women; age, 56.7 years; mean 24-h BP, 152/90 mmHg) recruited at 11 expert centers. BP variability was assessed by weighted SD [SD over time weighted for the time interval between consecutive readings (SDiw)], average real variability (ARV), coefficient of variation, and variability independent of the mean (VIM). RESULTS Mean office and 24-h BP fell by 15.4/6.6 and 5.5/3.7 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariable-adjusted analyses, systolic/diastolic SDiw and VIM for 24-h SBP/DBP decreased by 1.18/0.63 mmHg (P  0.01) and 0.86/0.42 mmHg (P  0.05), respectively, whereas no significant changes in ARV or coefficient of variation occurred. Furthermore, baseline SDiw (P = 0.0006), ARV (P = 0.01), and VIM (P = 0.04) predicted the decrease in 24-h DBP but not 24-h SBP after RDN. CONCLUSION RDN was associated with a decrease in BP variability independent of the BP level, suggesting that responders may derive benefits from the reduction in BP variability as well. Furthermore, baseline DBP variability estimates significantly correlated with mean DBP decrease after RDN. If confirmed in younger patients with less arterial damage, in the absence of the confounding effect of drugs and drug adherence, baseline BP variability may prove a good predictor of BP response to RDN.","output":"Blood pressure response to renal denervation is correlated with baseline blood pressure variability: a patient-level meta-analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Serine proteases are a large family of enzymes critical for multiple physiological processes, and proven diagnostic and therapeutic targets in several clinical indications.

The only current treatment option available for advanced OA is joint replacement surgery. This surgery may pose the risks of persistent pain, surgical complications and limited implant lifespan. Transforming growth factor (TGF)- has a crucial role in multiple cellular processes such as cell proliferation. Any deterioration in TGF- signaling pathways can have an immense impact on OA. Owing to the crucial role of TGF- in cartilage homeostasis, targeting it could be an alternative therapeutic approach. Additionally, stem cell-based therapy has recently emerged as an effective treatment strategy that could replace surgery. A number of recent findings suggest that the tissue regeneration effect of stem cells is attributed to the paracrine secretion of anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective mediators or trophic factors, particularly nanosized extracellular vesicles (i.e., exosomes).

Rapid implementation of system-wide changes at unprecedented scale and pace has been the norm during the COVID-19 pandemic, but this must be coupled with iterative cycles of learning and improvement to ensure optimal care.","output":"Evaluation of a multidisciplinary team model of care in paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The wide use of laparoscopy for groin hernia repair has unveiled \\"hidden hernias\\" silently residing in this area. During the open repair of the presenting hernia, the surgeon was often unaware of these occult hernias. These patients postoperatively may present with unexplained chronic groin or pelvic pain. PRESENTATION OF CASE Rare groin hernias are defined according to their anatomical position. Challenges in the diagnosis and management of occult rare groin hernias are discussed. These problems are illustrated by a unique case report of multiple (six) coexisting groin hernias, whereof five were occult and two were rare. DISCUSSION Rare groin hernias are uncommon because they are difficult to diagnose clinically and are not routinely looked for. They are often occult and may coexist with other inguinal hernias, thus posing a diagnostic and treatment challenge to the surgeon, especially if there is persistent groin pain after \\"successful\\" repair. MRI is the most accurate preoperative and postoperative diagnostic tool, if there is a clinical suspicion that the patient might have an occult hernia. CONCLUSION Preperitoneal endoscopic approach is the recommended method in confirming the diagnosis and management of occult groin hernias. A sound knowledge of groin anatomy and a thorough preperitoneal inspection of all possible sites for rare groin hernias are needed to diagnose and repair all defects. The preperitoneal mesh repair with adequate overlap of all hernia orifices is the recommended treatment of choice.","output":"Multiple concurrent bilateral groin hernias in a single patient; a case report and a review of uncommon groin hernias: A possible source of persistent pain after successful repair."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Patients treated with curative-intent lung radiotherapy are in the group at highest risk of severe complications and death from COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need to reduce the risks associated with multiple hospital visits and their anti-cancer treatment. One recommendation is to consider alternative dose-fractionation schedules or radiotherapy techniques. This would also increase radiotherapy service capacity for operable patients with stage I-III lung cancer, who might be unable to have surgery during the pandemic. Here we identify reduced-fractionation for curative-intent radiotherapy regimes in lung cancer, from a literature search carried out between 20/03/2020 and 30/03/2020 as well as published and unpublished audits of hypofractionated regimes from UK centres. Evidence, practical considerations and limitations are discussed for early-stage NSCLC, stage III NSCLC, early-stage and locally advanced SCLC. We recommend discussion of this guidance document with other specialist lung MDT members to disseminate the potential changes to radiotherapy practices that could be made to reduce pressure on other departments such as thoracic surgery. It is also a crucial part of the consent process to ensure that the risks and benefits of undergoing cancer treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties surrounding toxicity from reduced fractionation have been adequately discussed with patients. Furthermore, centres should document all deviations from standard protocols, and we urge all colleagues, where possible, to join national/international data collection initiatives (such as COVID-RT Lung) aimed at recording the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer treatment and outcomes.","output":"Reduced Fractionation in Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Curative-intent Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of race/ethnicity and social determinants of health on COVID-19 care and outcomes for patients within a healthcare system that provided virtual hospital care. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 12,956 adults who received care for COVID-19 within an integrated healthcare system between 3/1/2020 and 8/31/2020. Multinomial models were used to examine associations between race/ethnicity, insurance, neighborhood deprivation measured by Area Deprivation Index (ADI), and outcomes of interest. Outcomes included (1) highest level of care: virtual observation (VOU), virtual hospitalization (VACU), or inpatient hospitalization; (2) intensive care (ICU); and (3) all-cause 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients were 41.8% White, 27.2% Black, and 31.0% Hispanic. Compared to White patients, Black patients had 1.86 higher odds of VACU admission and 1.43 higher odds of inpatient hospitalization (vs. VOU). Hispanic patients had 1.24 higher odds of inpatient hospitalization (vs. VOU). In models stratified by race/ethnicity, Hispanic and Black patients had higher odds of inpatient hospitalization (vs. VOU) if Medicaid insured compared to commercially insured. Hispanic patients living in the most deprived neighborhood had higher odds of inpatient hospitalization, compared to those in the least deprived neighborhood. Black and Hispanic patients had higher odds of ICU admission and 30-day mortality after adjustment for other social determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Insurance and ADI were associated with COVID-19 outcomes; however, associations varied by race/ethnicity. Racial/ethnic disparities in outcomes are not fully explained by measured social determinants of health, highlighting the need for further investigation into systemic causes of inequities in COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"Disparities in Level of Care and Outcomes Among Patients with COVID-19: Associations Between Race/Ethnicity, Social Determinants of Health and Virtual Hospitalization, Inpatient Hospitalization, Intensive Care, and Mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To prepare a nanobody specific to dectin 1 and verify its specificity and anti-inflammatory effects on Aspergillus fumigatus keratitis. METHODS: The nanobody was selected from a high-quality shark-antibody library constructed with phage-display technology. The nanobody was developed in the expression systems of Escherichia coli. Indirect ELISA was used to determine the specificity of the nanobody to recombinant dectin 1 protein. The potential of the nanobody to be recognized and expressed on the surfaces of cells and corneas was detected by immunofluorescence, and its anti-inflammatory effect on A. fumigatus keratitis was further verified. After infection with A. fumigatus, eyes of C57B L/6 mice were treated with nanobodies. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) were pretreated with nanobodies and then incubated with A. fumigatus. Clinical scores and slit-lamp photography were used to assess disease response in mouse corneas. RT-PCR and ELISA were used to evaluate mRNA and protein expression of IL1 and IL6 in both mouse corneas and HCECs. RESULTS: The nanobody was successfully expressed through microbial system and showed specific high-affinity binding to recombinant dectin 1. Furthermore, it exhibited specific binding to dectin 1 expressed on the surfaces of cells and recognized dectin 1 in mouse corneas. Importantly, it reduced clinical scores of A. fumigatus keratitis in mice compared with a PBS-treatment group. In addition, it decreased mRNA and protein expression of IL1 and IL6 in infected corneas and HCECs stimulated with A. fumigatus.

Mushroom is a macrofungus which has been cultivated worldwide for its nutritional value and medicinal applications. Several bioactive molecules were extracted from mushroom such as polysaccharides, lectins and terpenoids. Lectins are carbohydrate-binding proteins with non-immunologic origin. Lectins were classified according to their structure, origin and sugar specificity. This protein has different binding specificity with surface glycan moiety which determines its activity and therapeutic applications. A wide range of medicinal activities such as antitumor, antiviral, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and antidiabetic were reported from sugar-binding proteins. However, glycan-binding protein from mushroom is not well explored as antiviral agent. The discovery of novel antiviral agents is a public health emergency to overcome the current pandemic and be ready for the upcoming viral pandemics.

Since January 2020, Taiwan has introduced both NPIs but their effectiveness on non-COVID-19 respiratory viruses (NCRVs) remain underexplored. METHODS: This retrospective observational study examined electronic records at a tertiary hospital in northern Taiwan from pre-COVID (January-December 2019) to post-COVID period (January-May 2020). Patients with respiratory syndromes were tested for both enveloped (eg, influenza virus and seasonal coronavirus) and non-enveloped RVs (eg, enterovirus and rhinovirus) using multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Monthly positivity rates of NCRVs among adult and pediatric patients were analyzed with comparison between pre- and post-COVID periods. RESULTS: A total of 9693 patients underwent 12 127 multiplex RT-PCR tests. The average positivity rate of NCRVs reduced by 11.2% (25.6% to 14.4%) after nationwide PHIs. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the most commonly identified enveloped and non-enveloped viruses were influenza virus and enterovirus/rhinovirus, respectively. Observed reduction in NCRV incidence was predominantly contributed by enveloped NCRVs including influenza viruses. We did not observe epidemiological impacts of NPIs on non-enveloped viruses but an increasing trend in enterovirus/rhinovirus test positivity rate among pediatric patients. Our data were validated using Taiwan's national notification database. CONCLUSIONS: Our frontline investigation suggests that the current NPIs in Taiwan might not effectively control the transmission of non-enveloped respiratory viruses, despite their protective effects against influenza and seasonal coronavirus.

METHODS: Data on the cases and deaths from COVID-19, by sex and age group, were extracted from the national official agencies from Denmark, England, Israel, Italy, Spain, Canada and Mexico. Age-specific CFRs were computed for males and females separately. The ratio of the male to female CFRs were computed and meta-analytic methods were used to obtained pooled estimates of the male to female ratio of the CFRs over the seven countries, for all age-groups. Meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were conducted to evaluate the age and country contribution to differences. RESULTS: The CFRs were consistently higher in males at all ages. The pooled M:F CFR ratios were 1.71, 1.88, 2.11, 2.11, 1.84, 1.78 and 1.49, for ages 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80+ respectively. In meta-regression, age group and country were associated with the heterogeneity in the CFR ratios. CONCLUSIONS: The sex differences in the age-specific CFRs are intriguing. Sex differences in the incidence and mortality have been found in many infectious diseases. For COVID-19, factors such as sex differences in the prevalence of underlying diseases may play a part in the CFR differences. However, the consistently greater case-fatality rates in males at all ages suggests that sex-related factors impact on the natural history of the disease.

The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number (r0 = 1.93) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-3 lockdown was found to be 2.34 and that of the level-4 lockdown, 1.69. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally 'smarter' than the 'harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general.

This segment of the global fixed income market is of particular importance for insurance companies in Europe. Our empirical research strategy is inspired by Gunay (2020) who has analyzed the relationship between credit and liquidity risk in the United States using Granger causality tests. More specifically, we employ the procedure developed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995) to test for Granger causality among yield spreads in five different member countries of the European Monetary Union (namely Austria, Belgium, France, Italy and Ireland) relative to Germany. We examine interest rate data from bonds with three different maturities (5, 10 and 30 years). Given the importance of long-term bonds as asset class for European life insurers and pension funds, the empirical results from the often ignored market for government bonds with a maturity of 30 years should be of interest. With regard to long-term sovereign debt, there is no evidence for Granger causality among the time series examined here. Consequently, the risk premia required by investors to hold government bonds of one specific member country of the EMU do not help to forecast the risk premia that have to be paid by other countries. Given the structure of their liabilities, this empirical finding should be of high relevance for portfolio and risk managers in the European life insurance industry and in pension funds. With regard to the yield spreads to be observed in the market for 10-year government bonds, there seems to be no clear picture. Focusing on fixed income securities with a maturity of 5 years, there is one very interesting empirical finding. The test results reported here seem to imply that there is unidirectional Granger causality running from the yield spreads in all other four countries to Austria. Given that Austria is a comparably small country which is assumed to be in a fiscally stable position, this result could be interpreted as evidence for credit risk premia as being helpful to forecast liquidity risk premia in the market for medium-term government bonds issued by member states of the European Monetary Union.","output":"Risk premia and the European government bond market: new empirical evidence and some thoughts from the perspective of the life insurance industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reopening in-person education in public schools during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires careful risk-benefit analysis, with no current established metrics. Equity concerns in urban public schools such as decreased enrollment among largely Black and Latinx prekindergarten and special needs public school students already disproportionately impacted by the pandemic itself have added urgency to Chicago Department of Public Health's analysis of COVID-19 transmission. Close tracking within a large school system revealed a lower attack rate for students and staff participating in in-person learning than for the community overall.

This study explores the performance of several Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model in forecasting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Time series of daily cumulative COVID-19 cases were used for generating 1-day, 3-day, and 5-day forecasts using several LSTM models and ARIMA. Two novel k-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the performance of the models in forecasting time series values for multiple days. Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as 0.05%, while those for ARIMA were 0.07% and 0.06% respectively. LSTM models slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the forecasts. The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period performance metrics proposed is likely to be useful for performance evaluation of time series models in predicting multiple periods. Based on the k-period performance metrics proposed, both LSTMs and ARIMA are useful for time series analysis and forecasting for COVID-19.","output":"Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of COVID-19 Cases Using LSTM and ARIMA Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"MAIN CONCLUSION: 46 monocot chimeric jacalins (MCJs) were mined from wheat genome. They were divided into three subfamilies with the activity of mannose-specific lectins and had effects on dehydration tolerance or disease resistance. Monocot chimeric jacalin (MCJ) is a newly identified subfamily of plant lectins that exclusively exists in Poaceae. The MCJs are modular proteins consisting of a dirigent domain and a jacalin-related lectin domain. Their unique evolution and various functions are not fully understood as only few members of MCJ have so for been investigated. From wheat, 46 MCJs were identified and phylogenetically classified into three subfamilies, in which subfamily I represented the early evolutionary cluster. MCJ genes are evenly distributed among three subgenomes of wheat, indicating that MCJ might be an ancient gene in Poaceae. qRT-PCR analysis showed that TaMCJ1 and TaMCJ2 were mainly expressed in leaves while TaMCJ3 in root tissues. All these TaMCJ genes are JA or ABA inducible. All three proteins exhibited agglutinating activity but different preference to mannose-binding. The overexpression of TaMCJ3 in tobacco increased dehydration tolerance, while TaMCJ1 enhanced wildfire disease resistance. The lignin biosynthetic genes were temporarily induced after pathogen inoculation in transgenic tobacco overexpressing TaMCJ, but the specific association with TaMCJ was not established. This evidence argued against the notion that the dirigent domain in TaMCJ is directly linked with lignin metabolism. Taken together, these results pave the way for a better understanding of the manifold functionality of MCJs and offer important insights to the evolutionary history of MCJ.","output":"Identification of monocot chimeric jacalin family reveals functional diversity in wheat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The variety of current cosmetic procedures has increased the potential risks of adverse events and infections.

Our analysis utilizes COVID-19 observational data in the USA between March 19 and 28, corresponding to the early stage of the epidemic when the impacts of social distancing on disease progression were yet to manifest. Calibrating our model using epidemiological data from this time period enabled us to unbiasedly address the question \\"How long and with what intensity does the USA need to implement social distancing intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic?\\" For a short (i.e., up to two weeks) duration, we find a near-linear decrease in hospital beds demand with increasing intensity (&#966;) of social distancing. For a duration longer than two weeks, our findings highlight the diminishing marginal benefit of social distancing, characterized by a linear decrease in medical demands against an exponentially increasing social distancing duration. Long-term implementation of strict social distancing with &#966;>50% could lead to the emergence of a second wave of infections due to a large residual susceptible population which highlights the need for contact tracing and isolation before re-opening of the economy.

Most published research on feedback in health professional education originates in Europe and North America. Our interest is on the impact of Culture on this process, particularly in the context of Asian cultures.The (scientific) realist approach of Pawson and Tilley provides a means to examine complex interventions in social situations, and thus is an appropriate lens to use for this study. This is a protocol for a realist synthesis which asks how, why and in what circumstances do Asian Cultures influence health professional trainees to seek, respond to and use feedback given in the clinical environment, if at all.

In a tertiary care center, video conferencing-enhanced virtual clinics were established via a new application platform. They were introduced during COVID-19 pandemic to connect patients to trained health-care providers via a secured line. While maintaining patients' privacy, they were theorized to offer effective communications and continuous clinical care. In this cross-sectional cohort study, we ought to examine the impact of service and the assistance they may offer to cardiac patients in the outpatient setup. METHODS: A prospective cohort study looking at all video-conferencing virtual clinics' visits during the pandemic with primary focus on cardiac outpatient clinic, addressing primary endpoints of need for admission or emergency visits from cardiac demises during the pandemic and secondary endpoint of patient satisfaction based on patients' experiences. RESULTS: A total of 6000 live care video-based chats were made over 10 months period from March 10(th), 2020, to January 30(th), 2021, among which 277 patients were evaluated in the virtual cardiac clinic, of these 193 (69.7%) were males, with mean age of 48  15.60 (22.3%), patients were requested to present to clinic for further evaluation and testing, 20 (7.2%) patients were asked to visit the emergency room, of whom 8 (2.8%) patients were hospitalized. All 8 were admitted for high-risk findings that require immediate medical attention, 4/8 underwent cardiac catheterization, mean duration of admission was 2  1 days. When compared to regular walk-in care, there was a statistical difference in admission rate and emergency visits p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively, both were statistically higher in the virtual clinic. The satisfaction rate in a 5-scale grading system was 97% of 4 and above recommending the continuation of the service beyond pandemic time. CONCLUSIONS: Video-enhanced virtual cardiology clinic works safely and efficiently during COVID-19 pandemic with a difference in admission rate and ER visits when compared to walk-in clinic. It can be used during nonpandemic time to reduce load on hospital and clinic crowdedness. It also decreases the chances of COVID-19 transmission indirectly by reenforcing physical distance.","output":"Efficacy of Telemedicine Utilization for Cardiac Outpatients' Care during the Pandemic of COVID-19: A Large Center Experience in the Wave of the Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this report, we describe an in vitro culture method for feline bone marrow cells, which yields large numbers of quiescent macrophages after 14 days of culture.

Our Emergency Department (ED) was designated as a COVID-19 exclusive service. We report our first 500 confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia patients. METHODS: From 14 March to 16 May 2020, we enrolled all patients admitted to our ED that had a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Infection was confirmed via nasopharyngeal swabs or tracheal aspirate PCR. The outcomes included hospital discharge, invasive mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death, among others. RESULTS: From 2219 patients received in the ED, we included 506 with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. We found that 333 patients were discharged home (65.9%), 153 died (30.2%), and 20 (3.9%) remained in the hospital. A total of 300 patients (59.3%) required ICU admission, and 227 (44.9%) needed invasive ventilation. The multivariate analysis found age, number of comorbidities, extension of ground glass opacities on chest CT and troponin with a direct relationship with all-cause mortality, whereas dysgeusia, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-ii receptor blocker and number of lymphocytes with an inverse relationship with all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This was a sample of severe patients with COVID-19, with 59.2% admitted to the ICU and 41.5% requiring mechanical ventilator support. We were able to ascertain the outcome in majority (96%) of patients. While the overall mortality was 30.2%, mortality for intubated patients was 55.9%.

An unbalanced immune response, characterized by a weak production of type I interferons (IFN-Is) and an exacerbated release of proinflammatory cytokines, contributes to the severe forms of the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused outbreaks in 2003 and 2013, respectively. Although IFN treatment gave some encouraging results against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in animal models, its potential as a therapeutic against COVID-19 awaits validation. Here, we describe our current knowledge of the complex interplay between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the IFN system, highlighting some of the gaps that need to be filled for a better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In addition to the conserved IFN evasion strategies that are likely shared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, novel counteraction mechanisms are being discovered in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Since the last coronavirus epidemic, we have made considerable progress in understanding the IFN-I response, including its spatiotemporal regulation and the prominent role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are the main IFN-I-producing cells. While awaiting the results of the many clinical trials that are evaluating the efficacy of IFN-I alone or in combination with antiviral molecules, we discuss the potential benefits of a well-timed IFN-I treatment and propose strategies to boost pDC-mediated IFN responses during the early stages of viral infection.","output":"Interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the type I interferon response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spatial and spatio-temporal scan statistics proposed by Kulldorff have been applied to a number of geographical disease cluster detection problems.

In this study, we propose a more flexible geometric structure to be used as a spatial or spatio-temporal scanning window. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the scanning window to determine disease clusters. We evaluated the proposed method over a number of spatial and spatio-temporal datasets (Breast cancer mortality in Northeastern US 1988C1992 and different types of cancer in New Mexico 1982C2007).

ARMOR is a novel, reusable face covering that can be quickly disinfected using an array of ultraviolet C lamps contained within a wearable case. A nanomembrane UVC sensor was used to quantify the intensity of germicidal radiation at 18 different locations on the face covering and determine the necessary exposure time to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in addition to other viruses and bacteria. After experimentation, it was found that ARMOR successfully provided germicidal radiation to all areas of the mask and will inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in approximately 180 s, H1N1 Influenza in 130 s, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 113 s, proving that this design is effective at eliminating a variety of pathogens and can serve as an alternative to traditional waste-producing disposable face masks.

Without specific antivirals, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continues to cause major global mortality. Antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine (CQ)/hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mefloquine have emerged as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. CQ/HCQ entered the Solidarity and RECOVERY clinical trials against COVID-19 and showed lack of efficacy. Importantly, mefloquine is not a 4-aminoquinoline like CQ and HCQ and has been previously repurposed for other respiratory diseases. Unlike the 4-aminoquinolines that accumulate in the high pH of intracellular lysosomes of the lung, the high respiratory tract penetration of mefloquine is driven by its high lipophilicity. While CQ and HCQ exhibit activity in Vero E6 cells, their activity is obviated in TMPRSS2-expressing cells, such as Calu-3 cells, which more accurately recapitulate in vivo entry mechanisms for SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, here we report the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of mefloquine in Calu-3 type II pneumocytes and primary human monocytes. Mefloquine inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells with low cytotoxicity and EC50 and EC90 values of 1.2 and 5.3 {micro}M, respectively. In addition, mefloquine reduced up to 68% the SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in infected monocytes, reducing viral-induced inflammation. Mefloquine blocked early steps of the SARS-CoV-2 replicative cycle and was less prone than CQ to induce drug-associated viral mutations and synergized with RNA polymerase inhibitor. The pharmacological parameters of mefloquine are consistent with its plasma exposure in humans and its tissue-to-plasma predicted coefficient points that this drug may accumulate in the lungs. These data indicate that mefloquine could represent an orally available clinically approved drug option against COVID-19 and should not be neglected on the basis of the failure of CQ and HCQ.","output":"Unlike Chloroquine, mefloquine inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in physiologically relevant cells and does not induce viral variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapy for pyothorax, or pleural empyema, has not been described for large felids.

Here we study the presence and evolution of extracellular histone H3 and several other neutrophil-related molecules and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the plasma of 117 COVID-19-positive ICU patients. We demonstrate that at ICU admission the levels of histone H3, MPO, and DNA-MPO complex were all significantly increased in COVID-19-positive patients compared to control samples. Furthermore, in a subset of 54 patients, the levels of each marker remained increased after 4+ days compared to admission. Histone H3 was found in 28% of the patients on admission to the ICU and in 50% of the patients during their stay at the ICU. Notably, in 47% of histone-positive patients, we observed proteolysis of histone in their plasma. The overall presence of histone H3 during ICU stay was associated with thromboembolic events and secondary infection, and non-cleaved histone H3 was associated with the need for vasoactive treatment, invasive ventilation, and the development of acute kidney injury.

It has been used for more than 50 years for the treatment of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis/sinusitis. Iota-carrageenan is effective against a broad variety of respiratory viruses, which are the most common cause of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Therefore, it is used as the active component in the antiviral nasal spray Coldamaris prophylactic (1.2 mg/mL iota-carrageenan in 0.5% NaCl) and other medical device nasal sprays that are approved and marketed in the EU. Recently, we developed a nasal spray formulation containing both xylometazoline HCl (0.05%) and iota-carrageenan (0.12%) that provides decongestion and antiviral protection of the nasal mucosa at the same time. RESULTS: A set of in vitro experiments revealed that the vasoconstrictive properties of xylometazoline HCl and the antiviral effectiveness of iota-carrageenan against human rhinovirus (hRV) 1a, hRV8 and human coronavirus OC43 were maintained in the formulation containing these two compounds. Permeation experiments using bovine nasal mucosa showed that iota-carrageenan had no significant influence on the permeation of xylometazoline HCl. Finally, in the local tolerance and toxicity study, it was shown that the formulation was well tolerated at the application site with no occurrence of erythema or edema in the nostrils of all rabbits or any signs of toxicity in any of the organs and tissues inspected. CONCLUSION: Investigations on compatibility of xylometazoline HCl and iota-carrageenan demonstrated that the substances do not influence each other, allowing both to fulfill their known specific clinical efficacy (xylometazoline HCl) and effectiveness (iota-carrageenan).","output":"Development of a nasal spray containing xylometazoline hydrochloride and iota-carrageenan for the symptomatic relief of nasal congestion caused by rhinitis and sinusitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Population-based literature suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection may disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities; however, patient-level observations of hospitalization outcomes by race/ethnicity are limited. The aim of this study was to characterize COVID-19-associated morbidity and in-hospital mortality by race/ethnicity. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of nine Massachusetts hospitals including all consecutive adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Measured outcomes were assessed and compared by patient-reported race/ethnicity, classified as White, Black, Latinx, Asian, or other. Students t-test, Fischer exact test, and multivariable regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: 379 patients (62.916.5 years; 55.7% men) with confirmed COVID-19 were included (49.9% White, 13.7% Black, 29.8% Latinx, 3.7% Asian), of which 376 (99.2%) were insured (34.3% private, 41.2% public, 23.8% public with supplement). Latinx patients were younger, had fewer cardiopulmonary disorders, were more likely to have obesity, more frequently reported fever and myalgia, and had lower D-dimer levels compared to White patients (p&0.05). On multivariable analysis controlling for age, gender, obesity, cardiopulmonary comorbidities, hypertension, and diabetes, no significant differences in in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, or mechanical ventilation by race/ethnicity were found. Diabetes was a significant predictor for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.11-3.23) while older age was a predictor of in-hospital mortality (OR 4.18; 95% CI 1.94-9.04). CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-center cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the largest health system in Massachusetts, there was no association between race/ethnicity and clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, after controlling for key demographic/clinical characteristics. These findings serve to refute suggestions that certain races/ethnicities may be biologically predisposed to poorer COVID-19 outcomes.","output":"How Do Presenting Symptoms and Outcomes Differ by Race/Ethnicity Among Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19 Infection?

This paper: (1) evaluates the idea that a single standard of \\"healthy\\" growth characterizes children under age 5, (2) discusses how variation from this standard is viewed in global health, in human biology and by parents, and (3) explores how views of \\"normal\\" growth shape biomedical and parental responses. METHODS This paper reviews the anthropological, public health and clinical literature on the nature of child growth and the applicability of World Health Organization Multicenter Growth Reference Study growth standards across contexts. RESULTS The considerable variability in child growth across contexts makes it unlikely that any one framework, with issues of sample selection and representativeness, can serve as the model of healthy growth. Global health, human biology and parents differ in the emphasis they place on heredity versus environmental context in understanding this variability, but human biologists and parents tend to view a wider range of growth as \\"normal.\\" Since both biomedicine and parents base their care decisions on their perceptions of normal, healthy growth, the comparative framework used has important implications for medical treatment and feeding practices.

After the lockdown, the French strategy to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 relied partly on investigations of all confirmed cases. Monitoring collective settings is particularly important since SARS-CoV-2 seems prone to superspreading events (SSEs). METHODS: Our study is based on data gathered in Paris from May 11 to December 31, 2020, by the Ile-de-France Regional Health Agency (RHA) to investigate cases occurring in collective and high-risk settings. Specific events in high-risk settings were systematically transmitted to the RHA, and screenings were organized by the facilities, while other settings were reported when three cases were identified within a short period. These settings were more difficult to identify through the surveillance system since no systematic screening was organized by the facility, leaving screenings to rely on the national contact-tracing programme. No official superspreading threshold has been set for SARS-CoV-2. We defined a SSE as an event involving ten cases. RESULTS: We analysed 15,706 events associated with 38,670 cases, representing an average of 2.70 cases per event. Most clusters occurred in educational facilities, workplace environments, social care settings, and healthcare facilities. SSEs represented 3.4% but accounted for 28% of all cases reported. The highest number of SSEs occurred in college settings (12.6%), followed by hospitals and retirement homes. Educational facilities had the lowest number of SSEs, with around 1% in preschools and elementary schools. CONCLUSIONS: We observed different SSE rates in each setting. Preschools and primary schools represented the majority of events but experiencing very few SSEs. Colleges were prone to SSEs and were associated with a high number of secondary cases. These findings provide some insights on contact tracing activities and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in different settings.","output":"Superspreading events of SARS-CoV-2 in Paris: A retrospective analysis of data from the first wave of COVID-19 in 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first cluster of coronavirus cases in Europe was officially detected on 21st February 2020 in Northern Italy, even if recent evidence showed sporadic first cases in Europe since the end of 2019.

Contraction occurs mainly in the lateral epidermal cells, while the dorsoventral epidermis plays a more passive role. Two parallel pathways trigger actinomyosin contraction, one mediated by LET-502/Rho kinase and the other by PAK-1/p21 activated kinase. A number of genes mediating morphogenesis have been shown to be sufficient when expressed either laterally or dorsoventrally. Additional genes show either lateral or dorsoventral phenotypes. This led us to a model where contractile genes have discrete functions in one or the other cell type. We tested this by examining several genes for either lateral or dorsoventral sufficiency. LET-502 expression in the lateral cells was sufficient to drive elongation. MEL-11/Myosin phosphatase, which antagonizes contraction, and PAK-1 were expected to function dorsoventrally, but we could not detect tissue-specific sufficiency. Double mutants of lethal alleles predicted to decrease lateral contraction with those thought to increase dorsoventral force were previously shown to be viable. We hypothesized that these mutant combinations shifted the contractile force from the lateral to the dorsoventral cells and so the embryos would elongate with less lateral cell contraction. This was tested by examining ten single and double mutant strains. In most cases, elongation proceeded without a noticeable alteration in lateral contraction. We suggest that many embryonic elongation genes likely act in both lateral and dorsoventral cells, even though they may have their primary focus in one or the other cell type.","output":"Tissue-specific regulation of epidermal contraction during C. elegans embryonic morphogenesis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rapid advances in clinical education in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are taking place globally.

Due to the risk of airborne transmission and limited personal protective equipment, hospitals restricted patient visitations to protect both healthcare workers and patients. In response to the initiation of this visitation restriction at our hospital on March 18, 2020, we piloted a video-based communication program for families to virtually visit their family members in the hospital. This is a quality improvement project designed to evaluate the utility and limitations of these virtual family visits during the pandemic. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted of all patients over 17 years-old hospitalized between March 18 and May 31, 2020 for documented video encounters performed by hospital staff at a New York City public hospital. All video calls were performed using Whatsapp, Facetime, or Google Hangout communication app on a hospital-issued smartphone or tablet. Data collected included date of call, patient age, call facilitator, preferred language, patient location during hospitalization, use of mechanical equipment for assisted breathing, hospital length of stay, patient disposition, discharge diagnosis, and any additional limitations noted by the staff during video visits. Patients admitted to the psychiatric, rehabilitation, pediatric, labor and delivery, forensics wards, or if only a voice call was performed, were excluded. Results: Of the 2068 hospitalizations qualified for chart review, 177 patients have thus far been identified with documented video visits. A total of 1416 video visits were performed in these patients. 71.0% of the patients were intubated during their hospitalization and when video visits occurred. 37.3% of the patients expired, while 24.9% were discharged home or to a short-term rehabilitation center (38.9%). The average length of stay was 35.2 days (SD 2.1). Majority of the diagnoses were COVID-related illnesses (61.0%). Social workers conducted 78.5% of the video visits, followed by physicians (57.7%) and hospital chaplains (9.6%). Average patient age was 62 years-old. Chart review process is currently ongoing. Conclusions: The use of smartphones and tablets for video visits facilitated communication between patients and their families when in-person visits were restricted. We were able to provide visual visits to families when patients were intubated and were unable to verbalize. While a significant number of patients expired during this period, families were able to see and communicate with their family members prior to their deaths. The use of this technology is an invaluable tool for families to communicate and partake in patient care. .","output":"The use of smartphones and tablets for video visits between patients and families during the height of COVID-19 in new york city"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sector of tourism is a leading service sector according to the BoP methodology.

To determine the functional role of these beta bursts we took advantage of the Race Model framework describing action-stopping. We incorporated beta bursts in three race model variants, each implementing a different functional contribution of beta to action-stopping. In these variants, we hypothesized that a transient increase in beta could 1) modulate decision thresholds, 2) change stop accumulation rates, or 3) promote the interaction between the Stop and the Go process. We then tested the model predictions using EEG recordings in humans performing a Stop-signal task. We found that the model variant in which beta increased decision thresholds for a brief period of time best explained the empirical data. The model parameters fitted to the empirical data indicated that beta bursts involve a stronger decision threshold modulation for the Go process than for the Stop process. This suggests that prefrontal beta influences stopping by temporarily holding the response from execution. Our study further suggests that human action-stopping could be multi-staged with the beta acting as a pause, increasing the response threshold for the Stop process to modulate behavior successfully. Overall, our approach of introducing transient oscillations into the race model and testing against human electrophysiological data provides a novel account of the puzzle of prefrontal beta in executive control.","output":"Transient beta modulates decision thresholds during human action-stopping"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental contamination caused by COVID-19 patients could be a medium of transmission. Previous reports of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental surfaces were about short-term contamination. This study investigated SARS-CoV-2 RNA existence in room-temperature and low-temperature environments long after exposure (>28 days). A department store, where a COVID-19 outbreak was occurred in January 2020 (the epicenter of 43 COVID-19 patients), and a patient's apartment were included as room-temperature environments after being blocked for 57 days and 48 days, respectively. Seven cold storages and imported frozen foods inside were included as low-temperature environments (under ?18 C). Twenty food markets with potential contamination of imported frozen foods were also included to study the consecutive contamination. Information about temperature, relative humidity, and the number of days of environmental samples since the last exposure was collected and analyzed. In sum, 11,808 swab samples were collected before disinfection, of which 35 samples were positive. Persistent contamination of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified in the apartment (6/19), the department store (3/50), food packages in cold storages (23/1360), environmental surfaces of cold storages (2/345), and a package in the food market (1/10,034). Two positive samples were isolated from the bathroom of the apartment (66.7 %, 2/3), and doorknobs were proved with contamination in the apartment (40 %, 2/5) and cold storage (33.3 %, 1/3). The epidemiology information and environmental contamination results of an imported frozen food related COVID-19 case (138th COVID-19 patient in Tianjin) were analyzed. Based on the Ct values, the number of copies of two target genes was calculated by standard curves and linear regressions. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in room-temperature environments at least 57 days after the last exposure, much longer than previous reports. Based on the results of this study and previous studies, infectious SARS-CoV-2 could exist for at least 60 days on the surface of cold-chain food packages.

While efforts to increase production are underway in many jurisdictions, demand may yet outstrip supply leading to PPE shortages, particularly in low resource settings. PPE is critically important for the safety of healthcare workers (HCW) and patients and to reduce viral transmission within healthcare facilities. A structured narrative review was completed to identify methods for extending the use of available PPE as well as decontamination and reuse. Methods Database searches were conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE for any available original research or review articles detailing guidelines for the safe extended use of PPE, and/or PPE decontamination and reuse protocols prior to September 28, 2020. Grey literature in addition to key websites from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), Infection Prevention Association of Canada (IPAC), and the National Health Service (NHS) was also reviewed. Results Extended use guidelines support co-locating patients with confirmed COVID-19 within specific areas of healthcare facilities to enable the use of PPE between multiple patients, and reduce PPE requirements outside these areas. Decontamination strategies for N95 respirators and face shields range from individual HCWs using conventional ovens and microwave steam bags at home, to large-scale centralized decontamination using autoclave machines, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, hydrogen peroxide vapors, or peracetic acid dry fogging systems. Specific protocols for such strategies have been recommended by the US CDC and WHO and are being implemented by multiple institutions across North America. Further studies are underway testing decontamination strategies that have been reported to be effective at inactivating coronavirus and influenza, and on SARs-CoV-2 specifically. Conclusions This narrative review summarizes current extended use guidelines and decontamination protocols specific to COVID-19.

Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies.","output":"Tracking and tracing in the UK: a dynamic causal modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Performance measurement is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting standardized measures of clinical performance that can be compared across practices to evaluate how well care was provided.

However, the implications of certain tumor types, treatments, and the age and sex of patients with cancer for the outcomes of COVID-19 remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the differences in clinical outcomes between patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients without cancer but with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to identify patients with cancer at particularly high risk for a poor outcome. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were searched for articles published in English until June 14, 2021. References in these articles were reviewed for additional studies. STUDY SELECTION: All case-control or cohort studies were included that involved 10 or more patients with malignant disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection with or without a control group (defined as patients without cancer but with SARS-CoV-2 infection). Studies were excluded if they involved fewer than 10 patients, were conference papers or abstracts, were preprint reports, had no full text, or had data that could not be obtained from the corresponding author. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently performed data extraction using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The difference in mortality between patients with cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection and control patients as well as the difference in outcomes for various tumor types and cancer treatments. Pooled case fatality rates, a random-effects model, and random-effects meta-regressions were used. RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included, involving 61 532 patients with cancer. Among 58 849 patients with available data, 30 557 male individuals (52%) were included and median age ranged from 35 to 74 years. The relative risk (RR) of mortality from COVID-19 among patients with vs without cancer when age and sex were matched was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.46-1.95; P < .001; I(2) = 51.0%). The RR of mortality in patients with cancer vs control patients was associated with decreasing age (exp [b], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99; P = .03). Compared with other cancers, lung cancer (RR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.45-1.94; P < .001; I(2) = 32.9%), and hematologic cancer (RR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.31-1.54; P < .001; I(2) = 6.8%) were associated with a higher risk of death. Although a higher point estimate was found for genitourinary cancer (RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.24; P = .06; I2 = 21.5%), the finding was not statistically significant. Breast cancer (RR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.36-0.71; P < .001; I(2) = 86.2%) and gynecological cancer (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62-0.93; P = .009; I(2) = 0%) were associated with a lower risk of death. Chemotherapy was associated with the highest overall pooled case fatality rate of 30% (95% CI, 25%-36%; I(2) = 86.97%; range, 10%-100%), and endocrine therapy was associated with the lowest at 11% (95% CI, 6%-16%; I(2) = 70.68%; range, 0%-27%).

FINDINGS: This study confirmed the findings of previous research that current pressures within the ED include crowding, time pressure and working within an uncontrollable environment. Eight participants identified an absence of previous emotional support resulting in dissociation and avoidance behaviours following traumatic exposure. Overall, the PACE service was well received by the majority of staff (11/12). There was a positive association with the one-to-one element and the educational component helped to reduce the stigma associated with stress reactions after work-related exposure.

Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialised cells responsible for sampling antigens and presenting them to T cells, which also play an essential role in recognising and neutralising viruses. Recent studies have suggested that non-coding RNAs may regulate the functional program of DCs. Expression of host non-coding RNAs changes markedly during infectious bronchitis virus infection, but their role in regulating host immune function has not been explored. Here, microarrays of mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs were globally performed to analyse how avian DCs respond to IBV. RESULTS: First, we found that IBV stimulation did not enhance the maturation ability of avian DCs. Interestingly, inactivated IBV was better able than IBV to induce DC maturation and activate lymphocytes. We identified 1093 up-regulated and 845 down-regulated mRNAs in IBV-infected avian DCs. Gene Ontology analysis suggested that cellular macromolecule and protein location (GO-BP) and transcription factor binding (GO-MF) were abundant in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. Meanwhile, pathway analysis indicated that the oxidative phosphorylation and leukocyte transendothelial migration signalling pathways might be activated in the IBV group. Moreover, alteration of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) was detected in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. In total, 19 significantly altered (7 up and 12 down) miRNAs and 101 (75 up and 26 down) lncRNAs were identified in the IBV-treated group. Further analysis showed that the actin cytoskeleton and MAPK signal pathway were related to the target genes of IBV-stimulated miRNAs. Finally, our study identified 2 TF-microRNA and 53 TFCmicroRNACmRNA interactions involving 1 TF, 2 miRNAs, and 53 mRNAs in IBV-stimulated avian DCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests a new mechanism to explain why IBV actively blocks innate responses needed for inducing immune gene expression and also provides insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of avian IBV.

Pts were divided into cohort 1 (pts who were intolerant to ibr only) and cohort 2 (pts who were intolerant to acala alone/and ibr). Pts with documented progressive disease (PD) on prior BTKi therapy were excluded. Efficacy and safety, including recurrence of intolerant AEs to the prior BTKi, were evaluated. AEs were assessed for severity, seriousness, and relation to zanu;as well as dose reductions, holds, or discontinuations. Response was assessed by investigators based on response criteria for their respective indications (Blood 2008;131:2745;J Clin Oncol 2012;30:2820;J Clin Oncol 2014;32:3059;Br J Haemtol 2013;160:171). Disease parameters from study entry were the baseline for response assessment. Mutational analysis was performed on pts who discontinued treatment, and data will be shared once available. To support clinical findings, kinase selectivity was assessed using Kinome profiling at 100X IC50 (against BTK) for zanu, ibr, acala and its major metabolite, M27 (Reaction Biology Corp). Results: As of 7 June 2021 (data cutoff), 57 pts (n=44 CLL/SLL;n=9 WM;n=2 MCL;n=2 marginal zone lymphoma [MZL]) were enrolled in cohort 1, and 7 pts were enrolled in cohort 2 (n=4 CLL;n=1 WM;n=1 MCL;n=1 MZL). All received 1 dose of zanu and were analyzed for safety. The median age was 71 years (range, 49-91) in cohort 1 and 71 years (range, 65-76) in cohort 2;median duration of treatment was 8.7 months (range, 0.6-17.9) in cohort 1 and 8.2 months (range, 6.4-11.4) in cohort 2;median number of prior regimens was 1 (range, 1-12) in cohort 1 and 3 (range, 2-5) in cohort 2. Within cohort 2, 5 pts were intolerant to both ibr and acala. Median number of intolerant events per pt for both cohorts 1 and 2 was 2 (range, 1-5). Overall, 73% of pts did not experience recurrence of their ibr or acala intolerant events and 79% of recurrent events recurred at a lower severity (Figure 1). At cutoff, 54 pts remained on treatment. Reasons for treatment discontinuation were AEs (n=4), PD (n=4), physician's decision (n=1), and consent withdrawal (n=1). Grade 3 AEs were reported in 18 pts (28%), and serious AEs occurred in 7 pts (11%). AEs requiring dose interruptions occurred in 17 pts (27%), and AEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 3 pts (5%). One death, due to COVID-19, was reported. Pts demonstrated maintained (41%) and improved (53%) response with zanu treatment from their reported best overall response on prior BTKis for a total disease control rate of 94% (including a 42% partial response rate in pts with CLL/SLL, 30% in pts with WM, and a 20% very good partial response rate in pts with WM). Zanu also demonstrated good selectivity by kinase profiling. It showed >50% inhibition on 7/370 kinases, while ibr, acala, and M27 had more off-target binding (17, 15 and 23 kinases, respectively) at their respective 100X IC50 (BTK) c ncentrations (Figure 2). Conclusion: In pts with B-cell malignancies intolerant to ibr and/or acala, zanu treatment resulted in continued disease control or improved response. Zanu was well-tolerated, and most AEs that led to discontinuation of previous BTKi therapy did not recur or recurred at a lower grade. In support of clinical findings, differentiation between BTKi selectivity profiles favor zanu over ibr and acala.

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study that included patients hospitalised because of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, three months after their discharge. A clinical evaluation, analytical parameters, chest X-ray, six-minute walk test, spirometry and DLCOCDLNO analysis were performed. Demographic variables, comorbidities, and variables related to the severity of the admission were recorded. Results: Two hundred patients completed the study;59.5% men, age 62 years, 15.5% admitted to the intensive care unit. The most frequent functional alteration, in 27% of patients, was in the DLCOCDLNO combination. This alteration was associated with age, male sex, degree of dyspnoea, poorer perception of health, and limited ability for physical effort. These patients also presented higher levels of D-Dimer and more residual radiological alterations. In 42% of the patients with diffusion alterations, only reduced DLNO was presented, along with lower D-Dimer levels and less capillary volume involvement. The severity of the process was associated with the reduction in DLCOCDLNO. Conclusions: The most sensitive RFT for the detection of the sequelae of COVID-19 pneumonia was the combined measurement of DLCOCDLNO and this factor was related to patient health status and their capacity for physical exertion. In 40% of these cases, there was only a reduction in DLNO, a finding that may indicate less pulmonary vascular involvement.","output":"Alterations in Respiratory Function Test Three Months after Hospitalisation for COVID-19 Pneumonia: Value of Determining Nitric Oxide Diffusion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted organ donation and transplantation across the globe. METHODS: This study analyzed transplant outcomes during the pre-pandemic [PPE, 1/2019-2/2020] and pandemic era [PE, 3/2020-8/2020] based on changes in induction immunosuppression. During PPE, high immunological risk patients received 4-6 mg/kg, moderate risk 2-4mg/kg, and low risk 1-2 mg/kg of ATG. During PE, ATG doses were reduced to 3-4 mg/kg for high risk, 1-2 mg/kg for moderate, and low changed to basiliximab. Primary outcomes: biopsy-proven rejection [BPAR], de-novo donor-specific antibody [DSA], delayed graft function [DGF], infection rates, graft loss, and all-cause of mortality. RESULTS: During PPE, 224 kidney transplants [KTx], 14 kidney/pancreas transplants [KP] were included, while 180 KTx, 5 KP were included for PE. Basiliximab use increased by 30% in the PE. The odds of DGF were statistically significant between PE vs PPE, OR 1.7 [1.05, 2.8, p-value=0.042]. The odds of developing DSAs and BPAR during the PE versus PPE was 0.34 [0.16, 0.71, p-value = 0.004] and OR 0.34 (0.1 to 1.1, p-value, 0.104)] respectively. Cytomegalovirus [19% in PE, 37% in PPE] and BK virus [5.4% PE vs. 16% PPE] incidence reduced during PE versus PPE. COVID-19, graft loss, and mortality were comparable between groups.

African green monkey is a widely used non-human primate model in biomedical investigations. In this study, total RNAs were extracted from stool samples of 10 African green monkeys with diarrhea. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize viromes. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to determine the full genome sequences. Great viral diversity was observed. The dominant viruses were enteroviruses and picobirnaviruses. Six enterovirus genomes and a picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence were characterized. Five enteroviruses belonged to two putative new genotypes of species Enterovirus J. One enterovirus belonged to EV-A92. The picobirnavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence had the highest nucleotide similarity (93.48%) with human picobirnavirus isolate GPBV6C2.

The risk of embolic cerebrovascular event complicates the management of this condition via a pure endovascular approach. A combined operative-endovascular intervention may be a valuable approach in order to reduce the risk of intraoperative stroke and prevent future embolic events. CASE PRESENTATION An 84-year-old female presented at the emergency department (ED) with a 4-month history of migratory digital cyanotic lesions across various fingers on her right hand. The lesion eventually progressed into dry gangrene on her right middle finger. Selective angiography of the aortic arch vessels demonstrated significant atherosclerotic plaque burden throughout her supra-aortic vessels and a segmental stenosis at the proximal innominate artery. A right carotid cut down was performed to allow clamping of the carotid artery so as to minimize the risk of intraoperative stroke from plaque manipulation. Retrograde balloon angioplasty was performed, and stent was placed across the stenotic segment. The patient tolerated the procedure well and had an uneventful postoperative course. She was discharged on postoperative day 3. At 2-week follow-up, she has had no progression of her digital ischemia nor other focal cranial nerve deficits. CONCLUSION Migratory digital ischemia is a rare presentation of atherosclerotic disease of the supra-aortic vessels. It represents a challenging situation for endovascular intervention due to concern about plaque dislodgment during the procedure. A retrograde balloon-stent angioplasty following distal carotid control with an open approach may be safe and effective in selected patients.","output":"Innominate Artery Stenosis Presenting With Migratory Digital Ischemia."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Holarrhena antidysenterica (HA), a twining shrub belonging to the Apocynaceae family is found in tropical regions of Africa and over a large part of Asia including India, Philippines and Malayan Peninsula. In Indian traditional system of medicine, HA has been used to treat gastric ailments, for wound healing and also to improve glycaemic control. Glucose lowering activity of HA root, bark, seed, leaf and fruit extract in different parts of India as well as in Chinese traditional medicine is widely reported. Purpose In the meta-analysis reported in this article, we summarize glucose-lowering effects of HA extracts from different plant parts as reported in multiple studies involving animal models of diabetes. Our analysis helps to quantify the glucose-lowering effect of HA in comparison with standard diabetes drugs. The analysis also sheds light on differential efficacy levels of HA extracted from different plant parts. Study design The meta-analysis was carried out following PRISMA guidelines. Literature was searched to identify studies published between years 2011 to 2019 reporting glucose-lowering effects of HA extract on rodent models of diabetes. Methods Longitudinal meta-analysis was carried out on time-course data extracted from selected studies to calculate standardized mean change of glucose value from day 1 to days 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment by HA extract or standard anti-diabetic drug. Subgroup analysis was carried out for studies reporting effects of HA on leaf and seed extracts. Standardized mean difference in levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and serum total protein between treatment and control groups were also assessed. Results We shortlisted nine articles to be used for this meta-analysis. Summarized standardized mean changes of glucose value between day 1 and day 21 post-treatment indicated glucose-lowering effects of HA extracts to be marginally lower but comparable to that of standard anti-diabetic drugs like Glibenclamide or Sitagliptin. However, subgroup analysis revealed seed extracts of HA to be more potent than leaf extracts or even standard drugs. Effects of the extract on levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and serum total protein was also commensurate with its glucose-lowering property. Conclusions Our results, summarized over multiple studies, present a clear quantitative assessment of the anti-diabetic property of HA, in particular the seed extracts compared to standard anti-diabetic drugs. Further differential analysis of the seed extracts will be useful to arrive at a herbal formulation with superior anti-diabetic property and possibly lesser side effects than chemical entities.","output":"Anti-diabetic effects of Holarrhena antidysentrica extracts: Results from a Longitudinal Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global epidemic of COVID-19, social isolation and the fear of viral contagion have determined and determine profound changes in social relations between people.

The purpose of this study was to assess the impacts of the lockdown measures on air quality and pollutant emissions in Valencia, Spain. For this reason, we determined if there was a significant difference in the concentration levels of different particulate matter (PM) sizes, PM(10), PM(2.5), and NO(x), NO(2), NO, and O(3,) between the period of restrictions in 2020 and the same period in 2019. Our findings indicated that PM pollutant levels during the lockdown period were significantly different from the same period of the previous year, even if there is variability in the different local areas. The highest variations reduction in the PM(10) and PM(2.5) levels were observed for the Valncia Centre, Valncia Avd Francia, and Valncia Pista de Silla (all of the urban traffic type) in which there was a reduction of 58%C42%, 56%C53%, and 60%C41% respectively. Moreover, consistent with recent studies, we observed a significant reduction in nitric oxide levels in all the air monitoring stations. In all seven monitoring stations, it was observed, in 2020, NO(x), NO(2), and NO concentrations decreased by 48.5%C49.8%C46.2%, 62.1%C67.4%C45.7%, 37.4%C35.7%C35.3%, 60.7%C67.7%C47.1%, 65.5%C65.8%C63.5%, 60.0%C64.5%C41.3%, and 60.4%C61.6%C52.5%, respectively. Lastly, overall O(3) levels decreased during the lockdown period, although this phenomenon was more closely related to weather conditions. Overall, no significant differences were observed between the meteorological conditions in 2019 and 2020.

DESIGN: Qualitative descriptive study. SETTING: Adult intensive care setting across 14 hospitals within the UK National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: ICU-experienced clinicians and non-ICU-experienced family liaison team members deployed during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semistructured telephone/video interviews were conducted with ICU clinicians. Analytical themes were developed inductively following a standard thematic approach, using family-centred care and sensemaking as sensitising concepts. RESULTS: We completed 36 interviews, with 17 ICU-experienced clinicians and 19 non-ICU-experienced family liaison team members. In the context of inperson visiting restrictions, virtual visiting offered an alternative conduit to (1) restoring the family unit, (2) facilitating family involvement, and (3) enabling sensemaking for the family. Virtual visits with multiple family members concurrently and with those living in distant geographical locations restored a sense of family unit. Family involvement in rehabilitation, communication and orientation activities, as well as presence at the end of life, highlighted how virtual visiting could contribute to family-centred care. Virtual visits were emotionally challenging for many family members, but also cathartic in helping make sense of their own emotions and experience by visualising their relatives in the ICU. Being able to see and interact with loved ones and their immediate care providers afforded important cues to enable family sensemaking of the ICU experience. CONCLUSIONS: In this UK qualitative study of clinicians using virtual ICU visiting, in the absence of inperson visiting, virtual visiting was perceived positively as an alternative that promoted family-centred care through virtual presence. We anticipate the perceived benefits of virtual visiting may extend to non-pandemic conditions through improved equity and timeliness of family access to the ICU by offering an alternative option alongside inperson visiting.","output":"Virtual visiting in intensive care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative descriptive study with ICU clinicians and non-ICU family team liaison members"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Digital health (DH) is nowadays fundamental for physicians. Despite the improvement of information and communications technology (ICT), Italian medical doctors' (MDs) education system seems inadequate in this area. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, societies are waking up to their limitations. The aim of this paper is to analyze the Italian status quo in DH. METHODS The Italian Young Medical Doctors Association (Segretariato Italiano Giovani Medici - SIGM) proposed a web-based survey to assess DH awareness and previous knowledge among young doctors. Investigated areas were: big data, -omics technology and predictive models, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things, telemedicine, social media, blockchain and clinical-data storage. RESULTS A total of 362 participants answered to the survey. Only 13% had experience in big data during clinical or research activities, 13% in -omics technology and predictive models, 13% in AI, 6% had experience in internet of things, 22% experienced at least one telemedicine tool and 23% of the participants declared that during their clinical activities data collection was paper-driven.

However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.

The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated these existing issues in a vulnerable, often forgotten, immigrant community. It is challenging for this population to access public information regarding COVID-19 testing, treatment, and assistance programs because this information is seldom disseminated in Spanish and even less frequently in Portuguese. While long-term solutions will require time and changes to policy, some short-term measures can mitigate the current situation. The authors share their experience from Newark, New Jersey, where partnerships of public and private community-based organizations (CBOs) have been successful in establishing trust between the health care system and a fearful Latino community. The Ironbound Initiative, a student group at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School in Newark, New Jersey, has partnered with Mantena Global Care, a Brazilian CBO in Newark, to facilitate dissemination of COVID-19-relevant information. Medical student volunteers, removed from their clinical duties, serve as virtual patient navigators, using social media to reach community members with the goals of improving awareness of precautions to take during the pandemic and of increasing access to needed medical care. These students have collaborated with colleagues in other disciplines to provide necessary legal guidance to community members fearful of seeking care because of their immigration status. The authors urge other academic institutions across the country to recruit multidisciplinary teams of medical, health professional, and law students invested in their local communities and to empower students to partner with CBOs, immigrant community leaders, faith-based organizations, hospitals, and local authorities to support these vulnerable communities during this crisis.","output":"Vulnerable Immigrant Populations in the New York Metropolitan Area and COVID-19: Lessons Learned in the Epicenter of the Crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Community engagement is considered a cornerstone of health promotion practice. Yet engagement is a fuzzy term signifying a range of practices. Health scholarship has focused primarily on individual effects of engagement. To understand the complexities of engagement, organizations must also consider relational, structural, and/or organizational factors that inform stakeholders' subjective understandings and experiences. Community engagement processes are not neutral; they can reproduce and/or dismantle power structures, often in contradictory or unexpected ways. This article discusses diverse stakeholders' subjective experiences and understandings of engagement within the HIV sector in Toronto, Canada. In our study, a team of community members, service providers, and academics partnered with three HIV community-based organizations to do this work. We used photovoice, a participatory and action-oriented photography method, to identify, document, and analyze participants' understandings at respective sites. Through collaborative analysis, we identified seven themes that may catalyze conversations about engagement within organizations: reflecting on journey; honoring relationships; accessibility and support mechanisms; advocacy, peer leadership, and social justice; diversity and difference; navigating grief and loss; and nonparticipation. Having frank and transparent discussions that are grounded in stakeholders' subjective experiences, and the sociopolitical and structural conditions of involvement, can help organizations take a more intersectional and nuanced approach to community engagement. Together, our findings can be used as a framework to support organizations in thinking more deeply and complexly about how to meaningfully, ethically, and sustainably engage communities (both individually and collectively) in HIV programming, and organizational policy change.

Clinically occult SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients admitted to the hospital is always considered a risk during the pandemic. The aim of our study is to describe the application of CT scan to reveal unexpected COVID-19 in patients needing hospital admission. METHOD: In our emergency department, we prospectively enrolled adult patients needing hospital admission, without symptoms suspected of COVID-19, and showing negative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swab test. CT scan was performed to diagnose clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia. All the exams were read and discussed retrospectively by two expert radiologists and assigned to one of 4 exclusive diagnoses: typical (typCT), indeterminate (indCT), atypical (atyCT), negative (negCT). The clinical characteristics and final diagnoses were described and compared with the results of CT scans. RESULTS: From May 25 to August 18, 2020, we prospectively enrolled 197 patients. They showed 122 negCT, 52 atyCT, 22 indCT, and 1 typCT. Based on the CT imaging, the prevalence of suspected clinically occult COVID-19 pneumonia was 11.6% (23 patients). None had confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection after the hospital stay. Nineteen patients had negative serial RT-PCR while in 4 cases, the infection was excluded by clinical follow-up or appearance of positivity of RT-PCR after months. CONCLUSION: Our descriptive analysis confirms that CT scan cannot be considered a valid tool to screen clinically occult COVID-19, when the asymptomatic patients need hospitalization for other conditions. Application of personnel protections and distancing among patients remains the best strategies to limit the possibility of intrahospital cross-infections.","output":"Retrospective analysis of the application of CT scan in the emergency department to screen clinically asymptomatic COVID-19 before hospital admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social marginalization harms lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons wellbeing in Lesotho.

However, accurate measurements require experience and time. To reduce patient and surgeon burdens related to ROM measurement, a smartphone-based system, which enables participants to measure the ROM of the wrist joint semiautomatically using self-taken pictures on a smartphone, was developed and evaluated in this study. METHODS: In the developed system, participants were asked to take a picture of their wrist by using the other hand to position the joint first into full flexion and then into full extension. The hand and arm regions were automatically extracted in the program, and the ROM was estimated after the area of the hand and forearm was cropped. To verify the accuracy of ROM measurements in this system, the proposed method was tested on 66 images of hands from 33 participants; measurements were compared with those taken by hand surgeons. A limit of agreement and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used for evaluation. RESULTS: The smallest averages (95% limits of agreement) of flexion and extension were 11.32 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.88 to 13.76) and 11.01 (95% CI, 8.64 to 13.39), respectively. The ICC (1,1) for 3 measurements taken by one assessor was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.986C0.992), and the ICC (2,1) for 2 measurements taken by both assessors was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.947C0.977). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a system to measure the semiautomatic ROM of the wrist joint using a smartphone image.

The glycan binding specificity of different P[3] RV VP8*s were investigated in this study. Human HCR3A and dog P[3] RV VP8*s recognized glycans with terminal sialic acid and hemagglutinated the red blood cells, while bat P[3] VP8* showed neither binding to glycans nor hemagglutination.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether oral camostat mesylate would reduce upper respiratory SARS-CoV-2 viral load in newly diagnosed outpatients with mild COVID-19, and would lead to improvement in COVID-19 symptoms. DESIGN: From June, 2020 to April, 2021, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial. SETTING: Single site, academic medical center, outpatient setting in Connecticut, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Of 568 COVID-19 positive potential adult participants diagnosed within 3 days of study entry and assessed for eligibility, 70 were randomized and 498 were excluded (198 did not meet eligibility criteria, 37 were not interested, 265 were excluded for unknown or other reasons). The primary inclusion criteria were a positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification result in adults within 3 days of screening regardless of COVID-19 symptoms. INTERVENTION: Treatment was 7 days of oral camostat mesylate, 200 mg po four times a day, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was reduction of 4-day log(10) nasopharyngeal swab viral load by 0.5 log(10) compared to placebo. The main prespecified secondary outcome was reduction in symptom scores as measured by a quantitative Likert scale instrument, Flu-PRO-Plus modified to measure changes in smell/taste measured using FLU-PRO-Plus. RESULTS: Participants receiving camostat had statistically significant lower quantitative symptom scores (FLU-Pro-Plus) at day 6, accelerated overall symptom resolution and notably improved taste/smell, and fatigue beginning at onset of intervention in the camostat mesylate group compared to placebo. Intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated that camostat mesylate was not associated with a reduction in 4-day log(10) NP viral load compared to placebo.

Several studies investigated the presence of infectious agents in bats, but their impact on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the microbiological and histopathological findings in 77 deceased bats belonging to nine European species (families Vespertilionidae and Molossidae). Materials and Methods: Bat carcasses were collected in the Piedmont region (Italy) by the Unconventional Rehabilitation Centre (CANC), Torino University, and submitted to necropsy. Species, age and sex of each bat were recorded. Virological (orthoreovirus, coronavirus, flavivirus, rhabdovirus, poxvirus, kobuvirus) and histopathological examinations were performed on the main organs (liver, spleen, kidney, gut, lung, heart and brain). Results: Traumatic injuries (fractures, haemorrhages, skin lesions;43%) and predation injuries (8.4%) represented the two main causes of death.

We conducted a meta-analysis by searching Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and Embase up to 13 May 2020. Data analyses were performed by the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software. Finally, we included 9 studies comprising 3936 patients with hypertension and COVID-19 infection.

This article aims to present the reasons for vulnerability of CYP during the pandemic, and to focus on actions by health professionals that mitigate additional challenges to their health and well-being. Using a rapid review of the literature and team-based discussions, eight vulnerable groups were identified: CYP with disabilities, mental health conditions and chronic diseases; CYP facing financial hardship; within the child protection system; Aboriginal; migrant and refugee; in residential care; rural; and isolated CYP. Recommendations for action are required at the level of governments, health professionals and researchers and include enhancing access to health and social supports, prioritising vulnerable CYP in resuming health activity and elevating the voice of CYP in designing the response. The pandemic can be conceptualised as an opportunity to create a more equitable society as we document the inequities that have been exacerbated.

Samples of spray dried porcine plasma (SDPP) were collected over a 12- month period from eight spray drying facilities in Spain, England, Northern Ireland, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. In this survey, viral load for several porcine pathogens including SVA, TGEV, PRRSV (EU and US strains), PEDV, PCV-2, SIV, SDCoV and PPV were determined by qPCR. Regression of Ct on TCID(50) of serial diluted stock solution of each virus allowed the estimate of potential viral level in SDPP and unprocessed liquid plasma (using typical solids content of commercially collected porcine plasma). In this survey SVA, TGEV or SDCoV were not detected in any of the SDPP samples. Brazil SDPP samples were free of PRRSV and PEDV. Samples of SDPP from North America primarily contained the PRRSV-US strain while the European samples contained the PRRSV-EU strain (except for one sample from each region containing a relatively low estimated level of the alternative PRRSV strain). Estimated viral level tended to be in the range from <1.0 log(10) TCID(50) to <2.5 log(10) TCID(50).

News and social media discussions have extensively covered the issue of coronavirus vaccines, with a mixture of vaccine advocacies, concerns, and oppositions. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to uncover the emerging themes in Twitter users perceptions and attitudes toward vaccines during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This study employed topic modeling to analyze tweets related to coronavirus vaccines at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States (February 21 to March 20, 2020). We created a predefined query (eg, COVID AND vaccine) to extract the tweet text and metadata (number of followers of the Twitter account and engagement metrics based on likes, comments, and retweeting) from the Meltwater database. After preprocessing the data, we tested Latent Dirichlet Allocation models to identify topics associated with these tweets. The model specifying 20 topics provided the best overall coherence, and each topic was interpreted based on its top associated terms. RESULTS: In total, we analyzed 100,209 tweets containing keywords related to coronavirus and vaccines. The 20 topics were further collapsed based on shared similarities, thereby generating 7 major themes. Our analysis characterized 26.3% (26,234/100,209) of the tweets as News Related to Coronavirus and Vaccine Development, 25.4% (25,425/100,209) as General Discussion and Seeking of Information on Coronavirus, 12.9% (12,882/100,209) as Financial Concerns, 12.7% (12,696/100,209) as Venting Negative Emotions, 9.9% (9908/100,209) as Prayers and Calls for Positivity, 8.1% (8155/100,209) as Efficacy of Vaccine and Treatment, and 4.9% (4909/100,209) as Conspiracies about Coronavirus and Its Vaccines. Different themes demonstrated some changes over time, mostly in close association with news or events related to vaccine developments. Twitter users who discussed conspiracy theories, the efficacy of vaccines and treatments, and financial concerns had more followers than those focused on other vaccine themes. The engagement levelthe extent to which a tweet being retweeted, quoted, liked, or replied by other userswas similar among different themes, but tweets venting negative emotions yielded the lowest engagement. CONCLUSIONS: This study enriches our understanding of public concerns over new vaccines or vaccine development at early stages of the outbreak, bearing implications for influencing vaccine attitudes and guiding public health efforts to cope with infectious disease outbreaks in the future. This study concluded that public concerns centered on general policy issues related to coronavirus vaccines and that the discussions were considerably mixed with political views when vaccines were not made available. Only a small proportion of tweets focused on conspiracy theories, but these tweets demonstrated high engagement levels and were often contributed by Twitter users with more influence.","output":"Characterization of Vaccine Tweets During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak in the United States: Topic Modeling Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eleven patient research partners (PRPs) attended the virtual Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2020 Annual Meeting.

RESULTS Four hundred fifty-three pediatric onco-hematologists from 20 countries responded to the first survey, with subsequent surveys response rates above 85%. More than 95% of participants reported that treatment continued without interruption for new and active ongoing patients, though with disruptions in treatment availability. During the first three surveys, respondents reported suspensions of outpatient procedures (54.2%), a decrease in oncologic surgeries (43.6%), radiotherapy (28.4%), stem cell transplants (SCT) (69.3%), and surveillance consultations (81.2%). Logistic regression analysis showed that at the beginning of the first wave, participants from countries with healthcare expenditure below 7% were more likely to report a decrease in outpatient procedures (odds ratio [OR]: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.19-2.8), surgeries (OR: 3, 95% CI: 1.9-4.6) and radiotherapy (OR: 6, 95% CI: 3.5-10.4).

METHODS An Institutional Review Board approved prospective observational pilot study of well newborns. Serum pNF-H and UCHL1 levels were measured on the day following delivery. CrSO2 values along with CFOE values were also measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and pulse oximetry. RESULTS There were 22 subjects, 15 born vaginally and seven born by cesarean section.

DESIGN: We conducted a systematic scoping review of original research articles about milk bank donors published before August 2020. SETTING: Globally. PARTICIPANTS: Donors to milk banks. RESULTS: A total of twenty-eight studies were included across a variety of geographies: the USA (n 8), Brazil (n 7), Spain (n 4), India (n 2), and single studies in France, Norway, Poland, Italy, Taiwan, Korea and China. Study variables were grouped into six main categories: Donor Demographics (n 19), Clinical Characteristics (n 20), Donor Experiences (n 16), Donation Patterns (n 16), Lifestyle Characteristics (n 4) and Lactation/Breast-feeding History (n 8).

Therefore, VLPs are considered as a safe and effective candidate of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. VLPs, with a diameter of approximately 20 to 150 nm, also have the characteristics of nanometer materials, such as large surface area, surface-accessible amino acids with reactive moieties (e.g., lysine and glutamic acid residues), inerratic spatial structure, and good biocompatibility. Therefore, assembled VLPs have great potential as a delivery system for specifically carrying a variety of materials. This review summarized recent researches on VLP development as vaccines and biological vehicles, which demonstrated the advantages and potential of VLPs in disease control and prevention and diagnosis. Then, the prospect of VLP biology application in the future is discussed as well.","output":"The application of virus-like particles as vaccines and biological vehicles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ?1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (?1 PRF) mechanism utilized by many viruses is dependent on a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream secondary structure element.

Such opinions can be analyzed to determine social trends and devise policies to increase vaccination acceptance. In this regard, this study proposes a methodology for analyzing the global perceptions and perspectives towards COVID-19 vaccination using a worldwide Twitter dataset. The study relies on two techniques to analyze the sentiments: natural language processing and machine learning. To evaluate the performance of the different lexicon-based methods, different machine and deep learning models are studied. In addition, for sentiment classification, the proposed ensemble model named long short-term memory-gated recurrent neural network (LSTM-GRNN) is a combination of LSTM, gated recurrent unit, and recurrent neural networks. Results suggest that the TextBlob shows better results as compared to VADER and AFINN.

Current CF treatment strategies are focused on targeted drug delivery to the lungs. Novel inhalable drug therapies require an in vitro CF model that appropriately mimics the in vivo CF lung environment to better understand drug delivery and transport across the CF epithelium, and predict drug therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, the aim of this research was to determine the appropriate air-liquid interface (ALI) culture method of the CuFi-1 (CF cell line) compared to the NuLi-1 (healthy cell line) cells to be used as in vitro models of CF airway epithelia. Furthermore, drug transport on both CuFi-1 and NuLi-1 was investigated to determine whether these cell lines could be used to study transport of drugs used in CF treatment using Ibuprofen (the only anti-inflammatory drug currently approved for CF) as a model drug. Differentiating characteristics specific to airway epithelia such as mucus production, inflammatory response and tight junction formation at two seeding densities (Low and High) were assessed throughout an 8-week ALI culture period. This study demonstrated that both the NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines fully differentiate in ALI culture with significant mucus secretion, IL-6 and IL-8 production, and functional tight junctions at week 8. Additionally, the High seeding density was found to alter the phenotype of the NuLi-1 cell line. For the first time, this study identifies that ibuprofen is transported via the paracellular pathway in ALI models of NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cell lines.

The aim of this study is to use the literature, researcher, and stakeholder opinion to explicate potential interventions for improving HH compliance in the ICU, and provide an indication of the suitability of these interventions. Methods: A four-phase co-design study was designed. First, data from a previously completed systematic literature review was used in order to identify unique components of existing interventions to improve HH in ICUs. Second, a workshop was held with a panel of 10 experts to identify additional intervention components. Third, the 91 intervention components resulting from the literature review and workshop were synthesised into a final list of 21 hand hygiene interventions. Finally, the affordability, practicability, effectiveness, acceptability, side-effects/safety, and equity of each intervention was rated by 39 stakeholders (health services researchers, ICU staff, and the public). Results: Ensuring the availability of essential supplies for HH compliance was the intervention that received most approval from stakeholders. Interventions involving role models and peer-to-peer accountability and support were also well regarded by stakeholders. Education/training interventions were commonplace and popular. Punitive interventions were poorly regarded. Conclusions: Hospitals and regulators must make decisions regarding how to improve HH compliance in the absence of scientific consensus on effective methods.

We surveyed 1556 Chinese people in April 2020 (757 people in Hubei Province, the pandemic epicenter in China, and 799 in other regions of China where the pandemic is relatively not severe). A multiple-group structural equation modeling analysis found significant total effects between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic in both regional groups, and the effect between them was mainly achieved through the mediating roles of sense of control and powerlessness during the pandemic. For all participants, negative coping strategies significantly aggravated the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressive tendencies during the pandemic, but the buffers were different across regions of outbreak severity. For participants in other regions where the pandemic is relatively not severe, positive coping strategies could mitigate the association between perceived threat of COVID-19 and aggressions. However, for participants in Hubei Province, the epicenter of Chinas pandemic, higher life satisfaction was more effective in buffering. These findings extend the possible consequences of the perceived COVID-19 threat and suggest that improving the life satisfaction of residents in areas with severe outbreaks is more effective in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19.

Workplace regulations prohibit beards with N95 respirators, but there is little information on the effect of beards with face masks worn by the public for protection against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We examined the fitted filtration efficiency (FFE) of five commonly worn protective face masks as a function of beard length following the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration Quantitative Fit Test: N95 (respirator), KF94 and KN95, surgical/procedure, and cloth masks. A comparison using N95 respirators was carried out in shaven and bearded men. A detailed examination was conducted for beard lengths between 0 and 10 mm (0.5 mm increments). The effect of an exercise band covering the beard on FFE was also tested. Although N95 respirators showed considerable variability among bearded men, they had the highest FFE for beard lengths up to 10 mm. KF94 and KN95 masks lost up to 40% of their FFE. Procedure and cotton masks had poor performance even on bare skin (10-30% FFE) that did not change appreciably with beard length. Marked performance improvements were observed with an exercise band worn over the beard. CONCLUSIONS: Though variable, N95 respirators offer the best respiratory protection for bearded men.

METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective observational study enrolling consecutive adult COVID-19 patients. On arrival to emergency department, blood samples were collected for laboratory tests, including serum calprotectin. The primary outcome was severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and the secondary outcome was need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. RESULTS: Study population included 395 patients, 57 (14.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 100 (25.3%) were admitted to ICU. Median serum calprotectin levels were significantly higher in intubated (3.73 mg/L vs. 2.63 mg/L; p < 0.001) and ICU patients (3.48 mg/L vs. 2.60 mg/L; p = 0.001).

Currently, the gold standard for virus identification is the nasopharyngeal (NP) swab. Saliva samples, however, offer clear, practical, and logistical advantages but due to a lack of collection, transport, and storage solutions, high-throughput saliva-based laboratory tests are difficult to scale up as a screening or diagnostic tool. With this study, we aimed to validate an intralaboratory molecular detection method for SARS-CoV-2 on saliva samples collected in a new storage saline solution, comparing the results to NP swabs to determine the difference in sensitivity between the two tests. METHODS: In this study, 156 patients (cases) and 1005 asymptomatic subjects (controls) were enrolled and tested simultaneously for the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome by RT-PCR on both NP swab and saliva samples. Saliva samples were collected in a preservative and inhibiting saline solution (Biofarma Srl). Internal method validation was performed to standardize the entire workflow for saliva samples. RESULTS: The identification of SARS-CoV-2 conducted on saliva samples showed a clinical sensitivity of 95.1% and specificity of 97.8% compared to NP swabs. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 81% while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.5%. Test concordance was 97.6% (Cohen's Kappa = 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91). The LoD of the test was 5 viral copies for both samples. CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR assays conducted on a stored saliva sample achieved similar performance to those on NP swabs, and this may provide a very effective tool for population screening and diagnosis.

The aim of this review was to report and summarize the available data in the literature concerning the incidence, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Currently, the incidence of CAPA is unclear due to different definitions and diagnostic criteria used among the studies. It was estimated that approximately 8.6% (206/2383) of mechanically ventilated patients were diagnosed with either proven, probable, or putative CAPA. Classical host factors of invasive aspergillosis are rarely recognized in patients with CAPA, who are mainly immunocompetent presenting with comorbidities, while the role of steroids warrants further investigation. Direct epithelial injury and diffuse pulmonary microthrombi in combination with immune dysregulation, hyperinflammatory response, and immunosuppressive treatment may be implicated. Discrimination between two forms of CAPA (i.e., tracheobronchial and parenchymal) is required, whereas radiological signs of aspergillosis are not typically evident in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In previous studies, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group (EORTC/MSG) criteria, a clinical algorithm to diagnose Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in intensive care unit patients (AspICU algorithm), and influenza-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (IAPA) criteria were used for the diagnosis of proven/probable and putative CAPA, as well as the differentiation from colonization, which can be challenging. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most commonly isolated pathogen in respiratory cultures. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum galactomannan (GM), beta-d-glucan (with limited specificity), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Aspergillus-specific lateral-flow device test can be included in the diagnostic work-up; however, these approaches are characterized by low sensitivity.

The developed nanocomposite was characterized through the infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analyses. The ternary nanocomposite coating offers the good mechanical and thermal stability and high extraction efficiency thanks to its large specific surface. A central composite statistical design was used to study the main variables affecting the extraction efficiency. Afterwards, to study the relationship between different input and output variables as well as to identify the optimal operating conditions, response surface methodology was used, whereby a second-order polynomial equation was fit to the experimental data. The optimized extraction conditions were as follows: temperature, 70C; extraction time, 15 min; and concentration of NaCl, 5%w/v. Detection limit of 0.12 ng mL-1 was obtained at the optimized extraction conditions, and the calibration plot was linear in the concentration range of 0.30-200 ng mL-1 .

In March 2020, the German government passed the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act that guaranteed compensation payments for these limitations. In this study the regional impact of this intervention were analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The performance data and revenue figures for the departments of general and visceral surgery of the University Hospital of Erlangen (UKER) and the District Hospital St. Anna H?chstadt/Aisch (KKH) during the period from 1 April to 30 June 2019 were compared with the respective period in 2020. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in bed occupancy rates and case numbers of inpatient treatment. The latter declined by 20.06% in the UKER and 60.76% in the KKH. Nononcological elective surgery was reduced by 33.04% in the UKER and 60.87% in the KKH. The number of emergency procedures remained unchanged in the UKER, while they decreased by 51.58% in the KKH. The revenues from diagnosis-related groups (DRG) decreased by 22.12% (UKER) and 54% (KKH), respectively. After taking compensation payments and savings from variable material costs into account, the UKER recorded a loss of -3.87%, while there was a positive revenue effect of 6.5% in the KKH. DISCUSSION: The nonselective restriction of elective surgery had a significant impact on patient care and revenue figures at both locations. With respect to the increase of intensive care capacities, such untargeted measures do not appear to be efficient. In addition, the fixed rate of compensation payments led to an unbalanced distribution of the financial aid between the two departments.","output":"[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in general and visceral surgery : A comparison of performance and revenue data from two departments of hospitals with different levels of referral]./ ?konomische Auswirkung der COVID-19-Pandemie in der Allgemein- und Viszeralchirurgie : Ein Vergleich von Leistungs- und Erl?sdaten zweier Kliniken aus Krankenh?usern unterschiedlicher Versorgungsstufen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute and critical limb ischemia post significant rates of morbidity and death, and need to be promptly recognized and treated to avoid amputation.

OBJECTIVES: We examine outcomes in critically ill individuals with COVID\\\\19 who develop atrial tachyarrhythmias. METHODS: We collected data from electrocardiograms and the electronic medical record of COVID\\\\19 positive (COVID(+)) and negative (COVID(?)) individuals admitted to our medical intensive care unit between February 29 and June 28, 2020. We compared clinical and demographic characteristics, new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia, hemodynamic compromise following atrial tachyarrhythmia, and in\\\\hospital mortality in COVID(+) versus COVID(?). Hemodynamic compromise was defined as having a new or increased vasopressor requirement or the need for direct current cardioversion for hemodynamic instability within 1 hour of atrial tachyarrhythmia onset. RESULTS: Of 300 individuals included, 200 were COVID(+) and 100 were COVID(?). Mean age was 60  16 years, 180 (60%) were males, and 170 (57%) were African American. New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia occurred in 16% of COVID(+) and 19% of COVID(?) individuals (P = .51). When compared to COVID(?) participants without atrial tachyarrhythmia, COVID(+) individuals with new onset atrial tachyarrhythmia had higher mortality after multivariable adjustment (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.9C13.5). New onset atrial tachyarrhythmia was followed by hemodynamic compromise in 18 COVID(+) but no COVID(?) participants (P = .0001).

This model would assist frontline clinicians in optimizing medical treatment with limited resources. METHODS: 6415 patients from seven hospitals in Wuhan city were assigned to the training and testing cohorts. A total of 6351 patients from another three hospitals in Wuhan, 2169 patients from outside of Wuhan, and 553 patients from Milan, Italy were assigned to three independent validation cohorts. A total of 64 candidate clinical variables at hospital admission were analyzed by random forest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analyses. RESULTS: Eight factors, namely, Oxygen saturation, blood Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate, admission before the date the national Maximum number of daily new cases was reached, Age, Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and absolute Neutrophil counts, were identified as having significant associations with mortality in COVID-19 patients. A composite score based on these eight risk factors, termed the OURMAPCN-score, predicted the risk of mortality among the COVID-19 patients, with a C-statistic of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.90C0.93). The hazard ratio for all-cause mortality between patients with OURMAPCN-score >11 compared with those with scores  11 was 18.18 (95% CI 13.93C23.71; p < .0001).

METHODS: This study performed three-dimensional perineal ultrasound scanning of the anal sphincter complex of 157 primiparas 42 days after delivery. Among them, 77 were in caesarean delivery (spontaneous delivery group) and 80 were in caesarean section (caesarean delivery group) from September 2018 to December 2020 in our hospital. The thickness of the end plane, the middle plane, the distal plane and the distal plane of the external anal sphincter at 3, 6, 9, 12 oclock direction, and measure the thickness of the central plane of the pubic rectum muscle at 4, 8 oclock direction. At the same time, the study used tomography and volume contrast imaging to observe the morphology and integrity of the anal sphincter complex. RESULTS: The thickness of the distal anal sphincter at the 12 oclock direction, the proximal anal sphincter at 6, 12 oclock, and the central plane at 9 and 12 oclock in the obstetric group were smaller than those in the caesarean section group (all P < 0.05).

CONCLUSION: The delivery method has a certain influence on the shape of the anal sphincter complex. The thickness of the internal and external anal sphincter of the primiparous women in a certain direction is significantly smaller than that of caesarean section. Transperineally three-dimensional ultrasound can clearly show the morphological characteristics and integrity of the anal sphincter complex, and diagnose the defect of the anal sphincter complex.","output":"The effect of vaginal delivery and Caesarean section on the anal Sphincter complex of Primipara based on optimized three-dimensional ultrasound image and nuclear regression Reconstruction Algorithm"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this case is to illustrate the(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography findings of a patient who was admitted in AIIMS, Raipur, for the preoperative evaluation of Marjolin ulcer and was later diagnosed with COVID-19 infection.

This article summarizes the research findings published in 2020/2021, focusing on safety aspects, factors influencing treatment efficacy and patient-reported outcomes. With herpes zoster, facial nerve palsy and psoriasis, several adverse events were investigated that were either reported as a safety signal from clinical trials or through the EudraVigilance database or occurred as a paradoxical reaction under drug treatment. For these events, the influence of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment was analyzed. In the publication on herpes zoster, we also considered drug treatment with Janus kinase inhibitors. Severe overweight can influence the success of treatment. There are gender-specific differences and the mode of action of a treatment also determines whether obesity reduces the response to treatment. The majority of patients observed in RABBIT were satisfied with the treatment they have received after 1 year. We were able to show which factors either favor or negatively influence satisfaction with the effectiveness and safety of the treatment.

This paper describes the results of a survey of neuropsychology trainee (graduate student through postdoctoral resident) perspectives on the COVID-19 pandemic and compares them to a previous survey conducted in Spring 2020. METHOD The survey used several questions from the 2020 survey and added applicable new questions based on the results of the 2020 survey. The survey was distributed to listservs, training directors, and student organizations in neuropsychology with snowball sampling used. RESULTS Respondents were primarily female (82.4%) and white (63%). The majority of trainees (66%) reported loss of clinical hours. Interestingly, the average training time missed was approximately 3.36 weeks (SD = 9.27). Trainees continue to report that they have experienced increased anxiety, depression, and stress since the beginning of the pandemic; however, compared to a prior survey, rates of increased anxiety/stress remained stable, but more trainees reported increased depression. Approximately 31% of trainees reported that they were differentially impacted by the pandemic due to racial/ethnic background and female trainees were more likely to report increased personal stress, anxiety and depression than their male counterparts. CONCLUSIONS Results suggest continued wide-reaching pandemic related impacts on neuropsychology trainees. For example, trainees continue to be concerned about the impact of lost clinical hours on their professional futures. The most notable of the personal impacts included increased rates of mental health concerns and differential impacts on trainees from ethnoracial minority communities.

The global scientific community has responded rapidly to understand immune correlates of protection to develop vaccines and immunotherapeutics against the virus. The major goal of this mini review is to summarize current understanding of the structural landscape of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) glycoprotein. The RBD plays a critical role in the very first step of the virus life cycle. Better understanding of where and how nAbs bind the RBD should enable identification of sites of vulnerability and facilitate better vaccine design and formulation of immunotherapeutics. Towards this goal, we compiled 38 RBD-binding nAbs with known structures. Review of these nAb structures showed that (1) nAbs can be divided into five general clusters, (2) there are distinct non-neutralizing faces on the RBD, and (3) maximum of potentially four nAbs could bind the RBD simultaneously. Since most of these nAbs were isolated from virus-infected patients, additional analyses of vaccine-induced nAbs could facilitate development of improved vaccines.","output":"A Structural Landscape of Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During the Covid-19 pandemic, the negative effects of wearing a mouth-nose cover (MNC) on interpersonal functioning have been discussed in public media but empirical studies on how wearing MNCs affect social judgements are sparse. In the present study, we investigated the effects of MNCs on trustworthiness appraisals, the influence of changes due to MNCs in evaluating joy, and the relationship between a social-cognitive appraisal bias and a participants characteristics. METHODS: All participants (N = 165) judged the intensity of happiness and trustworthiness in calm facial stimuli presented with and without a surgical mask covering part of the face. We analysed the relationship of changes in judgements evoked by MNCs to participants evaluations of MNCs as protective tools and explored their associations with the burden experienced by wearing MNCs, compliance to behaviour recommendations, their risk associated with the pandemic, and their levels of psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, calm facial stimuli covered with MNCs were evaluated as less trustworthy and, to an even stronger extent, less happy than uncovered facial stimuli. However, participants varied in whether they showed a negative or positive evaluation of faces with MNCs; the negative bias was stronger in those participants who attributed lower protective potential to MNCs, experienced a higher burden while wearing MNCs, wore MNCs less often, and experienced a higher level of psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: A negative bias in trustworthiness appraisals of faces with a positive emotional expression covered by MNCs is linked to a participants evaluation of MNCs as inefficient and burdening and their experience of high psychological distress.","output":"Trustworthiness appraisals of faces wearing a surgical mask during the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany: An experimental study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study was performed to investigate published literature about the association between measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and COVID-19.

Although facilities are required to have infection control staff, only 3% of designated infection preventionists have taken a basic infection control course prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most research has focused on infection control in the acute care setting. However, little is known about the implementation of infection control practices and effective interventions in nursing homes. This study utilizes Project ECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes), an evidence-based telementoring model, to connect Penn State University subject matter experts with nursing home staff and administrators to proactively support evidence-based infection control guideline implementation. OBJECTIVE: Our study seeks to answer the research question of how evidence-based infection control guidelines can be implemented effectively in nursing homes, including comparing the effectiveness of two ECHO-delivered training interventions on key patient-centered outcomes such as reducing the number of residents with a COVID-19 diagnosis. METHODS: A stratified cluster randomized design was utilized. Using a 1:1 ratio, we randomly assigned 136 nursing homes to ECHO or ECHO Plus arms. Randomization was stratified by geographic location, baseline COVID-19 infection rate, and facility capacity. The study had two phases. In phase one, completed in July 2021, nursing homes in both study arms received a 16-week infectious disease and quality improvement training intervention via real-time, interactive videoconferencing and the ECHO learning model. Phase one sessions were up to 90 minutes in duration. In phase two, completed in November 2021, the ECHO group was offered optional 60-minute office hours for 9 weeks and the ECHO Plus group received 9 weeks of 60-minute sessions on emerging topics and an additional 8-session refresher series on infection control. RESULTS: A total of 290 nursing home facilities were assessed for eligibility, with 136 nursing homes recruited and randomly assigned to ECHO or ECHO Plus. Guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, we will simultaneously evaluate the studys effectiveness and implementation outcomes at baseline (intervention start date), and at 4, 6, 12, and 18 months. The primary outcome is the COVID-19 infection rate in nursing homes. Secondary outcomes include COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths, flu-like illness, and quality of life. Surveys and interviews with participants will also provide data as to the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of best practices taught throughout ECHO sessions. CONCLUSIONS: A multipronged approach to improving infection control and emergency preparedness in nursing homes is important, given the toll that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken on residents and staff. The ECHO model has significant strengths when compared to traditional training, as it allows for remote learning delivered by a multidisciplinary team of experts, and utilizes case discussions that match the context and capacity of nursing homes.

By processing, abstracting and aggregating information from these resources into drug set libraries, knowledge about novel properties of drugs and small molecules can be systematically imputed with machine learning. In addition, drug set libraries can be used as the underlying database for drug set enrichment analysis.

Collecting high-quality post-mortem tissue has advanced research through cell line generation and genomic analyses. Unfortunately, some autopsy programs temporarily shut down during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed autopsies of four patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) who underwent limited brain post-mortem examination at Weill Cornell Medicine College (WCMC) from June 2020 to June 2021. We collected patient demographics; DNR status; time of death and procedure; restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic; and results of the tissue analysis. Each case presented unique challenges and the timing of securing parental consent varied. RESULTS: Three of four specimens were processed within 12 hours of the time of death. Two Spanish-speaking families required interpreters services to obtain consent. In all cases tumor aliquots were flash frozen for further study. All specimens contained viable tumor and cell line generation was successful in one case. All families/caregivers expressed gratitude for the opportunity to participate and for the handling of the procedures. DISCUSSION: Despite the sensitive nature of these cases, clinicians should offer the option of a rapid autopsy to caregivers of pediatric patients based on the scientific need and the positive effect it has on grieving families.

This study explores the forms and outcomes of coronavirus and COVID-19-related social stigma and the experiences of people who were home quarantined or isolated in Finland during the spring 2020. The findings of this study can be used to improve support for those quarantined or isolated and to develop strategies to reduce the stigma associated with coronavirus and COVID-19. METHODS: The study is based on qualitative one-to-one interviews with households with at least two members and at least one PCR confirmed COVID-19 case. Recruitment took place via website or SMS messages sent to PCR confirmed cases in the capital area of Helsinki. Sampling was based on maximum variation to acquire different types of respondents. The framework of health stigma was used to develop question guides and analyze stigma. Quarantine and isolation experiences were explored through open-ended questions. The analysis was based on thematic analysis. RESULTS: The study included 64 participants from 24 households. Perceived stigma among respondents was driven by fear and blame for infection, and it manifested in various ways leading to a reluctance to disclose their coronavirus status to others. Self-stigma developed from conflicting information and advice about coronavirus and COVID-19 led to difficulties interacting with others outside of the house and reluctance to meet people after quarantine and isolation. Quarantine and isolation experiences included uncertainty, health concerns, and boredom. Communication with others in similar situations was perceived vital, whereas discussions with family members about worries and fears related to coronavirus and COVID-19 was not preferred. CONCLUSIONS: This study shed light on the lives of those quarantined or isolated at home and provided a set of operational recommendations to minimize coronavirus and COVID-19-associated stigma and to reduce challenges faced by those in quarantine or isolation.","output":"Learning about COVID-19-related stigma, quarantine and isolation experiences in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dynamic data-driven simulation (incorporates real-time measurement data to improve simulation models during model run-time.

The results show that the estimation accuracy in DA is more constrained by the choice of time intervals than the number of particles.

CRISPR-based detection technologies have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. METHODS: We developed ENHANCEv2 that is composed of a chimeric guide RNA, a modified LbCas12a enzyme, and a dual reporter construct to improve the previously reported ENHANCE system. We validated both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 using 62 nasopharyngeal swabs and compared the results to RT-qPCR. We created a lyophilized version of ENHANCEv2 and characterized its detection capability and stability. RESULTS: Here we demonstrate that when coupled with an RT-LAMP step, ENHANCE detects COVID-19 samples down to a few copies with 95% accuracy while maintaining a high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentrations (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Our clinical validation results for both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 show 60/62 (96.7%) sample agreement with RT-qPCR results while only using 5 L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. We show that the lateral flow assay using paper-based strips displays 100% agreement with the fluorescence-based reporter assay during clinical validation. Finally, we demonstrate that a lyophilized version of ENHANCEv2 shows high sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2 detection while reducing the CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes while maintaining its detection capability for several weeks upon storage at room temperature. CONCLUSIONS: CRISPR-based diagnostic platforms offer many advantages as compared to conventional qPCR-based detection methods.

This in vitro study will serve as the foundation for development of novel anti-SARS therapeutics. METHODS 48 siRNA sequences were designed for targeting regions throughout entire SARS-CoV genome RNA including open-reading frames for several key proteins. Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes were transfected into foetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells prior to or after SARS-CoV infection. The inhibitory effects of the siRNAs were evaluated for reductions of intracellular viral genome copy number and viral titres in the cell culture medium measured by Q-RT-PCR and CPE-based titration, respectively. Four siRNA duplexes were found to achieve potent inhibition of SARS-CoV infection and replication. A prolonged prophylactic effect of siRNA duplexes with up to 90% inhibition that lasted for at least 72 h was observed. Combination of active siRNA duplexes targeting different regions of the viral genome resulted in therapeutic activity of up to 80% inhibition. CONCLUSION Chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes targeting SARS-CoV genomic RNA are potent agents for inhibition of the viral infection and replication.

METHODS Adults with virologically-documented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a convalescent plasma donor screening program were tested for serum IgG to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain, nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb. RESULTS Amongst 250 consecutive persons studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 243/250 (97%) were seropositive on one or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers 1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titer included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03/year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during acute illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96).

Specialty training is often required to master the nuances of these approaches. This study aimed to create a reproducible transanal excision training model that is suited for laparoendoscopic techniques. METHODS Frozen porcine rectum and anus with intact perianal skin were commercially obtained. Thawed specimens were then cut to approximately 20 cm in length. The proximal end of the rectum was then everted and suction applied to the mucosa to create pseudopolyps of various sizes (sessile and pedunculated). Larger pedunculated lesions were made by tying the base of the pseudopolyps with 5-0 monofilament sutures to gather more tissue. Methylene blue dye was injected submucosally into the lesions to simulate tattoos. The proximal rectum was then closed with sutures. The model was suspended in a trainer box by clamping the distal end in a ringed clamp and the proximal end to the box. Transanal excisions using TAMIS were then performed. The procedures were done by trained community colorectal surgeons attending courses on transanal minimally invasive surgery. RESULTS Both partial- and full-thickness excisions of sessile and pedunculated rectal lesions were successfully performed during simulated TAMIS by trained community surgeons learning this laparoendoscopic technique. CONCLUSION Transanal laparoendoscopic procedures to excise rectal tumors can be successfully and reproducibly performed in an ex vivo porcine anorectal model.","output":"A reproducible ex vivo model for transanal minimally invasive surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: the purpose of this study was to assess the orthopaedic surgeons' perceptions and attitudes on COVID-19 related changes in their practice. Methods: an online survey was shared with orthopaedic surgeons practicing in different countries. Results: this study showed that orthopaedic surgery plan management was adapted to respond more effectively to the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining the continuity of health care and ensuring protection of medical staff and patients. Among the introduced measures, elective surgery was postponed to free-up beds for suspected or COVID-19 positive patients requiring hospitalization. Additionally, the number of outpatient visits was considerably decreased and non-urgent visits were postponed to reduce the flow of patients in and out of hospitals and therefore minimize the risk of contamination. Interestingly, data revealed the willingness of orthopaedic surgeons to take care of COVID-19 positive patients and support their colleagues in intensive care units, if needed. Conclusion: orthopaedic surgery departments have adapted their programs to face the unprecedented challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Quick measures were taken to reduce the risk of contamination in patients, medical staff and to allow hospitals to free up beds for treatment of patients with positive or suspected COVID-19.","output":"Orthopaedic surgeons' perceptions and attitudes on COVID-19 related changes in practice: an international cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To enhance thermal stability of ready-to-eat sea cucumbers (RSC), gallic acid (GA) and chlorogenic acid (CA) were employed.

NLR may be used as an early marker of poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Observational studies that reported the association between baseline NLR values (i.e. at hospital admission) and severity or all-cause mortality in COVID-19 patients were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Random effects models and inverse variance method were used for meta-analyses. The effects were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Small study effects were assessed with the Eggers test. Results: Twenty studies, 19 cohorts and one case-control were included. An increase of one unit of NLR was associated with a higher odds of COVID-19 severity (OR 6.6, 95% CI: 4.71 - 7.19;p<0.001) and higher odds of all-cause mortality (OR 12.7, 95% CI: 1.32, 123.36;p=0.025). No differences were found in subgroup analyses by study design. The subgroup analysis of the studies, by country of origin, showed that the strength of the association between NLR and mortality was greater in Chinese studies (OR 31.1;95%CI 19.57 to 49.3;p<0.0001) with moderate heterogeneity (I2 =43%). In our sensitivity analysis, we found that 7 studies with low risk of bias maintained strong association between both outcomes and the NLR values (severity: OR 4.7;95% CI 3.5 to 6.34;p < 0.001 vs mortality: OR 31.1;95% CI 19.57 to 49.3;p <0.0001), with low (I2 = 37%) and moderate (I2 = 43%) heterogeneity for severity and mortality outcomes, respectively.

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to both the public health and the durability of our health care systems and will profoundly affect the field of plastic and reconstructive surgery. The objective of this article is to provide a natural history of COVID-19-including virology, epidemiology, and transmission patterns-and a guide for plastic surgeons regarding patient and resource management. METHODS: The authors reviewed existing literature regarding COVID-19, both primary research and secondary reviews, by means of PubMed queries, and recommendations from relevant professional organizations (e.g., American College of Surgeons and American Society of Plastic Surgeons). The literature and recommendations were summarized to provide a specific guide for plastic surgeons. RESULTS: Internationally, over 5.7 million cases and 357,000 deaths from COVID-19 have been reported at the time of writing. No pharmacologic treatments have been identified, but epidemiologic strategies were identified to prevent viral spread, preserve health care resources, and protect patients and surgeons globally. Specific recommendations for plastic and reconstructive surgeons include postponing elective cases and transitioning to telecommunication platforms for patient consultations and education. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 represents a nearly unprecedented threat to the public health and the durability of health care systems in the contemporary era. Although plastic and reconstructive surgery may seem relatively remote from the pandemic in direct patient care and exposure, our field can significantly enhance health care resource management.","output":"Slowing the Spread and Minimizing the Impact of COVID-19: Lessons from the Past and Recommendations for the Plastic Surgeon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to develop a scale to assess social distance attitudes related to COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an online national survey of US adults (n = 1,074) to assess social distance attitudes, COVID-19 related beliefs and behaviors, and demographics. We assessed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis and evaluated internal consistency and validity. We assessed association of scale factors with respondent characteristics. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a hypothesized two-factor solution. Internal consistency was high for both positive (Alpha = 0.92) and negative (Alpha = 0.91) attitude factors. Analyses supported construct and predictive validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity.

Yet they often fail to produce realistic stance knee and ankle mechanics. While the influence of the performance criterion on the predicted walking pattern has been previously studied, the influence of musculoskeletal mechanics has been less explored. Here, we investigated the influence of two mechanical assumptions on the predicted walking pattern: the complexity of the foot model and the stiffness of the Achilles tendon. We found, through three-dimensional muscle-driven predictive simulations of walking, that modeling the toes, and thus using two-segment instead of single-segment foot models, contributed to robustly eliciting physiological stance knee flexion angles, knee extension torques, and knee extensor activity. Modeling toes also slightly decreased the first vertical ground reaction force peak, increasing its agreement with experimental data, and improved stance ankle kinetics. It nevertheless slightly worsened predictions of ankle kinematics. Decreasing Achilles tendon stiffness improved the realism of ankle kinematics, but there remain large discrepancies with experimental data. Overall, this simulation study shows that not only the performance criterion but also mechanical assumptions affect predictive simulations of walking. Improving the realism of predictive simulations is required for their application in clinical contexts. Here, we suggest that using more complex foot models might contribute to such realism.","output":"Modeling toes contributes to realistic stance knee mechanics in three-dimensional predictive simulations of walking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article aims to assess the impact of copper availability on the energy transition and to determine whether copper could become critical due to the high copper content of low-carbon technologies compared to conventional technologies In assessing copper availability through to 2050, we rely on our linear programming world energy-transport model, TIAM-IFPEN We examine two climate scenarios (2 C and 4 C) with two mobility shape, implemented with a recycling chain The penetration of low-carbon technologies in the transport and energy sectors (electric vehicles and low-carbon power generation technologies) is likely to significantly increase copper demand by 2050 To investigate how tension over copper resources can be reduced in the energy transition context, we consider two public policy drivers: sustainable mobility and recycling practices Results show that in the most stringent scenario, the cumulative primary copper demand between 2010 and 2050 is found to be 89 4% of the copper resources known in 2010 They also pinpoint the importance of China and Chile in the future evolution of the copper market","output":"Copper at the crossroads: Assessment of the interactions between low-carbon energy transition and supply limitations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by the intense formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), leading to the occlusion of microvessels, as shown in pulmonary samples. The occurrence of ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a serious cardiac manifestation of COVID-19; the intrinsic mechanism of coronary thrombosis appears to still be unknown. Objective: To determine the role of NETs in coronary thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a consecutive series of patients with COVID-19 at an academic tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain, who underwent primary coronary interventions for STEMI in which coronary aspirates were obtained in the catheterization laboratory using a thrombus aspiration device. Patients with COVID-19 who experienced a STEMI between March 23 and April 11, 2020, from whom coronary thrombus samples were aspirated during primary coronary intervention, were included in the analysis. These patients were compared with a series conducted from July 2015 to December 2015 of patients with STEMI. Main Outcomes and Measures: The presence and quantity of NETs in coronary aspirates from patients with STEMI and COVID-19. The method for the analysis of NETs in paraffin-embedded coronary thrombi was based on the use of confocal microscopy technology and image analysis for the colocalization of myeloperoxidase-DNA complexes and citrullinated histone H3. Immunohistochemical analysis of thrombi was also performed. Clinical and angiographic variables were prospectively collected. Results: Five patients with COVID-19 were included (4 men [80%]; mean [SD] age, 62 [14] years); the comparison group included 50 patients (44 males [88%]; mean [SD] age, 58 [12] years). NETs were detected in the samples of all 5 patients with COVID-19, and the median density of NETs was 61% (95% CI, 43%-91%). In the historical series of patients with STEMI, NETs were found in 34 of 50 thrombi (68%), and the median NET density was 19% (95% CI, 13%-22%; P < .001). All thrombi from patients with COVID-19 were composed of fibrin and polymorphonuclear cells. None of them showed fragments of atherosclerotic plaque or iron deposits indicative of previous episodes of plaque rupture. Conclusions and Relevance: In this small case series of patients with COVID-19 and myocardial infarction, NETs seem to play a major role in the pathogenesis of STEMI in COVID-19 disease. Our findings support the idea that targeting intravascular NETs might be a relevant goal of treatment and a feasible way to prevent coronary thrombosis in patients with severe COVID-19 disease.","output":"Assessment of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in Coronary Thrombus of a Case Series of Patients With COVID-19 and Myocardial Infarction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report a distinct difference in the interactions of the glycans of the host-cell receptor, ACE2, with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S-protein receptor-binding domains (RBDs).

We hypothesize, that the intermittent bursts of high NO concentration in cigarette smoke may be a mechanism in protecting against the virus. Mainstream smoke from cigarettes contains NO at peak concentrations of between about 250 ppm and 1350 ppm in each puff as compared to medicinal use of no more than 80 to a maximum of 160 ppm. The diffusion of NO through the cell wall to reach the virus should be significantly more effective at the very high NO concentration in the smoke, according to classic laws of physics. The only oxide of nitrogen in the mainstream smoke is NO, and the NO2 concentration that is inhaled is very low or undetectable, and methemoglobin levels are lower in smokers than non-smokers, reasonably explained by the breaths of air in between the puffs that wash out the NO.

First, virologists focused on the most abundant internal mRNA modification, m(6)A, mapping this modification and elucidating its effects on the RNA of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses.

METHODS: A lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-based antiviral treatment was administered to the patients with computed tomography (CT)-documented pneumonia. Medical records of patients with COVID-19, previously discharged or hospitalized for  21 days at the Seoul Medical Center from January 29 to April 15, 2020 were reviewed to analyze clinical and virological outcomes. Patients were divided into two groups (PCR-Negative conversion group vs. Non-negative conversion group and requiring oxygen group vs. Non-requiring oxygen group). RESULTS: In total, 136 patients with a mean age of 41.8  18.2 years were included with median 3-day delay of hospitalization after illness. Thirteen (9.56%) were initially asymptomatic, and 5 (3.67%) were persistently asymptomatic. Eighty-five (62.5%) had CT-documented pneumonia, 94% of whom received LPV/r treatments. A total of 53 patients (38.97%) had negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results within 28 days. Eight (9.4%) out of 85 pneumonic patients received oxygen supplementation. Patients with initial lower respiratory symptoms showed significant delay in PCR negative conversion (> 28 days) (odds ratio [OR] 0.166; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.067C0.477; P < 0.001). However, antiviral treatment for pneumonic patients was significantly related with early conversion within 28 days (OR 3.049; 95% CI 1.128C8.243; P = 0.028). Increasing age increased the likelihood of oxygen supplementation requirement in the pneumonic patient group (OR 1.108; 95% CI 1.021C1.202; P = 0.014).

However, the underlying physiological mechanisms suggested to improve cognitive function from physical activity and the frequency, intensity, and duration of the breaks remain unknown. This study will investigate the effects of frequent, short physical activity breaks during prolonged sitting on task-related prefrontal cerebral blood flow, cognitive performance, and psychological factors. Additionally, the moderating and mediating effects of arterial stiffness on changes in cerebral blood flow will be tested. METHODS: This is a protocol for a randomized crossover study that will recruit 16 adolescents (13C14 years old). Participants will undergo three different conditions in a randomized order, on three separate days, involving sitting 80 min with a different type of break every 17 min for 3 min. The breaks will consist of (1) seated social breaks, (2) simple resistance activities, and (3) step-up activities. Before and after the 80-min conditions, prefrontal cerebral blood flow changes will be measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (primary outcome), while performing working memory tasks (1-, 2-, and 3-back tests). Arterial stiffness (augmentation index and pulse wave velocity) and psychological factors will also be assessed pre and post the 80-min interventions. DISCUSSION: Publication of this protocol will help to increase rigor in science. The results will inform regarding the underlying mechanisms driving the association between physical activity breaks and cognitive performance. This information can be used for designing effective and feasible interventions to be implemented in schools. TRIAL REGISTRATION: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04552626.

METHODS: A survey was distributed to all 542 registered dentists in Nova Scotia, asking about dental care provision during 19-25 April 2020. Most answers were categorical, and descriptive analyses of these were performed. Data from the 1 open-ended question were analyzed using an inductive approach to identify themes. RESULTS: The response rate was 43% (n = 235). Most dentists (181) provided care but only 13 provided in-person care. From the open-ended question, 4 concerns emerged: communication from the regulatory authority;respondents' health and that of their staff;the health of and access to care for patients;and the future of their business. CONCLUSION: Most respondents remained engaged in non-in-person dental care using various modes. They expressed concerns about their health and that of their staff and patients as well as about the future of their practice.

A conditional process model was then proposed for the impact of optimistic bias on self-protection behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of social norms. Statistical analysis demonstrates that optimistic bias has a negative impact on self-protection behaviors through message acceptance. Perceived social norms moderate this relationship in the following ways: (1) The higher the perceptions of social norms, the smaller the negative impact of optimistic bias on message acceptance, and the smaller the positive impact of message acceptance on self-protection behaviors. (2) Within a certain range, the higher the perceptions of social norms, the smaller the negative impact, both direct and indirect, of optimistic bias on self-protection behaviors. (3) The direct and indirect effects of optimistic bias on self-protection behaviors become insignificant when perceptions of social norms are very strong. Comparing the data of the three cities shows that higher risk is associated with a stronger role of social norms in moderating the relationship between optimistic bias and self-protection behaviors. The above results suggest that there may be both internal (optimistic bias) and external (social norms) reference points in individual decision-making regarding health behaviors.

A challenge is that various complex and idiosyncratic concepts relating to art, like emotions and creativity, are not yet well understood. Guided by the principles of speculative design, the current article describes the use of a collaborative prototyping approach involving artists and engineers to explore this design space, especially in regard to general and personalized art-making strategies. This led to identifying a goal: to generate representational or abstract art that connects emotionally with peoples art and shows creativity. For this, an approach involving personalized visual metaphors was proposed, which balances the degree to which a robots art is influenced by interacting persons. The results of a small user study via a survey provided further insight into peoples perceptions: the general design was perceived as intended and appealed; as well, personalization via representational symbols appeared to lead to easier and clearer communication of emotions than via abstract symbols. In closing, the article describes a simplified demo, and discusses future challenges.

Public opinion and the public's compliance with these technologies come into play here. The objective of the present study was to examine attitudes expressed in the public discourse toward the use of digital technologies to control people's behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reflected in the media. METHODS: Qualitative analysis was performed on posts and comments submitted in response to 12 articles that appeared on the four leading Israeli news sites, on three significant occasions: first, upon the announcement of the use of surveillance technologies by the Israeli security agency (ISA); second, upon the announcement of the launch of the Health Ministry's app that tracks contacts with COVID-19 patients; and third, following reports of petitions lodged with Israel's supreme court challenging the use of surveillance technologies. The analysis was performed using ATLAS-Ti software for systematic analysis. RESULTS: A total of 2551 posts and comments referring to these 12 articles were found, 714 of which were relevant to the purpose of the study. The analysis revealed disagreement between those who supported the measures taken and opponents. Supporters regarded contact tracing by means of digital technologies as essential to the effort to protect people during the pandemic, and believed that employing the ISA's capabilities was the correct way to combat the epidemic. Opponents of the measures rejected the use of tracking technologies, regarding this step as a move toward dictatorship and a violation of fundamental civil rights. Some proposed alternative measures that would obviate the use of such tracking. CONCLUSIONS: The primary task of medical practice is to heal illness and alleviate suffering. The debate surrounding the employment of digital technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the complexity of the close connection between social control and care in times of pandemic. The context of this pandemic has highlighted the interrelatedness of advanced digital surveillance technologies, medical care, and social control exercised by authorities and medical regulators and experts, which raises issues of transparency, trust and mistrust among the public. These issues become all the more relevant when the number of patients grows rapidly, the authorities need to deal with the extended ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the country has entered a second lockdown, and the public must be persuaded to comply with highly restrictive regulations.

The specific mental health implications of COVID-19 are still being uncovered, but we know that there are likely to be negative outcomes for many people. This is particularly the case for vulnerable members of the community, such as those with high health anxiety, and under conditions where individuals feel isolated or disconnected from others. The objective of this study was to examine whether the level of socially motivated Internet use acts as a buffer of the relationship between health anxiety, isolation behaviors, and depression. Participants (N = 473; 67.3 percent female; Mage = 23.03, SD = 7.50) from Australia completed self-report measures during the height of the national pandemic restrictions (April-May 2020). A regression analysis revealed positive relationships between health anxiety and isolation behaviors on depression and highlighted a three-way interaction effect. Specifically, health anxiety was significantly negatively associated with depression when participants engaged in fewer isolation behaviors. However, at higher levels of isolation behaviors, the relationship between health anxiety and depression was attenuated for participants with greater levels of online social connection. The findings suggest that online social connection buffered the negative effects of health anxiety under conditions of isolation.

In Canada, with essential activities such as grocery shopping, outdoor exercise and transportation, people need to be able to safely navigate dense, urban spaces while staying at least two metres or six feet apart. This pandemic has exacerbated the health inequities across neighbourhoods in cities like Toronto, Canada which are often segregated along racial and income lines. These inequities impact who has access to urban infrastructure that promotes health and quality of life. Safety in a time of COVID-19 goes beyond just exposure to the virus, it is complicated by notions of who belongs where, and who has access to what resources. The built environment has a role in maintaining and promoting physical and mental health during this pandemic and beyond it. This paper puts forwards three considerations for built environment interventions to promote health equitably: (i) addressing structural determinants of health and embedding anti-racist intersectional principles, (ii) revisiting tactical urbanism as a health promotion tool and (iii) rethinking community engagement processes through equity-based placemaking. This paper outlines four built environment interventions in Toronto, Canada that seek to address the challenges in navigating urban space safely in the short term, including street design that prioritizes pedestrians, protected cycling infrastructure, access to inclusive green space and safe, affordable housing.

Specifically, a nearly two- to five-fold discrepancy in backbone hydrogen bonding is observed between sub-molecules in Protein Data Bank files of the spike glycoprotein yielding two conclusions: mutagenic residues in the receptor-binding subunit of the spike much more frequently do not participate in backbone hydrogen bonds; and a technique of viral escape is therefore to remove such bonds within physico-chemical and functional constraints.

As of April 3, 2020, there were 1,009,625 reported confirmed cases, and 51,737 reported deaths. Doctors have been faced with a myriad of patients who present with many different symptoms. This raises two important questions. What are the common symptoms, and what are their relative importance? METHODS: A non-structured and incomplete COVID-19 dataset of 14,251 confirmed cases was preprocessed. This produced a complete and organized COVID-19 dataset of 738 confirmed cases. Six different feature selection algorithms were then applied to this new dataset. Five of these algorithms have been proposed earlier in the literature. The sixth is a novel algorithm being proposed by the authors, called Variance Based Feature Weighting (VBFW), which not only ranks the symptoms (based on their importance) but also assigns a quantitative importance measure to each symptom. RESULTS: For our COVID-19 dataset, the five different feature selection algorithms provided different rankings for the most important top-five symptoms. They even selected different symptoms for inclusion within the top five. This is because each of the five algorithms ranks the symptoms based on different data characteristics. Each of these algorithms has advantages and disadvantages. However, when all these five rankings were aggregated (using two different aggregating methods) they produced two identical rankings of the five most important COVID-19 symptoms. Starting from the most important to least important, they were: Fever/Cough, Fatigue, Sore Throat, and Shortness of Breath. (Fever and cough were ranked equally in both aggregations.) Meanwhile, the sixth novel Variance Based Feature Weighting algorithm, chose the same top five symptoms, but ranked fever much higher than cough, based on its quantitative importance measures for each of those symptoms (Fever - 75 %, Cough - 39.8 %, Fatigue - 16.5 %, Sore Throat - 10.8 %, and Shortness of Breath - 6.6 %). Moreover, the proposed VBFW method achieved an accuracy of 92.1 % when used to build a one-class SVM model, and an NDCG@5 of 100 %. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the dataset, and the feature selection algorithms employed here, symptoms of Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Sore Throat and Shortness of Breath are important symptoms of COVID-19. The VBFW algorithm also indicates that Fever and Cough symptoms were especially indicative of COVID-19, for the confirmed cases that are documented in our database.","output":"A novel computational method for assigning weights of importance to symptoms of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops, which began on February 24, 2022, caused an unprecedented number of refugees, which in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could increase the number of patients.

Absolute counts are transformed to rates adjusted for population size. RESULTS: Comparing continents, the absolute Gini index shows an unfavorable development in four continents since February 2020. In contrast, the relative Gini as well as the Theil index support the interpretation of less inequality between European countries compared to other continents. Infection fatality rates within the EU as well as within the U.S. express comparable improvement towards more equality (as measured by both Gini indices).

A significant difference in serum vitamin A concentration was found between the captive and wild caught toads (P=0.013) and between the low vitamin A-fed and wild caught toads (P=0.004), when controlling for liver vitamin A concentrations. After captive toads were treated with topical and/or oral vitamin A, their hepatic vitamin A concentrations were similar to those of the wild toads, averaging 48.41  37.03 g/g. However, plasma vitamin A concentrations pre- and post-vitamin A supplementation did not differ statistically. We concluded that plasma vitamin A concentrations do not provide a linear indication of liver/body vitamin A status, and that both topical and oral supplementation with an oil-based vitamin A formulation can increase liver stores in amphibians. No evidence of BSD or other signs of deficiency were noted in the marine toads, although this feeding trial was relatively short (127 days). To date, clinical, pathological and research findings do not support vitamin A deficiency as a primary factor underlying BSD.","output":"Serum and hepatic vitamin A levels in captive and wild marine toads (Bufo marinus)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The establishment of cell culture\\\\derived vaccine production requires the development of appropriate downstream processes.

Use of antimicrobials and alcohol-based hand cleaner were separately regressed against the incidences of HAIs and HA-MRSA infections. Infection incidence was expressed as persons per 1000 patient days (PDs), monthly use of i.v. antibiotics was expressed as defined daily doses per 1000 PDs and monthly alcohol-based hand cleaner use was expressed as bottle per 1000 PDs. Multivariate analysis indicated that use of hand cleaner was associated with reduced incidence of HAIs (P=0.0001) and HA-MRSA infections (P<0.0001). Time-series analysis indicated that increased use of hand cleaner was significantly associated with significant decreases in the incidences of HAIs and HA-MRSA infections. Total antibiotic use had no significant effect on HAIs, but was associated with more HA-MRSA infections. In addition, the use of J01CR01 antibiotics (combinations of penicillins, including -lactamase inhibitors) in particular was correlated with significantly increased incidence of HA-MRSA infections.

The FDA has granted an emergency use authorization for the rheumatoid arthritis treatment drug, baricitinib (Olumiant), for the treatment of COVID-19 in some cases. For this reason, investigators have paid considerable attention to the association between commonly used drugs and the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Aspirin and ibuprofen have been reported to reduce the mortality rate. Omeprazole can increase mortality. In addition, some studies have demonstrated that famotidine diminishes mortality, while others have indicated that famotidine leads to a poorer prognosis. The present study used UK Biobank (UKB) data to assess the association of commonly used drugs with COVID-19 mortality. Data processing was performed on Minerva, a Linux mainframe with Centos 7.6. The UK Biobank Data Parser (ukbb_parser) was used, a python-based package that allows easy interfacing with the large UK Biobank dataset. The results revealed that aspirin and omeprazole were associated with an elevated mortality rate. Ibuprofen-related mortality was lower than laxative-related mortality. Aspirin users were also significantly older than other subjects. The association with mortality of cholesterol-lowering medications, blood pressure-lowering medications, hormone replacement and oral contraceptives in 134 female subjects revealed insignificant variability. The association of nutritional supplements in 238 subjects with mortality indicated that variability was insignificant. The lower mortality linked to the supplementation of vitamin D and vitamin B, presumably B complex, has been previously observed.

SETTING: Two long-term acute care hospitals specialized in weaning from prolonged mechanical ventilation in the Chicagoland area, Illinois, United States. PATIENTS: Adult ( 18 yr old) ICU survivors of respiratory failure caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pneumonia receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, 158 consecutive patients were transferred to the long-term acute care hospitals for weaning from prolonged ventilation. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Final date of follow-up was June 1, 2021. Prior to long-term acute care hospital transfer, median length of stay at the acute care hospital was 41.0 days and median number of ventilator days was 35. Median age was 60.0 years, 34.8% of patients were women, 91.8% had a least one comorbidity, most commonly hypertension (65.8%) and diabetes (53.2%). The percentage of weaning success was 70.9%.

The first is primer-dependent and associated with the 106-kDa non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), whereas the second is catalysed by the 22-kDa nsp8. This latter enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure [i.e. nsp(7+8), consisting of 8 copies of both nsps]. To better understand the implications of these structural characteristics for nsp8-driven RNA synthesis, we studied the prerequisites for the formation of the nsp(7+8) complex and its polymerase activity. We found that in particular the exposure of nsp8's natural N-terminal residue was paramount for both the protein's ability to associate with nsp7 and for boosting its RdRp activity. Moreover, this improved recombinant nsp8 was capable of extending primed RNA templates, a property that had gone unnoticed thus far. The latter activity is, however, 20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12-RdRp at equal monomer concentrations. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved D/ExD/E motifs was employed to identify residues crucial for nsp(7+8) RdRp activity.","output":"The SARS-coronavirus nsp7+nsp8 complex is a unique multimeric RNA polymerase capable of both de novo initiation and primer extension"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Canine coronavirus (CCoV) generally causes an infection with high morbidity and low mortality in dogs In recent years, studies on coronaviruses have gained a momentum due to coronavirus outbreaks Mutations in coronaviruses can result in deadly diseases in new hosts (such as SARS-CoV-2) or cause changes in organ-tissue affinity, as occurred with feline infectious peritonitis virus, exacerbating their pathogenesis In recent studies on different types of CCoV, the pantropic strains characterized by hypervirulent and multi-systemic infections are believed to be emerging, in contrast to classical enteric coronavirus infections In this study, we investigated emerging hypervirulent and multi-systemic CCoV strains using molecular and bioinformatic analysis, and examined differences between enteric and pantropic CCoV strains at the phylogenetic level RT-PCR was performed with specific primers to identify the coronavirus M (membrane) and S (spike) genes, and samples were then subjected to DNA sequencing In phylogenetic analysis, four out of 26 samples were classified as CCoV-1 The remaining 22 samples were all classified as CCoV-2a In the CCoV-2a group, six samples were in branches close to enteric strains, and 16 samples were in the branches close to pantropic strains Enteric and pantropic strains were compared by molecular genotyping of CCoV in dogs Phylogenetic analysis of hypervirulent pantropic strains was carried out at the amino acid and nucleotide sequence levels CCoV was found to be divergent from the original strain This implies that some CCoV strains have become pantropic strains that cause multisystemic infections, and they should not be ruled out as the cause of severe diarrhea and multisystemic infections","output":"Molecular characterization of canine coronaviruses: an enteric and pantropic approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Evolution of polymerase chain reaction testing for infectious pathogens has occurred concurrent with a focus on value-based medicine. OBJECTIVE To determine if implementation of the FilmArray rapid respiratory panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, Utah) (hereafter RRP), with a shorter time to the test result and expanded panel, results in different outcomes for children admitted to the hospital with an acute respiratory tract illness. DESIGN Patient outcomes were compared before implementation of the RRP (November 1, 2011, to January 31, 2012) versus after implementation of the RRP (November 1, 2012, to January 31, 2013). The study included inpatients 3 months or older with an acute respiratory tract illness, most admitted through the emergency department. Testing before RRP implementation used batched polymerase chain reaction analysis for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A and B, with additional testing for parainfluenza 1 through 3 in approximately 11% of patients and for human metapneumovirus in less than 1% of patients. The RRP tested for respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1 through 4, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and coronavirus NL62. RESULTS The pre-RRP group had 365 patients, and the post-RRP group had 771 patients. After RRP implementation, the mean time to the test result was shorter (383 minutes versus 1119 minutes, P < .001), and the percentage of patients with a result in the emergency department was greater (51.6% versus 13.4%, P < .001). There was no difference in whether antibiotics were prescribed, but the duration of antibiotic use was shorter after RRP implementation (P = .003) and was dependent on receiving test results within 4 hours. If the test result was positive, the inpatient length of stay (P = .03) and the time in isolation (P = .03) were decreased after RRP implementation compared with before RRP implementation.

shortness of breath and tested positive for COVID-19 He was hypoxic (2-3 liters on nasal cannula [NC]) and had a blood pressure (BP) of 100/70 mm of Hg His initial labs were significant for mild elevations in AST and ALT with normal alkaline phosphatase He underwent CT scan of the chest and abdomen, which showed nonspecific lung nodules and thickened gall bladder His liver enzymes began to rise serially reaching an AST of 4,735 and ALT of 1,988 He was treated with convalescent plasma on day 2 of admission Hepatitis panel was negative Ultrasound arterial doppler of the abdomen and HIDA scan ruled out portal vein thrombosis and cholecystitis, respectively He developed tachypnea to 50 breaths/minute and respiratory distress An arterial blood gas showed pH:7 5, pCO2:10, pO2:68, HCO3:10 and a lactate of 16 Initial concerns were for cardiogenic shock (due to low EF) vs sepsis However, BP was stable with good urine output He was transferred to the ICU Repeat echocardiography(TTE) showed an EF of 15-25% He was placed on broad antibiotics and received N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for liver failure Repeat infectious exam and imaging were negative His lactic acidosis improved, and he was downgraded within 48 hours DISCUSSION: Normal BP, evidence of good end organ perfusion, unchanged TTE findings and negative infectious work up ruled out cardiogenic and septic shock Negative

Multiple linear regression models showed, on average, positive effects of collaboration on grades. Yet, when isolating the effects of the types of collaboration, the positive effects are observed only between those who display more strong friendship ties. Also, we found differences on the social networks and their effects over grades between both courses, presumably due to their pedagogical nature.

This paper presents a human-like walking control framework based on the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) com planning method that enables a child-sized humanoid robot to walk with a humanoid pattern with a speed of 0.6 s per step a strike of 30 cm. The control framework consists of three parts: the human-like gait generation of the center of mass (CoM) and swings foot trajectory, the dynamic replan in phase switch and the upper body stabilization controller. The dynamic replanning of the CoM and foot trajectory can efficiently decrease the vibration in the step-phase switch. The up-body stabilization controller can reduce the up-body swing in walking and increase the robot's stability while walking. The robot uses a mems-based inertial measurement unit (IMU) and joint position encoders to estimate the current state of the robot and use force-sensitive resistors (FSR) on the robot foot to identify the actual step phase of the robot. None of these solutions is high-cost or difficult to integrate with a child-size robot. Software simulations and walking experiments are using to verify the motion control algorithm.

However, crises and disasters that emerge and unfold within hospitals appear to be more common than external events. EDs are often affected. Internal hospital crises and disasters (IHCDs) have the potential to endanger patients, staff, and visitors, and to undermine the integrity of the facility as a steward of public health and safety. Furthermore, ED patient safety and logistics may be seriously hampered. METHODS: Case series of 3 disasters within EDs. Narrative overview of the current IHCD-related literature retrieved from searches of PubMed databases, hand searches, and authoritative texts. DISCUSSION: The causes of IHCDs are multifaceted and an internal disaster is often the result of a cascade of events. They may or may not be associated with a community-wide event. Examples include fires, floods, power outages, structural damage, information and communication technology (ICT) failures, and cyberattacks. EDs are particularly at-risk. While acute-onset disasters have immediate consequences for acute care services, epidemics and pandemics are threats that can have long-term sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals and their EDs are at-risk for crises and their potential escalation to hospital disasters. Emerging risks due to climate-related emergencies, infectious disease outbreaks, terrorism, and cyberattacks pose particular threats. If a hospital is not prepared for IHCDs, it undermines the capacity of administration and staff to safeguard the safety of patients.

OBJECTIVE: The NEX project aims to develop an integrated Internet of Things system coupled with artificial intelligence to offer unobtrusive health and wellness monitoring to support older adults living independently in their home environment. The primary objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the technical performance and user acceptability of the NEX system. The secondary objective is to apply machine learning algorithms to the data collected via the NEX system to identify and eventually predict changes in the routines of older adults in their own home environment. METHODS: The NEX project commenced in December 2019 and is expected to be completed by August 2022. Mixed methods research (web-based surveys and focus groups) was conducted with 426 participants, including older adults (aged 60 years), family caregivers, health care professionals, and home care workers, to inform the development of the NEX system (phase 1). The primary outcome will be evaluated in 2 successive trials (the Friendly trial [phase 2] and the Action Research Cycle trial [phase 3]). The secondary objective will be explored in the Action Research Cycle trial (phase 3). For the Friendly trial, 7 older adult participants aged 60 years and living alone in their own homes for a 10-week period were enrolled. A total of 30 older adult participants aged 60 years and living alone in their own homes will be recruited for a 10-week data collection period (phase 3). RESULTS: Phase 1 of the project (n=426) was completed in December 2020, and phase 2 (n=7 participants for a 10-week pilot study) was completed in September 2021. The expected completion date for the third project phase (30 participants for the 10-week usability study) is June 2022. CONCLUSIONS: The NEX project has considered the specific everyday needs of older adults and other stakeholders, which have contributed to the design of the integrated system. The innovation of the NEX system lies in the use of Internet of Things technologies and artificial intelligence to identify and predict changes in the routines of older adults. The findings of this project will contribute to the eHealth research agenda, focusing on the improvement of health care provision and patient support in home and community environments.

According to the prudent experts, future waves of COVID-19 are going to be apparently more dreadful than the initial ones as severity of infections are much higher than before. After tedious and stringent confinement measures, public apathy and restrictions fatigue have prompted people to act impetuously in the face of second wave of infection. The main objective of this study is to quantify the impact of various non-pharmaceutical interventions in order to battle against the pandemic more strategically. In this chapter, future projections of daily COVID-19 cases have been discussed for Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil and Colombia with the help of a compartmental mathematical model of COVID-19 pandemic incorporating all possible real life interactions and effective non-pharmaceutical interventions. Model calibration has been performed exploiting an advanced optimisation algorithm based on well-known trust-region-reflective algorithm. To quantify the transmissibility of COVID-19 infection, respective control reproduction numbers (Rc) for the above-mentioned countries are also calculated. It has been found in our global sensitivity analysis that efficacious face coverings with high coverage level could significantly reduce the spread of coronavirus in the absence of a safe and effective vaccine. Timely implementation of social-distancing measures and comprehensive use of efficacious face coverings could significantly lessen the burden of the pandemic. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Epidemic Prediction and Analysis of COVID-19: A Mathematical Modelling Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Durante los primeros meses de la pandemia por SARS-CoV 2 (Coronavirus 2 del Sndrome Respiratorio Agudo y Grave), el agente etiolgico de la Enfermedad Infecciosa por Coronavirus de 2019 (COVID-19), la actividad de donacin y trasplante de rganos en todo el mundo se ha visto claramente afectada.

Here we model how a hypothetical hurricane evacuation from four counties in southeast Florida would affect COVID-19 case levels. We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health directives. These results are relevant to disease transmission during evacuations stemming from additional climate-related hazards such as wildfires and floods.","output":"Compound Risks of Hurricane Evacuation Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the effects of sleep on the central nervous system, it is thought that sleep disorders have a special importance in the onset, course and treatment of psychiatric diseases. Although the negative effects of sleep problems on the occurrence, recurrence and clinical course of psychiatric disorders are well known, it is reported that clinicians do not spend enough time for sleep problems in practice. This may be related to the fact that patients underreport their complaints for various reasons, insufficient examination time, and clinicians' lack of knowledge about the importance of the subject. Pharmacotherapy, psychological and behavioral interventions are options among the therapeutic approaches to sleep problems. But, it seems that clinicians tend to prefer pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep problems. However, it is important to choose the appropriate treatment option with considering the method preferred by the patients, who already use many and high doses of pharmacological agents, the nature of the psychiatric disorder and the sleep problem. In this context, chronotherapeutic approaches such as bright light, sleep deprivation, interpersonal relations and social rhythm therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques adapted for patients with bipolar disorder can be used in the treatment of suitable patients.

OBJECTIVE: To answer the following research questions: How did COVID-19-related challenges affect the work climate? Do physicians with deteriorated work climate simultaneously report a worsened provision of patient care? Which challenges were the most burdening? METHODS: In the course of the project COVID-GAMS more than 18 000 physicians of various specialties had been invited to a quantitative cross-sectional online survey (in Summer 2020). Analyses were conducted separately for the groups of GPs and other medical specialists. Group differences were analysed statistically and burdening factors were identified. RESULTS: 1703 participants were included in the analysis. 22.2% of GPs (other medical specialists: 19.9%) stated, their work climate had deteriorated. Physicians with a deteriorated work climate showed a tendency towards poorer personal provision of patient care (M = 3.75, SD = 0.98 versus M = 3.93, SD = 0.99) compared to unchanged or improved work climate. The lack of protective material in March/April 2020, changes in practice management and possible economic impacts on the practice were the most burdening factors reported by GPs.

The exponential increase in the use of social media (SM) has made it a powerful tool for creating awareness, education, training and community engagement on IPC. Here, we review how social media can be used effectively to implement strategies to combat public health issues especially vis--vis infection prevention and control.

This publication focuses on the synthesis of molecular electrets with ether substituents. As important as ether electret residues are for transferring holes under relatively high potentials, the synthesis of their precursors presents formidable challenges. Each residue in the molecular electrets is introduced as its 2-nitrobenzoic acid (NBA) derivative. Hence, robust and scalable synthesis of ether derivatives of NBA is essential for making such hole-transfer molecular electrets. Purdie-Irvine alkylation, using silver oxide, produces with 90% yield the esters of the NBA building block for iso-butyl ether electrets. It warrants additional ester hydrolysis for obtaining the desired NBA precursor. Conversely, Williamson etherification selectively produces the same free-acid ether derivative in one-pot reaction, but a 40% yield.

The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) was recently developed to assess the fear of COVID-19. Although many studies found that the FCV-19S is psychometrically sound, it is unclear whether the FCV-19S is invariant across countries. The present study aimed to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV-19S across eleven countries. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Using data collected from prior research on Bangladesh (N = 8,550), United Kingdom (N = 344), Brazil (N = 1,843), Taiwan (N = 539), Italy (N = 249), New Zealand (N = 317), Iran (N = 717), Cuba (N = 772), Pakistan (N = 937), Japan (N = 1,079) and France (N = 316), comprising a total 15,663 participants, the present study used the multigroup confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Rasch differential item functioning (DIF) to examine the measurement invariance of the FCV-19S across country, gender and age (children aged below 18 years, young to middle-aged adults aged between 18 and 60 years, and older people aged above 60 years). RESULTS: The unidimensional structure of the FCV-19S was confirmed. Multigroup CFA showed that FCV-19S was partially invariant across country and fully invariant across gender and age. DIF findings were consistent with the findings from multigroup CFA. Many DIF items were displayed for country, few DIF items were displayed for age, and no DIF items were displayed for gender.

Despite the pandemic-imposed separation and restrictions, these two case studies shed light on how curators collaborated with artists and participants across distance and time, actively and flexibly forging responsive and relevant connections between site-specific artworks and the immediate present. Their curatorial practices as artistic mediation - complicated the conceptual framework of artworks and exhibitions through co-curation and co-production with artists, thus lending a collaborative dimension to the model of exhibition-making and the role of the curator as the 'curator-as-artist'.","output":"Curating pandemic contingencies: Remote collaboration and display reconfiguration in practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural ventilation (NV) is a strategy of bioclimatic design to promote hygrothermal comfort and indoor air quality (IAQ). Nowadays, COVID-19 pandemic highlights the review of ventilation standards. In Mexico, the IAQ standard states a minimum of 6 ACH for educational buildings. ACH considers NV as an ideal piston flow and does not provide information of indoor airflow distribution. In this work, new age of air associated parameters are proposed, considering the indoor airflow distribution: the air renovation per hour (ARH) and the renovation parameter R. An isolated educational building located in a rural region is studied. Four window configurations of cross-ventilation are considered. All configurations have one windward window located at bottom. The configurations axial and upward have one leeward window at bottom and top, respectively. While, configurations corner and upward corner have one lateral side window at bottom and top, respectively. A CFD model of the educational building is validated with experiments. The axial configuration has the best performance according to ACH, nevertheless has the worst performance according to ARH and R. The results show that NV evaluation using ACH can lead to wrong decisions. An improvement of NV standard with the age of air associated parameters is recommended. ? 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Methods and FindingsA prospective observational study of 708,187 persons aged []80 years living in Bavaria, Germany, was conducted between Jan 9 to Apr 11, 2021. We assessed the vaccine efficacy (VE) for two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related hospitalisations and mortality. Additionally, differences in VE by age groups []80 to []89 years and []90 years were studied. Analyses were adjusted by sex. By the end of follow-up, 63.8% of the Bavarian population []80 years had received one dose, and 52.7% two doses, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine lowered the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related outcomes, resulting in VE estimates of 68.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.5%, 70.9%) for infection, 73.2% (95% CI 65.3%, 79.3%) for hospitalisation, and 80.1% (95% CI 80.0%, 89.0%) for mortality.

This review summarizes recent literature on the benefits and risks of DCC in term and preterm infants and examines alternative approaches such as physiologic-based cord clamping or intact cord resuscitation (ICR) and umbilical cord milking (UCM). RECENT FINDINGS DCC improves hemoglobin/hematocrit among term infants and may promote improved neurodevelopment. In preterms, DCC improves survival compared to early cord clamping; however, UCM has been associated with severe intraventricular hemorrhage in extremely preterm infants. Infants of COVID-19 positive mothers, growth-restricted babies, multiples, and some infants with cardiopulmonary anomalies can also benefit from DCC. Large randomized trials of ICR will clarify safety and benefits in nonvigorous neonates. These have the potential to dramatically change the sequence of events during neonatal resuscitation. SUMMARY Umbilical cord management has moved beyond simple time-based comparisons to nuances of technique and application in vulnerable sub-populations. Ongoing research highlights the importance of an individualized approach that recognizes the physiologic equilibrium when ventilation is established before cord clamping.","output":"Toward greater nuance in delayed cord clamping."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: COVID\\\\19 has presented health care professionals with unprecedented challenges.

Increasing physical activity might be a good strategy to improve physical strength and reduce the prevalence of illnesses associated with prolonged sitting. Office workers exhibit a sedentary lifestyle with short rest periods or even without pauses during the workday. It is important to perform workplace interventions to treat musculoskeletal disorders caused by prolonged sitting and lack of movement adopted on the office setting.

In this trial (NCT04746183) we evaluated the safety and optimal dose of molnupiravir in participants with early symptomatic infection. METHODS: We undertook a dose-escalating, open-label, randomized-controlled (standard-of-care) Bayesian adaptive Phase I trial at the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen Clinical Research Facility. Participants (adult outpatients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 5 days of symptom onset) were randomized 2:1 in groups of 6 participants to 300, 600 and 800 mg doses of molnupiravir orally, twice daily for 5 days or control. A dose was judged unsafe if the probability of 30% or greater dose-limiting toxicity (the primary outcome) over controls was 25% or greater. Secondary outcomes included safety, clinical progression, pharmacokinetics and virological responses. RESULTS: Of 103 participants screened, 18 participants were enrolled between 17 July and 30 October 2020.

To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine national government through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases outlined different quarantine measures wherein each level has a corresponding degree of rigidity from keeping only the essential businesses open to allowing all establishments to operate at a certain capacity. Other measures also involve prohibiting individuals at a certain age bracket from going outside of their homes. The local government units (LGUs)Cmunicipalities and provincesCcan adopt any of these measures depending on the extent of the pandemic in their locality. The purpose is to keep the number of infections and mortality at bay while minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic. Some LGUs have demonstrated a remarkable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to identify notable non-pharmaceutical interventions of these outlying LGUs in the country using quantitative methods. METHODS: Data were taken from public databases such as Philippine Department of Health, Philippine Statistics Authority Census, and Google Community Mobility Reports. These are normalized using Z-transform. For each locality, infection and mortality data (dataset Y) were compared to the economic, health, and demographic data (dataset X) using Euclidean metric d=(x?y)(2), where xX and yY. If a data pair (x,y) exceeds, by two standard deviations, the mean of the Euclidean metric values between the sets X and Y, the pair is assumed to be a good outlier. RESULTS: Our results showed that cluster of cities and provinces in Central Luzon (Region III), CALABARZON (Region IV-A), the National Capital Region (NCR), and Central Visayas (Region VII) are the good outliers with respect to factors such as working population, population density, ICU beds, doctors on quarantine, number of frontliners and gross regional domestic product. Among metropolitan cities, Davao was a good outlier with respect to demographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Strict border control, early implementation of lockdowns, establishment of quarantine facilities, effective communication to the public, and monitoring efforts were the defining factors that helped these LGUs curtail the harm that was brought by the pandemic.

Although the disease can vary widely between individuals, common symptoms also include pain, cognitive deficits, sleep dysfunction, as well as immune, neurological and autonomic symptoms. Typically, it is a very isolating illness socially, carrying a stigma because of the lack of understanding of the cause and pathophysiology. METHODS: To gain insight into the pathophysiology of ME/CFS, we examined the proteomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by SWATH-MS analysis in a small well-characterised group of patients and matched controls. A principal component analysis (PCA) was used to stratify groups based on protein abundance patterns, which clearly segregated the majority of the ME/CFS patients (9/11) from the controls. This majority subgroup of ME/CFS patients was then further compared to the control group. RESULTS: A total of 60 proteins in the ME/CFS patients were differentially expressed (P < 0.01, Log(10) (Fold Change) > 0.2 and < ?0.2). Comparison of the PCA selected subgroup of ME/CFS patients (9/11) with controls increased the number of proteins differentially expressed to 99. Of particular relevance to the core symptoms of fatigue and post-exertional malaise experienced in ME/CFS, a proportion of the identified proteins in the ME/CFS groups were involved in mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, electron transport chain complexes, and redox regulation. A significant number were also involved in previously implicated disturbances in ME/CFS, such as the immune inflammatory response, DNA methylation, apoptosis and proteasome activation. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study support a model of deficient ATP production in ME/CFS, compensated for by upregulation of immediate pathways upstream of Complex V that would suggest an elevation of oxidative stress. This study and others have found evidence of a distinct pathology in ME/CFS that holds promise for developing diagnostic biomarkers.","output":"A SWATH-MS analysis of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome peripheral blood mononuclear cell proteomes reveals mitochondrial dysfunction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION COVID-19 pandemic may contribute to mental state worsening.

Misinformation related to COVID-19 from these searches is a problem, and hence, it is of high importance to assess the quality of health information over the internet related to COVID-19. The objective of our study is to examine the quality of COVID-19 related health information over the internet using the DISCERN tool. METHODS: The keywords included in assessment of COVID-19 related information using Google's search engine were Coronavirus, Coronavirus causes, Coronavirus diagnosis, Coronavirus prevention, and Coronavirus management. The first 20 websites from each search term were gathered to generate a list of 100 URLs. Duplicate sites were excluded from this search, allowing analysis of unique sites only. Additional exclusion criteria included scientific journals, nonoperational links, nonfunctional websites (where the page was not loading, was not found, or was inactive), and websites in languages other than English. This resulted in a unique list of 48 websites. Four independent raters evaluated the websites using a 16-item DISCERN tool to assess the quality of novel coronavirus related information available on the internet.

Current ASF subunit vaccine research focuses mainly on delivering protective antigens and antigen discovery within the ASFV genome. However, due to the complex nature of ASFV, expression vectors need to be optimized to improve their immunogenicity. Therefore, in the present study, we constructed several recombinant MVA vectors to evaluate the efficiency of different promoters and secretory signal sequences in the expression and immunogenicity of the p30 protein from ASFV. Overall, the natural poxvirus PrMVA13.5L promoter induced high levels of both p30 mRNA and specific anti-p30 antibodies in mice. In contrast, the synthetic PrS5E promoter and the S E/L promoter linked to a secretory signal showed lower mRNA levels and antibodies.

In this study the performance of the new assay was evaluated for use on a portable screening device (ParaDNA), with the long-term goal to enable rollout at POC as an inventive step to meet the World Health Organizations sustainable development goals for Africa. DNA samples for germline testing were obtained retrospectively from 50 patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive breast cancer referred for genomic tumor profiling (MammaPrint). Currently, SA patients with the luminal-type breast cancer are not routinely selected for BRCA1/2 testing as is the case for triple-negative disease. An initial evaluation involved the use of multiple control samples representing each of the pathogenic founder/recurrent variants included in the BRCA 1.0 POC Research Assay. Comparison with a validated laboratory-based first-tier real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay demonstrated 100% concordance. Clinical utility was evident in five patients with the founder BRCA2 c.7934delG variant, identified at the 10% (5/50) threshold considered cost-effective for BRCA1/2 testing. BRCA2 c.7934delG carrier status was associated with a significantly younger age (p=0.03) at diagnosis of breast cancer compared to non-carriers.

We are investigating these questions via a neuroimaging study with college-aged participants, using individual difference measures that examine the relation between substance use, social context, and trait reward sensitivity with tasks that measure reward anticipation, strategic behavior, social reward consumption, and the influence of social context on reward processing. We predict that substance use will be tied to distinct patterns of striatal dysfunction. Specifically, reward hyposensitive individuals will exhibit blunted striatal responses to social and non-social reward and enhanced connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex; in contrast, reward hypersensitive individuals will exhibit enhanced striatal responses to social and non-social reward and blunted connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex. We also will examine the relation between self-reported reward sensitivity, substance use, and striatal responses to social reward and social context. We predict that individuals reporting the highest levels of substance use will show exaggerated striatal responses to social reward and social context, independent of self-reported reward sensitivity. Examining corticostriatal responses to reward processing will help characterize the relation between reward sensitivity, social context and substance use while providing a foundation for understanding risk factors and isolating neurocognitive mechanisms that may be targeted to increase the efficacy of interventions.","output":"The Role of Social Reward and Corticostriatal Connectivity in Substance Use"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) (sacral nerve stimulation SNS) has become an established therapy for functional disorders of the pelvic organs. Despite its overall success, the therapy fails in a proportion of patients. This may be partially due to inadequate electrode placement with suboptimal coupling of the electrode and nerve. Based on these assumptions the technique of sacral spinal neuromodulation has been redefined. All descriptions relate to the only currently available system licensed for all pelvic indications (Medtronic Interstim? ). METHOD An international multidisciplinary working party of ten individuals highly experienced in performing SNM convened two meetings (including live operating) to standardize the implant procedure. This report addresses the main steps to optimal electrode lead placement in temporal sequence. RESULTS Key elements of the electrode placement are radiological marking, the use of a curved stylet, the entry of the electrode into the sacral foramen and its progression through the foramen, its placement guided by a combination of a typical appearance in fluoroscopy and achieving specific motor/sensory responses with stimulation. The report describes quadripolar electrode placement and then either insertion of a connecting percutaneous extension lead or permanent implantation of the programmable device. CONCLUSION Standardization of electrode placement may ensure close electrode proximity to the target nerve providing a higher likelihood for optimal effect with less energy consumption (better battery longevity), more programming options with more electrode contacts close to the nerve and reduced likelihood of side-effects.

Encapsulating drugs in nanoparticles reduces systemic toxicity and increases circulation time of the drugs. In a novel approach to microbubble-assisted drug delivery, nanoparticles are incorporated in or on microbubble shells, enabling local and triggered release of the nanoparticle payload with ultrasound. A thorough understanding of the release mechanisms within the vast ultrasound parameter space is crucial for efficient and controlled release. This set of presented protocols is applicable to microbubbles with a shell containing a fluorescent label. Here, the focus is on microbubbles loaded with poly(2-ethyl-butyl cyanoacrylate) polymeric nanoparticles, doped with a modified Nile Red dye. The particles are fixed within a denatured casein shell. The microbubbles are produced by vigorous stirring, forming a dispersion of perfluoropropane gas in the liquid phase containing casein and nanoparticles, after which the microbubble shell self-assembles. A variety of microscopy techniques are needed to characterize the nanoparticle-stabilized microbubbles at all relevant timescales of the nanoparticle release process. Fluorescence of the nanoparticles enables confocal imaging of single microbubbles, revealing the particle distribution within the shell. In vitro ultra-high-speed imaging using bright-field microscopy at 10 million frames per second provides insight into the bubble dynamics in response to ultrasound insonation. Finally, nanoparticle release from the bubble shell is best visualized by means of fluorescence microscopy, performed at 500,000 frames per second. To characterize drug delivery in vivo, the triggered release of nanoparticles within the vasculature and their extravasation beyond the endothelial layer is studied using intravital microscopy in tumors implanted in dorsal skinfold window chambers, over a timescale of several minutes. The combination of these complementary characterization techniques provides unique insight into the behavior of microbubbles and their payload release at a range of time and length scales, both in vitro and in vivo.","output":"Multi-timescale Microscopy Methods for the Characterization of Fluorescently-labeled Microbubbles for Ultrasound-Triggered Drug Release"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo A pandemia de COVID-19 fez-nos questionar prticas dirias at ent?o institudas, como o simples aperto de m?o.

Digital interventions that have been developed and evaluated in recent years may be used to mitigate the negative consequences of the pandemic. However, evidence-based recommendations on the use of existing telemedicine and internet-based (eHealth) and app-based mobile health (mHealth) interventions are lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the theoretical and empirical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions related to public mental health provision (ie, mental health promotion, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders) that may help to reduce the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A rapid meta-review was conducted. The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews and meta-analyses that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions and determinants likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Overall, 815 peer-reviewed systematic reviews and meta-analyses were identified, of which 83 met the inclusion criteria. Our findings suggest that there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions. Evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (eg, blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on process quality, cost-effectiveness, and long-term effects is very limited. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. In times of physical distancing, quarantine, and restrictions on social contacts, decision makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and invest time and efforts in the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs.","output":"Evidence Synthesis of Digital Interventions to Mitigate the Negative Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Public Mental Health: Rapid Meta-review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads heterogeneously, disproportionately impacting poor and minority communities. The relationship between poverty and race is complex, with a diverse set of structural and systemic factors driving higher rates of poverty among minority populations. The factors that specifically contribute to the disproportionate rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, are not clearly understood. METHODS: We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 test results from community-based testing sites in Los Angeles, California, between June and December, 2020. We used tester zip code data to link those results with United States Census report data on average annual household income, rates of healthcare coverage, and employment status by zip code. RESULTS: We analyzed 2 141 127 SARS-CoV-2 test results, of which 245 154 (11.4%) were positive. Multivariable modeling showed a higher likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity among Hispanic communities than among other races. We found an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 positivity among individuals from zip codes with an average annual household income <US$65 000 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.72 to 1.82), as well as from zip codes with <85% of individuals with health insurance (aOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.33), and <60% of individuals employed (aOR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.41 to 1.44). CONCLUSIONS: Residence in zip codes with lower average annual household income, lower rates of employment, or lower rates of health insurance was associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Further research is needed into how those factors increase the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among populations of lower socioeconomic status in order to develop targeted public health interventions.","output":"Association of Lower Socioeconomic Status and SARS-CoV-2 Positivity in Los Angeles, California"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundSeveral clinical trials have assessed the protective potential of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.

During follow-up, there were 97 (1.4%) COVID-19 cases in the exposed cohort and 183 (1.4%) among controls. The incidence rate was very similar between the two groups (12.05 vs 11.35 cases/100,000 person-days).

METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 569 adults who responded to an online questionnaire during confinement in France. The questions assessed demographics, usage of eHealth for exercise and physical activity, and behavioral levels. The questionnaire also measured the constructs of Social Cognitive Theory, the Theory of Planned Behavior, and automaticity facets toward eHealth for exercise and physical activity. RESULTS: Participants who were users of eHealth for exercise and physical activity presented significantly higher levels of vigorous physical activity and total physical activity per week than non-users (p < 0.001). The chi-square test showed significant interactions between psychological constructs toward eHealth (i.e., self-efficacy, behavioral attitudes, intentions, and automaticity) and physical activity levels (all interactions were p < 0.05). Self-efficacy was significantly and negatively correlated with walking time per week.

Scientists are trying to map the pattern of the transmission of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Many countries are in the phase of lockdown in the globe. In this paper we predict about the effect of coronavirus COVID-19 and give a sneak peak when it will reduce the transmission rate in the world via mathematical modelling. In this research work our study is based on extensions of the well-known susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) family of compartmental models and later we observe the new model changes into (SEIR) without changing its physical meanings. The stability analysis of the coronavirus depends on changing of its basic reproductive ratio. The progress rate of the virus in the critically infected cases and the recovery rate have major roles to control this epidemic. The impact of social distancing, lockdown of the country, self-isolation, home quarantine and the wariness of global public health system have significant influence on the parameters of the model system that can alter the effect of recovery rates, mortality rates and active contaminated cases with the progression of time in the real world.

In this study, we sought to assess our current practice and determine the factors which affect the surgical outcomes of intradural spinal tumour resection. Methods All consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection of intradural spinal tumours from December 2011 to November 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The Modified McCormick Scale (MMS) was used to grade patients neurological status both pre-operatively and at the latest follow-up. The associations between changes in MMS and variables such as patient demographics, tumour location, number and experience of consultants involved in the procedure, use of intraoperative neuro-monitoring, bony spinal exposure and dural closure methods were assessed. A multivariable binary logistic regression model was performed to identify independent predictors of improvements in MMS. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 22 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY), with p<0.05 deemed to be indicative of statistical significance throughout. Results A total of 145 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a median age of 56.5 years; of whom 119 had extramedullary tumours and 26 had intramedullary tumours. Methods of dural closure were variable, and there was an increasing trend over time towards using the laminoplasty approach for bony exposure. Neither the experience of consultants (p=0.991) nor the number of consultants involved (p=0.084) was found to be significantly associated with the change in MMS, with the strongest predictor being the baseline MMS (p<0.001). Patients who had adjuvant therapy were also significantly more likely to have a poorer neurological outcome (p=0.001). Conclusion A good neurological baseline is a significant positive predictor of an improved functional outcome.

In particular, the proportion of occupational infections among healthcare personnel and which workers among them are most at risk remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the reported COVID-19 cases among healthcare personnel in Frankfurt/Main during the first six months of the pandemic, to determine the number of occupational infections and thus to allow a better interpretation of the data published by the Robert Koch Institute. METHODS: Data from the Frankfurt/Main Health Protection Authority was analysed for the period from 1 March to 31 August 2020, and healthcare personnel were recruited for a cross-sectional survey. Three subgroups were defined and analysed according to whether the infectious contact occurred at work, in private or in an unknown setting. RESULTS: Healthcare personnel accounted for 11.8% (319/2700) of all reported COVID-19 cases in Frankfurt/Main during the period studied. In the survey, 47.2% of respondents reported that their infection was acquired in the workplace. There was an association of contact with COVID-19 patients as well as employment in the internal medicine ward and a reported work-related infection. Also apparent was an association between suspected occupational infections and consequently filed reports for alleged occupational disease. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Health protection authorities are in a position to collect relevant data on work-related transmissions in healthcare occupations and workplaces and should generate standardised data on infected healthcare personnel. This data is necessary to take targeted infection control and prevention measures that protect healthcare personnel and their patients.","output":"Beruflich erworbene SARS-CoV-2-Infektionen bei medizinischem Personal in Frankfurt am Main von M?rz bis August 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. Local anesthetics (LAs) have potent anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammatory down-regulation is crucial in diseases with overactive immune reactions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic inflammation. We investigated the influence of four LAs, procaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, and bupivacaine, on the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) secretion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human leucocytes. Methods. Blood samples of 28 individuals were stimulated with LPS. The reduction of TNF- production by each of the four LAs added (0.5 mg/mL) was measured and correlated with biometric variables. A response was defined as reduction to <85% of initial levels. Results. All four LAs down-regulated the TNF- secretion in 44C61%: Bupivacaine (44.4%), lidocaine (61.5%), mepivacaine (44.4%), and procaine (50% of the individuals, responders). The TNF- secretion was reduced to 67.4, 68.0, 63.6, and 67.1% of the initial values in responders. The effects in both patients and healthy persons were the same. Interindividual responses to LAs were not correlated with the duration or type of complaints, basal TNF- serum level, sex, BMI, or age of responders. Conclusions. Four clinically relevant LAs (amid-LA and ester-LA) attenuate the inflammatory response provoked by LPS.

The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of psoriasis on the quality of life, sense of stigmatization, self-esteem, and satisfaction with life in patients with psoriasis. METHODS: The study was based on a short survey prepared by the authors and five validated scales: Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), 6-Item Stigmatization Scale, 33-Item Feelings of Stigmatization Questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). The study included 111 patients with psoriasis (46.8% women and 53.2% men). The inclusion criteria of the study were the diagnosis of plaque psoriasis and written informed consent to participate. RESULTS: DLQI scores ranged between 0 and 28 points (pts) (mean 10.8 pts). Mean stigmatization scores determined with the 33- and 6-Item Stigmatization Scale were 81.6 pts and 7.5 pts, respectively. The mean SWLS score for the study group (18.5 pts) was slightly below the average. The mean score SES of 27 pts implies that the study respondents self-esteem level was slightly above the average. CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with life turned out to be significantly modulated by overall stigmatization level on the 33-Item Stigmatization Scale (the stronger the sense of stigmatization, the lower the satisfaction with life) and education (respondents with higher education presented with higher satisfaction with life than those with non-higher education).","output":"Skin-Disease Specific and Generic Psychometric Measures in Patients with Psoriasis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite its potential utility for the outdoor recreation sector, there is no centralised surveillance system for recreational walking trails in Ireland and thus trail usage in Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. This paper aims to report trends in footfall count data on Irish trails during the COVID-19 period and to triangulate findings with openly available mobility data. This descriptive study analysed changes in footfall counts gathered from passive infrared sensors on 33 of Irelands recreational walking trails between January 2019 and December 2020. The relationship between Google Community Mobility Report (GCMR) data and footfall counts was analysed to corroborate trends in footfall data. Total footfall increased by 6% between 2019 and 2020 on trails included in this analysis. Notably, mean trail usage was between 26% and 47% higher in OctoberCDecember 2020 than during the same period in 2019. A strong correlation between GCMR data from parks and footfall count data was found. The conclusions of this study are twofold. Firstly, trail usage in Ireland increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially on trails closer to urban areas and there is a potential for this to be a lasting legacy. Secondly, combining multiple data sources can provide trail managers with more detailed representations of trail usage and currently these are not harmonised. Future research should examine ways to encourage sustained recreational walking trail use in new users and implement novel ways to coordinate datasets across systems to monitor visitors on Irish recreational walking trails. Management implications This paper presents a number of implications for trail management teams to consider: ? Openly available datasets pertaining to mobility, such as Google Community Mobility Reports, can be utilised to corroborate data collected from footfall sensors in place on trails. Furthermore, there may be potential for Google Trends data to help trail management teams gauge interest in specific trails and parks during defined time frames. ? There is considerable potential to sustain the COVID-19 legacy of increased trail use, especially for trails closer to urban areas, through promotional campaigns and continued trail maintenance. ?

With the current rarity of pneumonic plague epidemics, our epidemiological knowledge remains insufficient for detailed characterization of effective control measures. METHODS Temporal patterns and key biological parameters of a pneumonic plague epidemic in Manchuria from 1910 to 1911 were analysed based on historical records collected by Kanto Totokufu, the administration of the Japanese Empire in Manchuria at that time. The serial intervals were fitted to gamma distribution using the maximum likelihood method, and time-delay distributions from onset-to-admission, admission-to-death, and onset-to-death were investigated. RESULTS Whereas a total of 228 cases were diagnosed with pneumonic plague in areas under direct control of the Japanese Empire, 4,781 cases were also recorded in surrounding areas. Although the epidemic grew exponentially in the early phase, the average doubling time steadily increased reflecting successful control efforts. The estimated mean serial interval (and standard deviation) was 5.7 (3.6) days. All cases with known dates of onset were admitted to hospital within 4 days after onset, and the mean time from onset to admission was 1.1 (0.4) days. CONCLUSIONS The increase in doubling time demonstrates the efficient and rapid countermeasures employed. Since the short interval from onset to death implies the importance of rapid responses, the challenge in confronting a future bioterrorist attack is to implement rapid and appropriate integration of control measures both at the individual and community level to prevent further transmissions as well as lower case fatality.","output":"Epidemiology of a primary pneumonic plague in Kantoshu, Manchuria, from 1910 to 1911: statistical analysis of individual records collected by the Japanese Empire."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We use a sales database of farmers market vendors in the Washington, D.C., area to estimate how first half 2020 sales were impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

METHOD Using ECFMG databases, the authors created a 10-year cohort (January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016) of certification applicants, defined as individuals who had attempted at least 2 examinations required for certification. Authors aggregated applicant data at the school level, excluding schools with <80 applicants. School accreditation statuses were based on agency websites. School region, age, and time of first accreditation were included. Analyses included descriptive and bivariate statistics and multiple linear regressions adjusting for school start year and year of first accreditation. RESULTS The cohort included 128,046 applicants from 1,973 medical schools across 162 countries. After excluding low-volume schools, 318 schools across 81 countries remained. These provided 99,598 applicants and 77,919 certificate holders, three-quarters of whom came from the Caribbean, South-Central Asia, and West Asia regions. Two hundred and fifty (78.6%) schools were accredited; 68 (21.4%) were not. Most ECFMG applicants (n = 84,776, 85.1%) and certificate holders (n = 68,444, 87.8%) attended accredited medical schools. Accredited schools had higher rates of ECFMG certification among graduates than non-accredited schools in comparisons that included all schools (75.0% (standard deviation [SD] = 10.6%) vs. 68.3% (SD = 15.9%), P < .001), and for countries that had both accredited and non-accredited schools (73.9% (SD = 11.4%) vs. 67.3% (SD = 16.8%), P = .023). After adjusting for age of school, longer duration of accreditation was associated with higher certification rates (P < .001).

The main limitation consists in reaching the point when the number of susceptible to the infection people substantially decreases. As testing ground, reasonable descriptions of the newly registered COVID-19 cases per day is achieved for Europe and the United States till December 2020, including several so-called Pandemic waves. The approach of the present work, by using transmission from one generation of infected people to a new generation allows a much more detailed tracking of the Pandemic spread than the approaches used so far. For example, the most widely used Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) models (and their variants) use instead transitions from one big compartment of susceptible people to another new one of infected people followed by recovery leading to a third compartment.

The cross-reactivity of coronavirus antibody responses of healthy children (n=89), adults (n=98), elderly (n=57), and COVID-19 patients (n=19) were analysed by systems serology. While moderate levels of cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgM, and IgA were detected in healthy individuals, we identified serological signatures associated with SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific Fc{gamma} receptor binding, which accurately distinguished COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc upon infection, enhancing Fc{gamma} receptor engagement. Vastly different serological signatures were observed between healthy children and elderly, with markedly higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG observed in elderly, whereas children displayed elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, including receptor binding domain-specific IgM with higher avidity.

Currently, there are over 95,000 complete genome sequences of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, in public databases, accompanying a growing number of studies. Nevertheless, there is still much to learn about the viral population variation when the virus is evolving as it continues to spread. We have analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genomes to identify the most variant sites, as well as the stable, conserved ones in samples collected in the Netherlands until June 2020. We identified the most frequent mutations in different geographies. We also performed a phylogenetic study focused on the Netherlands to detect novel variants emerging in the late stages of the pandemic and forming local clusters. We investigated the S and N proteins on SARS-CoV-2 genomes in the Netherlands and found the most variant and stable sites to guide development of diagnostics assays and vaccines. We observed that while the SARS-CoV-2 genome has accumulated mutations, diverging from reference sequence, the variation landscape is dominated by four mutations globally, suggesting the current reference does not represent the virus samples circulating currently. In addition, we detected novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 almost unique to the Netherlands that form localized clusters and region-specific sub-populations indicating community spread. We explored SARS-CoV-2 variants in the Netherlands until June 2020 within a global context; our results provide insight into the viral population diversity for localized efforts in tracking the transmission of COVID-19, as well as sequenced-based approaches in diagnostics and therapeutics.

METHODS: Ten senior medical students at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania were enrolled. Students were administered a precourse test on their perceived confidence of their urologic knowledge, confidence in identifying urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic issues. Students participated in a 2-week curriculum that included both asynchronous and synchronous content. Asynchronous content included prerecorded lectures, self-paced problem-based learning modules, directed reading and video content, and an online discussion board. Synchronous content included real-time videoconferences covering case discussions, simulated patient presentations, and critical literature reviews. At the conclusion of the course, students were administered the postcourse survey evaluating changes in their ability to identify and understand urologic conditions. RESULTS: The postcourse survey demonstrated this course significantly increases students' scores in: self-perceived urologic knowledge, confidence in naming urologic conditions, comfort with performing urologic evaluations, and confidence placing consults for urologic conditions (P <.05). CONCLUSION: Virtual medical student rotations are scalable and effective at delivering surgical material and can approximate the interpersonal teaching found in clinical learning environments.

We investigated the role of adiponectin (an anti-inflammatory adipokine), leptin (a pro-inflammatory adipokine) and their ratio (Adpn/Lep) in this context. DESIGN: Single-centre, prospective observational study. Methods. Adiponectin and leptin were measured in 60 COVID-19 patients with mild (not hospitalised, n=11), moderate (hospitalised but not requiring intensive care, n=25) and severe (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] or death, n=24) disease. RESULTS: Adiponectin and leptin levels were similar across severity groups, but patients with moderate severity had the highest Adpn/Lep ratio (1.2 [0.5; 2.0], 5.0 [1.6; 11.2], 2.1 [1.0; 3.6] in mild, moderate and severe disease; P = 0.019). Adpn/Lep, but not adiponectin or leptin alone, correlated with systemic inflammation (C reactive protein, CRP: Spearman's rho 0.293, P = 0.023). When dividing patients into Adpn/Lep tertiles, adiponectin was highest, whereas leptin was lowest in the third (highest) tertile. Patients in the highest Adpn/Lep tertile had numerically lower rates of obesity, diabetes and hypertension, and lower rates of death or admission to ICU versus other tertiles. At linear regression in the whole cohort, CRP significantly predicted Adpn/Lep ( 0.291, P = 0.022), while female gender ( -0.289, P = 0.016), diabetes ( -0.257, P = 0.028), and hypertension ( -239, P = 0.043) were negative predictors. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that the rise in Adpn/Lep, due to increased adiponectin and reduced leptin, is a compensatory response to systemic inflammation. In patients with worse cardiometabolic health (e.g. diabetes, hypertension) this mechanism might be blunted, possibly contributing to higher mortality.","output":"Adiponectin to leptin ratio reflects inflammatory burden and survival in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Various authors have hypothesized carotid body (CB) involvement in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), through direct invasion or indirect effects by systemic stimuli (cytokine storm, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]1/ACE2 imbalance).

Here, we present an integrated histopathological and virological analysis of CBs sampled at autopsy from four subjects (2 males and 2 females; age: >70 years old) who died of COVID-19. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular investigation techniques were employed to characterize Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome C Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) viral invasion and inflammatory reaction. SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected in the CBs of three cases through Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In these cases, positive immunostaining for Nucleocapsid and Spike protein were also demonstrated, mainly at the level of large roundish cells consistent with type I cells, confirming direct CB invasion. In these cases, T lymphocytes showed focal aggregations in the CBs, suggestive of local inflammatory reaction. Blood congestion and microthrombosis were also found in one of the positive cases. Intriguingly, microthrombosis, blood congestion and microhaemorrages were also bilaterally detected in the CBs of the negative case, supporting the possibility of COVID-19 effects on the CB even in the absence of its direct invasion. SARS-CoV-2 direct invasion of the CB is confirmed through both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, with likely involvement of different cell types. We also reported histopathological findings which could be ascribed to local and/or systemic actions of SARS-CoV-2 and which could potentially affect chemoreception.","output":"Case Report: The Carotid Body in COVID-19: Histopathological and Virological Analyses of an Autopsy Case Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has brought a new set of challenges at a time when poorer nations were struggling with existing burdens.

Deciding when to cease surveillance is challenging. METHODS There are no publications focused on surveillance of elderly patients for CRC metastases. A systematic review of studies reporting treatment outcomes for CRC metastases in elderly patients was performed to assess the risk-benefit balance of the key objectives of surveillance; detecting and treating CRC metastases. RESULTS Sixty-eight eligible studies reported outcomes for surgery and chemotherapy in the elderly. Liver resections and use of chemotherapy, including biologics, are more conservative and have poorer outcomes in the elderly compared with younger patients. Selected studies demonstrated poorer quality-of-life (QoL) following surgery and chemotherapy. Studies of ablation in elderly patients are limited. DISCUSSION The survival benefit of treating CRC metastases with surgery or chemotherapy decreases with advancing age and QoL may decline in the elderly. The relatively lower efficacy and detrimental QoL impact of multimodal therapy options for detected CRC metastases in the elderly questions the benefit of surveillance in some elderly patients. Care of elderly patients should thus be customized based on their preference, formal geriatric assessment, natural life-expectancy, and the perceived risk-benefit balance of treating recurrent CRC metastases. Clinicians may consider surveillance cessation in patients aged 75 years and above if geriatric assessment is unsatisfactory, patients decline surveillance, or patient fitness deteriorates catastrophically.","output":"Systematic Review of Treatments for Colorectal Metastases in Elderly Patients to Guide Surveillance Cessation Following Hepatic Resection for Colorectal Liver Metastases."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among a prospective cohort of children and adults admitted to a national COVID-19 treatment unit in Uganda from March to December 2020, we characterized the epidemiology of and risk factors for severe illness.

Around 5% of these patients will develop end-stage achalasia, where oesophagectomy may be advocated. We present the laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty as an alternative 'oesophagus-preserving' procedure in patients with end-stage achalasia. METHODS We present a retrospective review of four patients who underwent laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty. Data collected included pre-operative demographic information and investigations; and post-operative outcomes. Patients were scored pre- and post-operatively using Reflux Symptom Index, Eating Assessment Tool-10 and Voice Handicap Index-10 questionnaires. RESULTS Four patients underwent laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty during the study period. In one patient, it was performed as a rescue procedure during attempted myotomy following multiple perforations of friable mucosa. In the other three patients, laparoscopic hand-sewn cardioplasty was performed for end-stage achalasia. None of the patients had post-operative complications and all patients were discharged on the second post-operative day. All patients experienced improvement in swallowing symptoms (EAT-10; p = 0.03) but developed post-operative gastroesophageal reflux.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey employed systematic probability sampling technique to recruit 200 physiotherapy students. A self-developed questionnaire which was tested for its face and content validity was used to obtain data. Data was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha level was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: The mean age of the respondents was 21.2  2.04 years. There was higher prevalence of moderate awareness (43%) and positive attitude towards telerehabilitation (39%). Majority of the respondents (62%) had high expectation towards future telerehabilitation products and services. There was significant association between level of awareness of telerehabilitation and age (X(2) = 7.119; p = 0.001). DISCUSSION: The responding students in this study are by age in the class of digital natives, who should be conversant with technology. This could account for the higher moderate level of awareness of telerehabilitation. However, the higher rates of negative attitude towards telerehabilitation could be attributed to prevailing barriers to its utilization in Nigeria.

Patients were identified using a prospectively recorded local database. We performed a logistic regression analysis of factors associated with a diagnosis of CRC. RESULTS: One-thousand-and-seven-hundred-eighty-four patients with FIT results were included in the study. Change in bowel habit (CIBH) was the most common referring clinical feature (38.3%). Patients diagnosed with CRC were significantly older than those without malignancy (74.0 years vs 68.9 years, p = 0.0007). Male patients were more likely to be diagnosed with CRC than females (6.5% vs 2.5%, Chi-squared 16.93, p < 0.0001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 1st 2020 until July 31st 2020 a database was used to prospectively collect records for all patients with cervico-facial infection (CFI), presenting to oral and maxillofacial teams. Information gathered included clinical presentation, location/origin of infection and how they were managed. The OMFS units were asked to compare the patients care with the treatment which would usually have been given prior to the crisis. RESULTS: 32 OMFS units recorded 1,381 entries presenting with CFI in the UK. Most of the infections were referred via the Emergency Department (74%). Lower first or second molars were the most common origin, contributing 40% of CFI. Collaborators reported that patient's treatment was modified as a response to COVID in 20% of the cases. The most frequently cited reason for the change in treatment was applying COVID-19 hospital policy (85%). CONCLUSIONS: The impact of the first wave of COVID modified the management of a significant number of patients presenting with CFI.

During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number R(t), which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the R(t). METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of R(t). A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the R(t) was rapidly decreasing. The maximal R(t) displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing R(t).

Has an increased risk of a severe form been identified in the adolescent AN patients? Method We have recalled the French recommendations on the subject Then we carried out a review of the international literature via Medline, Google Scholar as well as data from the American organization Center for Disease Control and Prevention Results The evolution of knowledge about the pandemic has clearly established a lower risk of infection in adolescents than in adults It seems that the virus spares this population, most of them remaining asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic Reassuringly, AN or low body weight has not been shown to pose a risk for the severe form of COVID-19 Conversely, the literature reports that lockdown worsens the symptoms of AN (food restriction, hyperactivity) in at least a third of these patients Most of the patients expressed a high level of anxiety during the first lockdown It may even have been difficult for these patients to continue to access care when they were confined Conclusion In the end, it seems wise not to reproduce the strategy of early return home in adolescents with AN Current data support the need for continuity of care, as well as the continuation of hospital care when necessary, while a too rapid discharge runs the risk of destabilizing the patient in an already long and difficult course of care in the usual time","output":"Deuxime vague : quid des patients atteints danorexie mentale hospitaliss en pdopsychiatrie ?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global health pandemic, many employees transitioned to remote work, which included remote meetings. With this sudden shift, workers and the media began discussing videoconference fatigue, a potentially new phenomenon of feeling tired and exhausted attributed to a videoconference. In the present study, we examine the nature of videoconference fatigue, when this phenomenon occurs, and what videoconference characteristics are associated with fatigue using a mixed-methods approach. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses indicates that videoconference fatigue exists, often in near temporal proximity to the videoconference, and is affected by various videoconference characteristics. Quantitative data were collected each hour during five workdays from 55 employees who were working remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Latent growth modeling results suggest that videoconferences at different times of the day are related to deviations in employee fatigue beyond what is expected based on typical fatigue trajectories. Results from multilevel modeling of 279 videoconference meetings indicate that turning off the microphone and having higher feelings of group belongingness are related to lower postvideoconference fatigue. Additional analyses suggest that higher levels of group belongingness are the most consistent protective factor against videoconference fatigue. Such findings have immediate practical implications for workers and organizations as they continue to navigate the still relatively new terrain of remote work.

Although child-friendly contact visits with ample opportunities for physical contact are the most meaningful way for young children to connect with their incarcerated parents during times of health, there are other meaningful ways of connecting from a distance. Traditional mediated communication strategies such as phone calls and letters are challenging for very young children because of their limited cognitive, language, and attentional capabilities. New forms of mediated communication, such as in-home video chat, can be accessible and developmentally appropriate for connecting young children with family members who live at a distance, including connecting children with their incarcerated parents. A growing body of international developmental research suggests that video chat may afford children the ability to maintain the benefits of parent-child interactions from a distance, when internet access is available. Thus, in-home video chat between children and their incarcerated parents is a potentially viable option for building relationships during incarceration, especially when opportunities for positive physical contact are limited or non-existent.","output":"In-home video chat for young children and their incarcerated parents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 confirmed cases overseas continue to rise for months, while people overseas prefer to return at present. It is risky to have a large number of infected imported cases which may cause COVID-19 spread to China and even lead to outbreak again. In order to prevent imported infection, Shenzhen implemented the losed-loop management strategy by taking nucleic acid testing (NAT) for severe acute respiratory syndromes coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and medical observation for 14 days among individuals who have epidemic history (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan province and other countries) within 14 days. Our study described the status of COVID-19 infection among entry people in Shenzhen, and also evaluated the effect of closed-loop management strategy. Methods: A total of 86,844 people overseas entered Shenzhen from January 1 to April 18, 2020, and there were 39 imported cases. We made a descriptive study by analyzing the entry time, reported time, local confirmed cases in origin countries, and the number of entry people from abroad. The NAT were completed in Shenzhen center for disease control and prevention (CDC), ten district-level CDCs, as well as fever clinics. Results: The infection rate of entry people was 4.49 (95% CI: 3.26 ? 6.05). Most of the entry people or imported cases have Chinese nationality. The number of entry people and imported cases in Nanshan and Futian districts were larger than others. 15.73% of the entry people came from the US, and 12.67% came from the UK. 14 imported cases (35.9%) came from the UK, 9 (23.08%) came from the US. The imported risks from the US and UK in Shenzhen were higher than other countries or regions. According to the 14-days incubation period and the number of entry people, individuals from the US since Mar 9 were the high-risk population. Accordingly, entry people from the UK since Mar 13 were the high-risk population. It is important to evaluate the imported risk by analyzing local confirmed cases status in origin countries or regions and the number of entry people from these countries or regions to Shenzhen. The distribution of entry time and report time for imported cases in Shenzhen were similar. So it is important to prevent and control COVID-19 imported infection by taking NAT and medical observation at port. Conclusions: It is effective to implement closed-loop management strategy for individuals who have epidemic history (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan province and other countries) within 14 days. In order to control COVID-19 outbreak, we need the collaboration and cooperation at the global, national, and subnational levels to prevent, detect, and respond effectively.","output":"Study on the COVID-19 infection status, prevention and control strategies among entry people in Shenzhen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected millions of people and overwhelmed many health systems globally.

We surveyed the impact on sexual behaviour of men having sex with men (MSM) to inform future SHS provision. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, anonymous, web-based survey among HIV-negative MSM at high risk of HIV infection who attended 56 Dean Street, a sexual health and HIV clinic. The survey was conducted over a 7-day period in August 2020. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual behaviour and related mental well-being experienced during lockdown (defined as 23 March-30 June 2020) were extracted. Categorical and non-categorical variables were compared according to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use. RESULTS: 814 MSM completed the questionnaire: 75% were PrEP users; 76% reported they have been sexually active, of which 76% reported sex outside their household. 75% reported fewer partners than prior to lockdown. Isolation/loneliness (48%) and anxiety/stress (27%) triggered sexual activity, and 73% had discussed COVID-19 transmission risks with their sexual partners. While 46% reported no change to emotions ordinarily experienced following sex, 20% reported guilt for breaching COVID-19 restrictions. 76% implemented one or more changes to their sexual behaviour, while 58% applied one or more steps to reduce COVID-19 transmission during sex. 36% accessed SHS and 30% reported difficulties in accessing testing/treatment. Of those who accessed SHS, 28% reported an STI diagnosis. PrEP users reported higher partner number, engagement in 'chemsex' and use of SHS than non-PrEP users. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 restrictions had a considerable impact on sexual behaviour and mental well-being in our survey respondents. High rates of sexual activity and STI diagnoses were reported during lockdown. Changes to SHS provision for MSM must respond to high rates of psychological and STI-related morbidity and the challenges faced by this population in accessing services.","output":"COVID-19 restrictions and changing sexual behaviours in HIV-negative MSM at high risk of HIV infection in London, UK"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present Chirpy Cardinal, an open-domain dialogue agent, as a research platform for the 2019 Alexa Prize competition.

METHODS: Weekly total screening mammograms performed throughout 2019 (baseline year) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted year) were compared. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, race, ethnicity, breast density, breast cancer history, insurance status, imaging facility type used, and need for interpreter, were compared between patients imaged from March 16 to October 31 in 2019 (baseline cohort) and 2020 (COVID-19-impacted cohort). Census data and an online map service were used to impute socioeconomic variables and calculate travel times for each patient. Logistic regression was used to identify patient characteristics associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures. RESULTS: The year-over-year cumulative difference in screening mammogram volumes peaked in week 21, with 2962 fewer exams in the COVID-19-impacted year. By week 47, this deficit had reduced by 49.4% to 1498. A lower likelihood of returning for screening after COVID-19-related closures was independently associated with younger age (odds ratio (OR) 0.78, p < 0.001), residence in a higher poverty area (OR 0.991, p = 0.014), lack of health insurance (OR 0.65, p = 0.007), need for an interpreter (OR 0.68, p = 0.029), longer travel time (OR 0.998, p < 0.001), and utilization of mobile mammography services (OR 0.27, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Several patient factors are associated with a lower likelihood of returning for screening mammography after COVID-19-related closures.

Therefore, livestock are important components of a One Health perspective aimed to control these viral infections.

A total of 2229 variants were identified in the four candidate genes: 26% of them were not previously described; 29 variants affected the protein sequence and might potentially interact with the infection mechanisms. The results coming from this work are a first step towards a One Health perspective that should consider conservation programs of pig genetic resources with twofold objectives: (i) genetic resources could be reservoirs of host gene variability useful to design selection programs to increase resistance to coronaviruses; (ii) the described variability in genes involved in coronavirus infections across many different pig populations might be part of a risk assessment including pig genetic resources.","output":"Describing variability in pig genes involved in coronavirus infections for a One Health perspective in conservation of animal genetic resources"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mathematical modelling plays a key role in understanding and predicting the epidemiological dynamics of infectious diseases.

We also take advantage of the fitted model to conduct counterfactual analyses exploring the impact of lockdown timing and a more transmissible new variant. We found substantial differences in infectious contact between the two jurisdictions during periods of varied restriction easing and December holidays. Our counterfactual analyses reveal that implementing lockdowns earlier would have decreased subsequent hospitalisation substantially in most, but not all cases, and that an introduction of a more transmissible variant - without necessarily being more severe - can cause a large impact on the health care burden.","output":"Estimating time-dependent infectious contact: a multi-strain epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 on the island of Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Deep Neural Networks (DNN)-based methods, particularly UNet, are considered as state-of-the-art for many medical imaging tasks. However, despite remarkable progress on segmenting the normal lung, performance of the UNet is unsatisfactory on challenging chest X-ray (CXR) images. This could be due to mainly two limiting factors: (1) skip connections that merge feature maps of similar size from encoding and decoding paths, and (2) loss of spatial information due to repetitive down-sampling operations. To overcome these problems, in this study, we propose a DNN-based new architecture that replaces the skip connections with a bidirectional convolutional-LSTM (BC-LSTM) module that allows exchange of more information between encoder and decoder paths and also capture spatiotemporal information. For further improvement, we add a multiple kernel pooling (MKP) block at the lowest level of UNet to encode more spatial information by different sized pooling operations. To evaluate the performance of our method, we use CXR images with different pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, and Covid-19 from four public datasets as well as a private dataset and compare its performance with a standard UNet model.

We and others previously demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that AR12 increases autophagosome formation and autophagic flux, enhances virus protein degradation, preventing virus reproduction, and prolonging the survival of infected animals. In this report, we determined whether AR12 could act against SARS-CoV-2. In a dose-dependent fashion AR12 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 spike protein expression in transfected or infected cells. AR12 suppressed the production of infectious virions via autophagosome formation, which was also associated with degradation of GRP78. After AR12 exposure, the colocalization of GRP78 with spike protein was reduced. Knock down of eIF2 prevented AR12-induced spike degradation and knock down of Beclin1 or ATG5 caused the spike protein to localize in LAMP2+ vesicles without apparent degradation.

This ongoing clinical trial in young adult smokers measures appeal and the reinforcing value of smoking menthol versus non-menthol cigarettes and the impact of these variables on changes in smoking behaviour at a 6-month follow-up. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Reinforcement for menthol smoking is assessed in the laboratory using a validated behavioural economic choice task, and appeal is measured in the natural environment using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Analyses will examine differences between menthol and non-menthol cigarette smoking on measures of subjective response in the laboratory and via EMA, and how subjective response mediates the association between menthol preference at baseline and smoking outcomes at follow-up.

By collecting the dataset called \\"Effects of COVID19 on trade\\" from the state website NZ Tatauranga Aotearoa, we have developed a sustainable prediction process on the effects of COVID-19 in world trade using a deep learning model. In the research, we have given a 180-day trade forecast where the ups and downs of daily imports and exports have been accurately predicted in the Covid-19 period. In order to fulfill this prediction, we have taken data from 1st January 2015 to 30th May 2021 for all countries, all commodities, and all transport systems and have recovered what the world trade situation will be in the next 180 days during the Covid-19 period. The deep learning method has received equal attention from both investors and researchers in the field of in-depth observation. This study predicts global trade using the Long-Short Term Memory. Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economy changes over time. Time series analysis plays an important role in past analysis to get different predictions of the future and it can be observed that some factors affect a particular variable from period to period.

Our timely meta-ethnography aimed to synthesise existing qualitative literature on the wider personal and professional experiences of IMGs, to identify factors affecting IMGs' professional practice (either directly or indirectly). METHODS In September 2019 we systematically searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO, ERIC and EdResearch for peer-reviewed qualitative and mixed-methods articles that described experiences of IMGs. We extracted participant quotes and authors' themes from included articles and used the technique of meta-ethnography to synthesise the data and develop new overarching concepts. RESULTS Of the 1613 articles identified, 57 met our inclusion criteria. In total, the articles corresponded to 46 studies that described the experiences of 1142 IMGs practicing in all 6 continents in a range of settings, including primary and secondary care. We developed 5 key concepts: Migration dimensions (issues considered by IMGs when migrating), a challenging start (the stressful early period), degree of dissonance (between the IMG and host country in relation to the 4 main barriers of language, culture, medical education and belonging), levelling the playing field (interventions to reduce the impact of the barriers) and survive then thrive (adjustments IMGs made).

Design/methodology/approach C This study has employed an exploratory research design and obtained primary data via an online survey using a semistructured questionnaire. Convenience sampling has been used to choose a sample (n 5 105) of Netflix binge-watchers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both sample selection and survey administration have been done through social media messaging services owing to the COVID-19 lockdown measures. Findings C The results indicate that most of the respondents use smartphones for binge-watching on Netflix. Moreover, they have expressed that a wide range of shows available on Netflix incline them to engage in marathon viewing. However, the respondents spend just over 70 h per month binge-watching on Netflix. Finally, the majority of respondents have flagged one more episode syndrome as the most challenging aspect of being marathon viewers on Netflix during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like other health workers, CHWs need support to contribute effectively to health programmes and promote health equity. Yet the evidence base of what kind of support works best is weak. We present evidence from three fragile settingsSierra Leone, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo on managing CHWs, and synthesise recommendations for best approaches to support this critical cadre. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design to explore how CHWs are managed, the challenges they face and potential solutions. We conducted interviews with decision makers and managers (n = 37), life history interviews with CHWs (n = 15) and reviewed policy documents. RESULTS: Fragility disrupts education of community members so that they may not have the literacy levels required for the CHW role. This has implications for the selection, role, training and performance of CHWs. Policy preferences about selection need discussion at the community level, so that they reflect community realities. CHWs scope of work is varied and may change over time, requiring ongoing training. The modular, local and mix of practical and classroom training approach worked well, helping to address gender and literacy challenges and developing a supportive cohort of CHWs. A package of supervision, community support, regular provision of supplies, performance rewards and regular remuneration is vital to retention and performance of CHWs. But there are challenges with supervision, scarcity of supplies, inadequate community recognition and unfulfilled promises about allowances. Clear communication about incentives with facility staff and communities is required as is their timely delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that has explored the management of CHWs in fragile settings. CHWs interface role between communities and health systems is critical because of their embedded positionality and the trusting relationships they (often) have. Their challenges are aligned to those generally faced by CHWs but chronic fragility exacerbates them and requires innovative problem solving to ensure that countries and communities are not left behind in reforming the way that CHWs are supported.","output":"How should community health workers in fragile contexts be supported: qualitative evidence from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social scientists are increasingly turning to digital interactions as a primary source of qualitative data Online activities in turn typically take place on algorithmically mediated platforms, which shape what people do and say in crucial ways Here, I offer a toolkit for what I call algorithmic ethnography, that is, the ethnographic study of how computational systems structure online activities First, scholars need to follow the data and take into consideration the tracking strategies, monetization systems, and business models of the platforms where online interactions unfold Second, ethnographers should focus on the details of algorithmic sorting, since platforms typically have more content than they can display and thus rely on algorithmic procedures to personalize their pages Third, ethnographers should include metrics in their fieldwork and study their effects on interactions, hierarchies, and representations Together, these angles afford a fine-grained understanding of the computational texture of online exchanges","output":"Algorithmic ethnography, during and after COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: To investigate the impact of promising a referral bonus and an autonomous referral request on nurses' referral likelihood and the quality of their referrals.

However, established definitions of vulnerability typically involve only static concepts that are limited to measurement of system characteristics. Advancements in risk modeling, combined with the dynamic nature of data availability, and processing call for the need to understand the various dimensions and time-dependent properties of vulnerability within risk-informed decision making. There is need to: (1) Understand and classify aspects of vulnerability that exist in various systems, such as related to engineering, business, and healthcare, while recognizing both properties of the system and associated knowledge, (2) reconcile these definitions of vulnerabilities with existing concepts, such as sensitivity analysis and fragility, and (3) explore the implications of various types of vulnerability on risk management decisions. The main contributions of this work include classifying dynamic characteristics of system vulnerability and leveraging information about the multidimensional properties of vulnerability within risk management decisions that apply to a collection of risk events.

Comparisons were made with chi-square and MannCWhitney U, factors associated with survival were identified with a Cox regression. RECENT FINDINGS: The proportion of deaths was 7.1% in clinic A with a mean survival of 51.9 days (95% CI = 45C59); in clinic B 13.9% of patients died with mean survival of 37.8 days (95% CI = 32C43). The most prevalent comorbidities were hypertension (41.6%), diabetes (23.8%), obesity (15.0%), hypothyroidism (13.0%), dyslipidemia (11.0%), and chronic lung disease (10.8%) with similar proportions in both clinics. There were also differences by the clinic in the most prevalent complications: bacterial pneumonia (18.8%), acute renal failure (14.3%), and encephalopathy (9.5%). There were no differences in the days of hospitalization, mechanical ventilation (clinic A 23.7% and clinic B 29.4%) and admission to the ICU (25.3% in A and 32.3% in B). SUMMARY: We evidence the heterogeneity of the survival and the clinical profile of the patients who are cared for by two institutions of the same city. These findings demonstrate the need to conduct unique studies for each institution, which poses a significant challenge for hospital epidemiology programs due to the impossibility of extrapolating evidence from other healthcare institutions and the need to implement personalized medicine programs given the clinical diversity of patients hospitalized for COVID-19.","output":"Comparison of Survival and Clinical Profile of Adults with COVID-19 Hospitalized in Two Clinics in Medelln, Colombia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the ability of the 6-Minute Walk Test to predict long-term physical functional status improvement among intensive care unit survivors. METHODS Thirty-two intensive care unit survivors were prospectively evaluated from February 2017 to August 2018 in a post-intensive care unit outpatient clinic in Brazil. Individuals with intensive care unit stays > 72 hours (emergency admissions) or > 120 hours (elective admissions) attending the post-intensive care unit clinic four months after intensive care unit discharge were consecutively enrolled. The association between the 6-Minute Walk Test distance at baseline and physical functional status was assessed over 8 months using the Barthel Index. RESULTS The mean 6-Minute Walk Test distance was significantly lower in intensive care unit survivors than in the general population (405m versus 557m; p < 0.001). Age ( = -4.0; p < 0.001) and muscle weakness ( = -99.7; p = 0.02) were associated with the 6-Minute Walk Test distance.

A decrease in the number of pancreatic beta cells is a pathological sign of diabetes, and to date there is no drug treatment that targets damage to these cells. Pancreatic beta cells have a weak antioxidant system and are highly sensitive to oxidative stress reactions that occur within cells. Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) inhibits thioredoxin, which is part of the intracellular antioxidant system, thereby accelerating oxidative stress and apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells. Verapamil is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. The efficacy of this drug to improve beta cell survival and glucose homeostasis by inhibiting TXNIP expression has been demonstrated in in vitro studies. Although several retrospective studies have shown a lower incidence of T2DM with verapamil treatment, no prospective intervention studies have determined the efficacy of this drug in patients with T2DM. METHODS: The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral verapamil administration in T2DM patients. In this 90-day study, the effects of verapamil on fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), and the lipid profile were evaluated and compared with those of the placebo. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in HbA1c (about 0.5%) in the verapamil group at the end of the intervention period. The effects of verapamil on TXNIP gene expression and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) mRNA were compared with those of the placebo (at baseline, after 15 and 30 days, and at the end of the study). During the first month of the study, decreased TXNIP gene expression and increased GLP1R mRNA were associated with the administration of verapamil when compared with the placebo, although the differences were not significant. CONCLUSION: Verapamil can lead to better control of T2DM by reducing TXNIP gene expression and increasing beta cell survival and, possibly, by other mechanisms.

Our aim was to investigate the association between glucose variability and postoperative complications following total joint arthroplasty. METHODS We analyzed data on 21,487 patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at a single center from 2001 to 2017. Patients with a minimum of 2 postoperative glucose values per day or >3 values overall were included in the study. Glucose variability was assessed using a coefficient of variation. Adverse outcomes included an increased length of stay in the hospital, 90-day mortality, reoperations, periprosthetic joint infection, and surgical site infection. Periprosthetic joint infection was defined using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society criteria. RESULTS The final cohort included 2,360 patients who had undergone THA and 2,698 who had undergone TKA; 1,007 (19.9%) had diabetes. Higher glycemic variability was associated with an increased length of stay, 90-day mortality, periprosthetic joint infection, and surgical site infection. Adjusted analysis indicated that for every 10-percentage-point increase in the coefficient of variation, the length of stay increased by 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.1% to 7.2%; p < 0.001), the risk of mortality increased by 26% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.26, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.61; p = 0.07), and the risks of periprosthetic joint infection and surgical site infection increased by 20% (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.41; p = 0.03) and 14% (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.00 to 1.31; p = 0.06), respectively. These associations were independent of the year of surgery, age, body mass index, Elixhauser comorbidity index, diagnosis of diabetes, in-hospital use of insulin or steroids, and mean glucose values during hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS Higher glucose variability in the postoperative period is associated with increased rates of surgical site and periprosthetic joint infections and may be a useful predictor of the risk of mortality following THA and TKA. Efforts should be made to control the glucose variability in the early postoperative period, and future studies should examine the role of continuous glucose monitoring in a subset of patients with high glucose fluctuations.

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be further clarified. Here, we have identified that M1, an alphavirus isolated in 1960s, targeted C6 malignant glioma cells for apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that more cells enter S-phase post M1 infection, and subsequently undergo a classic apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism of S-phase arrest and its relationship to apoptosis, we tested the expression of several critical cell cycle regulatory proteins and found elevated phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), decreased expression of cyclin A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Notably, the protein level of p21(WAF1/CIP1) was downregulated earliest and most effectively among all tested changes of cell cycle regulators, though its mRNA level was strongly upregulated. To evaluate the role of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in S-phase accumulation and subsequent apoptosis, we confirmed that exogenous p21(WAF1/CIP1) overexpression or treatment with roscovitine (a selective chemical inhibitor of CDK2) efficiently protected against apoptosis with a reduced S-phase accumulation. Thus, it is indicated that the downregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) mediated C6 apoptosis via overactivation of CDK2. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) totally translocated to nucleolus during M1-induced C6 apoptosis. Altogether, downregulation and nucleolar translocation of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein played an active role in M1-induced C6 apoptosis.","output":"Alphavirus M1 induces apoptosis of malignant glioma cells via downregulation and nucleolar translocation of p21WAF1/CIP1 protein."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on the population with consequences on lifestyles.

The mainly airborne pathogen has led to large numbers of deaths, principally in elderly and vulnerable segments of the population. Protective vaccines have recently become available, but it is not yet clear whether and when population-wide immunity will be achieved. The existence of evidence for the protective effect of masks covering the mouth and nose is a topic of public debate. METHODS A selective literature search was carried out in PubMed. Data from the German Robert Koch Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also taken into account. RESULTS When talking, as many as 20 000 droplets ranging in size from 20 to 500 M are released every second. According to PCR tests, the amount of virus exhaled is highest immediately before the onset of symptoms. No randomized trials have been conducted on the effect of masks covering the mouth and nose. A metaanalysis of 29 studies on infection with SARS-CoV-2, SARS, or MERS revealed that type N-95 masks (corresponding approximately to FFP-2), surgical masks, or similar multilayer cotton masks can greatly reduce the infection risk for the wearers (RR 0.34 [0.26; 0.45], with moderate heterogeneity [I2 = 48%]). Model experiments and case reports suggest that masks covering the mouth and nose afford considerable protection against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne diseases by reducing release of and exposure to potentially infectious droplets; in addition, infections that do occur take a milder course. A limitation of the studies analyzed is that in most cases, this effect cannot be viewed in isolation from the protective impact of other measures (distancing, hygiene precautions).

The chapter begins with a review of sample collection and preparation, and a description of commonly measured parameters and analytical techniques. The reference values, sources of variation, and unique characteristics are then presented for each species, as available. Many variables affect the parameters of clinical biochemistry and hematology including methods of sample collection and preparation, equipment, reagents, and methods of analysis, as well as the age, sex, breed, and environment of the animals being sampled. Values obtained from a clinical case are usually compared with reference values that are either produced in the same laboratory or in a similar group of animals, or cited in the literature. Optimal sites for blood collection vary between laboratory animals and are described in this chapter for each species for which information is available. Total blood volume of the rabbit is discussed in the Hematology section of the chapter. The rabbit is recognized as a valuable model for human disturbances in lipid metabolism, such as the metabolic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia leading to atherosclerosis. Hematology is the study of blood and blood-forming organs, including the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood, bone marrow, and immunologic, hemostatic, and vascular systems.

Until then, it is proved that the most effective strategy to limit contagion is social distancing. Despite the adoption of countermeasures, this strategy is having heavy effects on the economy and social relations, putting the issue of peoples mobility at the centre of attention (OECD, 2020a; Un-habitat, 2020). This moment must therefore represent the opportunity to build an urban resilience strategy around mobility policies based on necessary anti-fragile scenarios (Taleb, 2008; Ble?i? & Cecchini, 2016), seizing this phase for an urban and social transformation capable of strengthening the complex city system toward a new normal (OECD, 2020b). In some Italian and foreign cities, the partial reopening carried out from May 2020 led to the resumption of some productive activities. The consequent increase in the flows has given rise to a complex challenge related to the reorganization of mobility. Rome has put in place measures such as the strengthening of public transport during peak hours and the start of the construction of 150 km of cycle paths, already foreseen by the Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) of 2019. However, it falls behind cities like Milan and Bologna, who have drawn up specific documents such as Adaptation Strategies and Emergency Plans for Sustainable Mobility, promptly engaged in the reorganization of mobility following the example of other European cities (such as Barcelona, Paris, Vienna) that pursue clear objectives and long-standing strategies of environmental, social and economic sustainability. Nevertheless, the backwardness of Rome also deals with the complexity of the urban form of the city and its immeasurable extension, as well as to the paucity of municipal mobility policies of the last decades. In view of a post-COVID phase, two essential factors are overriding: the demand for travel (Who should move? From where to where? How?) and the supply of urban and metropolitan mobility. However, it is necessary to counter immediately the risk of an uncontrolled return to the use of private vehicles, which, for Rome in particular, would mean the collapse of the city, also related to an immediate increase in atmospheric pollution and roads accidents. The paper is aimed at proposing an anti-fragile strategy for Roman mobility, starting from the functional and morphological analysis of the Roman settlement system, related to its articulation and specificities, which constitute a fundamental component in evaluating the potential and weaknesses of new mobility scenarios, highlighting the relationships between forms of the city and mobility models. The proposal for a planning methodology, based on the identification of the elementary urban units of the theoretical grid (Vittorini, 1987; Cerasoli, 2008), is supported by the international debate and practices of the last decades (Superillas in Barcelona; 15-minutes city model; Good Moove Plan in Bruxelles) and by the arising temporary practices in the Covid-19 phase.

The output is an alignment where for each pattern (constraint), an occurrence on each sequence can be found aligned together with those on the other sequences, in a manner that the overall alignment is optimized. Its predecessor, MuSiC, has been found useful by researchers since its release in 2004. However, it is noticed in applications that the pattern formulation adopted in MuSiC, namely, plain strings allowing mismatches, is not expressive and flexible enough. The constraint formulation adopted in RE-MuSiC is therefore enhanced to be regular expressions, which is convenient in expressing many biologically significant patterns like those collected in the PROSITE database, or structural consensuses that often involve variable ranges between conserved parts.

Results : During August to October 2021, five healthcare providers and seven healthy adults were enrolled in the study. One healthy adult could not be contacted resulting in a total of 11 participants interviewed. Both the healthcare providers and the healthy adults mainly talked about side effects after their vaccination, and to ease the other persons concerns based on their experience. Meanwhile, there were differences in the recommendations for vaccination between the two groups. The healthcare providers were strongly aware of the severity of COVID-19 infection and recommended vaccination to others as a useful measure to suppress becoming severely ill. On the other hand, the healthy adults recommended the vaccine with varying degree depending on their expectations and concerns about the vaccine and external factors such as living with a family member.

This study aimed to show the participant behaviour when webinars present at the COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: From December 2017 to July 2020, 58 webinars were broadcasted via the Uropedia, electronic library of SUST. Data of all webinars were collected with the YouTube analytics and application of the Uropedia. Data of streaming webinars included participant behaviours such as content views, engagement time, total unique attendees, average engagement time and the number of audience to leads. Data were split into two groups; group-1 is webinars before COVID-19 (before March 2020) and group-2 is the webinars during COVID-19. RESULTS: Total broadcast time and total page view number were found to be 112.6 hours (6761 minutes) and 15 919, respectively. The median participant age was 40.1 y. Median content view and median engagement time were found to be 261.0 and 12.2 minutes, respectively.

PROBLEM: Despite education about infection prevention practices, frequent RV outbreaks were declared each year at our rehabilitation facility. METHODS: Before and after study design. The primary outcome was the number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days. Process measures included delays in initiation of transmission-based precautions, RV testing and reporting of staff to occupational health and safety (OHS). Balancing measures included the number of isolation days and staff missed work hours. INTERVENTIONS: Based on comprehensive analysis of prior outbreaks, the following changes were implemented: (1) clear criteria for initiation of transmission-based precautions, (2) communication to visitors to avoid visitation if infectious symptoms were present, (3) exemption of staff absences if documented due to infectious illness, (4) development of an electronic programme providing guidance to staff about whether they should be excluded from work due to infectious illness. RESULTS: The number of bed closure days due to outbreak per overall bed days dropped from 2.8% to 0.5% during the intervention season and sustained at 0.6% during the postintervention season (p<0.001). There were fewer delays in initiation of droplet and contact precautions (28.8% to 15.5%, p=0.005) and collection of RV testing (42.9% to 20.3%, p<0.001), better reporting to OHS (9 vs 28.8 reports per 100 employees; p<0.001) and fewer isolation days (7.8% vs 7.3%; p=0.02) without a significant increase in missed work hours per 100 hours worked (4.0 vs 3.9; p=0.12).

Although, just like other respiratory tract viral infections, it is a disease with pathophysiological processes associated in general with cytokine production, inflammation, cell death, and redox imbalance or oxidative stress, very little is known about the pathology. Also, in recent studies, the effect of asprosin, which has an important and complex role on metabolism, on COVID-19 is unknown. The aim of this study is to determine the level of asprosin, a new hormone that has the potential to affect many metabolic pathways such as glucose metabolism, in COVID-19 patients. In addition, it is to determine whether asprosin is associated with oxidative stress in COVID-19 patients. METHODS Blood samples were taken from 30 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 confirmed with RT-PCR test and 30 healthy control subjects. The serum asprosin level was analyzed with ELISA, and total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) levels with colorimetric analysis. RESULTS The asprosin and TAS levels were determined to be statistically significantly decreased in the COVID-19 patients, and the TOS and OSI levels were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS It can be thought that a decrease in asprosin level in COVID-19 patients causes a decrease in metabolic activity, prevents sufficient energy production in patients, and therefore oxidative stress increases in patients.","output":"Asprosin and Oxidative Stress Level in COVID-19 Patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The scientific quantification of symptoms in pollen-related allergic rhinitis cannot be separated from the aerobiological data of the geographical area in which the study was carried out.","output":"Use of face masks and allergic nasal symptoms: Why not mention pollen count and air pollution data?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease-2019, or Covid-19, was first reported in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019 as viral pneumonia.

Coronaviruses, like many other viruses, have evolved mechanisms to evade this innate response, ensuring their survival. Several coronavirus accessory genes play a central role in these pathways, but for feline coronaviruses this has never to our knowledge been studied. As it has been demonstrated previously that ORF7 is essential for efficient replication in vitro and virulence in vivo of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), the role of this ORF in the evasion of the IFN- antiviral response was investigated. Deletion of ORF7 from FIPV strain 79-1146 (FIPV-7) rendered the virus more susceptible to IFN- treatment. Given that ORF7 encodes two proteins, 7a and 7b, it was further explored which of these proteins is active in this mechanism. Providing 7a protein in trans rescued the mutant FIPV-7 from IFN sensitivity, which was not achieved by addition of 7b protein. Nevertheless, addition of protein 7a to FIPV-37, a FIPV mutant deleted in both ORF3 and ORF7, could no longer increase the replication capacity of this mutant in the presence of IFN. These results indicate that FIPV 7a protein is a type I IFN antagonist and protects the virus from the antiviral state induced by IFN, but it needs the presence of ORF3-encoded proteins to exert its antagonistic function.","output":"ORF7-encoded accessory protein 7a of feline infectious peritonitis virus as a counteragent against IFN--induced antiviral response."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cases of COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) are being increasingly reported and physicians treating patients with COVID-19-related lung disease need to actively consider these fungal co-infections.","output":"Confronting and mitigating the risk of COVID-19 Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis (CAPA)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Household food waste (FW) has huge environmental and socio-economic impacts.

In this article, we report the case of a 75-year-old female with a baseline prolonged QT interval in whom the COVID-19 illness resulted in further remarkable QT prolongation (>700 ms), precipitating recurrent self-terminating episodes of torsade de pointes that necessitated temporary cardiac pacing. Despite the correction of hypoxemia and the absence of reversible factors, such as adverse medication effects, electrolyte derangements, and usage of hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin, the QT interval remained persistently prolonged compared with the baseline with subsequent degeneration into ventricular tachycardia and death. Thus, we highlight that COVID-19 illness itself can potentially lead to further prolongation of QT interval and unmask fatal ventricular arrhythmias in patients who have a prolonged QT and low repolarization reserve at baseline.","output":"Prolonged QT Interval in a Patient With Coronavirus Disease-2019: Beyond Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in dengue virus (DENV)Cendemic areas complicates the diagnosis of both infections.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among interns and dental students using self-administered, structured questionnaire regarding knowledge and clinical practice with respect to COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 126 completed questionnaires were received. A majority of the study participants (98.4%) stated they were aware of the COVID-19 infection control policies. Most participants (83.3%) had attended training or lectures about COVID-19. Most of them stated that the N59 mask is the best mask against the disease (81.7%). Significant variations between academic years and genders were revealed regarding the clinical practice. Uncertainty existed regarding quarantining, preprocedural mouth wash, and handwashing versus desensitizing. CONCLUSION: The level of knowledge of the participants was reasonable. Areas of deficiency in knowledge were observed among junior dental students. Further training in infection control measures and formulation of new guidelines are recommended to increase the knowledge and preparation of dental students regarding COVID-19 in dental settings, as well as reduce the transmission of infection.","output":"Knowledge and Practice of COVID-19 Infection Control Among Dental Students and Interns: A Cross-Sectional Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The European Commission sees the control of foreign subsidies as a top priority set out in its 2021 Work Programme. According to the Commission, there are three general areas where such distortions manifest themselves C acquisitions of European undertakings;public procurement procedures;and the general market operation of economic operators active in the European Union. Consequently, on May 5, 2021 the Commission has adopted its legislative proposal for a Regulation on Foreign Subsidies Distorting the Internal Market aimed at levelling the playing field in these three areas. This paper will focus on the third area. It seeks to answer the question whether the proposed solution is capable of solving the problem of an unfair advantage to foreign companies over their European competitors in the Internal Market, or whether it will remain a dead letter. The EU has its own internal anti-subsidy system C the State aid law. Its vast acquis will serve as a conceptual lens in this paper. Firstly, because of the Commission's extensive experience in this area suggesting the likelihood that the new framework will be interpreted with a State aid mindset. Secondly, because many relevant subsidy-related problems were initially encountered there.

Further, three degradation modes were designed for (1) the collaborative behavior of opinion leaders, (2) main knowledge dissemination behavior, and (3) main knowledge contribution behavior. Regarding the degradation model of the collaborative behavior of opinion leaders, we considered the propagation characteristics of opinion leaders to other nodes, and we created a susceptibleCinfectedCremoved (SIR) propagation model of the influence of opinion leaders behaviors. Finally, based on empirical data from the Local Motors open-source vehicle design community, a dynamic robustness analysis experiment was carried out. The results showed that the robustness of our constructed network varied for different degradation modes: the degradation of the opinion leaders collaborative behavior had the lowest robustness; this was followed by the main knowledge dissemination behavior and the main knowledge contribution behavior; the degradation of random behavior had the highest robustness. Our method revealed the influence of the degradation of collaborative behavior of different types of nodes on the robustness of the network.

A layman may have difficulty communicating with a professional due to not understanding the specialized terms common to the domain. In healthcare, it is rare to find a layman knowledgeable in medical terminology which can lead to poor understanding of their condition and/or treatment. To bridge this gap, several professional vocabularies and ontologies have been created to map laymen medical terms to professional medical terms and vice versa. OBJECTIVE: Many of the presented vocabularies are built manually or semi-automatically requiring large investments of time and human effort and consequently the slow growth of these vocabularies. In this paper, we present an automatic method to enrich laymens vocabularies that has the benefit of being able to be applied to vocabularies in any domain. METHODS: Our entirely automatic approach uses machine learning, specifically Global Vectors for Word Embeddings (GloVe), on a corpus collected from a social media healthcare platform to extend and enhance consumer health vocabularies. Our approach further improves the consumer health vocabularies by incorporating synonyms and hyponyms from the WordNet ontology. The basic GloVe and our novel algorithms incorporating WordNet were evaluated using two laymen datasets from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Open-Access Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV) and MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary. RESULTS: The results show that GloVe was able to find new laymen terms with an F-score of 48.44%. Furthermore, our enhanced GloVe approach outperformed basic GloVe with an average F-score of 61%, a relative improvement of 25%. Furthermore, the enhanced GloVe showed a statistical significance over the two ground truth datasets with P < 0.001. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents an automatic approach to enrich consumer health vocabularies using the GloVe word embeddings and an auxiliary lexical source, WordNet. Our approach was evaluated used healthcare text downloaded from MedHelp.org, a healthcare social media platform using two standard laymen vocabularies, OAC CHV, and MedlinePlus. We used the WordNet ontology to expand the healthcare corpus by including synonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms for each layman term occurrence in the corpus.

We summarize the current literature surrounding the virology of SARS-CoV-2, epidemiology of COVID-19 in transplant recipients, review the clinical features and complications of COVID-19 in SOTR, and discuss the safety and efficacy of current therapies and candidate vaccines in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite initial suspensions in organ transplantation during early 2020, routine donor testing and de-crowding of hospitals have allowed transplant activity to resume at pre-pandemic rates. COVID-19-associated mortality in SOTR is similar to that of the general population, and lower than that of patients with end-organ disease awaiting transplant. The optimal approach to immunosuppression in SOTR with COVID-19 is unknown and disease severity may influence management decisions. Many vaccines in development are likely to be safe for immunocompromised hosts, though post-marketing investigations will be required to determine the efficacy in the SOTR.

The presence of severe psychological distress (SPD) was measured using the Kessler's Six-scale Psychological Distress Scale. The difference of SPD percentages between the two phases was examined. Mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the factors associated with the change of SPD status between the two phases. RESULTS: Surveys for both phases had 2,078 valid respondents (49.3% men; average age, 50.3 years). In the two surveys, individuals with SPD were 9.3% and 11.3%, respectively, demonstrating a significant increase between the two phases (P = 0.005). Significantly higher likelihood to develop SPD were observed among those in lower (ie, 18,600-37,200 United States dollars [USD], odds ratio [OR] 1.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-3.46) and the lowest income category (ie, <18,600 USD, OR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.16-3.86).

DESIGN: Setting and participants A cross-sectional survey among 476 households was conducted during OctoberCDecember 2020 in five selected urban slums of Dhaka North, Dhaka South and Gazipur City Corporation. In-depth interviews with purposively selected 22 slum dwellers and key informant interviews with 16 local healthcare providers and four policymakers and technical experts were also conducted. OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of people suffering from general illness, percentage of people suffering from chronic illness, percentage of people seeking healthcare, percentage of people seeking maternal care, health system challenges resulting from COVID-19. RESULTS: About 12% of members suffered from general illness and 25% reported chronic illness. Over 80% sought healthcare and the majority sought care from informal healthcare providers. 39% of the recently delivered women sought healthcare in 3 months preceding the survey. An overall reduction in healthcare use was reported during the lockdown period compared with prepandemic time. Mismanagement and inefficient use of resources were reported as challenges of health financing during the pandemic. Health information sharing was inadequate at the urban slums, resulting from the lack of community and stakeholder engagement (51% received COVID-19-related information, 49% of respondents knew about the national hotline number for COVID-19 treatment). Shortage of human resources for health was reported to be acute during the pandemic, resulting from the shortage of specialist doctors and uneven distribution of health workforce. COVID-19 test was inadequate due to the lack of adequate test facilities and stigma associated with COVID-19. Lack of strong leadership and stakeholder engagement was seen as the barriers to effective pandemic management.

Metformin mainly activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the liver which leads to suppression of fatty acid synthesis and gluconeogenesis. Metformin activates AMPK in skeletal muscle as well, which increases translocation of glucose transporter 4 to the cell membrane and thereby increases glucose uptake. Further, metformin suppresses glucagon signaling in the liver by suppressing adenylate cyclase which leads to suppression of gluconeogenesis. In addition, metformin reduces autophagy failure observed in pancreatic ?-cells under diabetic conditions. Furthermore, it is known that metformin alters the gut microbiome and facilitates the transport of glucose from the circulation into excrement. It is also known that metformin reduces food intake and lowers body weight by increasing circulating levels of the peptide hormone growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Furthermore, much attention has been drawn to the fact that the frequency of various cancers is lower in subjects taking metformin. Metformin suppresses the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) by activating AMPK in pre-neoplastic cells, which leads to suppression of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis in pre-neoplastic cells. It has been shown recently that metformin consumption potentially influences the mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronavirus infectious disease (COVID-19).

In a typical EMA study, participants are prompted several times a day to answer sets of multiple-choice questions. Although the repeated nature of EMA reduces recall bias, it may induce participation burden. There is a need to explore complementary approaches to collecting in situ self-report data that are less burdensome yet provide comprehensive information on an individuals behaviors and states. A new approach, microinteraction EMA (EMA), restricts EMA items to single, cognitively simple questions answered on a smartwatch with single-tap assessments using a quick, glanceable microinteraction. However, the viability of using EMA to capture behaviors and states in a large-scale longitudinal study has not yet been demonstrated. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the EMA protocol currently used in the Temporal Influences on Movement & Exercise (TIME) Study conducted with young adults, the interface of the EMA app used to gather self-report responses on a smartwatch, qualitative feedback from participants after a pilot study of the EMA app, changes made to the main TIME Study EMA protocol and app based on the pilot feedback, and preliminary EMA results from a subset of active participants in the TIME Study. METHODS: The TIME Study involves data collection on behaviors and states from 246 individuals; measurements include passive sensing from a smartwatch and smartphone and intensive smartphone-based hourly EMA, with 4-day EMA bursts every 2 weeks. Every day, participants also answer a nightly EMA survey. On nonCEMA burst days, participants answer EMA questions on the smartwatch, assessing momentary states such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, and affect. At the end of the study, participants describe their experience with EMA and EMA in a semistructured interview. A pilot study was used to test and refine the EMA protocol before the main study. RESULTS: Changes made to the EMA study protocol based on pilot feedback included adjusting the single-question selection method and smartwatch vibrotactile prompting. We also added sensor-triggered questions for physical activity and sedentary behavior. As of June 2021, a total of 81 participants had completed at least 6 months of data collection in the main study. For 662,397 EMA questions delivered, the compliance rate was 67.6% (SD 24.4%) and the completion rate was 79% (SD 22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The TIME Study provides opportunities to explore a novel approach for collecting temporally dense intensive longitudinal self-report data in a sustainable manner. Data suggest that EMA may be valuable for understanding behaviors and states at the individual level, thus possibly supporting future longitudinal interventions that require within-day, temporally dense self-report data as people go about their lives.","output":"Intensive Longitudinal Data Collection Using Microinteraction Ecological Momentary Assessment: Pilot and Preliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the worldwide spread of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\\\\2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) resulting in declaration of a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2\\\\induced Coronavirus disease\\\\19 (COVID\\\\19) has become one of the main challenges of our times.

The aims of the study were to assess preventative measures practice, including vaccination history and health education, among Umrah pilgrims in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional survey was administered to pilgrims from February to April 2019 at the departure lounge at King Abdul Aziz International airport, Jeddah city. The questionnaire comprised questions on sociodemographic information (age, gender, marital status, level of education, history of vaccinations and chronic illnesses), whether the pilgrim had received any health education and orientation prior to coming to Saudi Arabia or on their arrival, and their experiences with preventative practices. Results: Pilgrims (n = 1012) of 41 nationalities completed the survey. Chronic diseases were reported among pilgrims (n = 387, 38.2%) with cardiovascular diseases being the most reported morbidity (n = 164, 42.3%). The majority of pilgrims had been immunized prior to travel to Saudi Arabia (n = 770, 76%). The most commonly reported immunizations were influenza (n = 514, 51%), meningitis (n = 418, 41%), and Hepatitis B virus vaccinations (n = 310, 31%).

Nearly a third of pilgrims (n = 305; 30.1%) never wore a face mask in crowded areas during Umrah in 2019. In contrast, similar numbers said they always wore a face mask (n = 351, 34.6%) in crowded areas, while 63.2% reported lack of availability of face masks during Umrah.

MethodsWe used national SARS-CoV-2 testing data in England to estimate the risk of reinfection []90 days after primary infection from 01 January 2020 to 31 July 2021, which encompassed both the Alpha and Delta waves in England. Disease severity was assessed by linking reinfection cases to national hospitalisation, intensive care admission and death registrations datasets. FindingsReinfection rates closely followed community infection rates, with a small peak during the Alpha wave and a larger peak during the Delta wave. In children aged []16 years, there were 688,418 primary infections and 2,343 reinfections. The overall reinfection rate was 66{middle dot}88/100,000 population, being higher in adults (72.53/100,000) than in children (21{middle dot}53/100,000). Reinfection rates after primary infection were 0{middle dot}68% overall, 0{middle dot}73% in adults and 0{middle dot}34% in children. Of the 109 reinfections in children admitted to hospital, 78 (72%) had underlying comorbidities. Hospitalisation rates were similar for the first (64/2343, 2{middle dot}73%) and second episode (57/2343, 2{middle dot}43%). Intensive care admission was rare after primary infection (n=7) or reinfection (n=4), mainly in children with comorbidities. 44 deaths occurred after primary infection within 28 days of diagnosis (44/688,418, 0{middle dot}01%), none after possible reinfections. InterpretationThe risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection is strongly related to exposure due to community infection rates, especially during the Delta variant wave. Children had a lower risk of reinfection than adults, but reinfections were not associated with more severe disease or fatal outcomes. FundingPHE/UKHSA Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence Before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed with the terms \\"COVID-19\\" or \\"SARS-CoV-2\\" with \\"reinfection\\" to identify publications relating to SARS-CoV-2 reinfections from 01 January until 15 November 2021. There were few publications relating to SARS-CoV-2 reinfections, and these primarily related to adults. Published studies reported very low rates of reinfection during the first few months after primary infection in adults. COVID-19 vaccines provide effective immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but recent studies have reported increasing risk of breakthrough infection with time since primary vaccination due to waning immunity. Several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the beta, gamma and delta variants have been shown to partially evade immunity after natural infection and vaccination, potentially increasing the risk of reinfections and breakthrough infections, respectively. Data on reinfections in children are lacking and restricted mainly to case reports in immunocompromised children. Added Value of This StudyWe used national SARS-CoV-2 testing data during the first 19 months of the pandemic to estimate the risk of reinfection in children compared to adults during a period that encompassed both the Alpha and the Delta variant waves in England. We found that the risk of reinfection correlated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and therefore, closely reflected community infection rates, with most reinfections occurring during the Delta variant wave. Whilst acknowledging the limitation of using national testing data, we found that children had a lower risk of reinfection compared to adults and that the risk of reinfection in children increased with age. Reinfections were not associated with severe disease in terms of hospitalization or intensive care admission and there were no fatalities within 28 days of the reinfection episode in children. Implications of all the Available EvidenceSARS-CoV-2 reinfections are rare in children, especially younger children, and occurred mainly during the Delta wave in England. Reinfections were not associated with more severe disease or fatal outcomes in children. COVID-19 vaccination will provide further protection against primary infections and reinfections in children.","output":"Risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfections in children: prospective national surveillance, January 2020 to July 2021, England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Molecular assays on nasopharyngeal swabs remain the cornerstone of COVID-19 diagnostic The high technicalities of nasopharyngeal sampling and molecular assays, as well as scarce resources of reagents, limit our testing capabilities Several strategies failed, to date, to fully alleviate this testing process (e g saliva sampling or antigen testing on nasopharyngeal samples) We assessed the clinical performances of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen (N-antigen) ELISA detection in serum or plasma using the COVID-19 Quantigene R (AAZ, France) assay METHODS: Performances were determined on 63 sera from 63 non-COVID patients and 227 serum samples (165 patients) from the French COVID and CoV-CONTACT cohorts with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 142 serum (114 patients) obtained within 14 days after symptoms' onset RESULTS: Specificity was 98 4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95 3 to 100) Sensitivity was 79 3% overall (180/227, 95% CI, 74 0 to 84 6) and 93 0% (132/142, 95% CI, 88 7 to 97 2) within 14 days after symptoms onset 91 included patients had a sera and nasopharyngeal swabs collected in the same 24 hours Among those with high nasopharyngeal viral loads, i e Ct value below 30 and 33, only 1/50 and 4/67 tested negative for N-antigenemia, respectively Among those with a negative nasopharyngeal RT-PCR, 8/12 presented positive N-antigenemia;the lower respiratory tract was explored for 6 of these 8 patients, showing positive RT-PCR in 5 cases CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of a commercially available serum N-antigen detection assay It presents a robust specificity and sensitivity within the first 14 days after symptoms onset This approach provides a valuable new option for COVID-19 diagnosis, only requiring a blood draw and easily scalable in all clinical laboratories","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 N-antigen in blood during acute COVID-19 provides a sensitive new marker and new testing alternatives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The glueing construction, defined as a certain comma category, is an important tool for reasoning about type theories, logics, and programming languages.

We model a group-structured society in which the transmission of individual behaviour occurs in parallel with the selection of group-level institutions. We consider a cooperative behaviour that generates collective benefits for groups but does not spread between individuals on its own. Groups exhibit institutions that increase the diffusion of the behaviour within the group, but also incur a group cost. Groups adopt institutions in proportion to their fitness. Finally, the behaviour may also spread globally. We find that behaviour and institutions can be mutually reinforcing. But the model also generates behavioural source-sink dynamics when behaviour generated in institutionalized groups spreads to non-institutionalized groups and boosts their fitness. Consequently, the global diffusion of group-beneficial behaviour creates a pattern of institutional free-riding that limits the evolution of group-beneficial institutions. Our model suggests that, in a group-structured society, large-scale beneficial social change can be best achieved when the relevant behaviour and institutions remain correlated.","output":"Source-sink behavioural dynamics limit institutional evolution in a group-structured society"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic effects of tourism industry during periods of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have received significant attention in recent years. The future is likely to pose a range of new challenges and opportunities to sustainable tourism. This paper employs the Markov-switching vector autoregressions (MSVAR) model to investigate the sustainability of tourisms economic effects in Hong Kong, both during periods of crisis and in the absence of crises. The empirical results show that: (1) The MSVAR model is effective in capturing the nonlinear relationship between the economy and tourism and allows for the categorizing of this relationship into four regimes, for example, the major event crises regime and the economic crises regime;(2) The economic effects of tourism differ noticeably across the four different regimes, and sustainability varies depending on the presence and type of crisis;(3) The Hong Kong economy, and the tourism industry in particular, exhibits high levels of stability and sustainability. In short, economic growth in Hong Kongs tourism industry is capable of rapid recovery following major crisis events, and it has the capacity to rebound quickly into new periods of rapid growth.

It can lead to cough and fever and in some cases severe pneumonia. It is generally detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and computed tomography scans. However, as it is a lung disease, it has common symptoms with other respiratory diseases. This necessitates us to carefully differentiate COVID19 from such diseases during the diagnosis. This work aims to do that with the help of several deep learning architectures and chest radiographs. It specifically focuses on differentiating COVID-19 from pneumonia, pleural effusion and lung mass. During this analysis, it is shown that we can differentiate COVID19 from other respiratory diseases using various deep learning architectures. It is further shown that ResNet-18 architecture produces the best overall performance in three scenarios of experiments.","output":"Deep learning to distinguish COVID-19 from other lung infections, pleural diseases, and lung tumors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Autonomous systems have played an important role in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Notably, there have been multiple attempts to leverage Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to disinfect surfaces. Although recent research suggests that surface transmission is less significant than airborne transmission in the spread of Covid-19, surfaces and fomites can play, and have played, critical roles in the transmission of Covid-19 and many other viruses, especially in settings such as child daycares, schools, offices, and hospitals. Employing UAVs for mass spray disinfection offers several potential advantages, including high-throughput application of disinfectant, large scale deployment, and the minimization of health risks to sanitation workers. Despite these potential benefits and preliminary usage of UAVs for disinfection, there has been little research into their design and effectiveness. In this work, we present an autonomous UAV capable of effectively disinfecting indoor surfaces. We identify relevant parameters such as disinfectant type and concentration, and application time and distance required of the UAV to disinfect high-touch surfaces such as door handles. Finally, we develop a robotic system that enables the fully autonomous disinfection of door handles in an unstructured and previously unknown environment. To our knowledge, this is the smallest untethered UAV ever built with both full autonomy and spraying capabilities, allowing it to operate in confined indoor settings, and the first autonomous UAV to specifically target high-touch surfaces on an individual basis with spray disinfectant, resulting in more efficient use of disinfectant","output":"Vision-based Autonomous Disinfection of High Touch Surfaces in Indoor Environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to infection by a new human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has seriously disrupted the provision of oncology services and their uptake. Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion for the public and healthcare professions alike. Many antibody test devices have been made available without independent evaluations and these may lack both adequate sensitivity and specificity.

The principal causes of AMS have yet to be determined. We aimed to identify the common causes of AMS in patients with COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department with AMS on arrival. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients presenting with AMS to three New York hospitals, from March 1 to April 16, 2020. Underlying causes of AMS on arrival to the emergency department (ED) were categorized as (1) neurological causes (stroke, seizure, encephalitis); (2) metabolic encephalopathy; (3) indeterminant. Multivariable analysis was used to assess independent predictors. RESULTS: Overall, 166 patients presented to the ED with AMS. Metabolic encephalopathy was diagnosed as the cause in 154 (92.8%), with 118 (71.1%) categorized as multifactorial ME and 36 (21.7%) with single-cause ME. Hypoxia 103 (62.0%) and renal failure 75 (45.2%) were the most common underlying mechanisms. Neurological causes of AMS occurred in a total 20 patients (12%) and as the sole factor in 5 (3.0%); 10 (6.0%) cases were seizure related and 10 (6.0%) were cerebrovascular events. Of the 7 patients with indeterminant causes, only 1 was suspicious for encephalitis (0.6%). Age, pre-existing dementia and cerebrovascular disease, and impaired renal function were independent predictors of AMS. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19, AMS on presentation to the ED is most frequently caused by metabolic encephalopathy (delirium).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost utility of sacubitril-valsartan compared with enalapril for acute decompensated heart failure treatment. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to project the total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of early initiation, and a 2-month delay of sacubitril-valsartan treatment and enalapril treatment in hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure over a lifetime horizon from a Thai healthcare system perspective. Clinical inputs were mainly derived from the PIONEER-HF and PARADIGM-HF trials, together with Thai epidemiological data. Cost data were based on the Thai population. All costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with enalapril, sacubitril-valsartan incurred a higher total cost per year (THB 42,994 [US$1367.48] vs THB 19,787 [US$629.37]), and it gained more QALYs (4.969 vs 4.755). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was THB 108,508/QALY (US$3451.26/QALY). Early initiation of sacubitril-valsartan treatment was more cost effective than delayed treatment. Sensitivity analyses revealed that at a level of willingness to pay of THB 160,000/QALY (US$5089/QALY), sacubitril-valsartan was a cost-effective strategy of about 60%. CONCLUSIONS: Sacubitril-valsartan is cost effective in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

Long-term registries should be pursued to decrease the uncertainty around long-term mortality.","output":"Cost-Utility Analysis of Sacubitril-Valsartan Compared with Enalapril Treatment in Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in Thailand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND During endoscopic surgical procedures, surgeons must manipulate an endoscope inside the body cavity to observe a surgical area while estimating the distance between that area and the surgical instruments by reference to a monitor on which the movement and size of the surgical instruments are displayed in 2-D endoscopic images. Therefore, there is a risk of the endoscope or instruments physically damaging body tissues. To overcome this problem, we developed a ?5-mm, 3-D endoscope using a single 1/10-inch CCD camera and pneumatic vibration mechanism. METHODS The 3-D endoscope proposed in this paper consists of an outer and inner sleeve, a 1/10-inch CCD camera attached to its distal end, and a pneumatic vibration mechanism attached to its proximal end. This endoscope can acquire left and right endoscopic images for stereovision in synchrony with the periodical motion generated by the vibration mechanism. We measured the displacement at the proximal and distal end of the 3-D endoscope simultaneously, and evaluated the feasibility of its use in vivo. RESULTS The displacement at the distal end of the endoscope to which the CCD camera is attached was approximately 0.25 mm. The timing when the displacement of the CCD camera was at maximal amplitude coincided with the timing when the displacement of its proximal end was at maximal amplitude. In the in vivo experiment, this 3-D endoscope can provide clear 3-D images of the surgical area. CONCLUSIONS The developed 3-D endoscope that uses a single CCD camera and pneumatic vibration mechanism can successfully visualize internal organs inside the body even though the CCD camera is moved by the vibration. Therefore, the risk of damage to fragile body tissues can be significantly decreased.","output":"3-D endoscope using a single CCD camera and pneumatic vibration mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A significant decline in the admission to intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) has been noted in Italy during the COVID-19 outbreak.

In this multicenter study conducted in six ICCUs, we enrolled consecutive adult patients admitted to ICCU in three specific time intervals: from February 8 to March 9, 2020 [before national lockdown (pre-LD)], from March 10 to April 9, 2020 [during the first period of national lockdown (in-LD)] and from May 18 to June 17, 2020 [soon after the end of all containment measures (after-LD)]. Compared to pre-LD, in-LD was associated with a significant drop in the admission to ICCU for all causes (- 35%) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS; - 49%), with a rebound soon after-LD. The in-LD reduction was greater for women (- 49%) and NSTEMI (- 61%) compared to men (- 28%) and STEMI (- 33%).

We aimed at identifying the variables associated with psychological distress during the lockdown between April and May 2020 in the Italian academic population. We conducted a multicenter cross-sectional online survey (IO CONTO 2020) within five Italian universities. Among about 240,000 individuals invited to participate through institutional communications, 18 120 filled the questionnaire. Psychological distress was measured by the self-administered Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The covariates collected included demographic and lifestyle characteristics, trust in government, doctors and scientists. Associations of covariates with influenza-like symptoms or positive COVID-19 test and with psychological distress were assessed by multiple regression models at the local level; a meta-analysis of the results was then performed. Severe levels of anxiety or depression were reported by 20% of the sample and were associated with being a student or having a lower income, irrespective of their health condition and worries about contracting the virus. The probability of being severely anxious or depressed also depended on physical activity: compared to those never exercising, the highest OR being for those who stopped during lockdown (1.53; 95% CI, 1.28 to 1.84) and the lowest for those who continued (0.78; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.95). Up to 21% of severe cases of anxiety or depression might have been avoided if during lockdown participants had continued to exercise as before. Socioeconomic insecurity contributes to increase mental problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic and to the measures to contain it. Maintaining or introducing an adequate level of physical activity is likely to mitigate such detrimental effects. Promoting safe practice of physical activity should remain a public health priority to reduce health risks during the pandemic.","output":"Psychological distress in the academic population and its association with socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: Results from a large multicenter Italian study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The protein coded by the open-reading-frame 3a of SARS coronavirus has been demonstrated to form a cation-selective channel that may become expressed in the infected cell.

Various drugs found in Chinese herbs that are well known as anticancer agents also have an antiviral potency.

Kaempferol derivatives with rhamnose residue also seem to be quite effective.

In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms.

The Neurostimulation Appropriateness Consensus Committee (NACC) has recommended that the placement of percutaneous SCS leads be performed in an awake patient capable of providing feedback. It is not currently known how commonly this recommendation is adhered to by physicians in clinical practice. This article presents the findings of a survey designed to answer this important question. METHODS: We conducted a survey of the active membership of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) and the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) regarding practice patterns with SCS therapy. We analyzed the percent of respondents who indicated that they use deep sedation and general anesthesia during SCS placement as well as any reported complications. RESULTS: Many practitioners frequently utilize deep sedation as well as general anesthesia when performing SCS implants. Our findings demonstrate that 77% of physicians reported that they utilize deep sedation for permanent SCS implants at times, and 45% of physicians reported the use of general anesthesia for 10 kHz implants. Additionally, 94% of physicians reported that they have never had a complication related to the use of general anesthesia for a spinal cord stimulator placement. CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides initial data on SCS practices among a large cohort of clinicians who utilize SCS. SCS lead placement under deep sedation and general anesthesia appears to be common practice for many physicians who perform implants. This survey should stimulate further research on this topic, given that the current safety guidelines and the rate of physicians reporting the use of deep sedation and general anesthesia for spinal cord stimulator placement remain at odds.","output":"Percutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation Lead Placement Under Deep Sedation and General Anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) were selected which reacted with bovine enteric coronavirus S and HE.

In particular, the authors attempt to: (1) measure resources consumption and waste generation toward companies' and policymakers' sustainable evaluations;(2) enhance consumers' education in the field of agri-food resilience and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach: MFA is applied to the entire Italian sector of beef consumed as packaged fresh product in 2020, during the Covid-19 pandemic. The analysis regards bovine, which represent roughly one-third of the national meat flow. To collect data, bottom-up and top-down mixed approach is applied. Subsequently, MFA results are used to calculate the wastage-related losses in terms of embedded natural resources (e.g. water, energy). Findings: In 2020, it results that the Italian meat industry slaughtered more than 1.15 Mt of bovine to produce approximately 0.29 Mt of fresh meat, 0.69 Mt of by-products and over 0.015 Mt of food waste at households, while 0.15 Mt of beef meat is destined to catering services and food industry (out-of-boundaries). In terms of hidden natural resources, it emerged that, on average, more than 94bn m3 of water, approximately 101,000 TJ of energy and over 11,500 t of PET and PE trays are required to sustain the entire beef system. Originality/value: This research is one of the few studies proposing MFA methodology as a tool to measure food waste and hidden associated flows in the agri-food sector.

However, most reports lack data on the metabolic syndrome itself. This study investigated prospectively the relationship between respiratory deterioration and the presence of metabolic syndrome or abdominal adiposity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study analysing patients with respiratory symptoms who presented at a local emergency department in the Netherlands. The influence of abdominal adiposityassessed by an increased waistChip ratioand metabolic syndrome on respiratory deterioration and the length of hospital stay were analysed with multivariable logistic regressions and Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: In total, 166 patients were analysed, of whom 86 (52%) tested positive for COVID-19. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome did not differ between patients with COVID-19 with and without the need for intubation or level of supportive care (37.5% vs 48.4%, p=0.338). In contrast, abdominal adiposity is an independent risk factor for respiratory distress in COVID-19, adjusted for metabolic syndrome, age, gender and BMI (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20, p=0.014). CONCLUSION: This study shows that abdominal adiposity, and not the presence of metabolic syndrome, is associated with clinical deterioration in COVID-19.

RECENT FINDINGS The efficacy of NIV is variable depending on the cause of the episode of ARF. In community-acquired pneumonia, NIV is often associated with poor response, with better response in patients with preexisting cardiac or respiratory disease. In patients with pandemic influenza H1N1 and severe ARF, NIV has been associated with high failure rates but relatively favorable mortality. In acute respiratory distress syndrome, NIV should be used very cautiously and restricted to patients with mild-moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome without shock or metabolic acidosis due to the high failure rate observed in several reports. Despite limited evidence, NIV may improve the outcomes of patients with chest trauma and severe ARF. In postoperative ARF, both continuous positive airway pressure and NIV are effective to improve clinical outcomes, particularly in those with abdominal, cardiac, and thoracic surgery. SUMMARY Although patients with severe hypoxemic ARF are, in general, less likely to be intubated when NIV is used, the efficacy is different among these heterogeneous populations. Therefore, NIV is not routinely recommended in all patients with severe hypoxemic ARF.","output":"Noninvasive ventilation for acute respiratory failure."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book covers deep researches from different perspectives and disciplines upon Covid-19 pandemic impacts on social, legal, economic, cultural issues by successful and expert researchers in their field.

Treatment of CPTP has been a clinical challenge and the underlying mechanisms of CPTP remain elusive. Recently, sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling has been shown to be associated with various pain states but its role in the pathogenesis of CPTP is still unclear. Methods CPTP was induced in rats by thoracotomy. Rats were divided into CPTP group and non-CPTP group based on the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT). Rats were administered with Shh signaling inhibitor cyclopamine and activator smoothened agonist (SAG), and then evaluated by MWT and cold allodynia testing. The expressions of Shh signaling (Shh ligand, patched and smoothened receptor, Gli transcription factors), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (Trk-B), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt) in rat T4-5 spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) were detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results The expression of Shh signaling significantly increased and the BDNF/TrkB pathway was activated in T4-5 SDH of CPTP rats. Cyclopamine attenuated hyperalgesia and down-regulated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt in CPTP rats. SAG induced hyperalgesia in non-CPTP rats and elevated the expressions of Gil1, BDNF, p-TrkB, p-PI3K and p-Akt.

We determined the prevalence of persistent pain following primary hip or knee replacement and its association with disorders of glucose metabolism, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and obesity. PATIENTS AND METHODS The incidence of pain in the operated joint was surveyed 1-2 years after primary hip replacement (74 patients (4 bilateral)) or primary knee replacement (119 patients (19 bilateral)) in 193 osteoarthritis patients who had participated in a prospective study on perioperative hyperglycemia. Of the 155 patients who completed the survey, 21 had undergone further joint replacement surgery during the follow-up and were excluded, leaving 134 patients for analysis. Persistent pain was defined as daily pain in the operated joint that had lasted over 3 months. Factors associated with persistent pain were evaluated using binary logistic regression with adjustment for age, sex, and operated joint. RESULTS 49 of the 134 patients (37%) had a painful joint and 18 of them (14%) had persistent pain. A greater proportion of knee patients than hip patients had a painful joint (46% vs. 24%; p = 0.01) and persistent pain (20% vs. 4%; p = 0.007). Previously diagnosed diabetes was strongly associated with persistent pain (5/19 vs. 13/115 in those without; adjusted OR = 8, 95% CI: 2-38) whereas MetS and obesity were not. However, severely obese patients (BMI  35) had a painful joint (but not persistent pain) more often than patients with BMI < 30 (14/21 vs. 18/71; adjusted OR = 5, 95% CI: 2-15).

METHOD Patients with Crohn's disease who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2007 were identified. Pathology slides were reviewed for the presence, number and location of granulomas in four representative slides from each specimen. RESULTS Two-hundred and seven patients were identified. At a mean follow up of 14 months, 39 patients had a recurrence, 22 (57%) of whom underwent reoperation. Ninety-four (45%) patients had granulomas present in the surgical specimen. Patients with granulomas were younger (P<0.001), had a lower preoperative body mass index (P=0.037), were more likely to be female (P=0.017) and were more likely to have extra-intestinal manifestations (P=0.026) or perianal disease (P=0.012). Sites of disease and procedures performed were similar in both groups. Disease recurrence and reoperative rates were similar in both groups, as were length of stay and morbidity rates. The average number of granulomas present in each sampled pathology slide was 7.2, and there was no correlation between number of granulomas and disease severity. No link was found between the depth of involvement of the granulomas and fistulizing or stricturing disease.

METHODS In a single-arm trial, participants aged 15-24 years received 48 weeks of a combination intervention, comprising daily 2-way text message medication reminders plus peer navigation. The primary outcome measure was viral suppression less than 200 copies/mL. The secondary outcome measures included self-reported adherence on a visual analog scale and medication possession ratio, each dichotomized as 90% (good) or <90% (poor) adherence. The outcomes were analyzed using McNemar test. Retention in care, intervention feasibility and acceptability, and participants' satisfaction were also assessed. RESULTS Forty YWH (50% male participants) were enrolled: mean age 19.9 years (SD = 2.5), 55% perinatally infected, and 35% virologically suppressed at baseline. Compared with baseline, the odds of virologic suppression was higher at 24 weeks (odds ratio = 14.00, P < 0.001) and 48 weeks (odds ratio = 6.00, P = 0.013). Self-reported adherence (90%) increased from baseline at 24 weeks (63%, P = 0.008) and 48 weeks (68%, P = 0.031). Medication possession ratio 90% increased at weeks 24 and 48 (85% and 80%, respectively), achieving statistical significance at 24 weeks alone (P = 0.022). Retention in care at 48 weeks was 87.5%.

This dosing schedule is associated with inhibition of seroconversion following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, in contrast to the high levels of seroconversion following treatment with alemtuzumab and cladribine tablets. A number of emerging reports suggest that repopulation of 1-3% B cells facilitates seroconversion after CD20-depletion. The frequency of this occurring following repeated ocrelizumab treatment, after other DMT, and after treatment cessation is largely unknown. MethodsRelapse data, lymphocyte and CD19 B cell numbers were extracted from phase II ocrelizumab extension study (NCT00676715) data supplied by the manufacturer via the Vivli Inc, trial data-request portal. Repopulation data of oral cladribine from the phase III CLARITY study (NCT00213135) was supplied by the European Medicines Agency; and the alemtuzumab phase III CARE-MS I (NCT00530348) and CARE-MS II (NCT00548405) trial data were supplied by the manufacturer via the clinicalstudydatarequest.com portal. ResultsOnly 3-5% of people with MS exhibit 1% B cells at 6 months after the last infusion following 3-4 cycles of ocrelizumab, compared to 50-55% at 9 months, and 85-90% at 12 months. During this time relapses occurred at consistent disease breakthrough rates compared to people during standard therapy. In contrast most people (90-100%) exhibited more than 1% B cells during treatment with either cladribine or alemtuzumab. ConclusionsFew people repopulate peripheral B cells with standard ocrelizumab dosing, however an extending the dosing interval by 3-6 months may allow many more people to potentially seroconvert in the relative absence of excess relapse-activity. Most people demonstrate B cell repletion within 3 months of the last treatment of alemtuzumab and cladribine.

Most methods to understand housing composition are based on survey or census data, and there is currently no reproducible methodology for creating population-level household composition measures using linked administrative data. METHODS: Using existing, and more recent enhancements to the address-data linkage methods in the SAIL Databank using Residential Anonymised Linking Fields we linked individuals to properties using the anonymised Welsh Demographic Service data in the SAIL Databank. We defined households, household size, and household composition measures based on adult to child relationships, and age differences between residents to create relative age measures. RESULTS: Two relative age-based algorithms were developed and returned similar results when applied to population and household-level data, describing household composition for 3.1 million individuals within 1.2 million households in Wales. Developed methods describe binary, and count level generational household composition measures. CONCLUSIONS: Improved residential anonymised linkage field methods in SAIL have led to improved property-level data linkage, allowing the design and application of household composition measures that assign individuals to shared residences and allow the description of household composition across Wales. The reproducible methods create longitudinal, household-level composition measures at a population-level using linked administrative data.

These include clinical condition, abdominal pain not localized at the wound, C-reactive protein level and respiratory rate. The accuracy of each was compared. METHOD Data of all patients from five Dutch centres operated on between 16 October 2007 and 1 November 2009 with an anastomosis in the colon or rectum were entered into a prospectively maintained database. RESULTS In total, 782 patients were included of whom 81 (10.4%) had a clinically relevant anastomotic leakage. The DULK score gave an overall sensitivity of 97% for anastomotic leakage, overall specificity of 53%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 16% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99%. The modified DULK score used clinical condition, abdominal pain not localized at the wound, C-reactive protein level and respiratory rate.

DESIGN A total of 71 healthy volunteers participated. The FPLR, biceps reflex, brachioradialis reflex, and patellar tendon reflex of each participant were tested bilaterally and rated by eight examiners (four experienced, four inexperienced). For intrarater reliability evaluation, five examiners rated the reflexes of four volunteers at four different points in time. RESULTS Analysis of the interrater reliability with Gwet's AC1 demonstrated almost perfect agreement for FPLR (Gwet's AC1 = 0.90), biceps reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.90), and patellar tendon reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.95) when using binary data (reflex present vs. absent). Only fair agreement was found for the brachioradialis reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.56). Experienced raters had a higher agreement than inexperienced raters did when rating the biceps reflex and the patellar tendon reflex. The intrarater reliability was almost perfect for the patellar tendon reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.94), followed by the FPLR (Gwet's AC1 = 0.83) with substantial agreement and the biceps reflex (Gwet's AC1 = 0.57) with moderate agreement.

Methods: This observational cross-sectional study was conducted in the Louisiana State University Medicine Clinic from September 2020 to December 2020. Intent to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 and influenza virus was assessed through a brief questionnaire. Additionally, hesitancy and attitudes regarding vaccines were ascertained using validated 5-point Likert scales. In total, 280 patients completed the questionnaire. Results: A total of 248 patients were included in the final analysis. Overall 167 (67%, 95% CI = 61.1-73.0%) of patients were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while only 19.3% (95% CI = 14.4-24.5%) were unsure or did not intend to be vaccinated against the influenza vaccine. Reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy included concern regarding side effects, fear of getting sick from the vaccine, and the absence of vaccine recommendations from their doctor. Concerningly, African American patients demonstrated decreased likelihood of receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Conclusion: This survey revealed that only 1 in 3 adults intended to be vaccinated against COVID-19, while 8 out of 10 adults intended to receive the influenza vaccine.

Upon viral invasion, the innate immune system responds rapidly and plays a key role in activating the adaptive immune system. In the innate immune system, the interactions between pathogen-associated molecular patterns and host pattern recognition receptors activate multiple signaling pathways in immune cells and induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons to elicit antiviral responses. Macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells are the principal innate immune components that exert antiviral activities. In this review, the current understanding of innate immunity contributing to the restriction of RNA viral infections was briefly summarized. Besides the main role of immune cells in combating viral infection, the intercellular transfer of pathogen and host-derived materials and their epigenetic and metabolic interactions associated with innate immunity was discussed.

Comparison with current COVID data identified 291 proteins that are altered at protein or transcript level in SARS-CoV-2 infection, with 191 being known autoantigens. These known and putative autoantigens are significantly associated with viral replication and trafficking processes, including gene expression, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, mRNA metabolism, translation, vesicle and vesicle-mediated transport, and apoptosis. They are also associated with cytoskeleton, platelet degranulation, IL-12 signaling, and smooth muscle contraction. Host proteins that interact with and that are perturbed by viral proteins are a major source of autoantigens.

By using a questionnaire (with a set of 26 numbers of questions) in the platform of Google form, 282 numbers of responses from under graduate students of College of Veterinary Science, Guwahati and Lakhimpur College of Veterinary Science of Assam Agricultural University were obtained. The findings of this study offer useful opinions and suggestions of under-graduate students regarding the E-learning process which will facilitate better and efficient usage of the E-learning system during the COVID-19 like pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 Pandemic and E-learning: Perceptions of Under Graduate Veterinary Students of Assam"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Predictively diagnosing infectious diseases helps in providing better treatment and enhances the prevention and control of such diseases. This study uses actual data from a hospital. A multiple infectious disease diagnostic model (MIDDM) is designed for conducting multi-classification of infectious diseases so as to assist in clinical infectious-disease decision-making. METHODS: Based on actual hospital medical records of infectious diseases from December 2012 to December 2020, a deep learning model for multi-classification research on infectious diseases is constructed. The data includes 20,620 cases covering seven types of infectious diseases, including outpatients and inpatients, of which training data accounted for 80%, i.e., 16,496 cases, and test data accounted for 20%, i.e., 4124 cases. Through the auto-encoder, data normalization and sparse data densification processing are carried out to improve the model training effect. A residual network and attention mechanism are introduced into the MIDDM model to improve the performance of the model. RESULT: MIDDM achieved improved prediction results in diagnosing seven kinds of infectious diseases. In the case of similar disease diagnosis characteristics and similar interference factors, the prediction accuracy of disease classification with more sample data is significantly higher than the prediction accuracy of disease classification with fewer sample data. For instance, the training data for viral hepatitis, influenza, and hand foot and mouth disease were 2954, 3924, and 3015 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were 99.86%, 98.47%, and 97.31%. There is less training data for syphilis, infectious diarrhea, and measles, i.e., 1208, 575, and 190 respectively and the corresponding test accuracy rates were noticeably lower, i.e., 83.03%, 87.30%, and42.11%. We also compared the MIDDM model with the models used in other studies. Using the same input data, taking viral hepatitis as an example, the accuracy of MIDDM is 99.44%, which is significantly higher than that of XGBoost (96.19%), Decision tree (90.13%), Bayesian method (85.19%), and logistic regression (91.26%). Other diseases were also significantly better predicted by MIDDM than by these three models. CONCLUSION: The application of the MIDDM model to multi-class diagnosis and prediction of infectious diseases can improve the accuracy of infectious-disease diagnosis. However, these results need to be further confirmed via clinical randomized controlled trials.","output":"Deep learning model for multi-classification of infectious diseases from unstructured electronic medical records"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"KEY POINTS: The effectiveness of pentavalent rotavirus vaccine against rotavirus-associated hospitalization was more than 90% 4 years after introduction into the national immunization program in Finland. A major impact on hospitalization for all-cause gastroenteritis was observed also. BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccination with exclusive use of RotaTeq was added to the National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Finland in September 2009. The objective of our study was to estimate the effectiveness and impact of RotaTeq after 4 years of follow-up. METHODS: Between 2009 and 2013, we conducted a prospective surveillance study of children aged <16 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and admitted in 2 hospitals in Finland. Rotavirus and other gastroenteritis viruses were detected in stool samples by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The effectiveness of RotaTeq was investigated by using a case-control design; wild-type rotavirus-positive children were classified as cases and rotavirus-negative children as controls. Hospital discharge records were used to estimate the impact of RotaTeq on rotavirus-associated AGE (RV-AGE) and all-cause AGE (AC-AGE) hospitalizations of age-eligible children in the NIP by comparing the prevaccination (2001C2006) and post-NIP seasons (2009C2013). RESULTS: The crude estimate of the effectiveness of RotaTeq to prevent RV-AGE hospitalization in NIP age-eligible children was 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%C98.4%). No change in prevalent wild-type rotavirus genotypes was observed. Vaccine-derived rotaviruses were detected in 8% of the children with RV-AGE, with a probable causal association in 2 children. Hospital discharge records revealed that RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations in children aged <16 years decreased in the two post-NIP seasons by 79% and 58%, respectively, compared to those in the prevaccination seasons. CONCLUSIONS: Over 4 years of follow-up, high rotavirus vaccine coverage in the NIP (>95%) has led to a major reduction in RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations without a resurgence of rotavirus activity. However, rotavirus continues to circulate in older unvaccinated children.","output":"Sustained High Effectiveness of RotaTeq on Hospitalizations Attributable to Rotavirus-Associated Gastroenteritis During 4 Years in Finland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disruption of viral fusion represents a viable, albeit under-explored, target for HIV therapeutics.

Postoperative pain is an undesirable clinical outcome impairing daily activity of 22.5% of patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative acute and chronic pain via inflammatory markers as an objective assessment following tacks or glue mesh fixation in TEP repair. METHODS Sixty-six (66) patients with unilateral uncomplicated inguinal hernia were randomized into 34 patients in the tacker and 32 patients in cyanoacrylate glue mesh fixation in TEP repair. The extent of surgical trauma was evaluated by measuring inflammatory markers of C-reactive protein, white blood cell count at 48 h, and ESR at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative acute and chronic pain was assessed by recording the visual analogue scale scores and surgical complications were recorded over 3 months of the study period. RESULTS The median CRP and WBC levels at postoperative 48 h in both groups raised significantly from the baseline values (p < 0.05), however, did not differ significantly between the two study groups at 48 h (p > 0.05). The median ESR level increased significantly at 3 months postoperatively from baseline in the glue mesh fixation group only (p < 0.05), however, did not differ significantly between the two study groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference for VAS scores at all timelines between the tacker and glue mesh fixation group (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Cyanoacrylate glue mesh fixation technique as an alternative method to mechanical fixation in TEP repair is comparable to tacker and can be considered to be safe and feasible.","output":"Tackers versus glue mesh fixation: an objective assessment of postoperative acute and chronic pain using inflammatory markers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for the healthcare system. In order to meet capacity demands, hospitals around the world suspended surgeries deemed to be elective. In hand surgery, there are numerous pathologies treated on an elective basis, but a delay or absence of care may result in poorer outcomes. We present here an ethical framework for prioritizing elective surgery during a period of resource scarcity. Instead of using the term elective, we define procedures that can be safely delayed based on three considerations. First, a safe delay is only possible if deferral will not result in permanent injury. Second, a delay in care will come with tolerable costs and impositions that can be appropriately managed in the future. Third, a safe delay will preserve the bioethical principle of patient autonomy. In considering these criteria, three case examples are discussed taking into account individual patient characteristics and the pathophysiology of the condition.

In a previous study, we found that ?3-endonexin expressed in vascular endothelial cells was involved in promoting proliferation and angiogenesis partially by facilitating VEGF expression. However, it still remains unclear if ?3-endonexin in vascular endothelial cells also employs other mechanisms in regulating angiogenesis. In this study, we utilized a ?3-endonexin mutant (M2) carrying a defective nuclear localization sequence to disrupt its nuclear localization and evaluated its ability to promote HUVEC proliferation and formation of tube-like vascular structures. In addition, we performed yeast 2-hybrid assay to identify potential functional effectors of ?3-endonexin. We found that both wild type ?3-endonexin and the M2 mutant could localize to centrosomes in HUVECs and both were able to promote HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures. However, the M2 mutant failed to promote VEGF expression in HUVECs. Further, we found that both wild type ?3-endonexin and the M2 mutant were capable of binding to ninein, a centrosomal protein with a proangiogenic effect. Knockdown of ninein in HUVECs impeded centrosome localization of wild type ?3-endonexin and the M2 mutant and inhibited HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures. Taken together, these findings suggest that ?3-endonexin interacts with centrosome ninein and contributes to HUVEC proliferation and formation of vascular structures.","output":"?3-Endonexin interacts with ninein in vascular endothelial cells to promote angiogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Adherence to Covid-19 safety measures reduces the spread of the pathogen and lowers mortality rates.

Adherence was negatively predicted by depression and anxiety. Perceptions of governmental communication as credible and honest, government communication being guided by political interests, the feeling of being well informed, and perceived country-level freedom positively predicted self-reported adherence. Perceived country-level justice negatively predicted adherence, and perceived country-wide wealth was unrelated to it.

However, the significant growth in the body of literature on the legal perspectives on IBSA, and the media coverage of high profile cases have not been equally met with appreciable victimization studies. Meanwhile, the need for a victim-centered approach in studying IBSA in Nigeria is underscored by the pervasiveness and normalization of sexual violence as a result of societal attitudes about gender and sexuality in the country. Therefore, this study explored the social and psychological implications of IBSA victimization. METHODS: Using qualitative methods, 27 adult women whose sexual images have been non-consensually shared publicly through online channels were purposively selected and interviewed for the study, between September 2019 and April 2020, and a thematic analysis of the participants narratives carried out. RESULTS: Victims of IBSA were found to be subjected to higher social condemnation, stigmatization, and isolation based on greater attribution of blames to them by their social network. Evidences of institutional re-victimization were documented. Victims also reported self-blame, paranoia, anger, guilt, depression, suicidal ideation and attempt in dealing with the abuse, secondary victimization, and social isolation. CONCLUSION: IBSA victims are faced with peculiar social and psychological consequences which separate them from victims of other forms of sexual abuse.

The search terms \\"Grasper Integrated Flexible Cystoscope,\\" and \\"Isiris,\\" within the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and EMBASE were searched. RESULTS: In this review, a cumulative total experience (10 publications) included 970 \\"SUGIFC\\" procedures (755 patients). However, only 366/970 procedures were actually used for \\"ureteral stent removal,\\" with the remainder being surveillance cystoscopy only (603/970) or foreign body retrieval (1/970).

Some animals, such as llamas, manufacture heavy-chain antibodies that have a single variable domain (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH/VL) as opposed to typical antibodies. Nanobodies are antigen-specific, single-domain, changeable segments of camelid heavy chain-only antibodies that are recombinantly produced. These types of antibodies exhibit a wide range of strong physical and chemical properties, like high solubility, and stability. The VHH's high-affinity attachment to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) allowed the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

It is crucial for providers to understand whether pediatric patients are at risk for violent mechanisms, such as rape, assault, or other abuse. Therefore, we sought to perform a large database analysis of pediatric and adolescent female genitalia trauma, comparing mechanisms of injury (i.e., sexual abuse) and need for operative intervention between adolescent and pediatric cohorts. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank was queried (years 2007C2015) for female patients  16 years old with external genitalia (vaginal or vulvar) trauma. Two groups were compared: pediatrics (< 12 years old) and adolescents (12C16 years old). RESULTS: Out of 303,992 female patients, 3206 (1.1%) were identified to have genitalia trauma with the majority being pediatric patients (92.1%) and with injury to the vagina (62.6%). Pediatric patients with vaginal injury were less likely to be victims of rape (4.1% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001) and assault (2.1% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001) but more likely to be victims of other abuse (9.5% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.003). More of the adolescent patients with vaginal trauma required repair (58.7% vs. 43.2%, p < 0.001). Pediatric patients with injury to the vulva were less likely to be victims of rape (0.7% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.01) and motor vehicle accidents (4.2% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001).

Unlike increased activation of ICOS-1+ CD4+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients (n=21), T cells in severe patients showed impaired activation, low IFN-?3 production and high functional exhaustion, which correlated with significantly down-regulated HLA-DR expression in monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells.

Although the COVID-19 infection rate in Japan is low compared with Europe and the United States, by the end of 2020, several infected people died in ambulances because they could not find hospitals to accept them. Our study aimed to examine the Japanese healthcare system's capacity to accommodate critically ill COVID-19 patients during the pandemic. We created a model to estimate bed and staff capacity at 3 levels of pandemic response (conventional, contingency, and crisis), as defined by the US National Academy of Medicine, and the function of Japan's healthcare system at each level. We then compared our estimates of the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care at peak times with the national health system capacity using expert panel data. Our findings suggest that Japan's healthcare system currently can accommodate only a limited number of critically ill COVID-19 patients. It could accommodate the surge of pandemic demands by converting nonintensive care unit beds to critical care beds and using nonintensive care unit staff for critical care. However, bed and staff capacity should not be expanded uniformly, so that the limited number of physicians and nurses are allocated efficiently and so staffing does not become the bottleneck of the expansion. Training and deploying physicians and nurses to provide immediate intensive care is essential. The key is to introduce and implement the concept and mechanism of tiered staffing in the Japanese healthcare system.

Objective: To compare mood and stress of those that lived alone or together with others during the COVID-19 lockdown, and to investigate the impact on perceived immune fitness and presence and severity of COVID-19 related symptoms. Methods: An online survey among Dutch adults compared the period before the lockdown (15 JanuaryC14 March 2020) with the lockdown period (15 MarchC11 May 2020) [2]. Participants indicated whether they lived alone or together with others during the lockdown. Mood (anxiety, depression, fatigue, hostility, loneliness and happiness) and stress was assessed via 1-item scales [3]. Perceived immune fitness and quality of life was measured using a scale ranging from 0 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) [3,4]. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms was assessed using the COVID-19 Symptoms Scale [2]. Items could be rated as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). The sum score served as severity score, and the number of items with a score > 0 as COVID-19 symptom presence score. Differences between outcomes of the groups that lived alone or lived together during lockdown were compared with Independent-Samples Mann-Whitney U tests. For each variable, difference scores (, lockdown C before lockdown) were calculated and compared between the groups with analysis of variance. Pearson's correlations were calculated between difference scores. Results: Data of N=505 participants were analyzed. The mean (SD) age was 38.2 (15.8), and 65.5% of the sample were female. During the lockdown period, 115 (22.8%) lived alone and 390 (77.2%) lived together with others. The mean (SD) number of household members was 2.8 (1.6), with a range of 1 to 12. During the lockdown, individuals that lived alone reported significantly higher ratings (p<0.05) of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and significantly lower scores on happiness and quality of life compared to the group that lived together with others. Comparing difference scores (during lockdown C before lockdown) of both groups revealed that the group that lived alone reported a significant greater increase in loneliness (p=0.002), which was accompanied by a significant increase in reported COVID-19 symptoms (presence: p=0.019, severity: p=0.041), whereas a small decrease in symptom presence and severity was seen among the lived together group. The  loneliness scores correlated significantly with  perceived immune fitness (r = -0.239, p<0.0001) and  presence (r = 0.144, p=0.001) and  severity (r = 0.160, p<0.0001) of COVID-19 symptoms. Conclusions: Living alone and associated feelings of loneliness have a negative impact on mood, perceived immune fitness, and the presence and severity of COVID-19 symptoms. Loneliness is an important determinant of mental health, though often underestimated. Future research should investigate how the impact of increased social support, for example with the aid of mobile technology, can counteract loneliness and thereby improve health and quality of life.

We conducted a longitudinal study of the influence of repeated mild lockdowns during two emergency declarations in Japan, in May 2020 and February 2021. The analyses included 7893 people who participated in all online surveys. During repeated mild lockdowns, mental and physical symptoms decreased overall, while loneliness increased and social networks decreased. Subgroup analyses revealed that depression and suicidal ideation did not decrease only in the younger age group (aged 18C29 years) and that younger and middle-aged people (aged 18C49 years), women, people with a history of treatment for mental illness, and people who were socially disadvantaged in terms of income had higher levels of mental and physical symptoms at all survey times. Additionally, comprehensive extraction of the interaction structure between depression, demographic attributes, and psychosocial variables indicated that loneliness and social networks were most closely associated with depression. These results indicate that repeated lockdowns have cumulative negative effects on social isolation and loneliness and that susceptible populations, such as young people and those with high levels of loneliness, require special consideration during repeated lockdown situations.","output":"Mental health and social isolation under repeated mild lockdowns in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper explores the power dynamics in the process of Chinese seafarers' labour rights defence activities on social media during the crew change crisis caused by the COVID\\\\19 pandemic.

The current study evaluates the hotel safety perception by Portuguese and Spanish tourists during the COVID-19 pandemic. It discusses the differentiated changes needed to be implemented by the hotel industry to address each countrys tourists safety concerns. A sample of 533 Portuguese and Spanish hotel guests was inquired using an online questionnaire to assess safety perception and service needs under the COVID-19 situation by exploring seven critical dimensions: financial risk, front-desk digitalization, entertainment, front-desk service, hygiene and sanitation, hotel characteristics, and space management, and food and beverage service. The results show that there are differences regarding safety perception and preferences between Spanish and Portuguese hotel guests. Findings indicated that the differences spread across all categories with special incidence in hygiene-related factors. The differences vary with gender, and Women seem to be more sensitive to safety as they present more differences than men. The level of education and having children also affects the perception of hotel safety and the requisites of guests. The need to prove hygiene care and have the hotel certificate for COVID-19 emerged as key factors in restoring the clients trust. The research on the effects of pandemics on hotel guests safety perception is scarce. Therefore, the proposed framework for assessing hotel clients perceptions and the findings are particularly important for Iberian hotel managers to adopt an innovative approach and shape their offer to better address specific needs and preferences of Portuguese and Spanish clients in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. ? 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","output":"Factors Affecting Portuguese and Spanish Hotel Guests Safety Perception Under COVID-19: Insights for the Development of Personalized Hotel Offers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many industrialized nations have followed the lead of the United States (US) in reducing workers wages and cutting government safety nets, while giving their populaces the false impression that non-governmental organizations can meet the food and basic survival needs of their low-income residents.

The results indicated that wheelchair players demonstrated unique elbow and wrist kinematics, especially shorter total swing time, greater elbow flexion at preparation, lower wrist extension acceleration before impact, and smaller racket vibration at impact. Comparing to able-bodied players in standing, wheelchair players and players in sitting demonstrated significantly greater elbow joint flexion/extension angle, angular velocity, angular acceleration during extension, and wrist joint flexion angle. Wheelchair players also differ significantly with the players in sitting regarding elbow joint angular velocity and acceleration, and wrist joint flexion velocity. These adaptations and adjustments can be attributed to the missing lower extremity function and deficient trunk kinetic chain.

However, despite widespread implementation, most studies on symptom checkers have involved simulated patients. Only limited evidence currently exists about symptom checker safety or accuracy when used by real patients. We developed a new prototype symptom checker and assessed its safety and accuracy in a prospective cohort of patients presenting to primary care and emergency departments with new medical concerns. METHOD: A prospective cohort study was done to assess the prototypes performance. The cohort consisted of adult patients (16 years old) who presented to hospital emergency departments and family physician clinics. Primary outcomes were safety and accuracy of triage recommendations to seek hospital care, seek primary care, or manage symptoms at home. RESULTS: Data from 281 hospital patients and 300 clinic patients were collected and analyzed. Sensitivity to emergencies was 100% (10/10 encounters). Sensitivity to urgencies was 90% (73/81) and 97% (34/35) for hospital and primary care patients, respectively. The prototype was significantly more accurate than patients at triage (73% versus 58%, p<0.01). Compliance with triage recommendations in this cohort using this iteration of the symptom checker would have reduced hospital visits by 55% but cause potential harm in 2C3% from delay in care. INTERPRETATION: The prototype symptom checker was superior to patients in deciding the most appropriate treatment setting for medical issues. This symptom checker could reduce a significant number of unnecessary hospital visits, with accuracy and safety outcomes comparable to existing data on telephone triage.","output":"Performance of a new symptom checker in patient triage: Canadian cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Currently, there is a growing concern towards epidemiological and clinical research on functional gastrointestinal disorders. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is defined as a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, and altered bowel movements.

Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of IBS among medical students of Allama lqbal Medical College and to determine conditions and lifestyle habits that may act as significant risk factors for developing IBS. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted for over 5 months. A sample of 323 individuals was studied whereas the sampled individuals were selected using a \\"stratified random sampling technique\\". The study was conducted by collecting data through an online questionnaire during the global COVID pandemic. The questionnaire consisted of three parts.

In addition to older age, people living with CVD, stroke, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, and hypertension are at a particularly greater risk for severe forms of COVID-19 and its consequences. Meta-analysis indicates that hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and thrombotic complications have been observed as both the most prevalent and most dangerous co-morbidities in COVID-19 patients.

The world simply cannot wait for the next pandemic to invest in NCDs. Social determinants of health cannot be addressed only through the healthcare system, but a more holistic multisectoral approach with at its basis the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is needed to truly address social and economic inequalities and build more resilient systems. Yet there is reason for hope: the 2019 UN Political Declaration on UHC provides a strong framework for building more resilient health systems, with explicit calls for investment in NCDs and references to fiscal policies that put such investment firmly within reach. By further cementing the importance of addressing circulatory health in a future Framework Convention on Emergency Preparedness, WHO Member States can take concrete steps towards a pandemic-free future.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, symptoms at first admission were questioned in adult patients who applied to the Covid Outpatient Clinic between 21 December 2020 - 22 January 2021. A total of 43 complaints were analyzed in PCR test positive and negative patients. Results: 273 (62.0%) first application and 167 (38.0%) control applications were included in the study. The PCR test was positive in 16.5% of the first admissions. The most common complaints in the first admissions with positive PCR test were fatigue (73.0%), headache (64.9%), pain (32.2%), cough (56.8%), sore throat (51.4%), loss of appetite (45.9%) while 15.9% of them were asymptomatic. Odd's rates of significant complaints for PCR positivity were calculated as 2.607 for fever, 2.724 for anorexia, 2.051 for cough, 2.594 for loss of smell, and 2.243 for loss of strength. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a disease that affects many organs and systems. Comparing the admission symptoms with the PCR test results will contribute to the recognition of the disease at the initial stage.

Our previous studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus-like particles (VLPs) can be assembled using a recombinant baculovirus (rBV) expression system and such VLPs induce specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice after subcutaneous injection. Here, we investigated mucosal immune responses to SARS-CoV VLPs in a mouse model. Mice were immunized in parallel, intraperitoneally or intranasally, with VLPs alone or with VLPs plus cytosineCphosphateCguanosine (CpG). Immune responses, including the production of SARS-CoV-specific serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), were determined in mucosal secretions and tissues. Both immunizations induced SARS-CoV-specific IgG, although the levels of IgG in groups immunized via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route were higher. sIgA was detected in saliva in groups immunized intranasally but not in groups immunized intraperitoneally. CpG had an adjuvant effect on IgA production in genital tract washes when administered intranasally but only affected IgA production in faeces samples when administered intraperitoneally. In addition, IgA was also detected in mucosal tissues from the lung and intestine, while CpG induced an increased level of IgA in the intestine. Most importantly, neutralization antibodies were detected in sera after i.p. and intranasal (i.n.) immunizations. Secretions in genital tract washes from the i.n. group also showed neutralization activity. Furthermore, VLPs that were administered intraperitoneally elicited cellular immune responses as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay analyses. In summary, our study indicates that mucosal immunization with rBV SARS-CoV VLPs represent an effective means for eliciting protective systemic and mucosal immune responses against SARS-CoV, providing important information for vaccine design.","output":"Effect of mucosal and systemic immunization with virus-like particles of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity is associated with an increase prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms and diseases, such as depression. Based on the facts that pro-inflammatory cytokines are able to modulate behavior, and that obesity is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, inflammation has been hypothesized to contribute to the neuropsychiatric comorbidity in obese individuals. However, a causal link between inflammation and the development of neuropsychiatric symptoms is hard to establish in humans. Here, we used an inflammatory stimulus, i.e. the intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in a double-blind placebo-controlled design to determine the vulnerability of obese individuals to inflammation-induced behavioral changes. The hypothesis was that obese individuals would show heightened behavioral response compared to normal-weight subjects for the same inflammatory stimulus, reflecting an increased sensitivity to the behavioral effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines. LPS (dose 0.8 ng/kg body weight, adjusted for blood volume in obese subjects) and placebo (saline) were intravenously injected in 14 obese healthy subjects and 23 normal-weight healthy subjects in a within-subject, randomized, crossover design. LPS administration induced, in both groups, an acute increase in blood concentrations of cytokines (interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor- and IL-10), as well as in body temperature, cortisol, norepinephrine, sickness symptoms, fatigue, negative mood and state anxiety. There were little differences in the immune and behavioral responses to LPS between obese and normal-weight subjects, but the cortisol response to LPS was strongly attenuated in obese individuals. Higher percentage of body fat was related to a lower cortisol response to LPS. Taken together, the population of young and healthy obese individuals in this study did not exhibit an increased behavioral sensitivity to cytokines, but an attenuated cortisol response to the immune challenge.

One of the unique features of this virus, known as COVID coagulopathy, has been associated with bleeding and/or clotting diathesis in the setting of a prothrombotic state. This has put patients at risk for hemorrhagic complications such as frank disseminated intravascular coagulation, and antiphospholipid syndrome activation. This is a case of hemothorax as a rare complication of COVID-19 infection. Case Presentation This is the case of a 48 year old male with a history of ESRD requiring dialysis, who presented to our facility with shortness of breath. He was recently admitted a month prior to an outside facility for a dialysis catheter infection and was found to be COVID-19 positive. He received IV antibiotics and supplemental oxygen. He was discharged home with plans for IV antibiotics. He presented to our facility with five days of shortness of breath. In the ED he was afebrile, tachypneic and tested negative for COVID-19. Computed Tomography of the chest was significant for a moderate to large right pleural effusion with loculated components. The next day he underwent a thoracentesis and 600 cc of bloody pleural fluid was aspirated. He then underwent a VATS, decortication, pleurodesis a few days later as the effusion failed to resolve. Cytology of the initial thoracentesis was negative for malignant cells and pathology from the VATS was positive for fibrosis, hemorrhage with fibrin deposition and acute and chronic inflammation. Discussion Hemothorax as a complication of COVID -19 has yet to be described in the literature. Altered markers such as D-dimer and fibrinogen were associated with increased coagulation and thrombotic complications respectively. Furthermore, studies have reported intra-alveolar hemorrhages and GI bleeding in post-mortem analysis of COVID patients.

Our aim was to critically evaluate the safety of ibuprofen during the course of pediatric infectious disease in order to promote its appropriate use in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Ibuprofen is associated with severe necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) during chickenpox course. Pre-hospital use of ibuprofen seems to increase the risk of complicated pneumonia in children. Conflicting data have been published in septic children, while ibuprofen in the setting of Cystic Fibrosis (CF) exacerbations is safe and efficacious. No data is yet available for ibuprofen use during COVID-19 course. SUMMARY: Ibuprofen should not be recommended for chickenpox management. Due to possible higher risks of complicated pneumonia, we suggest caution on its use in children with respiratory symptoms. While it remains unclear whether ibuprofen may have harmful effects during systemic bacterial infection, its administration is recommended in CF course. Despite the lack of data, it is seems cautious to prefer the use of paracetamol during COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome in children.","output":"Serious infectious events and ibuprofen administration in pediatrics: a narrative review in the era of COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the degree to which political bias in medicine and study authors could explain the stark variation in Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)/Chloroquine (CQ) study favorability in the US compared to the rest of the world.SETTING: United States and Worldwide.PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 preprint and published papers between January 1, 2020 and July 26, 2020 with the terms Hydroxychloroquine and/or Chloroquine;267 met study criteria, of which 68 originated from the US. 68 control studies were randomly selected from the same time period to serve as a control subset for baseline COVID-19 publication trends and author characteristics, not related to HCQ/CQ.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HCQ/CQ study result favorability, with each recorded as favorable, unfavorable, or neutral. First and last main authors of each US study were entered into FollowTheMoney.org Website, to extract any history of political party donation, and to which political party.RESULTS: Of all US studies (68 total), 39/68 (57.4%) were unfavorable, with only 7/68 (10.3%) of US studies yielding favorable results. This was compared to 199 non-US studies, in with 66/199 (33.2%) were unfavorable, 69/199 (34.7%) favorable, and 64/199 (32.2%) neutral. Studies with at least one US main author were 20.4% (SE 0.053, P<0.05) more likely to report unfavorable results than non-US studies. US Studies with at least one main author donating to any political party were 25.6% (SE 0.085, p<0.01) more likely to have unfavorable results. US studies with at least one author donating to the Democratic party were 20.4% (SE 0.045, p<0.05) more likely to have unfavorable results.

Objective To investigate the ability of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) to predict mild and severe cases of COVID-19. Study design This retrospective cohort study included 140 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 18, 2020, to March 12, 2020. The study population was divided into two groups according to disease severity: a mild group (MG) (n = 107) and a severe group (SG) (n = 33). Data on demographic characteristics, baseline clinical characteristics, and the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT on admission were collected. Results Among the 140 patients, the levels of IL-6, CRP, and PCT increased in 95 (67.9 %), 91 (65.0 %), and 8 (5.7 %) patients on admission, respectively. The proportion of patients with increased IL-6, CRP, and PCT levels was significantly higher in the SG than in the MG. Cox proportional hazard model showed that IL-6 and CRP could be used as independent factors to predict the severity of COVID-19. Furthermore, patients with IL-6 > 32.1 pg/mL or CRP > 41.8 mg/L were more likely to have severe complications.

Results Patient A is a 51-year-old Haitian American woman who was admitted to inpatient psychiatry with symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, disorganized behavior, and suicidal ideation, as well as intermittent hypertensive episodes. After discharge, the hypertensive episodes persisted and were associated with feelings of impending doom, palpitations, and shortness of breath. While undergoing blood pressure management from her cardiologist, she was admitted to outpatient psychiatry, diagnosed with panic disorder, and tried on multiple medications (Mirtazapine, Trazodone, Hydroxyzine, Escitalopram, Sertraline). None of these medications relieved her symptoms, which gradually evolved from panic/anxiety/depression to derealization/depersonalization. Eventually, all her symptoms abated without medication. Patient B is a 61-year-old African American woman who was admitted to outpatient psychiatry with episodes of chest tightness, palpitations, and trembling, as well as insomnia and depressed mood; she too was diagnosed with panic disorder. She had previously been treated by her primary care doctor and in the emergency room with various benzodiazepines (Diazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam), but she was eventually stabilized on a regimen of Sertraline, Trazodone, and Gabapentin.

Tissue characteristics and pre- and post-management considerations may pose difficulties to reconstruction in the pediatric patient. Primary closure is the preferred surgical technique but is not always possible. Various techniques have been described for facilitating primary wound closure, by reducing tension from the skin wound margins. The authors use a tension-relief system in some challenging scalp wounds when simple primary closure cannot be achieved. This enables primary closure without tension on the surgical margins, and may thus preclude the need for other closure techniques such as tissue-expanders, grafts, and flaps. The authors describe our use of a tension-relief system in 21 pediatric patients treated during 2017-2020, for congenital deformities, vascular malformations and other skin lesions, traumatic wounds, burn scars, and complicated surgical wounds with and without hardware exposure. A tension-relief system is a prompt, simple-to-use, safe, and low-cost surgical solution that offers several advantages over other techniques when tension-free primary intention closure is not possible. These benefits include less extensive surgery, fewer surgeries and associated anesthesia, shorter treatment period and hospitalization, better scarring, lower distress and burden to patients and their families, better pain-control, the absence of donor-site with its comorbidities, and less bleeding and risk of damaging adjacent structures.

Faisalabad is an industrial city in the Punjab province of Pakistan, where donkeys are used for goods transportation. Working donkeys require regular farriery to avoid hoof and limb problems, including lameness. The perception of owners regarding the farriery needs of their donkeys, and the farriers understanding of quality farriery, play an important part in ensuring donkey welfare. In this study, owners were asked questions about lameness issues in their donkeys, farriery intervals, factors that they considered important in choosing a farrier, as well as problems that they experienced with farriery. Farriers were asked about their business structure, challenges, and the farriery requirements of donkeys in the region. Farriers reported a lack of training, meager wages, and that farriery is an unregulated industry in Pakistan. Owners provided mixed reports regarding the quality of farriery their animals received. Owners ranked the relationship with their farrier as the most important consideration when selecting a farrier, with cost not being a major factor. This study provides important information for interventional projects taking place in the region for the improvement of donkey welfare, and mitigation of lameness and foot-related problems. ABSTRACT: Quality farriery is essential to ensure donkey welfare, and many intervention programs in low-middle income countries (LMICs) train farriers, and educate owners, regarding the farriery needs of donkeys. It is essential for interventional programs to understand the perspectives of all stakeholders in donkey-owning communities. A cross-sectional questionnaire study was conducted in the Faisalabad region of Pakistan. Ten farriers and 55 donkey owners participated in the study. Farriers reported receiving no formal training for farriery, insufficient wages (PKR 65 or USD 0.36 per hoof) and the requirement to use traditional tools. Farriers reported an average shoeing time of 5 min per hoof and shoeing between three and 30 donkeys a day. Donkeys were mostly shod while they were harnessed to a cart. Six donkey-owning farriers reported shoeing their donkeys every 20 to 25 days. Owners reported varying shoeing intervals of 20 days to 90 days. Shoeing interval was also affected by seasonal and weather changes. Owners considered their relationship with farriers as the most important factor in choosing a farrier rather than cost. A majority (87%) of the owners reported lameness in their donkeys. The study provides important insights into the many challenges and opportunities in developing quality donkey farriery in the region.","output":"Cross-Sectional Questionnaire of Donkey Owners and Farriers Regarding Farriery Practices in the Faisalabad Region of Pakistan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epithelial characteristics underlying the differential susceptibility of chronic asthma to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) and other viral infections are currently unclear.

We found sexual dimorphism in the expression of SARS-CoV-2-related genes ACE2, TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, and SLC6A19. ACE2 receptor downregulation occurred specifically in females in Th2 high asthma, while proteases broadly assisting coronavirus and influenza viral entry, TMPRSS2, and TMPRSS4, were highly upregulated in both sexes. Overall, changes in SARS-CoV-2-related gene expression were specific to the Th2 high molecular endotype of asthma and different by asthma severity and airway location.

METHODS A total of 56 consecutive patients who underwent elective LS were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of PSVT after LS. In addition, patients with PSVT were divided into two groups: a PVT group and a non-PVT group. The preoperative and intraoperative clinical data were compared among the groups. RESULTS Thirty (53.6%) patients developed PSVT. The splenic vein diameter was the most useful predictor for the development of PSVT, and 10 mm was an accurate splenic vein diameter cut-off value for use as a predictive factor for PSVT. In addition, the splenic vein diameter was the most useful predictor of the development of PVT from splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), and 14 mm was found to be an accurate cut-off value. CONCLUSION PSVT is a common postoperative complication that is identified on enhanced computed tomography. The splenic vein diameter is not only a predictor of PSVT but also of the development of PVT from SVT.","output":"Predictors of portal and splenic vein thrombosis after laparoscopic splenectomy: a retrospective analysis of a single-center experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The articles in this special section focus on how we conduct work has and will change post COVID-19. Advances in pervasive computing are rapidly changing the way we work. Pervasive computing can improve the way workers connect into productive teams;it vastly improves the ability of organizations to collect and process data;and it provides new tools for using data in feedback loops that affect the physical or virtual world, both as personalized, small-scale interventions and as broad, largescale actions, and policy. These changes were accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a sudden and dramatic change in how we work.

Here we have used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, machine learning (ML), and free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations to elucidate the differences in RBD binding by the two viruses. Although only subtle differences were observed from the initial MD simulations of the two RBD-ACE2 complexes, ML identified the individual residues with the most distinctive ACE2 interactions, many of which have been highlighted in previous experimental studies. FEP calculations quantified the corresponding differences in binding free energies to ACE2, and examination of MD trajectories provided structural explanations for these differences. Lastly, the energetics of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations were studied, showing that the affinity of the RBD for ACE2 is increased by N501Y and E484K mutations but is slightly decreased by K417N.","output":"Critical interactions for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding to ACE2 identified by machine learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since its identification in 2003, grapevine Pinot gris virus (GPGV, Trichovirus) has now been detected in most grape-growing countries.

Methods A total of 132 vegetable samples including carrot, coriander, lettuce, parsley and radish were purchased monthly from three different markets in Marrakech from March 2017 to January 2018, pre-treated and subjected to microscopic and molecular analyses. Results Of the 132 samples of vegetables analyzed by qPCR, the overall rate of protozoan was 21.21% (28/132); 22 samples were found to be contaminated with T. gondii, 6 with G. duodenalis, and none was positive for C. parvum/hominis. Whereas, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining allowed the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in 3% (4/132) of examined samples.

In the absence of population registers and other surveillance systems, however, it is often difficult to measure. This is especially the case in historical populations. Compared to measures of fertility, nuptiality and mortality, then, migration processes are rather less studied. Recent studies in the English historical context have challenged long standing theoretical constructs concerning the relationship between migration and modernisation; gender and distance travelled; motivation for movement and the very nature of the movers themselves. Using a set of marriage registers for a large, agricultural county, this study explores intra-county migration among a predominantly young population over the period 1700 to 1836. The proportion of migrants is explored as well as the distance between home and marriage parishes. For perhaps the first time, chord diagrams are deployed for historical English migration data to visualise inter- and intra- regional/district migration. Although there are numerous limitations concerning the scope of the sample and the study, the evidence presented here broadly accords with recent studies of migration in pre-industrial England; and shows the potential to both use circular visualisation and exploit large scale samples of marriage registers to gain a further insight into a particular type of historical migration.","output":"Circular visualisation of historical migration in England in the long eighteenth-century"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Klastering persebaran pandemi COVID-19 di Jawa Timur dapat dilakukan dengan melihat dinamika data harian yang disajikan dalam situs resmi pemerintah Jawa Timur terkait informasi COVID-19 Sumber data untuk proses klastering adalah data jumlah orang dalam resiko (ODR), orang tanpa gejala (OTG), orang dalam pemantauan (ODP), pasien dalam pengawasan (PDP) dan jumlah pasien positif terpapar virus COVID-19 (Confirm) untuk seluruh kabupaten/kota di Propinsi Jawa Timur Melalui algoritma klastering Non-Hirarki K-Means didaptkan bahwa jumlah klaster optimum adalah 5 klaster Untuk membuktikan bahwa kelima klaster yang dibentuk ini berbeda secara signifikan maka dilakukan uji mean vektor dengan statistic Wilks Lambda dan dihasilkan perbedaan yang signifikan dengan tingkat kepercayaan 95% Karakteristik klaster untuk setiap kelompok dapat disimpulkan secara umum adalah klaster dengan kasus PDP dan Confirm yang sangat tinggi (red zone) , klaster dengan kasus jumlah Confirm Tinggi ( Orange Zone), klaster dengan jumlah PDP Tinggi (Yellow Zone), klaster dengan jumlah kasus PDP dan Confirmed Sedang ( Green Zone) dan klaster dengan PDP dan Confirm rendah (Light Green Zone)","output":"Klastering Wilayah Kota/Kabupaten Berdasarkan Data Persebaran COVID-19 Di Propinsi Jawa Timur Dengan Metode K-Means"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Die klinische Ethik bietet Untersttzung bei der L?sung von ethisch komplexen Fragestellungen.

This is a perfect case to explore driving factors affecting the PM(2.5) distributions in Chinese cities, thus helping form better policies for future PM(2.5) mitigation. Based on panel data of 332 cities, we analyzed the function of natural and anthropogenic factors to PM(2.5) pollution by applying the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model. We found that the PM(2.5) concentration of 84.3% of cities decreased after lockdown. Spatially, in the winter of 2020, cities with high PM(2.5) concentrations were mainly distributed in Northeast China, the North China Plain and the Tarim Basin. Higher temperature, wind speed and relative humidity were easier to promote haze pollution in northwest of the country, where enhanced surface pressure decreased PM(2.5) concentrations. Furthermore, the intensity of trip activities (ITAs) had a significant positive effect on PM(2.5) pollution in Northwest and Central China. The number of daily pollutant operating vents of key polluting enterprises in the industrial sector (VOI) in northern cities was positively correlated with the PM(2.5) concentration; inversely, the number of daily pollutant operating vents of key polluting enterprises in the power sector (VOP) imposed a negative effect on the PM(2.5) concentration in these regions.

There is a sparsity of evidence in respect of the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE) used during restraint for reducing risk of infection. METHODS: A series of choreographed restraint episodes were used to simulate contact contamination in research participants playing the roles of staff members and a patient. For comparison, one episode of simulated recording of physical observations was taken. Ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent material was used to track the simulated contact contamination, with analysis undertaken using established image registration techniques of UV photographs. This was repeated for three separate sets of PPE. RESULTS: All three PPE sets showed similar performance in protecting against contamination transfer. For teams not utilising coveralls, this was dependent upon effective cleansing as part of doffing. There were similar patterns of contamination for restraint team members assigned to specific roles, with hands and upper torso appearing to be higher-risk areas. The restraint-related contamination was 23 times higher than that observed for physical observations. DISCUSSION: A second layer of clothing that can be removed showed efficacy in reducing contact contamination. PPE fit to individual is important. Post-restraint cleansing procedures are currently inadequate, with new procedures for face and neck cleansing required.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of ?48.1 kcal/mol ( 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as ?82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of ?52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learningCdriven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Rapid in silico design of antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 using machine learning and supercomputing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) The SARS CoV-2 is transmitted more rapidly and readily than SARS CoV Both, SARS CoV and SARS CoV-2 via their glycosylated spike proteins recognize the human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor We generated multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for representative spike proteins of CoV and CoV-2 from various host sources in order to analyze the specificity in SARS CoV-2 spike proteins required for causing infection in humans Our results show that two sequence motifs in the N-terminal domain;\\"MESEFR\\" and \\"SYLTPG\\" are specific to human SARS CoV-2 In the receptor binding domain (RBD), two sequence motifs;\\"VGGNY\\" and \\"EIYQAGSTPCNGV\\" and a disulfide bridge connecting 480C and 488C in the extended looare structural determinants for the recognition of human ACE-2 receptor The complete genome analysis of representative SARS CoVs from bat, civet, human host sources and human SARS CoV-2 identified the bat genome (GenBank code: MN996532 1) as closest to the recent novel human SARS CoV-2 genomes The bat CoV genomes (GenBank codes: MG772933 and MG772934) are evolutionary intermediates in the mutagenesis progression towards becoming human SARS CoV-2 br /div","output":"Evolutionary Relationships and Sequence-Structure Determinants in Human SARS Coronavirus-2 Spike Proteins for Host Receptor Recognition"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We all have questions.

The prevalence remains largely unknown because of early testing supply shortages. Although it cannot currently be used to determine level of immunity, antibody testing can contribute to epidemiological studies, identify convalescent plasma donors, or satisfy curiosity about previous exposure to the virus. METHODS: 407 samples collected from hospitalized inpatients with and without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 170 remnant clinical specimens collected and frozen prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, and paired serum and plasma samples from 23 convalescent plasma donors were used to determine performance characteristics of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assays. The sensitivity, specificity, imprecision, interferences, and sample stability were determined. These assays were then used to characterize the antibody response in serial samples from 20 SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients. RESULTS: Both assays exhibited 100% specificity (95% CI; 99.05 - 100.00), giving no positive results in 170 specimens collected before July 2019 and 215 specimens from patients without a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Differences between platforms were most notable in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. Roche offered higher sensitivity in convalescent plasma donors at 95.7% (95% CI; 78.1 - 99.9) versus 91.3% (95% CI; 72.0 - 98.9) but Abbott detected antibodies in two immunocompromised patients whereas Roche did not. The Roche and Abbott platforms also exhibited different trends in antibody signal for a subset of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both the Abbott and Roche platforms offer excellent specificity but different trends in antibody signal may reflect qualitative differences in the types of antibodies recognized by the two assays.

Studies on chemosensory disorders in COVID-19 have predominantly focused on Caucasian populations whereas Asians remain understudied. We conducted a nationwide, multicentre cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire on a cohort of RT-PCR-confirmed adult COVID-19 patients in Malaysia between 6 June to 30 November 2020. The aim of our study was to investigate their presenting symptoms and assess their chemosensory function using self-ratings of perceived smell, taste, chemesthesis, and nasal blockage. In this cohort of 498 patients, 41.4% reported smell and/or taste loss when diagnosed with COVID-19, which was the commonest symptom. Blocked nose, loss of appetite, and gastrointestinal disturbances were independent predictors of smell and/or taste loss on multivariate analysis. Self-ratings of chemosensory function revealed a reduction in smell, taste, and chemesthesis across the entire cohort of patients that was more profound among those reporting smell and/or taste loss as their presenting symptom. Perceived nasal obstruction accounted for only a small proportion of changes in smell and taste, but not for chemesthesis, supporting viral disruption of sensorineural mechanisms as the dominant aetiology of chemosensory dysfunction.

This study examines if the program was effective by studying relationship between strengthening of COs, vulnerability reduction, and sustaining of consistent condom use behavior among FSWs. METHODS: We used a longitudinal study design to assess the change in outcomes. A three-stage sampling design was used to select FSWs for the study. Panel data of 2085 FSWs selected from 38 COs across five states of India was used to examine the change in various outcomes from 2015 (Survey Round 1) to 2017 (Survey Round 2). The CO level program pillar measuring institutional development assessed performance of COs in six domains critical for any organization's functionality and sustainability: governance, project management, financial management, program monitoring, advocacy and networking, and resource mobilization. Overall, 32 indicators from all these domains were used to compute the CO strength score. A score was computed by taking mean of average dimension scores. The overall score was divided into two groups based on the median cutoff; COs which scored below the median were considered to have low CO strength, while COs which scored above or equal to median were considered to have high CO strength. Multivariable regression modeling techniques were used to examine the effect of program pillars on outcome measures. RESULTS: Analyses showed a significant improvement in the strength of the COs over time; percentage of COs having high strength improved from 50% in 2015 to 87% in Round 2. The improvement in CO's strength increased financial security (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.18, p<0.01), social welfare security (AOR: 1.71, p<0.01), and socio-legal security (AOR: 2.20, p<0.01) among FSWs. Further, improvement in financial security led to significant increase in consistent condom use with client among FSWs (AOR: 1.69, p<0.01) who were members of COs having high strength. Sustained consistent condom use was positively associated with young age (<30 years), ability to negotiate with clients for condom use, membership in self-help groups, high self-efficacy, self-confidence, and client solicitation in streets and brothels. CONCLUSIONS: Improving financial security and strengthening FSW led CO can improve sustained and consistent condom use. In addition, the program should focus on enhancing ability of FSWs to negotiate with clients for condom use, promote membership in self-help groups and target FSWs who are 30 years or older, and soliciting from homes to sustain consistent condom use across all FSWs.","output":"Sustaining consistent condom use among female sex workers by addressing their vulnerabilities and strengthening community-led organizations in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel predictive modeling framework for the spread of infectious diseases using high-dimensional partial differential equations is developed and implemented.

Researchers are trying to find a way to treat this disease as soon as possible. The present study aimed to identify the genes involved in COVID-19 and find a new drug target therapy. Currently, there are no effective drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2, and meanwhile, drug discovery approaches are time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, this study utilized a network-based drug repurposing strategy to rapidly identify potential drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2. To this end, seven potential drugs were proposed for COVID-19 treatment using protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. First, 524 proteins in humans that have interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 virus were collected, and then the PPI network was reconstructed for these collected proteins. Next, the target miRNAs of the mentioned module genes were separately obtained from the miRWalk 2.0 database because of the important role of miRNAs in biological processes and were reported as an important clue for future analysis. Finally, the list of the drugs targeting module genes was obtained from the DGIDb database, and the drug-gene network was separately reconstructed for the obtained protein modules. RESULTS: Based on the network analysis of the PPI network, seven clusters of proteins were specified as the complexes of proteins which are more associated with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Moreover, seven therapeutic candidate drugs were identified to control gene regulation in COVID-19. PACLITAXEL, as the most potent therapeutic candidate drug and previously mentioned as a therapy for COVID-19, had four gene targets in two different modules. The other six candidate drugs, namely, BORTEZOMIB, CARBOPLATIN, CRIZOTINIB, CYTARABINE, DAUNORUBICIN, and VORINOSTAT, some of which were previously discovered to be efficient against COVID-19, had three gene targets in different modules. Eventually, CARBOPLATIN, CRIZOTINIB, and CYTARABINE drugs were found as novel potential drugs to be investigated as a therapy for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our computational strategy for predicting repurposable candidate drugs against COVID-19 provides efficacious and rapid results for therapeutic purposes. However, further experimental analysis and testing such as clinical applicability, toxicity, and experimental validations are required to reach a more accurate and improved treatment.

METHODS All children treated for PIMS-TS (February to November, 2021) at the Childrens' Hospital Kassel were analysed retrospectively. Patients were treated according to local PIMS-TS standardised operating procedure based on the Swiss and UK consensus statements. RESULTS Eleven patients treated for PIMS-TS were included in this study (female:male = 2.1:1).

Healthy pregnant women are still not regarded as a susceptible group despite physiological changes that make pregnant women more vulnerable to severe infection. However, high-risk pregnancies may be associated with severe COVID-19 disease with respiratory failure, as outlined in this report. We discuss the importance of timely delivery and antenatal steroid administration in a critically ill patient. Case: A 27-year-old pregnant woman (gravida 2, para 1) with type I diabetes, morbid obesity, hypothyroidism and a previous Caesarean section presented with critical respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 at 32 weeks of gestation. A preterm emergency Caesarean section was performed, after steroid treatment for foetal lung maturation. The patient benefited from prone positioning; however, transient acute renal injury, rhabdomyolysis and sepsis led to prolonged intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 30 days.

Neonatal care is emblematic of these acute services as averting deaths requires skilled care over many days from multiple professionals with at least basic equipment. However, hospital care is often of poor quality and large-scale change is needed to improve outcomes. However, achieving large scale change in health systems remains challenging. To set the scene we first characterise the problems of hospital newborn units (NBU) in Kenya. We then combine our understanding of theory and context with reflection on our own position as an embedded research group with no formal authority to help us propose a feasible intervention strategy linked to in initial programme theory. We explain this programme theory and suggest how within a multi-level clinical professional network leaders at the ward or mid-level of hospital hierarchies are key potential change agents. In support of our programme theory we briefly outline and seek to integrate key ideas drawn from a wider set of theories. We propose how an intervention might be developed and employed in a phased approach to create the ownership, relationships and momentum that will be needed to achieve change at scale. Finally, we discuss the implications of such a strategy for our research design that is based on a prospective, in-depth case study that includes quantitative and qualitative data collection linked to specific sub-studies.

RESULTS: An investigation of digital overuse while the COVID-19 pandemic (and beyond) against the background of ANT calls for a shift of perspective in research, at least as an important supplement to research efforts querying the actual nature of digital overuse. In the present work, we argue that it is high time to more comprehensively address why children spend too much time with screens and to also highlight the indirect media effects of screen time use (e.g. less mammalian rough and tumble PLAY time outside and elevated SADNESS due to parental neglect).

It can increase the reliability of the cure and decision making by developing useful systems and algorithms. Healthcare workers, especially nurses and physicians, are overworked due to a massive and unexpected increase in the number of patients during the coronavirus pandemic. In such situations, artificial intelligence techniques could be used to diagnose a patient with life-threatening illnesses. In particular, diseases that increase the risk of hospitalization and death in coronavirus patients, such as high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes, should be diagnosed at an early stage. This article focuses on diagnosing a diabetic patient through data mining techniques. If we are able to diagnose diabetes in the early stages of the disease, we can force patients to stay home and care for their health, so the risk of being infected with the coronavirus would be reduced. The proposed method has three steps: preprocessing, feature selection and classification. Several combinations of Harmony search algorithm, genetic algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm are examined with K-means for feature selection. The combinations have not examined before for diabetes diagnosis applications. K-nearest neighbor is used for classification of the diabetes dataset. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy have been measured to evaluate the results.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of Saudi residents. Participants completed an online questionnaire after 1 month of a nationwide 24-hour curfew. We measured psychological distress using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). We ran binary logistic regression analyses to detect variables that significantly predicted DASS-21 scores. Results The sample comprised 2252 Saudi residents. The DASS-21 score means and standard deviations for depression and anxiety for the whole sample (10.73  10.29 and 6.98  8.30, respectively) were in the range of mild depression and anxiety. In contrast, the mean DASS-21 stress score was within the normal range (11.97  10.80).

Whereas pre-incubation for 10 min with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), did not or only weakly affected the enzyme activity, the bidentate chelator 1,10-phenanthroline produced a complete and concentration-dependent inhibition of AP-N.

Concentrating on single core symptoms that are biologically well understood might consist of a more viable approach. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework is a trans-diagnostic dimensional approach that focuses on symptoms and their underlying neurobiology. Evidence is accumulating that psychedelics may possess antidepressant activity, and this can potentially be explained through a multi-level (psychobiological, circuitry, (sub)cellular and molecular) analysis of the cognitive systems RDoC domain. Cognitive deficits, such as negative emotional processing and negativity bias, often lead to depressive rumination. Psychedelics can increase long-term cognitive flexibility, leading to normalization of negativity bias and reduction in rumination. We propose a theoretical model that explains how psychedelics can reduce the negativity bias in depressed patients. At the psychobiological level, we hypothesize that the negativity bias in MDD is due to impaired pattern separation and that psychedelics such as psilocybin help in depression because they enhance pattern separation and hence reduce negativity bias. Pattern separation is a mnemonic process that relies on adult hippocampal neurogenesis, where similar inputs are made more distinct, which is essential for optimal encoding of contextual information. Impairment in this process may underlie the negative cognitive bias in MDD by, for example, increased pattern separation of cues with a negative valence that can lead to excessive deliberation on aversive outcomes. On the (sub) cellular level, psychedelics stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis as well as synaptogenesis, spinogenesis and dendritogenesis in the prefrontal cortex. Together, these effects help restoring resilience to chronic stress and lead to modulation of the major connectivity hubs of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Based on these observations, we propose a new translational framework to guide the development of a novel generation of therapeutics to treat the cognitive symptoms in MDD.","output":"Improving cognitive functioning in major depressive disorder with psychedelics: a dimensional approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2020, two COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.*,?

METHODS: Four quantitative antibody tests that are different in targeted antigens, detectable immunoglobulin classes, and avidity were used. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Antibody titers of 117 samples collected from 24 COVID-19 patients and 23 non-COVID-19 patients were measured to evaluate correlations between different tests. For 24 COVID-19 patients, antibody titers measured at various time points after the onset or the RT-PCR diagnosis were subjected to assessment of humoral responses. RESULTS: Correlations between tests were observed to some degree, although there were discrepancies putatively due to differences in measurement principle. Seronegative COVID-19 was diagnosed for some patients, in whom antibody titers were less than the cut-off value in each test throughout the time courses. IgG seroconversion without prior IgM seroconversion most frequently occurred while predominance of IgM responses over IgG responses was observed in some severe cases.

All newly-identified betacoronaviruses were SARS-related Rhinolophus bat coronaviruses (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV). Importantly, with the exception of the S gene, the genome sequences of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoVs sampled in Guizhou province were closely related to SARS-related human coronavirus. Additionally, the newly-identified alphacoronaviruses exhibited high genetic diversity and some may represent novel species. Our phylogenetic analyses also provided insights into the transmission of these viruses among bat species, revealing a general clustering by geographic location rather than by bat species. Inter-species transmission among bats from the same genus was also commonplace in both the alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses. Overall, these data suggest that high contact rates among specific bat species enable the acquisition and spread of coronaviruses.","output":"Extensive diversity of coronaviruses in bats from China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Resumo Como a crise em sade pblica causada pela pandemia da COVID-19 ajuda a compreender o funcionamento do Sistema Nacional de Prote??o e Defesa Civil (SINPDEC) nas fases de prepara??o e resposta a desastres em sade no Brasil?

The main methods of historical research included, in particular, historical analytical, chronological and comparative historical;methods of medical statistics, etc. The historiography of the issue was analyzed, unpublished archival materials, local press were studied. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Despite the progress made, mortality remained high in general, proving the public health system had to be reorganized. The death rate shocked the local community so much that the authorities had to apply an information blockade. Anti-epidemic components included explanatory work by priests and police, sanitary measures, measures on strict compliance with observation and quarantine, food supplies to the blocked city and free medicine dispensation, involvement of all available medical institutions, and the establishment of special temporary facilities, actual mobilization of medical personnel. It was impossible to act in the other way, because the treatment methods seemed to be ineffective, like today, under the COVID-19 pandemic. When the medical component is proved ineffective in fighting the epidemic, relatively effective administrative measures, tried and tested over the centuries reasonably seem to be useful, and this experience has not lost its relevance.","output":"Struggle against Cholera Epidemics in Imperial Time Kharkiv as a Significant Factor of Public Health: Historical Experience"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is currently engaged in a race of vaccination versus infection in an effort to control the COVID-19 pandemic.

While both countries have achieved impressive vaccination rates, cases increased to unprecedented levels in one country while decreasing steadily in the other. Although this could be attributed to a number of factors, we argue here that the heavy reliance on alum-adjuvanted inactivated virus vaccines may have contributed to these discrepant outcomes. We then expand the analysis to compare the outcomes of the top 10 vaccinated countries based on their reliance on inactivated virus vaccines. The results remarkably align with the initial findings seen in Bahrain and Qatar. Countries that did not use inactivated virus vaccines achieved steady declines in daily COVID-19 deaths, while other countries did not.

While the most studied mode of angiogenesis is vascular sprouting, specific conditions or organs favor intussusception, i.e., the division or splitting of an existing vessel, as preferential mode of new vessel formation. In the present study, sustained (33-h) intravital microscopy of the vasculature in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) led to the hypothesis of a novel non-sprouting mode for vessel generation, which we termed coalescent angiogenesis. In this process, preferential flow pathways evolve from isotropic capillary meshes enclosing tissue islands. These preferential flow pathways progressively enlarge by coalescence of capillaries and elimination of internal tissue pillars, in a process that is the reverse of intussusception. Concomitantly, less perfused segments regress. In this way, an initially mesh-like capillary network is remodeled into a tree structure, while conserving vascular wall components and maintaining blood flow. Coalescent angiogenesis, thus, describes the remodeling of an initial, hemodynamically inefficient mesh structure, into a hierarchical tree structure that provides efficient convective transport, allowing for the rapid expansion of the vasculature with maintained blood supply and function during development.

METHODS: Based on the daily reported new cases and the population-movement data between 1 and 31 January, we examined the effects of population outflow from Wuhan on the geographical expansion of the infection in other provinces and cities of China, as well as the impacts of the city closure in Wuhan using different closing-date scenarios. RESULTS: We observed a significantly positive association between population movement and the number of the COVID-19 cases. The spatial distribution of cases per unit of outflow population indicated that the infection in some areas with a large outflow of population might have been underestimated, such as Henan and Hunan provinces. Further analysis revealed that if the city-closure policy had been implemented 2 days earlier, 1420 (95% confidence interval, 1059-1833) cases could have been prevented, and if 2 days later, 1462 (1090-1886) more cases would have been possible.

These changes have had an impact on the well-being of medical trainees and the role of GP plays in the society. We have therefore aimed to investigate the impact that COVID-19 has had on GP trainees and trainers in four domains: education, workload, practice organization and the role of GP in society. Design: a cross-sectional study design was used. METHODS: The Interuniversity Centre for the Education of General Practitioners sent an online survey with close-ended and open-ended questions to all GP trainees and trainers in Flanders, active in the period March C September 2020. Descriptive statistics were performed to analyze the quantitative data and thematic analysis for the qualitative data. RESULTS: 216 (response 25%) GP trainees and 311 (response 26%) trainers participated. GP trainees (63%, N = 136) and trainers (76%, N = 236) reported new learning opportunities since the COVID-19 pandemic. The introduction of telehealth consulting and changing guidelines required new communication and organizational skills. Most of the GP trainees (75%, n = 162) and trainers (71%, n = 221) experienced more stress at work and an overload of administrative work. The unfamiliarity with a new infectious disease and the fact that COVID-19 care compromised general GP clinical activities, created insecurity among GP trainers and trainees. Moreover, GP trainees felt that general GP activities were insufficiently covered during the COVID-19 pandemic for their training in GP. GP trainers and trainees experienced mutual support, and secondary support came from other direct colleagues. Measures such as reducing the writing of medical certificates and financial support for administrative and (para) medical support can help to reprioritize the core of GP care. COVID-19 has enhanced the use of digital learning over peer-to-peer learning and lectures. However, GP trainees and trainers preferred blended learning educational activities. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has created learning opportunities such as telehealth consulting and a flexible organization structure. To ensure quality GP education during the pandemic and beyond, regular GP care should remain the core activity of GP trainees and trainers and a balance between all different learning methods should be found.

We developed a machine learning method that can use information (i.e., resource utilization, pandemic progress, population mobility, weather condition, and public policy) currently known about a region since March 2020, to learn multiple temporal convolutional network (TCN) models every week; each used for forecasting the weekly average of one of these 5 quantities in Canada (respectively, in six specific provinces) for each, in the next 1 (resp., 2,3,4) weeks. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we compared our method, versus other standard models, on the COVID-19 data and hospital resource data, on the tasks of predicting the 116 values (for Canada and its six most populated provinces), every week from Oct 2020 to July 2021, and the 20 values (only for Canada) for four specific times within 9 July to 31 Dec 2021.

Fruit-bats of the genus Pteropus (commonly known as flying-foxes) are the natural host of the virus, and the putative source of infection in horses; infected horses are the source of human infection. Effective treatment is lacking in both horses and humans, and notwithstanding the recent availability of a vaccine for horses, exposure risk mitigation remains an important infection control strategy. This study sought to inform risk mitigation by identifying spatial and environmental risk factors for equine infection using multiple analytical approaches to investigate the relationship between plausible variables and reported Hendra virus infection in horses. Spatial autocorrelation (Global Morans I) showed significant clustering of equine cases at a distance of 40 km, a distance consistent with the foraging footprint of a flying-fox roost, suggesting the latter as a biologically plausible basis for the clustering. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis identified multiple equine infection hot spots along the eastern Australia coast from far north Queensland to central New South Wales, with the largest extending for nearly 300 km from southern Queensland to northern New South Wales. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) showed the density of P. alecto and P. conspicillatus to have the strongest positive correlation with equine case locations, suggesting these species are more likely a source of infection of Hendra virus for horses than P. poliocephalus or P. scapulatus. The density of horses, climate variables and vegetation variables were not found to be a significant risk factors, but the residuals from the GWR suggest that additional unidentified risk factors exist at the property level. Further investigations and comparisons between case and control properties are needed to identify these local risk factors.","output":"Flying-Fox Species Density - A Spatial Risk Factor for Hendra Virus Infection in Horses in Eastern Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social distancing measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may profoundly impact young peoples relationships. This study compared adolescent and young adults romantic relationships and sexual activity before and after social distancing policies were enacted. METHODS: In June 2020, 351 youth participating in an ongoing intervention study in Fresno County, California completed an online survey about their experiences related to COVID-19. The survey included open and closed-ended questions about their romantic relationships, sexual activity, and online romantic or sexual interactions before and during social distancing restrictions. We used the chi-square test of independence to compare adolescent (ages 13C17) and young adults (ages 18C21) responses. Results were also compared to responses in the intervention studys baseline survey. RESULTS: One-third (37%) of youth were dating or in a romantic relationship and 28% spent time in person with a partner early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Among those dating or in a relationship, 34% physically distanced from their partner due to parental restrictions related to COVID-19. Youth also spent less time in person with their partners during the pandemic than before. Although most youth (69%) were not sexually active before or during the pandemic, 22% had sex during the social distancing period. Young adults were more likely to spend time with their partners and have sex during the restrictions than adolescents. Most youth were not involved in sexting or online dating, before or during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults have continued to engage in sexual and romantic relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic, although many reported physical distancing from their partners.

This was exacerbated with a further 60% decline post-COVID-19. Research demonstrating that natural environments have a positive impact on health and wellbeing has led to prescription of nature-based health interventions and green prescribing, although evidence for its use is predominantly limited to adults. Growing evidence also shows the impact of arts on all aspects of health and wellbeing. However, what has received scant attention in literature is the interconnection between the two: arts and nature. Aims This review synthesizes the literature surrounding the interconnectedness between arts and nature, and their impact on the health and wellbeing of children and young people. Methods Eight major electronic databases were systematically searched, while hand-searching included 20 journals, six books, and contact with experts. The review was conducted using the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews, PRISMA guidelines and TIDieR template. All stages were conducted independently by two researchers and the protocol was published on PROSPERO (Registration no.: CRD42021286574). Results Although 9,314 records were identified, only 11 records were included as most studies focused either on arts or nature, but not both. Studies were conducted in United Kingdom, United States, Ireland, Australia, and Hong Kong, in a range of spaces such as forests, woodlands, beaches, parks, fields, gardens, and school playgrounds. The review encompasses data from 602 participants in total. Discussion Arts-in-nature offered an inclusive medium to engage all children and young people, especially those who might otherwise remain disinterested about environmental issues and disengaged with educational programs. Further, arts-in-nature provided stimuli to increase nature connectivity, understand environmental issues and explore ways to prevent environmental disasters. This led to higher environmental awareness and pro-environmental behaviors, and potential decrease in eco-anxiety. Conclusion Although the quality of qualitative studies was high, the quality of quantitative studies was low or unclear, thus quantitative evidence is still at its infancy. Implications for research, policy, and practice are discussed, such as methods and activities to strengthen future interventions. Scaling-up existing interventions may lead to wider recognition and inclusion of arts-in-nature in future health guidelines, including green prescribing.","output":"A Systematic Review of Arts-Based Interventions Delivered to Children and Young People in Nature or Outdoor Spaces: Impact on Nature Connectedness, Health and Wellbeing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We have read with great interest the article: Cutaneous manifestations in COVID\\\\19: a first perspective by Recalcati S.(1) This article is the first report of the cutaneous manifestations in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) pandemic in Lombardy, Italy.","output":"Comment on: Cutaneous manifestations in COVID\\\\19: a first perspective.

Clinical demographic, laboratory, and instrumental indexes and associated factors were studied with one-way and multivariate logistic regression analysis.Results This study included 402 patients aged 18 to 95 years (mean age, 62.914.6 years); 43.0a??% of them were older than 65 years. COVID-19 was frequently associated with chronic comorbidities, including arterial hypertension (74.4a??%), obesity (41.6a??%), history of ischemic heart disease (12.9a??%), atrial fibrillation (18.9a??%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) (13.0a??%), and oncological diseases (9.2a??%). 13.0a??% of patients were smokers; less than 10% had chronic lung diseases. 3.9% of patients had a combination of COVID-19 and acute coronary pathology, including acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 3.2a??% (13) and unstable angina in 0.7a??% (3). The most frequent clinical manifestation of COVID-19 were four symptoms: cough (81.1a??%), weakness (80.3a??%), shortness of breath (71.6a??%), and fever (62.7a??%). 46.5% of patients had shortage of breath and chest pain/compression, 40.3% had headache, 31.1% had myalgia, 28.8% had anosmia, and 25.5% had ageusia. Arterial oxygen saturation was &lt;93.0a??% in 55.7a??% of cases. According to laboratory blood tests the patients had anemia (58.2a??%), lymphopenia (34.8a??%), neutropenia (19.2a??%), thrombocytopenia (11.9a??%), and increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP, 87.3a??%), interleukin-6 (89.3a??%), ferritin (62.1a??%), and D-dimer (49.2a??%). 56.2% of patients required various regimens of oxygen support. 83 (20.6%) patients were admitted to intensive care and resuscitation units; invasive artificial ventilation was performed only for 34 (8.5a??%) patients. In-hospital mortality was 7.7a??% (31a??/a??402). One-way regression analysis identified major factors associated with death during the stay in the hospital: age &gt;55 years, NEWS scale score &gt;4.0, oxygen saturation &lt;92.0a??%, blood glucose &gt;5.4 mmol/l, hs-CRP &gt;25.7a??mg/l, and creatinine clearance &lt;72.0a??ml/min. Furthermore, the risk increased with increasing degree of changes in each factor. According to results of the multivariate regression analysis, three most significant predictors of the hard endpoint, all-cause death during the stay in the hospital, were more than 5-fold increases in aspartate aminotransferase and/or alanine aminotransferase compared to normal levels (relative risk (RR) 16.8 at 95a??% confidence interval (CI) 5.0-56.3, ??&lt;0.001), pronounced changes in the lungs consistent with a CT-4 picture as shown by computed tomography (CT) (RR 13.4; 95a??% CI 3.9-45.5, ??&lt;0.001), and MI/unstable angina during the stay in the hospital (RR 11.3; 95a??% CI 1.4-90.6, ??=0.023).

METHODS: In 250 patients with rheumatological disease and 100 healthy age-matched controls, we investigated disease activity scores and indicators and evaluated their association with hemogram-derived indices values. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, RDW, MPV, and PLR significantly increased (P < .001) in the three studied disorders (RA, SLE, and AS), but LMR dramatically decreased. SII was considerably higher in RA and AS patients compared with controls but not in SLE patients. On the other hand, NLR rose dramatically in SLE patients compared with controls (P = .043), but did not change much in RA and AS patients (P > .05). RDW and MPV showed significant changes (P < .001) in the three studied diseases (RA, SLE, and AS) according to disease activity. They significantly increased across worsening activity scores. Only in the SLE group, PLR was significantly increased with disease activity (P < .001), while LMR showed a significant decrease (P = .016).

To mitigate the spread of the virus, many states in the U.S. issued lockdown orders to urge their residents to stay at their homes, avoid get-togethers, and minimize physical interactions. While many offline workers are experiencing significant challenges performing their duties, digital technologies have provided ample tools for individuals to continue working and to maintain their productivity. Although using digital platforms to build resilience in remote work is effective, other aspects of remote work (beyond the continuation of work) should also be considered in gauging true resilience. In this study, we focus on content creators, and investigate how restrictions in individual's physical environment impact their online content creation behavior. Exploiting a natural experimental setting wherein four states issued state-wide lockdown orders on the same day whereas five states never issued a lockdown order, and using a unique dataset collected from a short video-sharing social media platform, we study the impact of lockdown orders on content creators' behaviors in terms of content volume, content novelty, and content optimism. We combined econometric methods (difference-in-differences estimations of a matched sample) with machine learning-based natural language processing to show that on average, compared to the users residing in non-lockdown states, the users residing in lockdown states create more content after the lockdown order enforcement. However, we find a decrease in the novelty level and optimism of the content generated by the latter group.

Increasing the number of international students has become an indispensable strategy for national and global competition. This study focuses on effective strategies and international students issues regarding satisfaction in the most popular STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) programs. We designed a structural equation modeling (SEM) method to determine the effect of institutional mediation between push factors and satisfaction factors for the development of better strategies by which to attract and retain international students. This study employed a self-designed questionnaire to collect data: 485 degree-seeking international students in STEM programs were invited and successfully participated in this study during spring 2021 in Taiwan. IBM SPSS 26 and AMOS 26 (Analysis of Moment Structure) were used to carry out the data analysis. We employed reliability, factor, and SEM analyses.

The immediate animal origin of the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, remains unknown, a notoriously challenging task for emerging disease investigations. Coevolution with hosts leads to specific evolutionary signatures within viral genomes that can inform likely animal origins. We obtained a set of 650 spike protein and 511 whole genome nucleotide sequences from 222 and 185 viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, respectively. We then trained random forest models independently on genome composition biases of spike protein and whole genome sequences, including dinucleotide and codon usage biases in order to predict animal host (of nine possible categories, including human). In hold-one-out cross-validation, predictive accuracy on unseen coronaviruses consistently reached ~73%, indicating evolutionary signal in spike proteins to be just as informative as whole genome sequences. However, different composition biases were informative in each case. Applying optimised random forest models to classify human sequences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV revealed evolutionary signatures consistent with their recognised intermediate hosts (camelids, carnivores), while human sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted as having bat hosts (suborder Yinpterochiroptera), supporting bats as the suspected origins of the current pandemic. In addition to phylogeny, variation in genome composition can act as an informative approach to predict emerging virus traits as soon as sequences are available.

IPAA was performed using single stapling (SS) technique in 38 patients, double stapling (DS) technique in 235 patients (TIA stapler 42 patients, Endo-GIA 131 patients, Contour 62 patients) and handsewn IPAA in 60 patients. RESULTS Statistically different early and late complications were recorded among the different IPAA techniques. A lower frequency of daily and nocturnal defecations and a higher level of continence were observed in the DS-IPAA compared to handsewn IPAA. The distance between the anastomotic line and the anal verge was significantly lower in DS Endo-GIA or DS Contour groups than in the DS TIA and SS. In SS IPAA group, 31.6% developed cuffitis compared to 14.4% belonging to DS group, at a mean follow-up of 140.4 months. CONCLUSIONS Technical improvements changed the IPAA technique.

We aimed to estimate the total number of COVID-19 related infections, deaths, and hospitalizations in Iran under different physical distancing and isolation scenarios. METHODS We developed a susceptible-exposed-infected/infectious-recovered/removed (SEIR) model, parameterized to the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran. We used the model to quantify the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran and assess the effectiveness of isolation and physical distancing under five different scenarios (A: 0% isolation, through E: 40% isolation of all infected cases). We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). RESULTS Under scenario A, we estimated 5 196 000 (UI 1 753 000-10 220 000) infections to happen till mid-June with 966 000 (UI 467 800-1 702 000) hospitalizations and 111 000 (UI 53 400-200 000) deaths. Successful implantation of scenario E would reduce the number of infections by 90% (ie, 550 000) and change the epidemic peak from 66 000 on June 9, to 9400 on March 1, 2020. Scenario E also reduces the hospitalizations by 92% (ie, 74 500), and deaths by 93% (ie, 7800). CONCLUSION With no approved vaccination or therapy available, we found physical distancing and isolation that include public awareness and case-finding and isolation of 40% of infected people could reduce the burden of COVID-19 in Iran by 90% by mid-June.","output":"Estimating COVID-19-Related Infections, Deaths, and Hospitalizations in Iran Under Different Physical Distancing and Isolation Scenarios."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A zoonotic coronavirus, tentatively labeled as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), has been identified as the causative agent of the viral pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.

METHODS Twenty-two participants completed a combination of three balance task and three secondary cognitive (visuo-motor) task difficulty levels for a total of nine dual-task conditions. An additional eight participants were tested while performing the same three balance task difficulty levels on its own (i.e., single-tasking). The balance task required participants to maintain their balance on a fixed or rotating stabilometer while the visuo-motor task required participants to respond to moving targets presented on a monitor. Throughout each single- and dual-task trial, H-reflexes were elicited from the soleus. RESULTS Although dual-task performance, as quantified by visuo-motor task accuracy as well as the root mean square of the stabilometer position and velocity, decreased by 10-34% with increasing dual-task difficulty (p < 0.05), no changes in the soleus H-reflex amplitude were observed between dual-task conditions (p = 0.483-0.758). This contrasts to when participants performed the balance task as a single-task, where the H-reflex amplitude decreased by ~25% from the easy to the hard balance task difficulty level (p = 0.037). CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the commonly reported finding of a reduced soleus H-reflex amplitude when individuals perform a less posturally stable task by itself, the results indicate that spinal excitability is not modulated as a function of dual-task difficulty. It is possible that when an individual's attentional resource capacity is exceeded during dual-tasking, they become ineffective in regulating spinal excitability for balance control.","output":"Does spinal excitability scale to the difficulty of the dual-task?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Chronic kidney disease patients show a high mortality in case of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation.","output":"Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic is a deadly disease spreading very fast. People with the confronted immune system are susceptible to many health conditions. A highly significant condition is pneumonia, which is found to be the cause of death in the majority of patients. The main purpose of this study is to find the volume of GGO and consolidation of a COVID-19 patient, so that the physicians can prioritize the patients. Here, we used transfer learning techniques for segmentation of lung CTs with the latest libraries and techniques which reduces training time and increases the accuracy of the AI Model. This system is trained with DeepLabV3 + network architecture and model ResNet50 with ImageNet weights. We used different augmentation techniques like Gaussian noise, horizontal shift, color variation, etc., to get to the result. Intersection over Union (IoU) is used as the performance metrics. The IoU of lung masks is predicted as 99.78% and that of infected masks is as 89.01%.

We now know that autosomal dominant monogenic FH can be caused by pathogenic variants of three additional genes (APOB/PCSK9/APOE) and that the plasma LDL-C concentration and risk of premature coronary heart disease differs according to the specific locus and associated molecular cause. It is now possible to use next-generation sequencing to sequence all exons of all four genes, processing 96 patient samples in one sequencing run, increasing the speed of test results, and reducing costs. This has resulted in the identification of not only many novel FH-causing variants but also some variants of unknown significance, which require further evidence to classify as pathogenic or benign. The identification of the FH-causing variant in an index case can be used as an unambiguous and rapid test for other family members. An FH-causing variant can be found in 20C40% of patients with the FH phenotype, and we now appreciate that in the majority of patients without a monogenic cause, a polygenic etiology for their phenotype is highly likely. Compared with those with a monogenic cause, these patients have significantly lower risk of future coronary heart disease.

Blocking this binding event, or reducing the accessibility of the virus to the ACE2 receptor, represents an alternative strategy to prevent COVID-19 disease. In addition, the biological significance of ACE2 in modulating the innate immune system and tissue repair cascades anchors its therapeutic potential for treating the infected patients. In this viewpoint article, we review the current efforts of exploiting ACE2 as a therapeutic target to address this dire medical need.

They may be located on the circle of Willis, on arterial feeders, or even inside the nidus. Because BAVM-associated aneurysms represent a risk factor of bleeding, the question of the timing and modality of their management remains a matter of debate in unruptured BAVMs. The authors present a case of fatal periprocedural rupture of a flow-related aneurysm (FRA) during the removal of the microcatheter after injection of a liquid embolic agent. A 40-year-old man was treated at the authors' institution for the management of a Spetzler-Martin Grade III left unruptured frontal BAVM, revealed by seizures and a focal neurological deficit attributed to flow steal phenomenon. After a multidisciplinary meeting, endovascular treatment was considered to reduce the flow of the BAVM. A proximal FRA located on the feeding internal carotid artery (ICA) was purposely left untreated because it did not meet the criteria of the authors' institution for preventative treatment (i.e., small size [2.5 mm]). During embolization, at the time of microcatheter retrieval, and after glue injection, the aneurysm unexpectedly ruptured. The aneurysm's rupture was attributed to the stress (torsion/flexion) on the ICA caused by the microcatheter removal. Despite the attempts to manage the bleeding, the patient eventually died of the acute increase of intracranial pressure related to the massive subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case highlights a previously unreported mechanism of FRA rupture during BAVM embolization: the stress transmitted to the parent artery during the removal of the microcatheter.","output":"Fatal rupture of a brain arteriovenous malformation flow-related aneurysm during microcatheter removal: a rare complication."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a rise in cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS).

The aim of this narrative review paper is to examine the challenges and opportunities faced by medical schools in implementing remote learning for basic science teaching in response to the COVID-19 crisis. We searched relevant literature in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using specific keywords, e.g., COVID-19 pandemic, preclinical medical education, online learning, remote learning, challenges, and opportunities. The pandemic has posed several challenges to premedical education (e.g., suspension of face-to-face teaching, lack of cadaveric dissections, and practical/laboratory sessions) but has provided many opportunities as well, such as the incorporation of online learning in the curriculum and upskilling and reskilling in new technologies. To date, many medical schools have successfully transitioned their educational environment to emergency remote teaching and assessments. During COVID-19 crisis, the preclinical phase of medical curricula has successfully introduced the novel culture of online home learning using technology-oriented innovations, which may extend to post-COVID era to maintain teaching and learning in medical education. However, the lack of hands-on training in the preclinical years may have serious implications on the training of the current cohort of students, and they may struggle later in the clinical years.

The objectives of the present study were to assess survival and to identify predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients at Kinshasa University Hospital. Methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted, 141 COVID-19 patients admitted at the Kinshasa University Hospital from March 23 to June 15, 2020 were included in the study. Kaplan Meier's method was used to described survival. Predictors of mortality were identified by COX regression models. Results: of the 141 patients admitted with COVID-19, 67.4 % were men (sex ratio 2H: 1F); their average age was 49.616.5 years. The mortality rate in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was 29% during the study period with 70% deceased within 24 hours of admission. Survival was decreased with the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, low blood oxygen saturation (BOS), severe or critical stage disease.

Three of 46 monkeys infused with enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory cytokines.

Coincidentally with the first wave of the pandemic, a cluster of children with fever, hyperinflammation and shock were identified, and this was first described as paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Patients with this novel condition were transferred to tertiary centres for management, increasing the pressure in these hospitals that were already extremely busy. There are multiple challenges related to the identification of patients presenting with PIMS-TS given that they mimic multiple other well-known paediatric conditions, like Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Investigations and admission criteria to a district general hospital (DGH) need to be well established, and clear guidance should be available for easy decision making in a busy paediatric emergency department. Furthermore, these children can deteriorate suddenly and rapidly; close monitoring is vital, and any deterioration must be taken seriously and addressed immediately. All children who present severely ill, with shock and multiorgan failure, should be retrieved to a paediatric intensive care unit.

Another way to generate evidence is by using a Learning Healthcare System (LHS) approach. In an LHS, care and research are aligned in such a way that it can accelerate evidence generation and outcomes for patients, based on real-life medication use. For the development of an ethically responsible and sustainable LHS, it is of crucial importance to understand what women think of such an alternative approach to knowledge generation. Therefore, this paper explores their views on an LHS for pregnant and breastfeeding women. METHOD: For this qualitative study, we interviewed 20 women during preconception, pregnancy, or nursing to explore their views on an ethically responsible LHS for pregnant and breastfeeding women. The pseudonymized transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: We identified four main themes describing womens views on LHSs. The first theme describes that respondents were positive about learning healthcare systems, and considered them to function as a central point for information about their medication, which they felt is currently lacking. The second theme shows that respondents want to contribute to and engage in generating new information because they want to help others and contribute to scientific research. Respondents also mentioned that, currently, not every woman is aware of the risks of the lack of evidence for medication used in pregnancy. The third theme shows that respondents regard their healthcare professional as essential for the translation and interpretation of information, regardless of a learning healthcare system. The last theme describes that respondents will trust a learning healthcare system more if the medical community supports it, and when data collection and processing is transparent. CONCLUSION: Women during preconception, pregnancy and nursing agree that an LHS could be a viable alternative to help close the knowledge gap on the safety of medication used during pregnancy and breastfeeding. The obtained insights from our interviews provide valuable stepping-stones for the development of an ethically responsible and sustainable LHS, as well as for the engagement of women in an LHS.

Coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) plays a pivotal role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD-related risk factors (e.g., age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, etc.). Equally, these are also risk factors for COVID-19. The purpose of this review was to explore CMD pathophysiology in COVID-19, based on recent evidence. COVID-19 mechanisms were reviewed in terms of imbalanced renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-systems (RAAS), systemic inflammation and immune responses, endothelial dysfunction and coagulatory disorders. Based on these mechanisms, we addressed CMD pathophysiology within the context of COVID-19, from five perspectives. The first was the disarrangement of local RAAS and Kallikrein-kinin-systems attributable to SARS-Cov-2 entry, and the concomitant decrease in coronary microvascular endothelial angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) levels. The second was related to coronary microvascular obstruction, induced by COVID-19-associated systemic hyper-inflammation and pro-thrombotic state. The third was focused on how pneumonia/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-related systemic hypoxia elicited oxidative stress in coronary microvessels and cardiac sympathetic nerve activation. Fourthly, we discussed how autonomic nerve dysfunction mediated by COVID-19-associated mental, physical or physiological factors could elicit changes in coronary blood flow, resulting in CMD in COVID-19 patients. Finally, we analyzed reciprocity between the coronary microvascular endothelium and perivascular cellular structures due to viremia, SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and systemic inflammation. These mechanisms may function either consecutively or intermittently, finally culminating in CMD-mediated cardiovascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this work was to study characteristics, cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and a prior diagnosis of heart failure (HF). Further aims included the identification of predictors and prognostic implications for AHF decompensation during hospital admission and the determination of a potential correlation between the withdrawal of HF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) and worse outcomes during hospitalization. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data for a total of 3080 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and follow-up of at least 30 days were analysed. Patients with a previous history of CHF (n = 152, 4.9%) were more prone to the development of AHF (11.2% vs. 2.1%; P < 0.001) and had higher levels of N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide. In addition, patients with previous CHF had higher mortality rates (48.7% vs. 19.0%; P < 0.001). In contrast, 77 patients (2.5%) were diagnosed with AHF, which in the vast majority of cases (77.9%) developed in patients without a history of HF. Arrhythmias during hospital admission and CHF were the main predictors of AHF. Patients developing AHF had significantly higher mortality (46.8% vs. 19.7%; P < 0.001). Finally, the withdrawal of beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers was associated with a significant increase in in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have a significant incidence of AHF, which is associated with very high mortality rates.

We studied characteristics and outcomes of critical illness, stratified by age groups (50-59,60-69 and &#8805;70). We conducted hierarchical logistic regression in primary model(N = 262, excluding direct admissions to intensive care unit) and sensitivity analysis(N = 275): age and gender in base model, entering CCI, frailty (CFS or FI) and initial acuity sequentially. RESULTS: The &#8805;70 age group had highest CCI(p<.001), FI(p<.001) and CFS(p<.001), and prevalence of geriatric syndromes (polypharmacy,53.5%; urinary symptoms,37.5%; chronic pain,23.3% and malnutrition,23.3%). Thirty-two (11.6%) developed critical illness. In the primary regression model, age was not predictive for critical illness when a frailty predictor was added. Significant predictors in the final model (AUC 0.809) included male gender (p=.012), CFS (p=.038), and high initial acuity (p=.021) but not CCI or FI. In sensitivity analysis, FI (p=.028) but not CFS was significant. CONCLUSIONS: In hospitalized older adults with COVID-19, geriatric syndromes are not uncommon. Acuity of clinical presentation and frailty are important age-independent predictors of disease severity. CFS and FI provide complimentary information in predicting interval disease progression and rapid disease progression respectively.","output":"Predictors for development of critical illness amongst older adults with COVID-19: Beyond age to age-associated factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical features and laboratory indices of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and explore their association with the severity of the disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 61 patients with COVID-19 were divided into groups with common symptoms and with severe diseases, and clinical data were collected to analyze and compare the differences between them. RESULTS In patients with severe COVID-19, compared with the common group, lymphocyte count and albumin levels were lower, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea, blood creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and prothrombin time (PT) were elevated (all P<0.05). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), mean platelet volume-to-lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), and C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) were significantly elevated in the severe group compared with the group with common symptoms; however, the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) was significantly reduced (P<0.05). Univariate logistic regression showed that lower lymphocyte count, prolonged PT, elevated CRP and LDH levels, and elevated NLR, PLR, MPVLR, and CAR were risk factors for COVID-19 severity (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that elevated CRP levels (odds ratio [OR], 0.028; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.002-0.526; P=0.017), prolonged PT (OR, 0.014; 95% CI: 0.001-0.341; P=0.09), and an MPVLR >8.9 (OR, 0.026; 95% CI: 0.002-0.349; P=0.006) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity.

The most common motifs utilize hybridization to a complementary detection strand coupled with a sensitive reporter molecule. Here, a paper-based colorimetric assay for DNA detection based on pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA)-induced nanoparticle aggregation is reported as an alternative to traditional colorimetric approaches. PNA probes are an attractive alternative to DNA and RNA probes because they are chemically and biologically stable, easily synthesized, and hybridize efficiently with the complementary DNA strands. The acpcPNA probe contains a single positive charge from the lysine at C-terminus and causes aggregation of citrate anion-stabilized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the absence of complementary DNA. In the presence of target DNA, formation of the anionic DNA-acpcPNA duplex results in dispersion of the AgNPs as a result of electrostatic repulsion, giving rise to a detectable color change. Factors affecting the sensitivity and selectivity of this assay were investigated, including ionic strength, AgNP concentration, PNA concentration, and DNA strand mismatches. The method was used for screening of synthetic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA based on a colorimetric paper-based analytical device developed using the aforementioned principle. The oligonucleotide targets were detected by measuring the color change of AgNPs, giving detection limits of 1.53 (MERS-CoV), 1.27 (MTB), and 1.03 nM (HPV). The acpcPNA probe exhibited high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over single-base-mismatch, two-base-mismatch, and noncomplementary DNA targets. The proposed paper-based colorimetric DNA sensor has potential to be an alternative approach for simple, rapid, sensitive, and selective DNA detection.","output":"Multiplex Paper-Based Colorimetric DNA Sensor Using Pyrrolidinyl Peptide Nucleic Acid-Induced AgNPs Aggregation for Detecting MERS-CoV, MTB, and HPV Oligonucleotides"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: CRF55_01B is a newly identified HIV-1 circulating recombinant form originated from MSM in China. However, its impact on the disease progression and transmission risk has not been investigated. This study aimed to determine the impact of CRF55_01B infection on viral dynamics and immunological status so as to provide scientific evidence for further control and prevention effort on CRF55_01B. Linear mixed effect models were applied to evaluate CD4 cell count decline and viral load increase by subtype. RESULTS: Of the 3418 blood samples, 1446 (42.3%) were CRF07_BC, 1169 (34.2%) CRF01_AE, 467 (13.7%) CRF55_01B, 249 (7.3%) type B, and 87 (2.5%) other subtypes (CRF_08BC, CRF_01B, C). CRF55_01B had become the third predominant strain since 2012 in Shenzhen, China. CRF55_01B-infected MSM showed lower median of CD4 count than CRF07_BC-infected MSM (349.5 [IQR, 250.2C474.8] vs. 370.0 [IQR, 278.0C501.0], P < 0.05). CRF55_01B infection was associated with slower loss of CD4 count than CRF01_AE (13.6 vs. 23.3 [cells/l]1/2/year, P < 0.05)among MSM with initial CD4 count of 200C350 cells/l. On the other hand, those infected with CRF55_01B showed higher median plasma HIV RNA load (5.4 [IQR, 5.0C5.9]) than both CRF01_AE (5.3 [IQR, 4.8C5.7], P < 0.05) and CRF07_BC (5.0 log10 [IQR, 4.5C5.5], P < 0.001) at the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Furthermore, the annual increasing rate of viral load for CRF55_01B infection was significantly higher than that of CRF07_BC (2.0 vs. 0.7 log10 copies/ml/year, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively lower CD4 count and faster increase of plasma HIV RNA load of CRF55_01B-infected MSM without antiretroviral therapy suggest that CRF55_01B may lead to longer asymptomatic phase and higher risk of HIV transmission. Strengthened surveillance, tailored prevention strategies and interventions, and in-depth research focusing on CRF55_01B are urgently needed to forestall potential epidemic.

Whether the characteristic findings of Chest CT could differentiate confirmed COVID-19 cases from other positive nucleic acid test (NAT)-negative patients has not been rigorously evaluated. Purpose We aim to test whether chest computed tomography (CT) manifestation of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) can be differentiated by a radiologist or a computer-based CT image analysis system. Methods We conducted a retrospective case-control study that included 52 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 80 non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients between 20 December, 2019 and 10 February, 2020. The chest CT images were evaluated by radiologists in a double blind fashion. A computer-based image analysis system (uAI system, Lianying Inc., Shanghai, China) detected the lesions in 18 lung segments defined by Boyden classification system and calculated the infected volume in each segment. The number and volume of lesions detected by radiologist and computer system was compared with Chi-square test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Results The main CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multi-lobar/segmental peripheral ground-glass opacities and patchy air space infiltrates. The case and control groups were similar in demographics, comorbidity, and clinical manifestations. There was no significant difference in eight radiologist identified CT image features between the two groups of patients. There was also no difference in the absolute and relative volume of infected regions in each lung segment. Conclusions We documented the non-differentiating nature of initial chest CT image between COVID-19 and other viral pneumonia with suspected symptoms. Our results do not support CT findings replacing microbiological diagnosis as a critical criterion for COVID-19 diagnosis. Our findings may prompt re-evaluation of isolated patients without laboratory confirmation.","output":"Chest CT Images for COVID-19: Radiologists and Computer-based detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Despite increasing evidence for specialized cardiac arrest centers, the impact of transport time on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients' outcome remains unclear. We systematically reviewed the prognostic impact of transport time in OHCA patients. METHODS We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to May 2016 for studies that had reported the relationship between transport time and outcome in OHCA patients. The primary outcome was survival at hospital discharge. The secondary outcomes included neurological outcome at hospital discharge and long-term outcome. RESULTS From a total of 3454 titles retrieved from the literature search, 9 studies were included for final analysis. All nine studies (N=46,417) were retrospective observational studies. OHCA patients included were mostly male (61-76%), suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest in half of the cases, and had an initial shockable rhythm in one third of cases. The overall survival to hospital discharge for all cardiac rhythms was less than 6%. There was no evidence for a differential mortality risk in OHCA patients according to transport time (mean difference -0.05min [-0.86,0.76]; I2 25%; 4 studies, 2197 patients). CONCLUSION Paramedic transport time was not associated with survival to hospital discharge or with neurological outcome at hospital discharge in adult OHCA patients.

The impact of Medicaid status on outcomes after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is unknown. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence outcomes following LSG in the adult Medicaid population of Louisiana with particular focus on adherence to bariatric aftercare attendance and access to care. METHODS A retrospective review of 63 Medicaid patients undergoing LSG was performed. Demographic data, access to care, weight, co-morbidities morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. Changes in weight and obesity-related co-morbidities were analyzed for patients with 12 months of follow-up. Regression analyses were used for estimating the relationships among variables. RESULTS The majority of patients were female and non-Caucasian. The mean age was 38.6 years. Morbidity was 16% and mortality was 0%. The average distance traveled to clinic was 71.9 miles. Within the first year only 10% of the patients attended all post-operative clinic visits. A multiple logistic model showed that the only predictor of clinic attendance was increased age. At a mean follow-up of 17.7 months, the mean percent excess body weight loss was 47.2%. Greater pre-surgical weight was the only variable associated with suboptimal weight loss. Improvement or resolution of all major co-morbidities was seen in 65% of patients. CONCLUSION Medicaid patients had a poor attendance at bariatric surgery follow up appointments.

The information that the VIPER rover provides will help improve understanding of the composition, distribution, and accessibility of Lunar polar volatiles and will help determine howthe Moons resources can support future human space exploration. VIPER, however, represents a radical departure from the way that NASA has traditionally developed planetary robotic missions. A key consequence of these differences is that estimating the cst of VIPERs rover software is challenging and complex. For example, VIPER is being developed using management procedures typically applied to NASA research and technology projects, rather than space flight programs. In addition, key portions of the rovers software are being designed as ground software to run on mission control computers (rather than on board the rover as flight software as with prior planetary missions) taking advantage of continuous, interactive data communications between the Moon and Earth and higher performance computing available on the ground. Moreover, the rovers software is being engineered using Agile software development practices and incorporates a significant amount of open-source code rather than following traditional (spir al, waterfall, etc.) development methods and mouse code. In this paper, we present an innovative process to estimate the life cycle cost of VIPERs rover software.

This could potentially lead to increased viral exposure to subsequent patients and practitioners. We evaluated intraoperative contamination and aerosol box decontamination and the impact of a preoperative educational visual aid. METHODS: Using a double-blinded randomized design, forty-four anesthesiology trainees and faculty completed a simulated anesthetic case using an aerosol box contaminated with a fluorescent marker; half of the subjects received a visual aid prior to the simulation. Intraoperative contamination was evaluated at 10 standardized locations using an ultraviolet (UV) light. Next, subjects were instructed to clean the aerosol box for use on the next patient. Following cleaning, the box was evaluated for decontamination using an UV light. RESULTS: Median total contamination score was significantly reduced in the experimental group (5.0 vs. 10.0, P < 0.001). The aerosol box was completely cleaned by 36.4% of subjects in the experimental group compared to 4.5% in the control group (P = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a visual aid significantly decreased intraoperative contamination and improved box cleaning. Despite these findings, a potentially clinically significant amount of viral exposure may exist. Thorough evaluation of the risks and benefits of the aerosol box should be completed prior to use.

GS2 has been considered for a long time as an essential enzyme for angiosperms survival under photorespiratory conditions.

Altogether, it appears that the GS2 \\"textbook\\" view of this enzyme must be revisited, especially regarding: 1) its essentiality for plants growth under photorespiratory conditions and 2) the role of NH4 + assimilation during ammonium stress. In this sense, in this article we open the debate whether \\"more or less\\" GS2 is a desirable trait for plants productivity.","output":"Is plastidic glutamine synthetase essential for C3 plants?

This lowered staff morale and reduced learning opportunities through the community of learners in the PED. This is particularly significant in a setting which manages a diverse range of pathologies, which has a high turnover of junior staff and where junior staff often face a steep learning curve at the start of their post, potentially posing increased clinical risk. A new teaching strategy was therefore implemented and delivered electronically in the form of a weekly 1-page newsletter.ObjectivesTo continue educating the staff within the PEDTo maintain a positive morale within the PED teamMethodsA weekly newsletter was sent out electronically to all staff within PED, it contained bitesize information on the PED topic of the week, signposting to further resources and an update on departmental news which included any new COVID-19 guidelines, local and regional training opportunities and celebrations of team-members achievements and contributions to the department during that week. There was also a summary of learning outcomes from the departmental weekly simulation sessions and a section on learning from a real case that had recently been seen in the department. Additionally, there was a link to a weekly quiz which was predominantly based on the topic of the week, for staff members to assess their knowledge on the topic.The topic of the week was based on common PED presentations. The quiz was used for participants own self- assessment and this has been shown to be an effective learning strategy within education. Sharing real-life examples of cases and learning points from simulation allowed participants to connect with their learning by highlighting its relevance to the real-world. In addition, it provided the opportunity to safely reflect on their own practice (E.g what might they have done differently) and helped learners build across their zone of proximal development, thus giving the opportunity to develop cognitive skills and own world view.ResultsAnonymised feedback was collected from a cross-section of department team members using an online survey 4 months after the intervention was started. The feedback received was that length and frequency of the newsletters was adequate, the quiz was positively received, and that team members felt that the newsletter brought a sense of comradery, despite social distancing.Constructive feedback was given for future newsletters regarding its format to make it easier to read on mobile devices and suggestions of including notification of team-members birthdays and junior staff to be involved in the newsletters production, thus resulting in an even more inclusive construction of the newsletter.ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic many areas of the department changed including teaching, however departmental learning and sense of team involvement was not diminished but rather thrived with the addition of the weekly paediatric emergency department newsletter.","output":"A weekly newsletter to maintain teamwork and teaching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Data on risk factors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization are needed to guide prevention efforts and clinical care We sought to identify factors independently associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalizations METHODS: U S community-dwelling adults (18 years) hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 during March 1-June 23, 2020 were identified from the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET), a multi-state surveillance system To calculate hospitalization rates by age, sex, and race/ethnicity strata, COVID-NET data served as the numerator and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System estimates served as the population denominator for characteristics of interest Underlying medical conditions examined included hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of stroke, diabetes, obesity [BMI 30 kg/m 2], severe obesity [BMI40 kg/m 2], chronic kidney disease, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Generalized Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted rate ratios (aRR) for hospitalization RESULTS: Among 5,416 adults, hospitalization rates were higher among those with 3 underlying conditions (versus without)(aRR: 5 0;95%CI: 3 9, 6 3), severe obesity (aRR:4 4;95%CI: 3 4, 5 7), chronic kidney disease (aRR:4 0;95%CI: 3 0, 5 2), diabetes (aRR:3 2;95%CI: 2 5, 4 1), obesity (aRR:2 9;95%CI: 2 3, 3 5), hypertension (aRR:2 8;95%CI: 2 3, 3 4), and asthma (aRR:1 4;95%CI: 1 1, 1 7), after adjusting for age, sex, and race/ethnicity Adjusting for the presence of an individual underlying medical condition, higher hospitalization rates were observed for adults aged 65, 45-64 (versus 18-44 years), males (versus females), and non-Hispanic black and other race/ethnicities (versus non-Hispanic whites) CONCLUSION: Our findings elucidate groups with higher hospitalization risk that may benefit from targeted preventive and therapeutic interventions","output":"Risk Factors for COVID-19-associated hospitalization: COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND North America is amidst an opioid overdose epidemic.

Data was analyzed thematically and framed by theories of structural vulnerability. RESULTS While participants described the utility and disadvantages of the technology for overdose response, most participants, unexpectedly described alternate adoptions of the technology. Participants used the technology for other emergency situations (e.g., gender-based violence), rather than its intended purpose of overdose response. CONCLUSIONS Our findings highlight the limitations of current technologies while also demonstrating the clear need for housing-based emergency response interventions that address not just overdose risk but also gender-based violence.

Telehealth addresses geographic barriers by offering routine, technology-based visits, and remote patient monitoring. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to explore adoption perceptions of a tele-COPD program among community members in rural Western North Carolina (WNC) counties. METHODS: A convenience sample of 17 community members were recruited to participate in one of five 45-min focus groups. Before the focus group, all participants completed a brief demographic survey. Focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, imported into MAXQDA v10, and analyzed thematically using established qualitative coding procedures. SPSS v22 was used to calculate descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Participants were primarily Non-Hispanic White (100%), male (59%), insured (100%), and had at least a high school education (80%). Only 25% of participants had any prior knowledge of telehealth programs. The majority (94%) of participants expressed interest in receiving a tele-COPD program due to convenience factors. Yet, most participants expressed a lack of interest and comfort in using Internet-capable devices (e.g., mobile devices, tablets, computers). Participants noted that to be successful, telehealth visits must be described and shown to them by their own provider or other trusted individual(s), such as a pharmacist. Privacy and cost were also expressed as telehealth concerns. CONCLUSION: Interest in a tele-COPD program was high among community residents in rural WNC. However, to increase patient willingness to adopt a tele-COPD program, patients' providers must overcome challenges, such as patients' awareness and knowledge of telehealth, privacy and cost concerns, and access to and comfort with using new technologies.

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercoagulability and inflammation leading to venous thrombotic events (VTE). Although elderly patients with comorbidities are at higher risk, COVID-19 may also cause VTE in a broader patient population without these risks. Neurologic complications and manifestations of COVID-19, including neuropathies, seizures, strokes and encephalopathy usually occur in severe established cases of COVID-19 infection who primarily present with respiratory distress. CASE DESCRIPTION: Case report of a 29-year-old woman, with no significant past medical history or comorbidities, presenting with new onset seizures. Further questioning revealed a one-week history of headaches, low-grade fever, mild cough and shortness of breath, diagnosed as COVID-19. Imaging revealed a left temporoparietal hemorrhagic venous infarction with left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis treated with full dose anticoagulation and antiepileptics. CONCLUSION: Although elderly patients with comorbidities are considered highest risk for COVID-19 neurologic complications, usually when systemic symptoms are severe, this case report emphasizes that young individuals are at risk for VTE with neurologic complications even when systemic symptoms are mild, likely induced by COVID-19 associated hypercoagulable state.","output":"Cerebral venous thrombosis: A typical presentation of COVID-19 in the young"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute care nurse practitioners (NPs) are educated, clinically trained, and board certified to care for acutely and critically ill patients, largely in hospital settings.

However, the risk factors for this complication are poorly understood. We hypothesize that genetic predisposition to cardioand cerebrovascular disease (CVD) leads to an increased risk of stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods: We evaluated data from a nested cohort study conducted within the UK Biobank focused on persons with documented COVID-19. Incident strokes (ischemic and hemorrhagic) were identified by combining inpatient data (including critical care and discharge diagnostic codes) and primary care data, the latter entered by providers within 30 days of a positive COVID-19 test. Genetic predisposition to CVD was evaluated through a polygenic risk score that integrated genomic information on 2,176 independent genetic risk variants for stroke, coronary artery disease and cardiometabolic risk factors. This score was divided into low (0-20th percentile), intermediate (20th- 80th percentile), and high (80 -100 percentile) genetic risk. Results: A total of 11,882 study participants (mean age 65.8, SD [8.6], female sex 6,306 [53.1%]) with documented COVID-19 infection were included in this study, including 99 (0.8%) persons that ustained a stroke during the infection. Compared to persons with low genetic predisposition to CVD, those with intermediate and high genetic risk had 35% (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.14-1.55) and 2.4- fold (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.71-3.05) higher risk of stroke (test for trend p=0.004). Sub-scoring analyses evaluating one polygenic risk score per CVD trait of interest indicated that genetic predisposition to hypertension (p=0.017) and smoking (p=0.03) were the most important genetic risk factors. Conclusions: Genetic predisposition to CVD is associated with a higher risk of stroke in persons with acute COVID-19 infection. Genetic risk factors for hypertension and smoking appear to mediate a significant portion of this association. Genetic information should be considered in the multiple ongoing efforts to create risk-stratification strategies to identify COVID-19 patients at high risk of stroke.","output":"Genetic predisposition to cardiovascular disease is associated with higher risk of stroke in persons with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has achieved impressive improvements in health outcomes and economic growth in the last decade but its total health spending is among the lowest in Africa. Ethiopia launched a Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme in 2011 with a vision of reaching 80% of districts and 80% of its population by 2020. This study aimed to identify early achievements in scaling up CBHI and the challenges of such scale-up. METHODS: We interviewed 18 stakeholders working on health financing and health insurance in Ethiopia, using a semi-structured interview guide. All interviews were conducted in English and transcribed for analysis. We performed direct content analysis of the interview transcripts to identify key informants views on the achievements of, and challenges in, the scale-up of CBHI. RESULTS: Implementation of CBHI in Ethiopia took advantage of two key policy windowsglobal efforts towards universal health coverage and domestic resource mobilization to prepare countries for their transition away from donor assistance for health. CBHI received strong political support and early pilots helped to inform the process of scaling up the scheme. CBHI has helped to mobilize community engagement and resources, improve access to and use of health services, provide financial protection, and empower women. CONCLUSION: Gradually increasing risk pooling would improve the financial sustainability of CBHI. Improving health service quality and the availability of medicines should be the priority to increase and sustain population coverage. Engaging different stakeholders, including healthcare providers, lower level policy makers, and the private sector, would mobilize more resources for the development of CBHI. Training for operational staff and a strong health information system would improve the implementation of CBHI and provide evidence to inform better decision-making.

In the current study, the involvement of S100 calcium binding protein S100A4, S100A9, and S100A10 in the inflammatory settings of COVID-19 patients were evaluated. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 65 COVID-19 subjects and 50 healthy controls. From the blood samples, RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized, and then the mRNA expression levels of S100A4, S100A9, and S100A10 were measured by Real-time PCR. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of S100A4 (fold change [FC] = 1.45, P = 0.0011), S100A9 (FC = 1.47, P = 0.0013), and S100A10 (FC = 1.35, P = 0.0053) was significantly upregulated in COVID-19 patients than controls.

Emerging evidence indicates a role for miRNAs in AAA pathogenesis, therefore we aimed to identify miRNAs that differently expressed in exosomes from AAA patients and explore the underlying mechanisms of how miR-106a plays its role in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS Exosomes were isolated from plasma of AAA patients, as well as from the tissue-conditioned culture medium. The exosomal expression profiles of several miRNAs including miR-106a were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. To determine the potential role of miR-106a in the pathogenesis of AAA, miR-106a was overexpressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), and then cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by performing CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Afterwards, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to assess the expression levels of some proteins involved in the modulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis. Furthermore, the target gene of miR-106a was predicted and verified through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS MiR-106a was up-regulated in exosomes from plasma of those patients with AAA as compared with healthy peers. Likely, increased level of miR-106a was observed in exosomes released from AAA tissue in comparison to those from adjacent normal tissues. Enhanced expression of miR-106a in VSMCs suppressed cell viability but promoted cellular apoptosis, whereas inhibition of miR-106a in VSMCs resulted in a significant decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells compared to the control group. In addition, the protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs, including MMP-2 and MMP-12) secreted from VSMCs were significantly up-regulated, while their inhibitor TIMP-2 was down-regulated due to miR-106a overexpression. Finally, TIMP-2 was validated subsequently as the direct target of miR-106a through Dual-Luciferase reporter assay. CONCLUSIONS In aggregate, our results suggest that increased expression of miR-106a promotes VSMC cell apoptosis and down-regulates TIMP-2 through directly targeting its 3'-UTR, which in turn restores MMP production and ultimately accelerates ECM degradation. Therefore miR-106a is proposed to play a crucial role in AAA development and this will provide an update on the understanding of the clinical value of miRNAs as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.","output":"Up-regulation of exosomal miR-106a may play a significant role in abdominal aortic aneurysm by inducing vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis and targeting TIMP-2, an inhibitor of metallopeptidases that suppresses extracellular matrix degradation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liver damage during COVID-19 disease has been described in numerous studies.

It aims at answering the question of whether personality-based intellectual styles are culture specific or they are universal. To achieve this aim, based on the two broad cultural systems derived from Hofstede's model of four cultural dimensions and two major style types from Zhang and Sternberg's threefold model of intellectual styles, two research hypotheses were made. To test the hypotheses, two types of empirical literature centered on each of the two personality-based styles are reviewed: (1) cross-cultural comparative studies; and (2) within-culture studies investigating the association of the two style constructs with other human attributes and outcomes. Results suggest that although personality-based styles are related to culture, they cannot be culture specific; rather, they are fundamentally universal.

In particular, accumulating evidence points to a substantial fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections, which influences our understanding of the transmission potential and severity of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. METHODS: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City together with epidemiological data of Japanese repatriated from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. RESULTS: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China, in 2019-2020 reached values at 3.49 (95% CrI 3.39-3.62) with a mean serial interval of 6.0 days, and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23 in 2020 was associated with a significantly reduced R at 0.84 (95% CrI 0.81-0.88), with the total number of infections (i.e., cumulative infections) estimated at 1,906,634 (95% CrI 1,373,500-2,651,124) in Wuhan City, elevating the overall proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95% CrI 13.5-26.6%). We also estimated the most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR at 0.04% (95% CrI 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95% CrI 0.08-0.17%), respectively, estimates that are substantially smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.06%. CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during January-February 2020 using an ecological modeling approach that is suitable to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems. Our estimate of time-delay adjusted IFR falls in the range of the median IFR estimates based on multiple serological studies conducted in several areas of the world.","output":"Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China, January-February, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with stroke, particular characteristics of these patients are not fully understood. The adequate management of these patients depends on the comprehension of factors such as temporality, clinical presentation and etiology. We hypothesize there is a differential temporal relationship between COVID-19 severity and stroke onset. Methods: Considering PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of the literature as of July 2020 was conducted and registered on PROSPERO. Pubmed and Scopus studies reporting patients with COVID-19 and stroke were included. Clinical, sociodemographic and laboratory characteristics of patients were extracted and analyzed. Results: Forty-seven studies and 176 patients were included, with a mean age of 63.1 years (SD= 16 n=122), most of them were males (63.2% n=171). The most frequent etiology was cryptogenic (40.9% n=66), and a mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale of 14.4 points was found (SD= 8.6 n=73). Large vessel occlusion (LVO) was reported in 65.9% patients (n=91) and these patients were younger with greater stroke severity. D-dimer, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase were elevated in most patients with reported findings. Most patients had severe COVID-19. The mean time from onset of respiratory symptoms to stroke was 9 days (SD=9.9), a shorter time was noted in those with mild and moderate disease compared with the longest time in severe disease, this difference was statistically significant (p&lt; 0.001). Conclusions: There is a trend between the severity of COVID-19 and time to stroke onset, in which mild disease is associated with earlier stroke than severe disease. Age and stroke severity are related to the development of LVO. Inflammation and hypercoagulability markers are elevated in this disease, we propose to consider hypercoagulability secondary to COVID-19 as an underlying cause of stroke in these patients.","output":"Time of stroke onset in coronavirus disease 2019 patients around the globe: A systematic review and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective exudate retention by dressings requires close and intimate dressing\\\\wound contact, immediately and continuously after the dressing application.

However, it is unclear how much practice is needed to fully adapt to robotic assistance, and which neuromotor processes underly this adaptation. Familiarization strategies for novice users, robotic optimization techniques (e.g. human-in-the-loop), and meaningful comparative assessments depend on this understanding. METHODS To better understand the process of motor adaptation to robotic assistance, we analyzed the energy expenditure, gait kinematics, stride times, and muscle activities of eight na?ve unimpaired participants across three 20-min sessions of robot-assisted walking. Experimental outcomes were analyzed with linear mixed effect models and statistical parametric mapping techniques. RESULTS Most of the participants' kinematic and muscular adaptation occurred within the first minute of assisted walking. After ten minutes, or 880 steps, the energetic benefits of assistance were realized (an average of 5.1% (SD 2.4%) reduction in energy expenditure compared to unassisted walking). Motor adaptation was likely driven by the formation of an internal model for feedforward motor control as evidenced by the reduction of burst-like muscle activity at the cyclic end of robotic assistance and an increase in arm-swing asymmetry previously associated with increased cognitive load. CONCLUSION Humans appear to adapt to walking assistance from a wearable robot over 880 steps by forming an internal model for feedforward control. The observed adaptation to the wearable robot is well-described by existing three-stage models that start from a cognitive stage, continue with an associative stage, and end in autonomous task execution.

The morphology of the microfiber mat was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The thermal and mechanical properties, water contact angle, surface area and pore size of the microfiber mats were characterized. Due to the introduction of graphene which can interact with silk fibroin, the SF/PLGA/GO microfiber mat, compared with the silk fibroin/poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (SF/PLGA) microfiber mat, has higher strength, greater Young's modulus and better thermal stability which can meet the requirements of protective fabric. The microfiber mat is biodegradable because its main component is silk fibroin and PLGA. In particular, the microfiber mat has a small pore size range of 4  10 nm in diameter, a larger surface area of 2.63 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 7.09  10(-3) cm(3) g(-1). The small pore size of the mat can effectively block the particulate pollutants and pathogenic particles in the air. The larger surface area and pore volume of the mat are effective for breathability.

If the DL algorithm achieves a performance equivalent to that achieved by physicians in chest radiography (CR) diagnoses with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia, the automatic interpretation of the CR with DL algorithms can significantly reduce the burden on clinicians and radiologists in sudden surges of suspected COVID-19 patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR compared with formal radiology reports. This is a retrospective study of adult patients that were diagnosed as positive COVID-19 cases based on the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction among all the patients who were admitted to five emergency departments and one community treatment center in Korea from February 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020. The CR images were evaluated with a publicly available DL algorithm. For reference, CR images without chest computed tomography (CT) scans classified as positive for COVID-19 pneumonia were used given that the radiologist identified ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or other infiltration in retrospectively reviewed CR images. Patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest CT scans were also classified as COVID-19 pneumonia positive outcomes. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the DL algorithm for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on CR were 95.6%, and 88.7%, respectively. The area under the curve value of the DL algorithm for the detection of COVID-19 with pneumonia was 0.921. The DL algorithm demonstrated a satisfactory diagnostic performance comparable with that of formal radiology reports in the CR-based diagnosis of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. The DL algorithm may offer fast and reliable examinations that can facilitate patient screening and isolation decisions, which can reduce the medical staff workload during COVID-19 pandemic situations.","output":"Deep-learning algorithms for the interpretation of chest radiographs to aid in the triage of COVID-19 patients: A multicenter retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since we announced the call for this Special Issue on Decolonial Interventions: in the middle of decoloniality in mid-2019, it feels like a lot has changed and the middle is more entangled and complicated than ever The COVID-19 pandemic has locked us down to shelter in our places, yet it has made us busier and more connected, and more worried and questioning The concerns and motivations that stood behind our decision to call for this Special Issue have not been eclipsed, as we might have initially thought Indeed, our concerns have been magnified and thrust forward as the global spread of the pandemic has been accompanied by the eruption of Black Lives Matter protests against police violence in the US, scenes of pandemic refugees dying on their exodus from locked-down cities in India, toppling statues in Britain and horrendously unjust disparities of sickness and death burdening Black people, Indigenous people and people of colour in different countries Deep questions about structural injustice and the colonial-modern have (re)surfaced as the entangled roots of oppression and violence have been thrust into the open, making them impossible to ignore Racism, gender violence, indigenous dispossession and genocide, climate and environmental injustice, forest fires and species extinction render basic human demands for healthcare, shelter, food, clean water and even the universal right to breathe (Mbembe 2020) impossible for so many ? 2020 Journal of International Women''s Studies","output":"In Medias Res: Decolonial Interventions Editorial Introduction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, quick public health investigations of the relationships between behaviours and infection risk are essential.

We set out to evaluate possible epistatic interactions between the early occurring D614G mutation and the more recently emerged cleavage site mutations present in spike of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants of concern. The P681H/R mutations at the S1/S2 cleavage site increased spike processing and fusogenicity but limited its incorporation into pseudoviruses. In addition, the higher cleavage rate led to higher shedding of the spike S1 subunit, resulting in a lower infectivity of the P681H/R-carrying pseudoviruses compared to those expressing the Wuhan wild-type spike. The D614G mutation increased spike expression at the cell surface and limited S1 shedding from pseudovirions. As a consequence, the D614G mutation preferentially increased the infectivity of P681H/R-carrying pseudoviruses. This enhancement was more marked in cells where the endosomal route predominated, suggesting that more stable spikes could better withstand the endosomal environment. Taken together, these findings suggest that the D614G mutation stabilized S1/S2 association and enabled the selection of mutations that increased S1/S2 cleavage, leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants expressing highly fusogenic spikes. AUTHOR SUMMARYThe successive emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants is fueling the COVID pandemic, thus causing a major and persistent public health issue. The parameters involved in the emergence of variants with higher pathogenic potential remain incompletely understood. The first SARS-CoV-2 variant that spread worldwide in early 2020 carried a D614G mutation in the viral spike, making this protein more stable in its cleaved form at the surface of virions, and resulting in viral particles with higher infectious capacity. The Alpha and the Delta variants that spread in late 2020 and early 2021, respectively, proved increasingly transmissible and pathogenic when compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. Interestingly, Alpha and Delta both carried mutations in a spike cleavage site that needs to be processed by cellular proteases prior to viral entry. The cleavage site mutations P681H/R made the Alpha and Delta spikes more efficient at viral fusion, by generating a higher fraction of cleaved spikes subunits S1 and S2. We show here that the early D614G mutation and the late P681H/R mutations act synergistically to increase the fusion capacity of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Specifically, viruses with increased spike cleavage due to P681H/R were even more dependent on the stabilizing effect of D614G mutation, which limited the shedding of cleaved S1 subunits from viral particles. These findings suggest that the worldwide spread of the D614G mutation was a prerequisite to the emergence of more pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants with highly fusogenic spikes.","output":"The spike-stabilizing D614G mutation interacts with S1/S2 cleavage site mutations to promote the infectious potential of SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dinamika dan perubahan arah pendidikan abad 21 menjadi salah satu fokus pengambilan kebijakan nasional maupun di tingkat global selain dari penuntasan target Sustainable Development Goals ke 4 di tahun 2025.

The IL-6 in the tumor microenvironment was produced either by the cancer cell or by host stromal cells, or by tumor-infiltrating immune cells, or all of them. IL-6 effects in this context included local changes in tumor cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion, enhanced motility, epithelial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT), and changes in cell proliferation rates in both solid tumors as well as hematologic dyscrasias. Locally produced IL-6 enhanced cancer-targeting functions of tumor-infiltrating macrophages and immune cells. Additionally, the sex-biased phenotype of certain cancers [e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which is 3-5-fold more common in men] was related to the inhibition of macrophage-derived IL-6 production by estradiol-17 (E2). In many circumstances, locally produced IL-6 reached the peripheral circulation and elicited systemic effects such as cachexia and paraneoplastic syndrome (including fever, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased levels of C-reactive protein in serum, hypoalbuminemia). This review highlights the EMT produced by IL-6 in cancer cells, as well as mechanisms underlying sex bias in HCC, enhanced IL-6 expression in cancer cells resulting from mutations in p53, consequent alterations in STAT3 transcriptional signaling, and the newer understanding of STAT3 nuclear bodies in the cancer cell as phase-separated biomolecular condensates and membraneless organelles (MLOs). Moreover, the perplexing issue of discrepant measurements of IL-6 in human circulation using different assays, especially in patients undergoing immunotherapy, is discussed. Additionally, the paradoxical chaperone (enhancing) effect of anti-IL-6 neutralizing antibodies on IL-6 in vivo and consequent limitations of immunotherapy using anti-IL-6 mAb is considered.","output":"Interleukin-6 at the Host-Tumor Interface: STAT3 in Biomolecular Condensates in Cancer Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious and noninfectious pulmonary complications are common among HSCT recipients and are the leading cause for respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and ICU admission.

Knowing the intended uptake of the vaccine will inform supply and public health messaging to maximize vaccination. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the acceptance of influenza vaccination in the 2020-2021 season, specifically focusing on people who were previously eligible but routinely declined vaccination and newly eligible people. METHODS: Intention to receive the influenza vaccine in 2020-2021 was asked of all registrants of the largest electronic personal health record in the NHS by a web-based questionnaire on July 31, 2020. Of those who were either newly or previously eligible but had not previously received an influenza vaccination, multivariable logistic regression and network diagrams were used to examine their reasons to undergo or decline vaccination. RESULTS: Among 6641 respondents, 945 (14.2%) were previously eligible but were not vaccinated; of these, 536 (56.7%) intended to receive an influenza vaccination in 2020-2021, as did 466 (68.6%) of the newly eligible respondents. Intention to receive the influenza vaccine was associated with increased age, index of multiple deprivation quintile, and considering oneself to be at high risk from COVID-19. Among those who were eligible but not intending to be vaccinated in 2020-2021, 164/543 (30.2%) gave reasons based on misinformation. Of the previously unvaccinated health care workers, 47/96 (49%) stated they would decline vaccination in 2020-2021. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, COVID-19 has increased acceptance of influenza vaccination in previously eligible but unvaccinated people and has motivated substantial uptake in newly eligible people. This study is essential for informing resource planning and the need for effective messaging campaigns to address negative misconceptions, which is also necessary for COVID-19 vaccination programs.","output":"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Uptake of Influenza Vaccine: UK-Wide Observational Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Vaccine candidates against COVID-19 have diverse compositions, from traditional inac-tivated virus vaccines to various new-generation vaccines.

Well-ordered periodic surface ripple/finger patterns were observed during the adhesion and coalescence, which eventually disappeared, leaving smooth polymer-air interfaces. The life-times of these transient well-ordered patterns depend on the viscosity and film thickness of the polymer melts. These observations are in contrast to the conventional understanding that liquid-liquid coalescence usually occurs with the deforming surfaces remaining smoothly curved at all stages, with no esoteric shape-transitions. The results reveal a new feature associated with liquid-liquid adhesion/coalescence, which may be of key importance for a full understanding of coalescence processes.

Injury to the lungs involves damage to and the subsequent repair of cells and tissue. However, the mechanism of both at a molecular level remains unclear. As mice have similar physiological and pathological processes to humans, the current research adopted mice models to explore the long non-coding ribonucleic acid (lncRNA) in the lung tissue of mice with cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis using gene sequencing analysis. A total of 30 mice were randomly divided into two groups, i.e., the sham group and the CLP group, respectively. Three mice were randomly selected from each group, and their lung tissue was used for gene sequencing analysis. Overall, a total of 1,110 lncRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed between the two groups. Among these, 658 were over-expressed, and 452 were under-expressed (fold change  2.0, P < 0.05). Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were performed to predict the potential biological functions of these differentially expressed lncRNAs, and the top 10 over- and under-expressed lncRNAs were selected as candidates for further validation. Finally, three over-expressed lncRNAs (XLOC_025752, XLOC_086176, and XLOC_148721) and four under-expressed lncRNAs (XLOC_120813, XLOC_029657, XLOC_031620, and XLOC_096198) were validated and found to be the same as those identified by sequencing analysis. To the best of the authors's knowledge, this research is the first to explore the expression profile of lncRNAs in the lung tissue of mice with CLP-induced sepsis. The results showed different lncRNA expression profiles between the two groups, indicating that lncRNAs may contribute to the occurrence of and recovery from sepsis-induced acute lung injury through interacting with target genes.","output":"The expression profile of long non-coding RNAs in the lung tissue of mice with cecal ligation and puncture-induced sepsis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the highly restrictive measures adopted by many countries for combating the current pandemic, the number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated number of deaths steadily decreased.

Recommendations focused on perioperative airway management of patients with proven or potential COVID-19 disease were included. Accelerated screening was used; data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second. Data was organized into themes based on perioperative phase of care. Principal FindingsThirty unique sets of recommendations were identified. None reported methods for systematically searching or selecting evidence to be included. Four were updated following initial publication. For induction and airway management, most recommended minimizing personnel and having the most experienced anesthesiologist perform tracheal intubation. Significant congruence was observed amongst recommendations that discussed personal protective equipment. Of those that discussed tracheal intubation methods, most (96%) recommended video laryngoscopy, while discordance existed regarding use of flexible bronchoscopy. Intraoperatively, 23% suggested specific anesthesia techniques and most (63%) recommended a specific operating room for patients with COVID-19. Postoperatively, a minority discussed extubation procedures (33%), or care in the recovery room (40%). Non-technical considerations were discussed in 27% and psychological support for healthcare providers in 10%. ConclusionRecommendations for perioperative airway management of patients with COVID-19 overlap to a large extent. However, we also identified significant differences.

However, mounting evidence suggests that patients with few and slowly progressive distant lesions of small size may benefit from various local ablation techniques, which have already been established as standard-of-care modalities for example in colorectal and renal cell carcinomas and in sarcomas. In principle, serving as radical approaches to eradicate cancer, these interventions can be curative. Their impact on local control and overall survival has been shown in numerous retrospective and prospective studies. The term oligometastatic refers to the number of distant lesions which should generally not surpass five in total, ideally in one organ. Currently, surgical resection remains the method of choice supported by the majority of published data. More recently, stereotactic (ablative) body radiotherapy (SABR/SBRT) has emerged as a viable alternative. In cases technically amenable to such local interventions, several other clinical variables need to be taken into account also, including patient-related factors (general health status, patient preferences, socioeconomic background) and disease-related factors (primary tumor site, growth kinetics, synchronous or metachronous metastases). In head and neck cancer, patients presenting with late development of slowly progressive oligometastatic lesions in the lungs secondary to human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer are the ideal candidates for metastasectomy or other local therapies. However, literature data are still limited to say whether there are other subgroups benefiting from this approach. One of the plausible explanations is that radiological follow-up after primary curative therapy is usually not recommended because its impact on survival has not been unequivocal, which is also due to the rarity of oligometastatic manifestations in this disease. At the same time, aggressive treatment of synchronous metastases early in the disease course should be weighed against the risk of futile interventions in a disease with already multimetastatic microscopic dissemination. Therefore, attentive treatment sequencing, meticulous appraisal of cancer extension, refinement of post-treatment surveillance, and understanding of tumor biology and kinetics are crucial in the management of oligometastases.","output":"Oligometastatic Disease Management: Finding the Sweet Spot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), human life and the world economy have been severely affected, the propagation and scale of COVID-19 is top of mind for everyone.

This restriction resulted in a sudden change in people's lifestyle, leading to an increase in sedentary behavior and a related decrease in the practice of physical activity (PA). However, in neuromuscular diseases patients need to perform regular PA to counteract the negative consequences of the disease. Hence, the aim of this study was to estimate the levels of PA, measured as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week), among patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD) before and during the last week of quarantine. METHODS: A total of 268 Italian subjects, living in Sicily, completed an adapted version of the IPAQ-SF. Participants comprised 149 NMD, enrolled at the Neuromuscular Clinic of Palermo and 119 healthy subjects (control group). The SF-12 questionnaire was also administered to NMD. The Mann-Whitney U and the Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease of the total weekly PA level during COVID-19 quarantine in both patients and controls. Moreover, a significant difference in the total weekly PA level was found depending on the presence of neuromuscular disease, impaired walking, gender and BMI. Finally, we found a correlation between SF-12 scores and the entity of the reduction of PA level during quarantine, thus confirming a relevant association with the quality of life in NMD. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that COVID-19 quarantine has affected the practice of PA among both NMD and healthy controls.","output":"Significant reduction of physical activity in patients with neuromuscular disease during COVID-19 pandemic: the long-term consequences of quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper considers certain specific issues that will be faced by low- and middle-income countries when treating psychiatric patients who test positive for COVID-19 The need for both medical and psychiatric units to do the same and challenges in the treatment and management of positive-testing patients are discussed","output":"Critical issues in treating COVID-19-positive psychiatric patients in low- and middle-income countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 has led to a change in care for patients with chronic conditions, involving a transfer of drug administration from an outpatient to a community setting.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional review. DATA SOURCES: Medline database. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Articles published from 1 January to 31 December 2020 in the seven leading general medical journals by impact factor. Article types included primary research, reviews, editorials and commentaries. DATA EXTRACTION: Key data elements were whether the study topic was related to COVID-19 and names of the principal and the senior authors. A hierarchical approach was used to determine the likely gender of authors. Logistic regression assessed the association of study characteristics, including COVID-19 status, with authors likely gender; this was quantified using adjusted ORs (aORs). RESULTS: We included 2252 articles, of which 748 (33.2%) were COVID-19-related and 1504 (66.8%) covered other topics. A likely gender was determined for 2138 (94.9%) principal authors and 1890 (83.9%) senior authors. Men were significantly more likely to be both principal (1364 men; 63.8%) and senior (1332 men; 70.5%) authors. COVID-19-related articles were not associated with the odds of men being principal (aOR 0.99; 95% CI 0.81 to 1.21; p=0.89) or senior authors (aOR 0.96; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.19; p=0.71) relative to other topics. Articles with men as senior authors were more likely to have men as principal authors (aOR 1.49; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.83; p<0.001). Men were more likely to author articles reporting original research and those with corresponding authors based outside the USA and Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Women were substantially under-represented as authors among articles in leading medical journals; this was not significantly different for COVID-19-related articles.

In this paper, we have developed 3 ELISA methods, trimer spike IgA, trimer spike IgG, and nucleocapsid IgG, for detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We evaluated their performance in comparison with four commercial ELISAs, EDI? Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM, Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG and IgA, and one lateral flow assay, DPP? COVID-19 IgM/IgG System (Chembio). Both sensitivity and specificity were evaluated and the causes of false-positive reactions were determined. The assays were compared using 300 pre-epidemic samples and 100 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 samples. The sensitivities and specificities of the assays were as follows: 90%/100% (in-house trimer spike IgA), 90%/99.3% (in-house trimer spike IgG), 89%/98.3% (in-house nucleocapsid IgG), 73.7%/100% (EDI nucleocapsid IgM), 84.5%/95.1% (EDI nucleocapsid IgG), 95%/93.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgA), 82.8%/99.7% (Euroimmun S1 IgG), 82.0%/91.7% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgM), 92%/93.3% (Chembio nucleocapsid IgG). The presumed causes of positive signals from pre-epidemic samples in commercial and in-house assays were mixed. In some cases, positivity varied with assay repetition. In other cases, reactivity was abrogated by competitive inhibition (spiking the sample with analyte prior to performing the assay). In other cases, reactivity was consistently detected but not abrogated by analyte spiking. Overall, there was wide variability in assay performance using our samples, with in-house tests exhibiting the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. The causes of false positivity in pre-epidemic samples may be due to plasma antibodies apparently reacting with the analyte, or spurious reactivity may be directed against non-specific components in the assay system.

Fertility preservation for this group following a diagnosis of cancer is a rapidly expanding area of reproductive medicine, although provision for such treatment often varies by region.

Descriptive statistics on work-related RTC showed a higher average positivity rate for medicines (14.8%) than for alcohol (3.02%) and drugs (0.84%). Interestingly, the impact of some medications found an unconvincing explanation in the mere occurrence of side effects, and it suggests that psychosocial and/or medical conditions could be better predictors of RTC. We therefore propose an intervention and prevention model that also considers biopsychosocial factors, for which further studies are needed in future research.","output":"A Systematic Review on the Role of Substance Consumption in Work-Related Road Traffic Crashes Reveals the Importance of Biopsychosocial Factors in Prevention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The new strain of a virus in the coronavirus family, COVID-19, generated a pandemic that changed the dynamics of the entire world Since its inception, there have been discussions about the effects on mental health that isolation and social distancing can generate To investigate the publications that have been made in psychology related to COVID-19, a bibliometric analysis was performed in the SCOPUS database in the psychology collection We obtained 223 articles published in the first half of 2020 The results show that the studies are focused on the effects of the pandemic on mental health Specifically, most of the studies are related to anxiety and depression and most of these studies were conducted in China Furthermore, we discuss some limitations of the study regarding the social and intellectual structure of the articles retrieved Finally, we suggest that future studies should explore how to promote or persuade individuals to comply with social distancing measures and to develop research focused on the effects of the pandemic on academic performance, job stress, job performance, marital satisfaction, sexual behaviour, among other phenomena (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Spanish) La nueva cepa de un virus de la familia de coronavirus, COVID-19, genero una pandemia que cambio las dinamicas en mundo entero Desde su inicio se ha discutido sobre los efectos en la salud mental que pueden generar las medidas de aislamiento y distanciamiento social Con el fin de indagar sobre las publicaciones que se han realizado en psicologia relacionadas con el COVID-19, se realizo un analisis bibliometrico en la base de datos de SCUPUS en la coleccion de psicologia Se obtuvieron 223 articulos publicados en el primer semestre del 2020 Los resultados muestran que los estudios se han enfocado en los efectos de la pandemia en la salud mental Especificamente, la mayoria de los estudios estan enfocados en la ansiedad y la depresion y la mayoria de esos estudios fueron realizados en China Por otro lado, discutimos algunas limitaciones del estudio respecto a la estructura social e intelectual de los articulos recuperados Finalmente, sugerimos que se realicen investigaciones enfocadas en como promover o persuadir a los individuos para que obedezcan las medidas de distanciamiento social y que se desarrollen investigaciones enfocadas en los efectos de la pandemia en el desempeno academico, el estres laboral, el desempeno laboral, la satisfaccion marital, el comportamiento sexual, entro otros fenomenos (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","output":"Publications in psychology related to the COVID-19: A bibliometric analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Natural Immune System (NIS) is a distributed system that solves challenging search and response problems while operating under constraints imposed by physical space and resource availability. Remarkably, NIS search and response times do not scale appreciably with the physical size of the animal in which its search is conducted. Many distributed systems are engineered to solve analogous problems, and the NIS demonstrates how such engineered systems can achieve desirable scalability. We hypothesize that the architecture of the NIS, composed of a hierarchical decentralized detection network of lymph nodes (LN) facilitates efficient search and response. A sub-modular architecture in which LN numbers and size both scale with organism size is shown to efficiently balance tradeoffs between local antigen detection and global antibody production, leading to nearly scale-invariant detection and response. We characterize the tradeoffs as balancing local and global communication and show that similar tradeoffs exist in distributed systems like LN inspired artificial immune system (AIS) applications and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Taking inspiration from the architecture of the NIS, we propose a modular RADAR (Robust Adaptive Decentralized search with Automated Response) strategy for distributed systems. We demonstrate how two existing distributed systems (a LN inspired multi-robot control application and a P2P system) can be improved by a modular RADAR strategy. Such a sub-modular architecture is shown to balance the tradeoffs between local communication (within artificial LNs and P2P clusters) and global communication (between artificial LNs and P2P clusters), leading to efficient search and response.","output":"Modular RADAR: An Immune System Inspired Search and Response Strategy for Distributed Systems"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatocellular carcinoma results in a high risk of second primary malignancies and has prominent morbidity and mortality. There is a lack of effective treatment and prognosis is poor. Therefore, effective drugs need to be discovered. Carrimycin is a 16-member macrolide antibiotic with anticancer activity, and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I is a main component. The aim of this study was to determine the anti-tumor effects of carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I on hepatocellular carcinoma through in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vitro, changes in cellular proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were analyzed by MTT, colony formation, EdU labeling, wound-healing, matrigel transwell invasion, and flow cytometric assays using SK-Hep1, Hep3B, SNU-354, SNU-387 hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Western blotting and RT-PCR were used to detect the effects of carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I on the expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Nude mice were subcutaneously transplanted with SK-Hep1 cells or C57BL/6J mice were orthotopically transplanted with hepatocarcinoma H22 cells. Tumor volume, pathological changes in tumor tissues, and the concentration of VEGF in mouse serum were measured after treatments. Carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I dose-dependently inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell viability, colony formation, and DNA replication. These agents markedly suppressed migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis of the cell lines. Western blotting and RT-PCR demonstrated that carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I reduced VEGF and PD-L1 protein and mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo studies further confirmed that carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I could significantly inhibit tumor growth, tumor histopathological alterations, and the concentration of VEGF in both mouse tumor models. These results show that carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Therefore, our discovery suggests anti-tumor capacity for carrimycin and monomeric isovalerylspiramycin I and provides data on potential new drugs for inhibiting hepatocellular carcinoma.","output":"Anti-Tumor Effects of Carrimycin and Monomeric Isovalerylspiramycin I on Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Vitro and in Vivo"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To examine patient satisfaction and information recall after telehealth breast cancer survivorship visits with a nurse practitioner.

METHODS: The study involved data concerning 468 households in Szczecin (Poland) inhabited by children where acts of violence between adults took place. The presented data refer to the years 2012-2103. The data came from so called Blue Card files, i.e. documents issued by the police and social workers in cases of domestic abuse, providing information about its forms, perpetrators, and victims. RESULTS: Domestic violence usually occurs between spouses and cohabitees (78%). The perpetrator was usually a man (88%). Violence usually lasted from 1 up to 3 years (30.0%). The most common forms of physical abuse against adults and children included pushing (79.5% of adults, 22.4% of children) and hitting (64.7% of adults, 16.6% of children), and psychologically abusive behaviors were mostly insults (91.9% of adults, 27.5% of children) and criticism (79.1% of adults, 21.5% of children). This work has shown that the longer the psychological abuse between adults lasts, the greater probability is that it will also be used against children. Child abuse is also associated with putting up resistance to the police by perpetrators.

Our study aimed to identify and synthesise evidence on the association between food environment characteristics and diet, nutrition and health outcomes in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), relevant to urban settings, to support development and implementation of appropriate interventions. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of 9 databases from 1 January 2000 to 16 September 2020 with no language restrictions. We included original peer-reviewed observational studies, intervention studies or natural experiments conducted in at least one urban LMIC setting and reporting a quantitative association between a characteristic of the food environment and a diet, nutrition or health outcome. Study selection was done independently in duplicate. Data extraction and quality appraisal using the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute checklists were completed based on published reports using a prepiloted form on Covidence. Data were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: 74 studies met eligibility criteria. Consistent evidence reported an association between availability characteristics in the neighbourhood food environment and dietary behaviour (14 studies, 10 rated as good quality), while the balance of evidence suggested an association with health or nutrition outcomes (17 of 24 relevant studies). We also found a balance of evidence that accessibility to food in the neighbourhood environment was associated with diet (10 of 11 studies) although evidence of an association with health outcomes was contradictory. Evidence on other neighbourhood food environment characteristics was sparse and mixed. Availability in the school food environment was also found to be associated with relevant outcomes. Studies investigating our other primary outcomes in observational studies of the school food environment were sparse, but most interventional studies were situated in schools. We found very little evidence on how workplace and home food environments are associated with relevant outcomes. This is a substantial evidence gap.

The development of vaccines has taken one year, which is why it is necessary to investigate whether some already-existing alternatives that have been successfully developed in recent years can mitigate the pandemic's advance. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have proved effective in antiviral action. Thus, in this review, several in vitro and in vivo studies of the effect of AgNPs on viruses that cause respiratory diseases are analyzed and discussed to promote an understanding of the possible interaction of AgNPs with SARS-CoV-2. The study focuses on several in vivo toxicological studies of AgNPs and a dose extrapolation to humans to determine the chief avenue of exposure. It can be concluded that the use of AgNPs as a possible treatment for SARS-CoV-2 could be viable, based on comparing the virus' behavior to that of similar viruses in in vivo studies, and that the suggested route of administration in terms of least degree of adverse effects is inhalation.

COVID-19 is more severe in people with diabetes. The identification of risk factors for predicting disease severity in COVID-19 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is urgently needed. Methods Two hundred and thirty-six patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in our study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 patients with or without T2DM. The patients were further divided into four subgroups according to the severity of COVID-19 as follows: Subgroup A included moderate COVID-19 patients without diabetes, subgroup B included severe COVID-19 patients without diabetes, subgroup C included moderate COVID-19 patients with diabetes, and subgroup D included severe COVID-19 patients with diabetes. The clinical features and radiological assessments were collected and analyzed. We tracked the dynamic changes in laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes during the hospitalization period. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression to analyze the risk factors that predict the severity of COVID-19 with T2DM. Results Firstly, compared with the nondiabetic group, the COVID-19 with T2DM group had a higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and procalcitonin (PCT) but lower lymphocyte counts and T lymphocyte subsets, including CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD16+CD56 cells, and CD19+ cells. Secondly, compared with group A, group C had higher levels of Fasting blood glucose (FBG), IL-6, TNF-, and neutrophils but lower lymphocyte, CD3+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+ T cell counts. Similarly, group D had higher FBG, IL-6 and TNF- levels and lower lymphocyte, CD3+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, and CD4+ T cell counts than group B. Thirdly, binary logistic regression analysis showed that HbA1c, IL-6, and lymphocyte count were risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 with T2DM. Importantly, COVID-19 patients with T2DM were more likely to worsen from moderate to severe COVID-19 than nondiabetic patients. Of note, lymphopenia and inflammatory responses remained more severe throughout hospitalization for COVID-19 patients with T2DM. Conclusion Our data suggested that COVID-19 patients with T2DM are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 than those without T2DM and that hyperglycemia associated with the lymphopenia and inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients with T2DM.","output":"Hyperglycemia associated with lymphopenia and disease severity of COVID-19 in type 2 diabetes mellitus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"is not allowed for a Research Letter.","output":"Antibody Response to mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine in Hemodialysis Patients with and without Prior COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the psychological health of individuals and societies.

Three groups of participants performed a task involving imagined rotations of the self. Prior to scanning, the positive stereotype group was exposed to a false but plausible stereotype of women's superior perspective-taking abilities; the negative stereotype group was exposed to the pervasive stereotype that men outperform women on spatial tasks; and the control group received neutral information. The significantly poorer performance we found in the negative stereotype group corresponded to increased activation in brain regions associated with increased emotional load. In contrast, the significantly improved performance we found in the positive stereotype group was associated with increased activation in visual processing areas and, to a lesser degree, complex working memory processes.

METHODS Data were derived from 2 clinical trials (Study 1, n=131; Study 2, n=139) of fentanyl sublingual tablet in patients with cancer-associated breakthrough pain (BTP). Both trials comprised a 2-week titration phase and 12-month maintenance phase. The initial dose was 100 g, titrated to an effective dose (producing effective relief of all BTP episodes on 2 consecutive days) of 100 to 800 g. RESULTS A total of 270 patients entered the titration phase. Mean (SD) baseline BTP opioid dose was 25.7 (88.9) mg morphine equivalent, and mean baseline around-the-clock opioid dose was 196.5 (151.6) mg morphine equivalent. Using conservative criteria for determining effective dose, 174 patients (64.4%) were successfully titrated to an effective dose (mean [SD], 498.2 [234.8] g).

DESIGN Rapid online survey. Participants completed a series of online questionnaires regarding hearing ability, socialisation (pre- and during-pandemic), loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive function. STUDY SAMPLE A total of 80 participants over the age of 70 with access to the internet. RESULTS There was a significant reduction in socialisation levels from pre-pandemic in this population. Hearing difficulties were significantly associated with greater levels of loneliness, depression and self-perceived cognitive dysfunction after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. Additionally, compared to pre-pandemic, people with hearing difficulties had increased odds of reporting worsened anxiety, depression, and memory during the COVID-19 pandemic, although only the effect of hearing difficulties on the change in memory reached statistical significance after controlling for age, gender, and level of education.

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a self-administered tool to assess the source of COVID-19 pandemic stress among college students. The data was collected online using google forms in two phases. The data collected from 173 participants from phase one was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). The second phase data of 216 participants were analyzed to validate the factor structure using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The standardized factor loadings, Composite Reliability (CR), and AVE of factors were assessed to determine the convergent validity of the scale. Similarly, discriminant validity and concurrent predictive validity were assessed through the HTMT ratio of correlations and ROC curves, respectively. A succession of Exploratory Factor Analysis yielded a five-factor solution, explaining 73.83 percent variance with 13 indices. CFA via maximum likelihood with bootstrapping indicated a good fit for the five-factor model (SRMR = 0.037, RMSEA = 0.049, CFI = 0.981). The standardized factor loadings, Composite Reliability (CR), and AVE of factors together suggest acceptable convergent validity. Further, the ROC curve results to assess stress indicated an acceptable AUC, with a magnitude of 0.79, p <0.01, indicating concurrent predictive validity for the five-factor Student COVID-19 Stress Scale (SCSS). HTMT ratio of correlations <0.85 indicated discriminant validity for the factor structure. The CR >0.70 for the dimensions indicated acceptable reliability.

The pathogen was identified quickly and was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infectious disease caused by this virus is referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within months, it has caused a global pandemic and posed a major threat to public health worldwide. As of May 23, 2020, 5,252,452 patients have been confirmed to have the disease, and 339,026 deaths have been reported. Multiple therapeutic trials are ongoing, and some promising results have been released. A vaccine would provide the most effective approach to fight the virus by preventing infection, but none are currently available. To control the COVID-19 outbreak, large-scale measures have been applied to reduce human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

Field , comprised of multi-stacked clastic reservoirs, was put on stream in 1980s and peaked in early 1990s. Pilot water injection started in 1993 and full field water flooding continued in 1997. After more than 35 years since start of production, one can say the field was already in the tail end of its life. It had been stabilizing at low rate after 25 years and starting to decline further and at some point was one of the potential candidates to be decommissioned. A new FDP (FDP18) for part of the field was delivered in 2018 with the first well drilled at the end of that year. In 2019, despite drilling further wells on the FDP18, production was declining and was at 2018 rate towards the year end. Intensive data analysis and integrated reservoir reviews per reservoir layers were actively performed and new opportunities and data gathering were identified. FDP18 wells from 2019 onwards were then deepened to also acquire log data over deeper than the target reservoirs. Further synergy between asset and exploration teams also instigated in new discoveries including oil in shallower carbonate reservoirs, which were logged and sampled when drilling the FDP18 wells. Declining production, low oil price and COVID-19 crisis that hit 2020 challenged the team to be more resilient and with ONE development mindset between development and WRFM team, also between asset and exploration team, existing long-term closed in and very low productivity wells were utilised to tap these new opportunities. As a result, the field production has been increased by more than double, highest since 10 years ago, with a potential of triple its production rate, all achieved through optimizing and recompletion of existing wells within 1 year, at a very attractive low UTC. ?

The district was stratified into two agro-ecologies: mid-altitude areas and low-altitude areas. The effects of grazing intensity on dry matter yields and biomass composition were analyzed using a randomized complete block design replicated three times having two blocks differed by two agro-ecologies (three mid-altitude kebeles and three low-altitude kebeles). The present study used seventy-two pasture samples and 20  20 m forage trees collected randomly from the two agro-ecologies of the study area. The General Linear Model of the SAS 19.0 version was used to compare the effects of the agro-ecology and species on dry matter yield and biomass composition. The result of the study indicated that the average dry matter yield for grasses, legumes, and other herbaceous forages was 1.156 t/ha, 0.242 t/ha, and 0.182 t/ha, with an overall 1.58 t/ha in the study district, respectively. About 73.13% of grasses, 15.32% of legumes, and 11.55% of other herbaceous were the species biomass composition in the study area. The midland agroecology had the average biomass fodder yields 7.98-19.78 kg/tree and 1.06-2.41 kg/shrub while lowland agroecology had 9.87-178.06 kg/tree and 1.34-3.87 kg/shrub. There was an estimate of 74.36-100 kg/ha fodder shrubs and 500-800 kg/ha fodder trees on cultivated and uncultivated land in the study area. The herbage yield of natural pasture is 1.733 t DMha-1 in the mid and 1.427 t DMha-1 in the low altitudes of the study area, with a mean herbage yield of 1.58 t DMha-1 during vegetation cover. The grazing capacity of the study area was 0.23 TLU/ha/year in the mid and 0.19 TLU/ha/year in the low altitudes of the study area, with a mean value of 0.21 TLU ha/year. The presence of limited grazing land in the study area led to overgrazing, which in turn resulted occurrence of land degradation associated with poor biomass yield, low quality and variable supply of feeds between the season. Therefore, this study suggests setting up land-use regulation policy to allocate separate land for feed production and commonly use for livestock feeding to improve livestock productivity and contribute to food security and poverty alleviation of small holder farmers in the study area.","output":"Biomass composition and dry matter yields of feed resource available at Lalo kile district of Kellem Wollega Zone, Western Ethiopia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"to develop critical reflections on the effects of the new coronavirus pandemic on the mental health of individuals and communities Method: reflective study carried out based on the structuring of a narrative review of the literature on the impacts of the pandemic of the new coronavirus on the mental health of the population Results: there has been widespread panic and stress on mental health in society The findings point to an immediate psychological impact on the population due to the pandemic, with an increase in symptoms of anxiety, and even depression Conclusion: the effects of the pandemic have been directly and indirectly affecting people's mental health in the most diverse aspects, which implies in a worrying public health condition desarrollar reflexiones crticas sobre los efectos de la nueva pandemia de coronavirus en la salud mental de individuos y comunidades Mtodo: estudio reflexivo realizado en base a la estructuracin de una revisin narrativa de la literatura sobre los impactos de la pandemia del nuevo coronavirus en la salud mental de la poblacin Resultados: ha habido un pnico y estrs generalizados en la salud mental en la sociedad Los hallazgos apuntan a un impacto psicolgico inmediato en la poblacin debido a la pandemia, con un aumento en los sntomas de ansiedad e incluso depresin Conclusin: los efectos de la pandemia han estado afectando directa e indirectamente la salud mental de las personas en los aspectos ms diversos, lo que implica una condicin preocupante de la salud pblica desenvolver reflex?es crticas sobre os efeitos da pandemia do novo Coronavrus na sade mental de indivduos e coletividades Mtodo: estudo reflexivo realizado a partir da estrutura??o de uma revis?o narrativa da literatura sobre os impactos da pandemia do novo Coronavrus na sade mental da popula??o Resultados: tem-se percebido um panico generalizado e estresse na sade mental na sociedade Os achados apontam um impacto psicolgico imediato na popula??o em decorrncia da pandemia, sendo observado um crescimento de sintomas de ansiedade, e at mesmo depress?o Conclus?o: os efeitos da pandemia vm atingindo direta e indiretamente a sade mental das pessoas nos mais diversos aspectos, o que implica numa condi??o preocupante de sade pblica","output":"Efeitos da pandemia do novo Coronavrus na sade mental de indivduos e coletividades"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Implementing and lifting social distancing (LSD) is an urgent global issue during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly when the travel ban is lifted to revive international businesses and economies. However, when and whether LSD can be considered is subject to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the recovery rate, and the case-fatality rate. It is imperative to provide real-time assessment of three factors to guide LSD. OBJECTIVE: A simple LSD index was developed for health decision makers to do real-time assessment of COVID-19 at the global, country, region, and community level. METHODS: Data on the retrospective cohort of 186 countries with three factors were retrieved from a publicly available repository from January to early July. A simple index for guiding LSD was measured by the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recoveries, and the case-fatality rate was envisaged. If the LSD index was less than 1, LSD can be considered. The dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated to assess whether and when health decision makers allowed for LSD and when to reimplement social distancing after resurgences of the epidemic. RESULTS: After large-scale outbreaks in a few countries before mid-March (prepandemic phase), the global weekly LSD index peaked at 4.27 in March and lasted until mid-June (pandemic phase), during which most countries were affected and needed to take various social distancing measures. Since, the value of LSD has gradually declined to 0.99 on July 5 (postpandemic phase), at which 64.7% (120/186) of countries and regions had an LSD<1 with the decile between 0 and 1 to refine risk stratification by countries. The LSD index decreased to 1 in about 115 days. In addition, we present the results of dynamic changes of the LSD index for the world and for each country and region with different time windows from January to July 5. The results of the LSD index on the resurgence of the COVID-19 epidemic in certain regions and validation by other emerging infectious diseases are presented. CONCLUSIONS: This simple LSD index provides a quantitative assessment of whether and when to ease or implement social distancing to provide advice for health decision makers and travelers.","output":"An Index for Lifting Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Algorithm Recommendation for Lifting Social Distancing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate COVID-19 as a super crisis in the design and management of places Design/methodology/approach: This theory-driven work outlines why and how, by treating COVID-19 as a super crisis, the immunological view rises in priority and swiftly ushers in short- and long-term implications for space design and place management Findings: First, this paper looks at the short-term impact of COVID-19 upon space and place management in addressing how porous bubbling, stippling and flexible curtaining respond to immediate retrofitting needs during the pandemic Using the concept of COVID-19-induced collective trauma, this paper draws attention to health-care facilities, schools, workplaces, commercial buildings and public outdoor spaces These sites require short-term improvisation in place and space design and will, where the collective trauma of COVID-19 leaves strong traces, require long-term redesign and rethinking Social implications: As a super crisis, COVID-19 generates contradictions in the existing trend in space and place studies from the notion of space and place as a container to one focusing on flow  A focus on flow highlights a focus on space and place as adaptable to changes in flow, especially as augmented and mediated by technology Originality/value: This treatment of COVID-19 as a super crisis is intended to stimulate the design and management of spaces and places in the post-COVID-19 period ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"COVID-19 as a super crisis: implications for place management"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Carta al editor.","output":"Enfermedad por Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19): papel del periodismo cientfico durante una pandemia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims at retrospectively re-analyzing the different distribution, between males and females, in the allelic frequency of the human  T cell receptor (TCR ) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) rs1800907 in Caucasian patients in the Milan metropolitan area.

To evaluate the automatic screener's performance, we estimated the median posterior sensitivity and efficiency [90% Credible Intervals] using Bayesian simulation to predict the distribution of undetected potentially relevant records. Tested on an example topic, the framework collected 17,755 unique records through the citation manager; 766 records required human evaluation while the rest were excluded by the automatic classifier; the theoretical efficiency was 95.6% [95.3%, 95.7%] with a sensitivity of 100% [93.5%, 100%].

Objective: To understand the predictors of abuse and discrimination of sexual minority men in healthcare settings by Healthcare workers in seven cities in Tanzania. Method: In total, 300 sexual minority men over the age of 18 were interviewed in 7 Tanzanian cities by trained local interviewers. Abuse from others (physical, verbal, sexual, discrimination/humiliation), and abuse from Healthcare workers, was ascertained. Gender role mannerisms were self-rated by the respondent, and at the end of the interview, by the interviewer, on a Likert scale from very feminine to very masculine. Respondents also indicated whether they had revealed their homosexual behavior or had it exposed in the health consultation. Results: Median age was 27. Verbal abuse and community discrimination were the most commonly reported forms of abuse. Eighty-four percent had visited a healthcare center with a sexually related complaint (usually a sexually transmitted infection); of these, 24% reported abuse or discrimination from from a healthcare worker. Correlation between self-rated gender role mannerisms and interviewer-rated was r = 0.84. Regression analysis indicated that the degree of perceived gender role nonconformity was the major and significant predictor from Healthcare worker abuse: confirmation of homosexual behavior was non-significant. Gender role nonconformity predicted 21% of the variance in health worker abuse. Conclusion: There is speculation that abuse of sexual minority men by Healthcare workers in public clinics is due to factors in addition to their sexual behavior as gay/bisexual, and that it is due to violating perceived gender roles. Data confirm that perceived feminine gender role is a significant predictor, of abuse in healthcare and other settings. Common confusion between homosexual behavior and gender role norms may trigger discrimination, which may be as much due to violation of perceived gender roles as having sex with other men.","output":"Stigmatization of men who have sex with men in health care settings in East Africa is based more on perceived gender role-inappropriate mannerisms than having sex with men"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract A 50-nucleotide (nt) untranslated region (coding gap sequence) that interrupts the amino acid coding sequence in T4 gene 60, plus an additional 5 nt upstream and another 3 nt downstream from the gap sequence, shows unusual folding patterns according to RNA structure prediction.

This feature is absent in insertion, deletion and substitution variants of the gap sequence, in which template activities are markedly lower than that of the wt. The proposed feature is consistent with currently available data showing that the translational bypass of the coding gap is correlated with a stop codon involved in a stem-loop structure folded in the gap sequence.

Minority populations are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. This study evaluates the risk of QT prolongation and subsequent outcomes after administration of these medications in largely underrepresented minority COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted an observational study on hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the Montefiore Health System (Bronx, NY). We examined electrocardiograms (ECG) pre/post-medication initiation to evaluate QTc, HR, QRS duration, and presence of other arrhythmias. RESULTS: One hundred five patients (mean age 67 years; 44.8% F) were analyzed. The median time from the first dose of any treatment to post-medication ECG was 2 days (IQR: 1-3). QTc in men increased from baseline (440 vs 455 ms, p < 0.001), as well as in women (438 vs 463 ms, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients with QT prolongation increased significantly (14.3% vs 34.3%, p < 0.001) even when adjusted for electrolyte abnormalities. The number of patients whose QTc > 500 ms was significantly increased after treatment (16.2% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.01). Patients with either QTc > 500 ms or an increase of 60 ms had a higher frequency of death (47.6% vs. 22.6%, p = 0.02) with an odds ratio of 3.1 (95% CI: 1.1-8.7).

The survival (SRV), diameter at breast height (DBH), and height of the trees (H) had been measured annually since the plantations were established, and from these measurements, mean annual height increment (MAHI) values were derived. These weather, edaphic, and clonal factors were evaluated and compared. Significant effects of the site (edaphic factors) were found as the primary source of variance and clonal differences as secondary sources of variance among the growth of trees. The interaction of site  clone effects was not significant. The results showed that for short rotation forestry (SRF), the site parametersespecially groundwater availabilityare key factors.","output":"Comparison of the Initial Growth of Different Poplar Clones on Four Sites in Western SlovakiaPreliminary Results"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article proposes a new method for detecting slight refractive index changes under conditions of unknown polarization state. It is argued that an insignificant modification of the tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) structure and selecting the appropriate spectral region allows us to accurately track changes in the refractive index. It has also been proven that the method can be easily made insensitive to temperature and that the sensitivity to changes in the polarization plane of the input light can be significantly reduced, which is crucial in later practical applications. Analytes in the form of an aqueous glucose solution were used to calibrate the sensor. The proposed method, based on perpendicular tilted fiber Bragg grating (P-TFBG), has a wide range of universality because its development and slight modification will enable the detection of glucose, pathogens, and viruses.","output":"Design and Manufacturing Optoelectronic Sensors for the Measurement of Refractive Index Changes under Unknown Polarization State"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: To date, a universal validated and specific tool for assessing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) stigma among healthcare workers is lacking We adapted a SARS stigma scale that was developed using the Berger HIV scale for use as a COVID-19 stigma scale and evaluated its psychometric properties among Egyptian physicians Methods: We administered the 17-item SARS stigma scale in an anonymous online questionnaire among 509 Egyptian physicians recruited via convenience sampling during a cross-sectional study in June 2020 Exploratory factor analysis was performed on half of the sample Confirmatory factor analysis of the resulting model was done using structural equation modeling on the other half Scale reliability was examined using Cronbachs alpha for internal consistency Convergent construct validity was assessed using regression models to examine the association between the adapted COVID-19 stigma scale and relevant factors Results: Exploratory factor analysis yielded 16 items (E16-COVID19-S) that supported a three-factor structure: personalized stigma (8 items);concerns of disclosure and public attitudes (5 items);and negative experiences (3 items) Cronbachs  was 0 909 for the total scale and 0 907, 0 663, and 0 789 for the three subscales E16-COVID19-S was confirmed to have good model fit (comparative fit index = 0 964;root mean squared error of approximation = 0 056) E16-COVID19-S was independently associated with physicians younger age, lower qualification, working in an isolation hospital, and self-stigma, whether the scale was treated as categorical or continuous Conclusions: E16-COVID19-S exhibited good internal consistency and construct validity among this sample of Egyptian physicians These adequate psychometric properties make the E16-COVID19-S scale appropriate for use by researchers and practitioners","output":"Validity and Reliability of a COVID-19 Stigma Scale Using Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis in a Sample of Egyptian Physicians: E16-COVID19-S"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Antiviral medications are being given empirically to some patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To support the development of a COVID-19 management guideline, we conducted a systematic review that addressed the benefits and harms of 7 antiviral treatments for COVID-19. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed and 3 Chinese databases (CNKI, WANFANG and SinoMed) through Apr. 19, medRxiv and Chinaxiv through Apr. 27, and Chongqing VIP through Apr. 30, 2020. We included studies of ribavirin, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, umifenovir (arbidol), favipravir, interferon and lopinavir/ritonavir. If direct evidence from COVID-19 studies was not available, we included indirect evidence from studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) for efficacy outcomes and other acute respiratory viral infections for safety outcomes. RESULTS: In patients with nonsevere COVID-19 illness, the death rate was extremely low, precluding an important effect on mortality. We found only very low-quality evidence with little or no suggestion of benefit for most treatments and outcomes in both nonsevere and severe COVID-19. An exception was treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, for which we found low-quality evidence for a decrease in length of stay in the intensive care unit (risk difference 5 d shorter, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0 to 9 d) and hospital stay (risk difference 1 d shorter, 95% CI 0 to 2 d). For safety outcomes, evidence was of low or very low quality, with the exception of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir for which moderate-quality evidence suggested likely increases in diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. INTERPRETATION: To date, persuasive evidence of important benefit in COVID-19 does not exist for any antiviral treatments, although for each treatment evidence has not excluded important benefit. Additional randomized controlled trials involving patients with COVID-19 will be needed before such treatments can be administered with confidence.","output":"Efficacy and safety of antiviral treatment for COVID-19 from evidence in studies of SARSCoV-2 and other acute viral infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Local surgery is safer than remote surgery because emergencies can be more easily addressed. Although many locally operated surgical robots and devices have been developed, none can safely grasp organs and provide traction. A new manipulator with a detachable commercial forceps was developed that can act as a third arm for a surgeon situated in a sterile area near the patient. This mechanism can be disassembled into compact parts that enable mobile use. METHODS A mobile locally operated detachable end-effector manipulator (LODEM) was developed and tested. This device uses crank-slider and cable-rod mechanisms to achieve 5 degrees of freedom and an acting force of more than 5 N. The total mass is less than 15 kg. The positional accuracy and speed of the prototype device were evaluated while performing simulated in vivo surgery. RESULTS The accuracy of the mobile LODEM was 0.4 mm, sufficient for handling organs. The manipulator could be assembled and disassembled in 8 min, making it highly mobile. The manipulator could successfully handle the target organs with the required level of dexterity during an in vivo laparoscopic surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS A mobile LODEM was designed that allows minimally invasive robotically assisted endoscopic surgery by a surgeon working near the patient.

Using original data from a survey conducted in December 2020 in ten developed countries (N=13,326), we discover a COVID-19 Vaccine gender paradox. Being more concerned about COVID-19 and more likely to believe to be infected and consequently to become seriously ill, women could be expected to be more supportive of vaccination than men. Instead, our findings show that women agree less than men to be vaccinated and to make vaccination compulsory. Our evidence suggests that their vaccine hesitance is partly due skepticism, since women are less likely to believe that vaccination is the only solution to COVID-19 and more likely to believe that COVID-19 was created by large corporations. Using a survey experiment performed in these ten countries, we show that information provision on the role of vaccination to become immune to COVID-19 is effective in reducing vaccine hesitance.","output":"COVID-19 Vaccine's Gender Paradox"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This experiment examines the effects of bamboo charcoal (BC) powder, bamboo vinegar (BV), and their combination (BCV) in the diet of laying hens on performance, egg quality, relative organ weights, and intestinal bacterial populations.

They were fed on a control diet, the control diet supplemented with 0.8% BC, the control diet supplemented with 0.4% BV, or the control diet supplemented with a combination of BC (0.8%) and BV (0.4%) from 36 to 51 weeks of age. Egg production increased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets during 48 to 51 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Damaged egg rate decreased in the hens fed the BV and BCV diets for the whole experiment (P < 0.05). Shell thickness was highest in the BCV-fed group at week 43, and shell strength was higher in the BV-fed group at week 51 (P < 0.05).

In the ileal content, the population of Salmonella spp. decreased in the BV and BCV groups and the population of Lactobacillus spp. increased in the BV group (P < 0.05). The present results indicate that feeding BV or BCV alleviates damaged egg rate and decreases intestinal pathogenic bacteria, while feeding BC benefits by reducing abdominal fat. These results suggest that the effect of BCV seems to be induced by the synergistic effect of BC and BV, and that the BCV contributes to the effective use of bamboo on the laying hen's production.","output":"Effects of bamboo charcoal powder, bamboo vinegar, and their combination in laying hens on performance, egg quality, relative organ weights, and intestinal bacterial populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically reduced family access to hospitals and created new barriers to home hospice care, raising concerns about how the pandemic has impacted cancer patients' place of death and end of life home hospice support. Hypothesizing that Medicaid-enrolled cancer patients may be at greater risk of disruptions in end-of-life care compared to commercially insured patients, we examined changes in place of death and home hospice support for Medicaid and Commercial enrollees following the pandemic. Methods: We linked WA State cancer registry records with claims from Medicaid and approximately 75% of commercially insured cancer patients in the state. Patients ages 18-64 with solid-tumor malignancies who died March-June 2020 (COVID) were compared to those who died March-June 2017-2019 (Pre-COVID). Place of death was categorized as hospital, home with hospice, and home without hospice;nursing home deaths were excluded. Given our sample size, we examined differences in the likelihood of place of death with Fisher's exact tests and multinomial logistic regressions stratified by payer and by COVID period, controlling for age, gender, race, stage, cancer type, and census tract-level neighborhood deprivation. We report marginal effects. Results: In Fisher's exact analyses, Medicaid but not commercial patients were significantly less like to die in hospital and more likely to die at home without hospice during COVID (Table). In pre-post adjusted analysis of Medicaid patients, the probability of dying in the hospital was 12.3% (p=0.03) percentage points lower during the pandemic versus before, while the probability of dying at home without hospice was 11.1% (p=0.04) greater. Place of death did not change significantly pre-post for commercial patients. In addition, Pre-COVID, the probability of dying in the hospital was 10.7% (p=0.03) greater for Medicaid than commercial patients. During COVID, the probability of dying at home without hospice was 15.8% (p=0.04) greater for Medicaid versus commercial patients but lower for women (ME=20.2%;p=0.01) and colorectal versus breast cancer patients (ME=39.2%;p=0.01). Conclusions: Following COVID, Medicaid patients place of death shifted from hospital to homes, but without an increase in the use of home hospice services. In contrast, place of death and hospice use among commercial patients did not significantly change. This widening disparity in home deaths without hospice services raises concerns that the pandemic disproportionately worsened end of life experience for low income patients with cancer.

However, there have been very few smartphone apps providing evidence-based support for suicide prevention in this population. To address this gap, we developed the LifeBuoy app, a self-help smartphone app informed by dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), to help young people manage suicidal thoughts in their daily life. OBJECTIVE: This study describes the protocol for a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the LifeBuoy app for reducing suicidal thoughts and behaviors, depression, anxiety, and psychological distress, and improving general mental well-being in young adults aged 18 to 25 years. METHODS: This is a randomized controlled trial recruiting 378 young adults aged between 18 and 25 years and comparing the LifeBuoy app with a matched attention control (a placebo app with the same display but no DBT components). The primary outcome is suicidal thoughts measured by the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The secondary outcomes are suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, and general mental well-being. The changes in the levels of insomnia, rumination, suicide cognitions, distress tolerance, loneliness, and help seeking before and after using the app are evaluated in this study. The study also addresses risk factors and responses to the intervention. A series of items assessing COVID-19 experiences is included in the trial to capture the potential impact of the pandemic on this study. Assessments will occur on the following three occasions: baseline, postintervention, and follow-up at 3 months postintervention. A qualitative interview about user experience with the LifeBuoy app will take place within 4 weeks of the final assessment. Using linear mixed models, the primary analysis will compare the changes in suicidal thoughts in the intervention condition relative to the control condition. To minimize risks, participants will receive a call from the team clinical psychologist by clicking a help button in the app or responding to an automated email sent by the system when they are assessed with elevated suicide risks at the baseline, postintervention, and 3-month follow-up surveys. RESULTS: The trial recruitment started in May 2020. Data collection is currently ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial examining the efficacy of a DBT-informed smartphone app delivered to community-living young adults reporting suicidal thoughts.

Data analysis was done with descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, and ANOVA. Results: The participants were mostly female (83.2%) college seniors (78.1%). About 60% of the participants practiced between 40% to 100% of their clinical practicum hours in alternative ways. Almost a third of the participants reported that they were not ready for a job (30.2%). However, participants' confidence in clinical competency and job readiness was not related to the rate of alternative practice, but rather to both achievement of educational outcomes and satisfaction in the nursing practicum. Conclusion: Due to COVID-19, it is evident that effective and efficient materials and ways of delivering clinical courses are constantly to be sought and developed. In particular, recently graduated nurses who experienced abrupt and considerable alterations in their clinical practicum courses due to COVID-19 are in need of attention while they strive to make clinical adaptations.

In spite of this, little is known about the developmental alteration from its appearance to the time of hatching. In the current study the CAM has been studied by classical stereology and allometry. Expression levels of selected angiogenesis-related molecules were estimated by RT-PCR and cell dynamics assessed by proliferation and apoptosis assays. Absolute CAM volume increased from a low of 0.47  0.11 cm(3) at embryonic day 8 (E8) to a high of 2.05  0.27 cm(3) at E18, and then decreased to 1.6  0.47 cm(3) at E20. On allometric analysis, three growth phases were identifiable. Between E8-13 (phase I), the CAM grew fastest; moderately in phase II (E13-18) but was regressing in phase III (E18-20). The chorion, the mesenchyme and the allantoic layers grew fastest in phase I, but moderately in phase II. The mesenchyme grew slowly in phase III while the chorion and allantois were regressing. Chorionic cell volume increased fastest in phase I and was regressing in phase III. Chorionic capillaries grew steadily in phase I and II but regressed in phase III. Both the chorion and the allantois grew by intrinsic cell proliferation as well as recruitment of cells from the mesenchyme. Cell proliferation was prominent in the allantois and chorion early during development, declined after E17 and apoptosis started mainly in the chorion from E14.

Cardiovascular disease is a dominant comorbidity and prognostic factors predicting risk for critical courses are highly needed. Moreover, immunomechanisms underlying COVID-induced myocardial damage are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate prognostic markers to identify patients at risk. RESULTS: Only patients with pericardial effusion (PE) developed a severe disease course, and those who died could be identified by a high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio. Ten out of 19 COVID-19 patients presented with PE, 7 (78%) of these had elevated APACHE-II mortality risk-score, requiring mechanical ventilation. At admission, PE patients showed signs of systemic and cardiac inflammation in NMR and impaired cardiac function as detected by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), whereas parameters of myocardial injury e.g. high sensitive troponin-t (hs-TnT) were not yet increased. During the course of disease, hs-TnT rose in 8 of the PE-patients above 16 ng/l, 7 had to undergo ventilatory therapy and 4 of them died. FACS at admission showed in PE patients elevated frequencies of CD3+CD8+ T cells among all CD3+ T-cells, and lower frequencies of Tregs and CD14+HLA-DR+-monocytes. A high CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio predicted a severe disease course in PE patients, and was associated with high serum levels of antiviral cytokines. By contrast, patients without PE and PE patients with a low CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio neither had to be intubated, nor died. CONCLUSIONS: PE predicts cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, TTE should be performed at admission. Immunological parameters for dysfunctional antiviral immunity, such as the CD8/Treg/monocyte ratio used here, supports risk assessment by predicting poor prognosis.","output":"Parameters predicting COVID-19-induced myocardial injury and mortality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penitrem A, PA, is an indole diterpene alkaloid produced by several fungal species. PA acts as a selective Ca++-dependent K-channels (Maxi-K, BK) antagonist in brain, causing motor system dysfunctions including tremors and seizures.

PA selectively activated STAT1 pathway, independently of IFN-?3 pathway, in vitro in Schwann cells and in vivo in Swiss albino mice sciatic nerves. Preliminary in vitro screening of EVOO phenolic compounds library for ability to reverse PA toxicity on Schwann cells revealed PN and AC as potential hits. In a Swiss albino mouse model, AC significantly minimized the fatality after intra-peritoneal administration of PA fatal doses and normalized most biochemical factors by modulating the STAT1 expression.

Given the scope of many existing studies, it is still unclear how very-high-resolution EO data can help to improve our understanding of the multidimensionality of deprivation within settlements on a city-wide scale. In this work, we assumed that multiple facets of deprivation are reflected by varying morphological structures within deprived urban areas and can be captured by EO information. We set out by staying on the scale of an entire city, while zooming into each of the deprived areas to investigate deprivation through land cover (LC) variations. To test the generalizability of our workflow, we assembled multiple WorldView-3 datasets (multispectral and shortwave infrared) with varying numbers of bands and image features, allowing us to explore computational efficiency, complexity, and scalability while keeping the model architecture consistent. Our workflow was implemented in the city of Nairobi, Kenya, where more than sixty percent of the city population lives in deprived areas. Our results indicate that detailed LC information that characterizes deprivation can be mapped with an accuracy of over seventy percent by only using RGB-based image features. Including the near-infrared (NIR) band appears to bring significant improvements in the accuracy of all classes. Equally important, we were able to categorize deprived areas into varying profiles manifested through LC variability using a gridded mapping approach. The types of deprivation profiles varied significantly both within and between deprived areas.

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Thoracoscopic surgery has become a routine operation for esophageal atresia repair. However, large studies comparing the safety and efficacy of thoracoscopy to thoracotomy are scarce. Current reviews are obscured with institutional experiences or pool small samples. METHODS PRISMA-compliant search in Medline/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library (PROSPERO #CRD42019121862) for original studies comparing thoracoscopy to thoracotomy for esophageal atresia. Quality assessments were performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Meta-analyses were presented as odds ratios and standardized mean differences. RESULTS This is the largest published meta-analysis, including 17 studies and 1043 patients. Thoracoscopy produce shorter hospital stay [standardized mean differences (SMD) -11.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 23.49-6.10; P = 0.0440], time until extubation (SMD -3.22; 95% CI 5.93-0.51; P = 0.0198), time until first oral feeding (SMD -2.84; 95% CI 4.62-1.07; P = 0.0017), and fewer musculoskeletal complications [odds ratio (OR) 0.08; 95% CI 0.01-0.58; P = 0.0133). Thoracoscopy is as safe as thoracotomy regarding leakage (OR -1.92; 95% CI 0.97-3.80; P = 0.0622), stricture formation (OR 2.66; 95% CI 0.86-3.23; P = 0.1339), stricture dilatation (OR 1.90; 95% CI 0.16-3.88; P = 0.0767), and mortality (OR 1.18; 95% CI 0.34-4.16; P = 0.7934). However, thoracoscopy take longer (SMD +27.69; 95% CI 12.06-43.32; P = 0.0005) and necessitate more antireflux surgery (OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.06-4.24; P = 0.0343). CONCLUSION Thoracoscopy is effective and safe, with similar or better outcomes than thoracotomy for patients and providers. The only significant drawback is the need for antireflux surgery in the first years of life.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of three patients with laboratory and radiologically confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Chosun University Hospital. Demographic and clinical data on inflammatory cell lung infiltration and cytokine levels in patients with COVID-19 were collected. RESULTS: Cytological analysis of sputum, tracheal aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from all three patients revealed massive infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), such as eosinophils and neutrophils. All sputum and BALF specimens contained high levels of eosinophil cationic proteins. The infiltration of PMNs into the lungs, together with elevated levels of natural killer T (NKT) cells in BALF and peripheral blood samples from patients with severe pneumonia in the acute phase was confirmed by flow cytometry.

While the implementation of these new curricula has been described, an understanding of the impact on student learning outcomes is lacking. In 2020, the authors followed Kerns 6-step approach to curricular development to create and evaluate a novel COVID-19 curriculum for medical students at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine and evaluate its learning outcomes. The primary goal of the curriculum was to provide third- and fourth-year medical students an opportunity for workplace learning in the absence of clinical clerkships, specifically for students to develop clerkship-level milestones in the competency domains of practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and systems-based practice. The curriculum was designed to match students with faculty-mentored projects occurring primarily in virtual formats. A total of 126 students enrolled in the curriculum and completed a survey about their learning outcomes (100% response rate). Of 35 possible clerkship-level milestones, there were 12 milestones for which over half of students reported development in competency domains including practice-based learning and improvement, professionalism, and interpersonal and communication skills. Thematic analysis of students qualitative survey responses demonstrated 2 central motivations for participating in the curriculum: identity as physicians-in-training and patient engagement. Six central learning areas were developed during the curriculum: interprofessional teamwork, community resources, technology in medicine, skill-building, quality improvement, and specialty-specific learning. This analysis demonstrates that students can develop competencies and achieve rich workplace learning through project-based experiential learning, even in virtual clinical workplaces. Furthermore, knowledge of community resources, technology in medicine, and quality improvement was developed through the curriculum more readily than in traditional clerkships.

The prevalence of COVID-19 in orthopaedic populations will vary depending on the time and place where the sampling is performed. The idea that asymptomatic carriers play a role is generalizable but has not been studied in large populations of patients undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. We therefore evaluated this topic in one large, metropolitan city in a state that had the ninth-most infections in the United States at the time this study was completed (June 2020). This work was based on a screening and testing protocol that required all patients to be tested for COVID-19 preoperatively. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) What is the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in patients planning to undergo orthopaedic surgery in one major city, in order to provide other surgeons with a framework for assessing COVID-19 rates in their healthcare system? (2) How did patients with positive test results for COVID-19 differ in terms of age, sex, and orthopaedic conditions? (3) What proportion of patients had complications treated, and how many patients had a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days of surgery (recognizing that some may have been missed and so our estimates of event rates will necessarily underestimate the frequency of this event)? METHODS: All adult patients scheduled for surgery at four facilities (two tertiary care hospitals, one orthopaedic specialty hospital, and one ambulatory surgery center) at a single institution in the Philadelphia metropolitan area from April 27, 2020 to June 12, 2020 were included in this study. A total of 1295 patients were screened for symptoms, exposure, temperature, and oxygen saturation via a standardized protocol before surgical scheduling; 1.5% (19 of 1295) were excluded because they had COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, or recent travel based on the initial screening questionnaire, leaving 98.5% (1276 of 1295) who underwent testing for COVID-19 preoperatively. All 1276 patients who passed the initial screening test underwent nasopharyngeal swabbing for COVID-19 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction before surgery. The mean age at the time of testing was 56  16 years, and 53% (672 of 1276) were men. Eighty-seven percent (1106), 8% (103), and 5% (67) were tested via the Roche, Abbott, and Cepheid assays, respectively. All patients undergoing elective surgery were tested via the Roche assay, while those undergoing nonelective surgery received either the Abbott or Cepheid assay, based on availability. Patients with positive test results undergoing elective surgery had their procedures rescheduled, while patients scheduled for nonelective surgery underwent surgery regardless of their test results. Additionally, we reviewed the records of all patients at 30 days postoperatively for emergency room visits, readmissions, and COVID-19-related complications via electronic medical records and surgeon-reported complications. However, we had no method for definitively determining how many patients had complications, emergency department visits, or readmissions outside our system, so our event rate estimates for these endpoints are necessarily best-case estimates. RESULTS: A total of 0.5% (7 of 1276) of the patients tested positive for COVID-19: five via the Roche assay and two via the Abbott assay. Patients with positive test results were younger than those with negative results (39  12 years versus 56  16 years; p = 0.01). With the numbers available, we found no difference in the proportion of patients with positive test results for COVID-19 based on subspecialty area (examining the lowest and highest point estimates, respectively, we observed: trauma surgery [3%; 2 of 68 patients] versus hip and knee [0.3%; 1 of 401 patients], OR 12 [95% CI 1-135]; p = 0.06). No patients with negative preoperative test results for COVID-19 developed a symptomatic COVID-19 infection within 30 days postoperatively. Within 30 days of surgery, 0.9% (11 of 1276) of the patients presented to the emergency room, and 1.3% (16 of 1276) were readmitted for non-COVID-19-related complications. None of the patients with positive test results for COVID-19 preoperatively experienced complications. However, because some were likely treated outside our healthcare system, the actual percentages may be higher. CONCLUSION: Because younger patients are more likely to be asymptomatic carriers of disease, surgeons should emphasize the importance of taking proper precautions to prevent virus exposure preoperatively. Because the rates of COVID-19 infection differ based on city and time, surgeons should monitor the local prevalence of disease to properly advise patients on the risk of COVID-19 exposure. Further investigation is required to assess the prevalence in the orthopaedic population in cities with larger COVID-19 burdens.

A next-generation nasal cannula (Neotech RAM cannula) has recently been used to provide nasal NIV. The impact of the Neotech RAM cannula on the delivery of pressure needs to be studied. METHODS In this ex vivo experimental design, a lung simulator (IngMar ASL 5000, version 3.4) was programmed to model a neonate (1-3 kg of body weight) with normal-to-moderately affected lungs. We used a Covidien PB840 ventilator with NIV software activated to compensate for leaks. Nasal NIV was set at peak airway pressures of 15, 20, and 25 cm H2O and PEEP of 5, 6, and 7 cm H2O. Three sizes of the Neotech RAM cannula were used (prong outer diameters of 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 mm). The nose was designed to keep the leak of the nares by the prongs to 30%. We also created a worst case leak (58% leak) by using the largest simulated nostril diameter with the smallest diameter Neotech RAM cannula prong. The outcome measure was the difference in pressures, referred to as leak effect, measured by the lung simulator relative to the set peak airway pressure and PEEP on the ventilator. RESULTS For the interface with 30% leak, leak effects of peak airway pressure during simulated nasal NIV were similar with all Neotech RAM cannula sizes, with 63-75% of peak airway pressure and 70-90% of PEEP being transmitted across the nasal interface. The worst case scenario produced a 92% leak effect in peak airway pressure and PEEP. CONCLUSIONS When used with  30% leak, the Neotech RAM cannula interface results in clinically acceptable transmission of pressures.

The Infection Prevention and Control Assessment Framework (IPCAF) by the World Health Organization allows systematic assessment of IPC capacity in healthcare facilities and has been applied in many national-level surveys. This study aims to assess the IPC capacity of Korean hospitals as well as their strengths and pitfalls by analyzing the results of the first government-led nationwide IPC survey in comparison to the IPCAF frame. METHODS: The Korean National Infection Prevention and Control Survey (KNIPCS) was conducted from February to March 2018. The survey questionnaire for KNIPCS was developed through a series of expert consultations and a round of pre-testing in two randomly selected hospitals. The survey questionnaire was distributed to a total of 2108 hospitals. Although the survey preceded the release of IPCAF, its contents complied with IPCAF to a large extent, allowing exploration of its results with regards to IPCAF. RESULTS: All tertiary hospitals and 96.5% of general hospitals had implemented IPC teams, whereas the percentage was lower for long-term care hospitals (6.3%). A similar trend was observed for IPC surveillance and monitoring activities across hospital types. The percentage of interactive IPC training was lower than 30% in all hospital groups. Disinfection was frequently monitored in all hospital types (e.g. 97.3% in general hospitals and 85.3% in long-term care hospitals). However, activities regarding antimicrobial resistance, such as multi-drug resistant pathogen screening, were weak in hospitals (25%) and long-term care hospitals (25%), compared to tertiary hospitals (83.3%) and general hospitals (57.7%). CONCLUSIONS: In general, essential IPC structures, such as IPC teams and programs, were well in place in most tertiary and general hospitals in Korea. These hospital groups also actively conducted various IPC activities. As most previous legislative and multimodal policy measures have targeted these hospital groups, we speculate that future policy efforts should encompass long-term care hospitals and smaller-sized hospitals to strengthen the IPC capacity of these hospital groups. Efforts should also be put forth to promote IPC training and antimicrobial activities.

The demographics of the TM cohort were compared with those of patients seen in the outpatient (OP) setting at the same institution the prior year as well as with patients in the metropolitan area (M). Results: Five thousand thirty-five TM visits met the inclusion criteria. The TM cohort was significantly younger than the OP cohort, with mean age of 48.7  19.0 years for TM and 55.2  18.0 years for OP, and with 22% of TM being 65 or older versus 35% of OP being 65 or older (p = 0.001). The TM cohort had a lower percentage of minority patients (41.3%) than the OP cohort (48.2%). The TM cohort had a significantly lower percentage of black 12.9% versus 14.1%, Asian. 5.1% versus 5.8%, and Spanish/Hispanic 1.9% versus 15.4%, than the M and the OP cohort from the prior year (p < 0.026, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). For socioeconomic status, only 13.8% of TM patients were from ZIP codes with median household incomes <50k. A total of 96.2% of TM visits were performed in English, where only 61% of individuals in the metropolitan area report English as their primary language. Conclusions: As the largest analysis of the use of TM in orthopedics, this study highlights both the future potential of TM and areas of improvement to ensure better access to care for all patient populations. Maintenance of the provisions to allow audio-only visits to be considered TM and billed as such is one important measure.","output":"Telemedicine Utilization by Orthopedic Patients During COVID-19 Pandemic: Demographic and Socioeconomic Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world has been facing the biggest virological invasion in the form of Covid-19 pandemic since the beginning of the year 2020. In this paper, we consider a deterministic epidemic model of four compartments classified based on the health status of the populations of a given country to capture the disease progression. A stochastic extension of the deterministic model is further considered to capture the uncertainty or variation observed in the disease transmissibility. In the case of a deterministic system, the disease-free equilibrium will be globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, otherwise, the disease persists. Using Lyapunov functional methods, we prove that the infected population of the stochastic system tends to zero exponentially almost surely if the basic reproduction number is less than unity. The stochastic system has no interior equilibrium, however, its asymptotic solution is shown to fluctuate around the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic system under some parametric restrictions, implying that the infection persists. A case study with the Covid-19 epidemic data of Spain is presented and various analytical results have been demonstrated. The epidemic curve in Spain clearly shows two waves of infection. The first wave was observed during March-April and the second wave started in the middle of July and not completed yet. A real-time basic reproduction number has been given to illustrate the epidemiological status of Spain throughout the study period. Estimated cumulative numbers of confirmed and death cases are 1,613,626 and 42,899, respectively, with case fatality rate 2.66 per cent till the deadly virus is eliminated from Spain.","output":"Mathematical Perspective of Covid-19 Pandemic: Disease Extinction Criteria in Deterministic and Stochastic Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IFRS 9 and ASC 326 were developed after the 2008C2009 financial crisis, and both accounting standards include an expected loss model as a means of providing for credit losses.

The phenomenon was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine period, which gave new impetus to the growth of small home gardens. However, the knowledge associated with making high-quality compost is often lacking in home gardeners. Therefore, the objective of this research was to find answers to the following questions: can the quality of backyard compost be considered safe in terms of toxicity and nutrient content? Can weed seed dispersion affect the usability of backyard compost? In general, can the circulation of organic matter be increased with the spread of home composting? In this study, 16 different house composts were analysed for stability, weed seed contamination, toxic elements, and nutrient content using analysis of variance. The results of the research showed that the quality properties of the composts (including their weed seed dispersion effect) were greatly influenced by the different techniques and raw materials used. The toxicity levels, as well as the content of macro and microelements, were within the parameters of safe-quality compost. The specific macronutrient (Ca, Mg) and micronutrient (Fe, Mn) contents of the tested composts have a similar and, in some cases, more favorable nutrient supply capacity in crop production than the frequently-used cow manure-based composts.

Relevant structural and thermodynamic details from biophysical experiments confirm that even long-term RNA preservation with ILs is a possible alternative devoid of any structural deformation. These results establish a unifying mechanism of how ILs are maintaining conformational integrity and thermal stability.

Thereby, cardiovascular comorbidity has a major impact on mortality. We investigated whether coronary calcification as a marker for coronary artery disease (CAD) is appropriate for risk prediction in COVID-19. METHODS: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (n = 109) were analyzed regarding clinical outcome after native computed tomography (CT) imaging for COVID-19 screening. CAC (coronary calcium score) and clinical outcome (need for intensive care treatment or death) data were calculated following a standardized protocol. We defined three endpoints: critical COVID-19 and transfer to ICU, fatal COVID-19 and death, composite endpoint critical and fatal COVID-19, a composite of ICU treatment and death. We evaluated the association of clinical outcome with the CAC. Patients were dichotomized by the median of CAC. Hazard ratios and odds ratios were calculated for the events death or ICU or a composite of death and ICU. RESULTS: We observed significantly more events for patients with CAC above the groups median of 31 for critical outcome (HR: 1.97[1.09,3.57], p = 0.026), for fatal outcome (HR: 4.95[1.07,22.9], p = 0.041) and the composite endpoint (HR: 2.31[1.28,4.17], p = 0.0056.

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) is a safety measure when performing a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT), but the controversy surrounding the routine use of FB as part of the procedure remains open. National surveys in some European countries showed that the use of FB is non-standardized. Retrospective studies have not shown a significant difference in complications between procedures performed with or without a bronchoscope. International guidelines have not been able to establish recommendations regarding the use of FB in PDT due to lack of evidence. DESIGN: This is a multicenter (three centers at the time of publishing this paper) randomized controlled clinical trial to examine the safety of percutaneous tracheostomy using FB. We will include all consecutive adult patients admitted to the ICU in whom percutaneous tracheostomy for prolonged mechanical ventilation is indicated and with no exclusion criteria for using FB. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive blind PDT or PDT under endoscopic guidance. All procedures will be performed by experienced intensivists in PDT and FB. A Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor the trial. The primary outcome is the incidence of perioperative complications.

The cross-coupled meta-population methods were employed using between-city Baidu migration index. We modelled four scenarios of geographic spread of COVID-19 including the presence of both chunyun and lock-down (baseline); lock-down without chunyun (scenario 1); chunyun without lock-down (scenario 2); and the absence of both chunyun and lock-down (scenario 3). RESULTS: Compared with the baseline, scenario 1 resulted in 3.84% less cases by February 9 while scenario 2 and 3 resulted in 20.22 and 32.46% more cases by February 9. The geographic distribution of cases revealed that chunyun facilitated the COVID-19 spread in the majority but not all cities, and the effectiveness of Wuhan lock-down was offset by chunyun.

The longer high levels of viral multiplication occur - permitted by high levels of transmission -, the more the virus can adapt to the human host and find ways to success. The third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic is starting in different parts of the world, emphasizing that transmission containment measures that are being imposed are not adequate. Part of the consideration in determining containment measures is the rationale that vaccination will soon stop transmission and allow a return to normality. However, vaccines themselves represent a selection pressure for evolution of vaccine-resistant variants, so the coupling of a policy of permitting high levels of transmission/virus multiplication during vaccine roll-out with the expectation that vaccines will deal with the pandemic, is unrealistic. In the absence of effective antivirals, it is not improbable that SARS-CoV-2 infection prophylaxis will involve an annual vaccination campaign against 'dominant' viral variants, similar to influenza prophylaxis. Living with COVID-19 will be an issue of SARS-CoV-2 variants and evolution. It is therefore crucial to understand how SARS-CoV-2 evolves and what constrains its evolution, in order to anticipate the variants that will emerge. Thus far, the focus has been on the receptor-binding spike protein, but the virus is complex, encoding 26 proteins which interact with a large number of host factors, so the possibilities for evolution are manifold and not predictable a priori. However, if we are to mount the best defence against COVID-19, we must mount it against the variants, and to do this, we must have knowledge about the evolutionary possibilities of the virus. In addition to the generic cellular interactions of the virus, there are extensive polymorphisms in humans (e.g. Lewis, HLA, etc.), some distributed within most or all populations, some restricted to specific ethnic populations and these variations pose additional opportunities for/constraints on viral evolution. We now have the wherewithal - viral genome sequencing, protein structure determination/modelling, protein interaction analysis - to functionally characterize viral variants, but access to comprehensive genome data is extremely uneven. Yet, to develop an understanding of the impacts of such evolution on transmission and disease, we must link it to transmission (viral epidemiology) and disease data (patient clinical data), and the population granularities of these. In this editorial, we explore key facets of viral biology and the influence of relevant aspects of human polymorphisms, human behaviour, geography and climate and, based on this, derive a series of recommendations to monitor viral evolution and predict the types of variants that are likely to arise.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 biology and variants: anticipation of viral evolution and what needs to be done"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Health workers (HWs) are at high risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) infections. Therefore, health authorities further recommend screening strategies for SARS-CoV-2 infection in exposed or high-risk HWs. Nevertheless, to date, the best/optimal method to screen HWs for SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under debate, and data on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs are still scarce. The present study aims to assess the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate amongst HWs in a teaching hospital in Central Italy and the diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 serology (index test) in comparison with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR assay (reference standard). (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study on the retrospective data of HWs tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RNA-RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and by an IgM/IgG serology assay on venous blood samples, irrespective of exposure and/or symptoms, was carried out. (3) Results: A total of 2057 HWs (median age 46, 19-69 years, females 60.2%) were assessed by the RNA RT-PCR assay and 58 (2.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Compared with negative HWs, SARS-CoV-2-positives were younger (mean age 41.7 versus 45.2, p < 0.01; 50% versus 31% under or equal to 40 years old, p < 0.002) and had a shorter duration of employment (64 versus 125 months, p = 0.02). Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 was more frequent in positive HWs than in negatives (55.2% versus 27.5%, p < 0.0001). In 44.8% of positive HWs, no exposure was traced. None of the positive HWs had a fatal outcome, none of them had acute respiratory distress syndrome, and only one required hospitalization for mild/moderate pneumonia. In 1084 (51.2%) HWs, nasopharyngeal swabs and an IgM/IgG serology assay were performed. With regard to IgM serology, sensitivity was 0% at a specificity of 98.99% (positive predictive value, PPV 0%, negative predictive value, NPV 99.2%). Concerning IgG serology and irrespective of the time interval between nasopharyngeal swab and serology, sensitivity was 50% at a specificity of 99.1% (PPV 28.6%, NPV 99.6%). IgG serology showed a higher diagnostic performance when performed at least two weeks after testing SARS-CoV-2-positive at the RNA RT-PCR assay by a nasopharyngeal swab.

Nearly half of the positive HWs reported no previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2-infected subjects and were diagnosed thanks to the proactive screening strategy implemented. IgG serology seems useful when performed at least two weeks after an RNA RT-PCR assay. IgM serology does not seem to be a useful test for the diagnosis of active SARS-CoV-2 infection.

METHODS: A prospective laboratory-based study including all patients with at least one positive APC was performed. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 7 days. Clinical, analytical and parasitological features including results of the direct visualization of the stool (DV) after formalin-ether concentration and time-to-detection (TTD) of the larvae in APC were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 141 samples from 75 patients had a positive APC. In 49 of them (65.3%) three or more stool samples were processed for direct visualization (DV) and APC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on all pediatric samples of suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The samples were received from the adjoining districts and our Institution in the Department of Microbiology from June to November 2020. Cases were then confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of the total 62,030 pediatric samples tested, 847 (1.3%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. The majority of positive cases were between the ages of 11C15 years. The median age of confirmed patients was 14 years. The male to female ratio was 1.5:1. Infants represented 1.6% of the positive cases. About 62.1% of all positive cases were asymptomatic. Childhood cases increased from June 2020 and peaked in September 2020 before declining. CONCLUSION: Children of all ages appeared susceptible to COVID-19 and accounted for a very small proportion of confirmed cases. Mostly, children were found to be asymptomatic.

METHODS: This position paper was prepared by researchers from several European countries and Australia, working within the EU COST Action OMEGA-NET. The paper drew on two recent systematic reviews on the occupational health of international migrant workers and other literature, and also identified uncertainties and gaps in the research literature. Migrants may, for example, be temporary or permanent, moving for specific jobs migrants or other reasons. Their ethnicity and language capabilities will affect their work opportunities. RESULTS: The occupational health literature seldom adequately identifies the heterogeneity or characteristics of the migrant group being studied. Migrants tend to work in more physically and mentally demanding environments with higher exposures than native workers. Migrants tend to have an increased risk of physical and mental ill health, but less access to health care services. This has been demonstrated recently by high rates of COVID-19 and less access to health care. There have been a number of cross-sectional studies of migrant health but few long-term cohort studies were identified. Other study designs, such as registry-based studies, surveys and qualitative studies may complement cross-sectional studies. Mixed-methodology studies would be valuable in research on migrants occupational health. Language and lack of trust are barriers to migrant research participation. CONCLUSION: Targeted research, especially longitudinal, identifying how these economically important but often-vulnerable workers can be best assisted is needed. Researchers should identify the characteristics of the migrant workers that they are studying including visa/migration circumstances (temporary, permanent, undocumented), racial and ethnic characteristics, existing skills and language abilities.","output":"Migrant workers occupational health research: an OMEGA-NET working group position paper"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNase-resistant, noninfectious virus-like particles containing exogenous RNA sequences (armored RNA) are good candidates as RNA controls and standards in RNA virus detection. However, the length of RNA packaged in the virus-like particles with high efficiency is usually less than 500 bases. In this study, we describe a method for producing armored L-RNA. Armored L-RNA is a complex of MS2 bacteriophage coat protein and RNA produced in Escherichia coli by the induction of a two-plasmid coexpression system in which the coat protein and maturase are expressed from one plasmid and the target RNA sequence with modified MS2 stem-loop (pac site) is transcribed from another plasmid. A 3V armored L-RNA of 2,248 bases containing six gene fragments-hepatitis C virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV1, SARS-CoV2, and SARS-CoV3), avian influenza virus matrix gene (M300), and H5N1 avian influenza virus (HA300)-was successfully expressed by the two-plasmid coexpression system and was demonstrated to have all of the characteristics of armored RNA. We evaluated the 3V armored L-RNA as a calibrator for multiple virus assays. We used the WHO International Standard for HCV RNA (NIBSC 96/790) to calibrate the chimeric armored L-RNA, which was diluted by 10-fold serial dilutions to obtain samples containing 10(6) to 10(2) copies. In conclusion, the approach we used for armored L-RNA preparation is practical and could reduce the labor and cost of quality control in multiplex RNA virus assays. Furthermore, we can assign the chimeric armored RNA with an international unit for quantitative detection.","output":"RNase-resistant virus-like particles containing long chimeric RNA sequences produced by two-plasmid coexpression system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Osteoporosis is characterized by impaired bone metabolism.

This study was performed to determine the role of Apelin in the osteoporosis process and whether it affects mitophagy, survival, and osteogenic capacity of BMSCs in in vitro and in vivo models of osteoporosis. Our results demonstrated that Apelin was down-regulated in ovariectomized-induced osteoporosis rats and Apelin-13 treatment activated mitophagy in BMSCs, ameliorating oxidative stress and thereby reviving osteogenic function via AMPK- phosphorylation. Besides, Apelin-13 administration restored bone mass and microstructure as well as reinstated mitophagy, enhanced osteogenic function in OVX rats.

Although survival-related traits often trade off with reproduction, survival-related traits themselves may trade off with each other under energy limitation. Whole-organism performance and the immune system both enhance survival, yet are costly, but it is unclear how the two might trade off with each other under energy-limited conditions. Resources may be allocated to very different types of performance (e.g., aerobic endurance versus anaerobic sprinting) just as they may be allocated to different components of the immune system (e.g., innate versus acquired) to maximize survival. We forced allocation to different performance traits in green anole lizards (Anolis carolinensis), using specialized exercise training, to determine how different components of the immune system would be impacted by shifts in energy use. We measured immunocompetence in endurance trained, sprint trained, and untrained control lizards with the swelling response to phytohemagglutinin (cell-mediated), antibody response to sheep red blood cells (acquired humoral), and wound healing (integrated). Endurance-trained lizards had reduced cell-mediated immunity, whereas sprint-trained lizards had reduced rates of wound healing. The acquired immune response was not affected by either type of training. Because each immune measure responded differently to the different types of training, our results do not support the hypothesis that simple energy limitation determines overall investment in immunity.

TB LAM Ag is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to help detect active tuberculosis in HIV-positive people with severe HIV disease. This review update asks the question, \\"does new evidence justify the use of LF-LAM in a broader group of people?\\", and is part of the WHO process for updating guidance on the use of LF-LAM. OBJECTIVES To assess the accuracy of LF-LAM for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis among HIV-positive adults with signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (symptomatic participants) and among HIV-positive adults irrespective of signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (unselected participants not assessed for tuberculosis signs and symptoms).The proposed role for LF-LAM is as an add on to clinical judgement and with other tests to assist in diagnosing tuberculosis. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, Scopus, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, and ProQuest, without language restriction to 11 May 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized trials, cross-sectional, and observational cohort studies that evaluated LF-LAM for active tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) in HIV-positive adults. We included studies that used the manufacturer's recommended threshold for test positivity, either the updated reference card with four bands (grade 1 of 4) or the corresponding prior reference card grade with five bands (grade 2 of 5). The reference standard was culture or nucleic acid amplification test from any body site (microbiological). We considered a higher quality reference standard to be one in which two or more specimen types were evaluated for tuberculosis diagnosis and a lower quality reference standard to be one in which only one specimen type was evaluated. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data using a standardized form and REDCap electronic data capture tools. We appraised the quality of studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and performed meta-analyses to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity using a bivariate random-effects model and a Bayesian approach. We analyzed studies enrolling strictly symptomatic participants separately from those enrolling unselected participants. We investigated pre-defined sources of heterogeneity including the influence of CD4 count and clinical setting on the accuracy estimates. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS We included 15 unique studies (nine new studies and six studies from the original review that met the inclusion criteria): eight studies among symptomatic adults and seven studies among unselected adults. All studies were conducted in low- or middle-income countries. Risk of bias was high in the patient selection and reference standard domains, mainly because studies excluded participants unable to produce sputum and used a lower quality reference standard.Participants with tuberculosis symptomsLF-LAM pooled sensitivity (95% credible interval (CrI) ) was 42% (31% to 55%) (moderate-certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 91% (85% to 95%) (very low-certainty evidence), (8 studies, 3449 participants, 37% with tuberculosis).For a population of 1000 people where 300 have microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF-LAM would result in: 189 to be LF-LAM positive: of these, 63 (33%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 811 to be LF-LAM negative: of these, 174 (21%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 52% (40% to 64%) among inpatients versus 29% (17% to 47%) among outpatients; and pooled specificity was 87% (78% to 93%) among inpatients versus 96% (91% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count.Unselected participants not assessed for signs and symptoms of tuberculosisLF-LAM pooled sensitivity was 35% (22% to 50%), (moderate-certainty evidence) and pooled specificity was 95% (89% to 96%), (low-certainty evidence), (7 studies, 3365 participants, 13% with tuberculosis).For a population of 1000 people where 100 have microbiologically-confirmed tuberculosis, the utilization of LF-LAM would result in: 80 to be LF-LAM positive: of these, 45 (56%) would not have tuberculosis (false-positives); and 920 to be LF-LAM negative: of these, 65 (7%) would have tuberculosis (false-negatives).By clinical setting, pooled sensitivity was 62% (41% to 83%) among inpatients versus 31% (18% to 47%) among outpatients; pooled specificity was 84% (48% to 96%) among inpatients versus 95% (87% to 99%) among outpatients. Stratified by CD4 cell count, pooled sensitivity increased, and specificity decreased with lower CD4 cell count. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We found that LF-LAM has a sensitivity of 42% to diagnose tuberculosis in HIV-positive individuals with tuberculosis symptoms and 35% in HIV-positive individuals not assessed for tuberculosis symptoms, consistent with findings reported previously. Regardless of how people are enrolled, sensitivity is higher in inpatients and those with lower CD4 cell, but a concomitant lower specificity. As a simple point-of-care test that does not depend upon sputum evaluation, LF-LAM may assist with the diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly when a sputum specimen cannot be produced.","output":"Lateral flow urine lipoarabinomannan assay for detecting active tuberculosis in people living with HIV."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Considering the interdisciplinary role dental staff can play in addressing overweight and obesity in childhood, this study aimed to codesign guideline implementation strategies for childrens growth assessment and dietary advice guidelines in the dental setting.

Participants learned information about one group (e.g., \\"Zuttles like apples\\"), and then made inferences about another group (e.g., \\"Do Twiggums like apples or hate apples?\\"). Study 1 acted as a proof of concept: Eight-year-olds and adults (but not 5-year-olds) assumed that the two groups would have opposite characteristics. Learning about the group as a generic whole versus as specific individuals boosted the use of the heuristic. Study 2 and Study 3 (sample sizes, methods, and analyses pre-registered), examined whether the presence or absence of several factors affected the activation and scope of the dichotomizing heuristic in adults. Whereas learning about or treating the groups as separate was necessary for activating dichotomous thinking, intergroup conflict and featuring only two (versus many) groups was not required. Moreover, the heuristic occurred when participants made both binary and scaled decisions. Once triggered, adults applied this cognitive shortcut widely-not only to benign (e.g., liking apples) and novel characteristics (e.g., liking modies), but also to evaluative traits signaling the morals or virtues of a social group (e.g., meanness or intelligence). Adults did not, however, extend the heuristic to the edges of improbability: They failed to dichotomize when doing so would attribute highly unusual preferences (e.g., disliking having fun).

Viruses can cause direct cardiac damage by lysing infected cardiomyocytes. Inflammatory immune responses that limit viral replication can also indirectly cause damage during infection, making regulatory factors that fine-tune these responses particularly important. Identifying and understanding these factors that regulate cardiac immune responses during infection will be essential for developing targeted treatments for virus-associated heart failure. Our laboratory has discovered Brain Expressed X-linked protein 1 (BEX1) as a novel stress-regulated pro-inflammatory factor in the heart. Here we report that BEX1 plays a cardioprotective role in the heart during viral infection. Specifically, we adopted genetic gain- and loss-of-function strategies to modulate BEX1 expression in the heart in the context of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced cardiomyopathy and found that BEX1 limits viral replication in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, despite the greater viral load observed in mice lacking BEX1, inflammatory immune cell recruitment in the mouse heart was profoundly impaired in the absence of BEX1. Overall, the absence of BEX1 accelerated CVB3-driven heart failure and pathologic heart remodeling. This result suggests that limiting inflammatory cell recruitment has detrimental consequences for the heart during viral infections. Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing BEX1 in cardiomyocytes revealed the efficacy of BEX1 for counteracting viral replication in the heart in vivo. We also found that BEX1 retains its antiviral role in isolated cells. Indeed, BEX1 was necessary and sufficient to counteract viral replication in both isolated primary cardiomyocytes and mouse embryonic fibroblasts suggesting a broader applicability of BEX1 as antiviral agent that extended to viruses other than CVB3, including Influenza A and Sendai virus. Mechanistically, BEX1 regulated interferon beta (IFN-) expression in infected cells.

METHODS: This is a county-level population-based study using a panel data regression analysis of the proportion of in-person learning to evaluate an association with community-wide daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases. The study period was July 12-October 6, 2020. We included 73 out of 92 (79.3%) Indiana counties in the analysis, accounting for 85.7% of school corporations and 90.6% of student enrollment statewide. The primary exposure was the proportion of students returning to in-person instruction. The primary outcome was the daily new SARS-CoV-2 cases per 100,000 residents at the county level. RESULTS: There is a statistically significant relationship between the proportion of students attending K-12 schools in-person and the county level daily cases of SARS-CoV-2 28 days later. For all ages, the coefficient of interest (?) is estimated at 3.36 (95% CI: 1.91-4.81; p < 0.001). This coefficient represents the effect of a change the proportion of students attending in-person on new daily cases 28 days later. For example, a 10 percentage point increase in K-12 students attending school in-person is associated with a daily increase in SARS-CoV-2 cases in the county equal to 0.336 cases/100,000 residents of all ages.

The goals of this study were to (1) assess the current state and needs of medical toxicology clerkships and (2) develop a consensus-derived list of core topics that should be covered during a medical toxicology clerkship. METHODS: We assembled a task force established by the American College of Medical Toxicology (ACMT) of nine experts in medical toxicology or emergency medicine. We developed a needs assessment survey that was sent to all medical student clerkship directors in medical toxicology. Based on their responses, we used a modified Delphi process to develop a consensus of core topics that should be covered during a medical student clerkship. RESULTS: Nineteen out of 42 (45%) clerkship directors completed the survey; 18 met inclusion criteria. The majority of clerkships were 4 weeks in duration with an average of 15 students/year. The three most common teaching methods used were bedside teaching (n = 17/18), classroom teaching (n = 17/18), and journal club (n = 14/18). All the clerkship directors (n = 18/18) reported they would use a standardized curriculum as well as educational content developed by ACMT. There was overwhelming consensus on the core topics which included, but were not limited to, pharmacology/toxicology; drugs; drugs of abuse; natural products; pharmacological basis of antidote use; toxicologic syndromes; vital sign abnormalities; initial management; supportive and other care; withdrawal syndrome management; industrial, household, and environmental toxins; differential diagnosis by clinical findings; and ABCs-resuscitation.

Current vaccines are designed to protect against circulating influenza strains of a given season. However, mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains, as well as inferior vaccine effectiveness in immunodeficient populations, represent major obstacles. In an effort to expand the breadth of protection elicited by influenza vaccination, one of the major surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA), has been modified to develop immunogens that display conserved regions from multiple viruses or elicit a highly polyclonal antibody response to broaden protection. These approaches, which target either the head or the stalk domain of HA, or both domains, have shown promise in recent preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, the role of adjuvants in bolstering the robustness of the humoral response has been studied, and their effects on the vaccine-elicited antibody repertoire are currently being investigated. This review will discuss the progress made in the universal influenza vaccine field with respect to influenza A viruses from the perspectives of both antigen and adjuvant, with a focus on the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies.","output":"Next-Generation Influenza HA Immunogens and Adjuvants in Pursuit of a Broadly Protective Vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Malin examines the impact of Covid-19 on public services in the UK which are already under pressure as a result of years of austerity 10 years of austerity has left public services in a fragile, vulnerable state, in addition to which, we are experiencing the weakest wage and productivity growth since the 19th century Starving the NHS of the resources it needed left it exposed on multiple fronts, not least from insufficient recruitment of doctors, nurses and a shortage of beds for critically ill patients The Conservative Government declared its intention to borrow for public infrastructure projects to produce faster growth, higher tax receipts and a lower deficit Infrastructure investment announced in its March 2020 budget was intended to take government spending back to the pre-austerity era, and included immediate measures for the NHS and public services","output":"Managing The Impact of Covid-19 as regards the delivery of UK public services"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Hepatitis B (HepB) vaccines have demonstrated safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy during the past 4 decades (1,2).

The anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and regenerative properties of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), and investigation into their therapeutic efficacy and safety in patients with severe chronic low back pain, have not been demonstrated in controlled studies. Multiple pain generators have been hypothesized to be responsible in severe spinal degeneration and it is difficult to identify a single pain generator; consequently, resulting in inadequate therapeutic results. OBJECTIVES The study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous bone marrow MSCs in the treatment of chronic low back pain due to severe lumbar spinal degeneration with involvement of multiple structures. STUDY DESIGN Prospective, open-label, nonrandomized, parallel-controlled, 2-arm exploratory study. SETTING A private, specialized, interventional pain management and regenerative medicine clinic. METHODS The treatment group patients received a one-time bone marrow concentrate injection into spinal structures (i.e., discs, facets, spinal nerves, and sacroiliac joints), along with conventional treatment, whereas, the control group received conventional treatment with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, over-the-counter drugs, structured exercise programs, physical therapy, spinal injections and opioids, etc., as indicated. OUTCOMES ASSESSMENT Outcomes were assessed utilizing multiple instruments, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11), EuroQOL 5-Dimensional Questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), Global Mental Health (GMH), and Global Physical Health (GPH). Multiple outcomes were assessed with primary outcomes being minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in ODI scores between the groups and/or a 2-point reduction in pain scores. In the study group, total nucleated cells, colony forming units-fibroblast, CD34-positive cell numbers and platelets were also recorded, along with post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging changes. Outcomes were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS Significant improvement was achieved in functional status measured by ODI, pain relief measured by NRS-11, and other parameters measured by EQ-5D-3L, GMH, and GPH, in the study group relative to the control group at all time periods. The results showed significant improvements at 12-month follow-up with 67% of the patients in the study group achieving MCID utilizing ODI when compared to 8% in the control group. Greater than 2-point pain reduction was seen in 74% of the patients at 3 months, 66% of the patients at 6 months, and 56% of the patients at 12 months. Both MCID and pain relief of 2 points were significantly different compared to the control group. Opioid use decreased in the investigational group, whereas, there was a slight increase in the control group. Age, gender, opioid use, and body mass index did not affect the outcomes in the stem cell group. LIMITATIONS Single center, nonrandomized study.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)Cbased tool that assists with diagnoses of dermatologic conditions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multiple-reader, multiple-case diagnostic study developed an AI-based tool and evaluated its utility. Primary care physicians and NPs retrospectively reviewed an enriched set of cases representing 120 different skin conditions. Randomization was used to ensure each clinician reviewed each case either with or without AI assistance; each clinician alternated between batches of 50 cases in each modality. The reviews occurred from February 21 to April 28, 2020. Data were analyzed from May 26, 2020, to January 27, 2021. EXPOSURES: An AI-based assistive tool for interpreting clinical images and associated medical history. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary analysis evaluated agreement with reference diagnoses provided by a panel of 3 dermatologists for PCPs and NPs. Secondary analyses included diagnostic accuracy for biopsy-confirmed cases, biopsy and referral rates, review time, and diagnostic confidence. RESULTS: Forty board-certified clinicians, including 20 PCPs (14 women [70.0%]; mean experience, 11.3 [range, 2-32] years) and 20 NPs (18 women [90.0%]; mean experience, 13.1 [range, 2-34] years) reviewed 1048 retrospective cases (672 female [64.2%]; median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-56] years; 41 920 total reviews) from a teledermatology practice serving 11 sites and provided 0 to 5 differential diagnoses per case (mean [SD], 1.6 [0.7]). The PCPs were located across 12 states, and the NPs practiced in primary care without physician supervision across 9 states. The NPs had a mean of 13.1 (range, 2-34) years of experience and practiced in primary care without physician supervision across 9 states. Artificial intelligence assistance was significantly associated with higher agreement with reference diagnoses. For PCPs, the increase in diagnostic agreement was 10% (95% CI, 8%-11%; P < .001), from 48% to 58%; for NPs, the increase was 12% (95% CI, 10%-14%; P < .001), from 46% to 58%. In secondary analyses, agreement with biopsy-obtained diagnosis categories of maglignant, precancerous, or benign increased by 3% (95% CI, ?1% to 7%) for PCPs and by 8% (95% CI, 3%-13%) for NPs. Rates of desire for biopsies decreased by 1% (95% CI, 0-3%) for PCPs and 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) for NPs; the rate of desire for referrals decreased by 3% (95% CI, 1%-4%) for PCPs and NPs. Diagnostic agreement on cases not indicated for a dermatologist referral increased by 10% (95% CI, 8%-12%) for PCPs and 12% (95% CI, 10%-14%) for NPs, and median review time increased slightly by 5 (95% CI, 0-8) seconds for PCPs and 7 (95% CI, 5-10) seconds for NPs per case. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Artificial intelligence assistance was associated with improved diagnoses by PCPs and NPs for 1 in every 8 to 10 cases, indicating potential for improving the quality of dermatologic care.","output":"Development and Assessment of an Artificial IntelligenceCBased Tool for Skin Condition Diagnosis by Primary Care Physicians and Nurse Practitioners in Teledermatology Practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To assess the COVID-19 frequency rates in hospitalized patients (HP) and healthcare workers (HCW), viral load inference, and the impact of vaccination and variants of concern (VOC) during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Listening effort was also significantly associated with more trouble understanding conversation, decreased interest in conversation, more difficulty connecting with patients, changes in cognition for both providers and patients, and changes in the clinical efficiency of providers. Hearing loss had an additive effect for trouble understanding conversations and changes in clinical efficiency. CONCLUSION: These results provide information about the clinical strain introduced from mask use in healthcare settings. Overall, results show that in healthcare settings there is increased cognitive load and listening effort for both patients and providers, as well as changes in clinical efficiency for providers when utilizing masks.

An under-studied area is that of lay (non-academic) theories of mindfulness. The goal of this article is to identify, organize, analyze in detail, and provide themes from the meditators definitions of mindfulness. Possible differences and similarities of the collected definitions of mindfulness with the scientific-academic definitions and with the academic-Buddhist definitions are also checked. METHODS: A qualitative and inductive thematic analysis on the definitions of mindfulness offered by the participants was carried out. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 326 meditators who offered a definition of mindfulness through an open question. Seven themes were identified: (1) mindfulness defined as attention/awareness; (2) mindfulness defined as a non-evaluative attitude; (3) mindfulness defined as strategy; (4) mindfulness defined from a theoretical analysis; (5) mindfulness defined as a psycho-affective-spiritual state; (6) mindfulness defined as personal development; and (7) lack of understanding of mindfulness. From these themes, it can be deduced that the definitions collected share more patterns of meaning with the scientific-academic definition of mindfulness than with the academic-Buddhist one.

This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 hospitalised patients. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study design was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of hospitalised adult patients ( 18 years old) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 illness at Mthatha Regional Hospital (MRH), Eastern Cape. RESULTS: Of the 1814 patients tested for COVID-19 between 20 March 2020 and 31 July 2020 at MRH, two-thirds (65.4%) were female. About two-thirds (242) of the 392 patients (21.6%) who tested positive for this disease were hospitalised and one-third (150) were quarantined at home. The mean age of the patients tested for COVID-19 was 42.6 years and there was no difference between males and females. The mean age of hospitalised patients was 55.5 years and the mean age of hospitalised patients who died (61.3 years) was much higher than recovered (49.5 years).

No differences in the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms and anxiety were found between those who were exposed and non-exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients. Having a fear of being infected with COVID-19 and spreading it among family members were associated with increased risk of depression. Among those exposed to COVID-19 confirmed or suspected patients, poor occupational safety (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.25-3.39), stigmatization (OR = 2.19, 95% CI 1.29-3.72), and heavy workload (OR = 2.45, 95% CI 1.53-3.92) were associated with increased risk of elevated depressive symptoms, whilst poor self-confidence (OR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.56-4.09) and heavy workload (OR = 1.94. 95% CI 1.22-3.12) were associated with increased risk of anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of being infected and distress caused by fear of spreading it among family members, stigmatization, poor self-confidence, poor occupational safety and heavy workload are vital risk factors that need to be considered in future psychological support services designed for the healthcare professionals in unprecedented outbreaks like COVID-19.","output":"Psychological experiences of healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A sharp increase in the hospitalization rate for pneumonia, particularly among adults between 20 and 40 years old, and an unusual series of deaths, coincident with an increase in laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, were reported in the spring of 2009 in Mexico.

This highly contagious virus is spread primarily via respiratory droplets from face-to-face contact and contaminated surfaces as well as potential aerosol spread. Over half of transmissions occur from presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers. Although several vaccines are currently available for emergency use, there are uncertainties regarding the duration of protection and the efficacy of preventing asymptomatic spread. Thus, personal protective health behaviour and measures against COVID-19 are still widely recommended after immunization. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy of these measures, and the results may provide valuable guidance to policymakers to educate the general public about how to reduce the individual-level risk of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: This case-control study enrolled 24 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from Centro Hospitalar Conde de S?o Janurio (C.H.C.S.J.), which was the only hospital designated to manage COVID-19 patients in Macao SAR, China, and 1113 control participants who completed a 14-day mandatory quarantine in 12 designated hotels due to returning from high-risk countries between 17 March and 15 April 2020. A questionnaire was developed to extract demographic information, contact history, and personal health behaviour. RESULTS: Participants primarily came from the United Kingdom (33.2%), followed by the United States (10.5%) and Portugal (10.2%). Independent factors for COVID-19 infection were having physical contact with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR, 12.108 [95% CI, 3.380C43.376], P < 0.005), participating in high-risk gathering activities (adjusted OR, 1.129 [95% CI, 1.048C1.216], P < 0.005), handwashing after outdoor activity (adjusted OR, 0.021 [95% CI, 0.003C0.134], P < 0.005), handwashing before touching the mouth and nose area (adjusted OR, 0.303 [95% CI, 0.114C0.808], P < 0.05), and wearing a mask whenever outdoors (adjusted OR, 0.307 [95% CI, 0.109C0.867], P < 0.05). The daily count of handwashing remained similar between groups. Only 31.6% of participants had a sufficient 20-s handwashing duration.

To address this, in March 2020, the Korean government designated emergency medical centers for critical care (EMC-CC). This study retrospectively analyzed whether this intervention effectively reduced ambulance diversion (AD) and shortened prehospital times using emergency medical service records from 219,763 patients from the Gyeonggi Province, collected between 1 January and 31 December 2020. We included non-traumatic patients aged 18 years or older.

Following the intervention, the proportion of patients transported 30C35 km and 50 km or more was 13.8% and 5.7%, respectively, indicating an increased distance compared to before the intervention. Although the change in the AD rate was insignificant, the daily AD rate significantly decreased after the intervention. Prehospital times significantly increased after the intervention in all patients (p < 0.001) and by disease group; all prehospital times except for the scene time of cardiac arrest patients increased.

Pathogen discovery techniques offer a hypothesis-free approach to diagnostic testing, yielding comprehensive analysis of microbial genetic material. Given the extent of genetic material produced, deep sequencing tools not only hold promise in the diagnosis of CNS infections but also in defining key pathogenic steps which have previously been unanswered. Significant challenges remain to implementing pathogen discovery techniques in routine clinical practice including cost, expertise and infrastructure needed including laboratory and bioinformatics support, and sample contamination risk. The use in resource-limited regions where the burden of CNS complications due to HIV/AIDS is highest remains poorly defined.

This release process is mediated by host ESCRT complex proteins, which is recruited by viral structural proteins and provides the mechanical means for membrane scission and subsequent viral budding. The prazole drug, tenatoprazole, was previously shown to bind to ESCRT complex member Tsg101 and quantitatively block the release of infectious HIV-1 from cells in culture. In this report we show that tenatoprazole and a related prazole drug, ilaprazole, effectively block infectious Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1/2 release from Vero cells in culture. By electron microscopy, we found that both prazole drugs block the release of HSV particles from the cell nuclear membrane resulting in their accumulation in the nucleus. Ilaprazole also quantitatively blocks the release of HIV-1 from 293T cells with an EC50 of 0.8 M, which is more potent than tenatoprazole. Finally, we synthesized and tested multiple novel prazole-based analogs that demonstrate both binding to Tsg101 and inhibition of viral egress in the nanomolar range of HIV-1 from 293T cells. Our results indicate that prazole-based compounds may represent a class of drugs with potential to be broad-spectrum antiviral agents against multiple enveloped viruses, by interrupting cellular Tsg101 interaction with maturing virus, thus blocking the budding process that releases particles from the cell.

It will very likely be worse than what we had projected, she said. While most of the economies are focusing on re-opening, there have been reports regarding a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic as well. The adverse impacts this can have on economic resilience does not require elaboration. The novel corona epidemic generated exceptional challenges which required exceptional solutions. Financial regulators have come up with very flexible macroprudential support to address acute market stress during the pandemic. In keeping with such international policy measures, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) also introduced extraordinary regulatory measures to provide relief to pandemic-affected individuals and businesses. Accordingly, Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and non-D-SIBs were allowed to draw-down their Capital Conservation Buffers by 100 bps and 50 bps, respectively, to facilitate uninterrupted credit flows to the economy.The CBSL also withdrew the requirement to classify all credit facilities extended to a single borrower as non-performing when the aggregate amount of all outstanding non-performing loans granted to such borrower exceed 30% of total credit facilities.Sri Lankas business sector has been facing extreme challenges as the pre-Covid-19 economy also carried dark spots which have now been compounded. The tourism and travel industries were severely affected by the Easter Sunday bombing which occurred, in April 2019, and all businesses, in general, were affected by the pre-election political uncertainty which emerged towards the latter part of 2019. The banking sector was required to assist such businesses by providing debt moratoria and other relief packages introduced by the authorities during 2019 and in the beginning of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic added new challenges for the countrys business sectors which were already vulnerable. In response, new debt repayment deferral policies were introduced to alleviate cash flow pressures on businesses and households. All such persistent fragilities in the economy and uncertainty about an end date of the health crisis have put severe strains on the financial system. The CBSL, as the prime regulator of the financial system, has a crucial task to ensure banks keep credit flowing to the real economy while preserving the safety and soundness of individual institutions and the entire system. However, the regulator alone cannot prepare the financial system and the economy to withstand the unfolding of a crisis of unprecedented scale.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 771,805 vaccination events across 266,094 patients in the Mayo Clinic Health System between 01/01/2017 and 03/15/2021. The primary outcome was a positive diagnosis of CVST, identified either by the presence of a corresponding ICD code or by an NLP algorithm which detected positive diagnosis of CVST within free-text clinical notes. For each vaccine we calculated the relative risk by dividing the incidence of CVST in the 30 days following vaccination to that in the 30 days preceding vaccination. RESULTS: We identified vaccination events for all FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines including Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 94,818 doses), Moderna (n = 36,350 doses) and Johnson & Johnson - J&J (n = 1,745 doses). We also identified vaccinations events for 10 common FDA-approved non-COVID-19 vaccines (n = 771,805 doses). There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of CVST in 30-days before and after vaccination for any vaccine in this population.

COVID\\\\19 patients over 18 years of age who were admitted to our hospital between 14 March and 1 June 2020, and with a complete micronutrient profile were included in the study. Age, gender, chronic diseases, micronutrient concentrations in the last 6 months, hemogram data on the day of hospitalization, total length of stay in hospital, and hospitalization to Intensive Care Unit (ICU)\\\\intubation\\\\death status of the patients were obtained from the patient files. RESULTS: A total of 310 patients whose parameters were thoroughly examined were included in our study; 51.9% of them were men and the mean age of all patients was 57.02  18.28 years, and the most common comorbid disease was hypertension. The percentage of patients who were followed in the ICU, were intubated, and died was 34.5%, 13.9%, and 9.4%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay was 15.87  12.79 days. Low folate, iron, vitamin D, and hemoglobin levels of the patients and high vitamin B12 concentration were more related to poor prognostic factors. The number of white blood cells was significantly higher in patients with a worse prognosis, and the number of lymphocytes was lower in patients with ICU admission but higher in intubated and dead patients. CONCLUSION: Micronutrient and hemogram values, advanced age, being male, and having comorbid diseases were correlated with the poor prognosis of COVID\\\\19 infection. Deficiency of Iron, Folate, and vitamin D should be well\\\\considered in COVID\\\\19. Excessive vitamin B12 and multivitamin supplementation should be avoided by choosing supplement wisely. In addition, attention should be paid to leukocytosis, lymphocyte counts, and anemia during COVID\\\\19 patient follow\\\\up. WHATS KNOWN: Some micronutrients have an immunomodulatory and anti\\\\inflammatory effect with antioxidant effects and thus play a protective role in respiratory tract infections as COVID\\\\19. Vitamin D deficiency is found to be associated with poor prognostic factors in COVID\\\\19. Lymphopenia is found to be associated with poor prognostic factors in COVID\\\\19.

On the other hand excessive use of vitamin B12 should be avoided. The fact that all micronutrients should be evaluated and managed by choosing wisely rather than a complete multivitamin supplement approach was demonstrated by the differences in the poor prognosis levels of vitamin B12 versus the other micronutrients. In addition, it was found in our study that leukocytosis, lymphocyte counts, and anemia should be taken into consideration together when evaluating hemogram parameters in the follow\\\\up of COVID\\\\19 patients.","output":"The association between micronutrient and hemogram values and prognostic factors in COVID\\\\19 patients: A single\\\\center experience from Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research background: The analysis allows to assess the impact of the industry structure of the credit portfolio on the resistance of commercial banks to the crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic It uses two independent methods to measure the impact of the pandemic on industry risk and the methodology allowing to prioritize industries in terms of potential negative effects of the crisis Purpose of the article: The aim of the research is to assess the resilience of commercial banks operating in the Polish banking sector to the potential effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic The diagnostic features of 13 commercial banks were selected for its implementation Methods: Two linear ordering methods were used, namely the Hellisig method and the TOPSIS method The following were used as the criteria for parametric assessment of the resilience of commercial banks: capital adequacy, liquidity level, profitability of business activity, share in the portfolio of exposures with recognized impairment and the resilience of the bank's credit portfolio to the risk resulting from the exposure in economic sectors These sectors were classified according to the level of risk associated with the effects of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic Findings & Value added: The study allows to conclude that the largest banks conducting their operations in Poland are the most resistant ones to the consequences of the pandemic At the same time the banks most vulnerable due to the crisis were identified The conclusions can be used, inter alia, in the process of managing the financial system stability risk and contribute to the Findings & Value added: The study allows to conclude that the largest banks conducting their operations in Poland are the most resistant ones to the consequences of the pandemic At the same time the banks most vulnerable due to the crisis were identified The conclusions can be used, inter alia, in the process of managing the financial system stability risk and contribute to the discussion on the impact of the pandemic on the condition of commercial banks in emerging markets","output":"Resistance of commercial banks to the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic: the case of Poland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tibet constitutes a major part of the QinghaiCTibet Plateau (QTP) and is a typical ethnic minority (e.g., Tibetan) and ecologically fragile area in the world.

The dietary consumption was characterized by the high consumption of grains and meat products, and the low consumption of fruits and vegetables. The LCC in Tibet has continued to increase. The LCC in approximately 60% of the counties increased, with the high-LCC counties concentrated mainly in the Yarlung Zangbo RiverNyangqu RiverLhasa River area, and municipal districts and pastoral counties generally experiencing a low LCC. The load on land resources (LoL) in Tibet exhibited the characteristic of overall balance with local overloads and increasing tensions. More than 50% of the counties experienced population overload, mainly in municipal districts and pastoral counties. Food surplus was mainly found in farming counties, while the food production in pastoral counties was generally unable to meet the calorie demand. Considering the important role of land use in maintaining regional food security and ecological security, the conversion of grassland to cultivated land, the occupation of cultivated land, and the phenomenon of cultivated land was used to non grain should be avoided. Trans-regional transport of food should be strengthened to meet the calorie needs in population overload areas in the future. Our study provides a perspective for evaluating the pressure of land resources. The result can provide a reference for realizing the balance of grain and calorie supplyCdemand and lay a foundation for formulating sustainable land use policies in the QPT.","output":"Spatio-Temporal Patterns of the Land Carrying Capacity of Tibet Based on Grain Demand and Calorie Requirement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The closure of cognitive psychology labs around the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic has prevented in-person testing. This has caused a particular challenge for speech production researchers, as before the pandemic there were no studies demonstrating that reliable overt speech production data could be collected via the internet. Here, we present evidence that both accurate and reliable overt articulation data can be collected from internet-based speech production experiments. We tested 100 participants in a picture naming paradigm, where we manipulated the word and phonotactic frequency of the picture names. We compared our results to a lab-based study conducted on different participants which used the same materials and design. We found a significant word frequency effect but no phonotactic frequency effect, fully replicating the lab-based results. Effect sizes were similar between experiments, but with significantly longer latencies in the internet-collected data. We found no evidence that internet upload or download speed affected either naming latencies or errors. In addition, we carried out a permutation-style analysis which recommends a minimum sample size of 40 participants for online production paradigms. In sum, our study demonstrates that internet-based testing of speech production is a feasible and promising endeavour, with less challenges than many researchers (anecdotally) assumed.","output":"Can we use the internet to study speech production?

Remdesivir (RDV), a prodrug and requires intracellular conversions to the active triphosphate nucleoside (TN) has surfaced as an active anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. To properly design therapeutic treatment regimens, it is imperative to determine if adequate intracellular TN concentrations are achieved in target tissues, such as the lung. Since measurement of such concentrations is unrealistic in patients, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) model was developed to characterize RDV and TN disposition. Specifically, a hybrid PBPK model was developed based on previously reported data in humans The model represented each tissue as a 2-compartment model - both extracellular and intracellular compartment wherein each intracellular compartment contained a comprehensive metabolic model to the ultimate active metabolite TN. Global sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess which parameters and how highly sensitive ones impacted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNCs) and intracellular lung TN profiles. Finally, clinical multiple-dose regimens indicated that minimum lung intracellular TN concentrations ranged from approximately 9 uM to 4 uM, which suggest current regimens are effective based on in vitro EC50 values. The model can be used to explore tissue drug disposition under various conditions and regimens, and expanded to pharmacodynamic models.","output":"Hybrid physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model for remdesivir: Application to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Engaging patients as partners can influence research, with rewards and deterrents. The authors are researchers and patient co-investigators who collaborated on a comparative effectiveness, randomized controlled study of a structured quality improvement (QI) process to improve behavioral health and primary care integration for people managing multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Patient co-investigators responded to a gap in available resources to support study clinics in partnering with their own patients in QI and co-created the Patient Partner Guide (PPG). OBJECTIVE: Describe the development of the PPG, its use by clinics undertaking the QI project, and research team partnerships. DESIGN: Observational report of study intervention component. PARTICIPANTS: Diverse patients and family members managing MCC and members of their primary care clinics. INTERVENTION: The PPG component of the study intervention is a five-step workbook providing practical tools and resources to sustain partnerships across clinic QI team members, including patient partners. The process of developing the PPG relied on relationship-building tools that were iteratively assessed, practiced, improved, and incorporated into the PPG under the leadership of patient co-investigators. MAIN MEASURES: Observations related to PPG use and patient partner inclusion in clinic QI; impact on the research team. KEY RESULTS: Of 20 clinics, 6 engaged patients as full partners on QI teams. Clinics found resistance in partnering and challenges in using the PPG but valued the material and their partners contributions. Similarly, engagement of patient co-investigators in research brought a shift in perspective to team members. The PPG is available and was adapted for use by research teams. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of patients and other stakeholders in research can be transformative and productive. Building relationships through meaningful work benefits others, and in turn, the research process. This approach can enhance clinical care QI and may result in substantial contributions to the conduct of research.

However, laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer, particularly cancer of the lower rectum, is still challenging because of limited accessibility. Robotic surgery overcomes the limitations of laparoscopy associated with anatomy and offers certain advantages, including 3-D imaging, dexterity and ambidextrous capability, lack of tremors, motion scaling, and a short learning curve. Robotic rectal surgery has been reported to reduce conversion rates, particularly in low anterior resection, but it is associated with longer operative times than the conventional laparoscopic approach. Postoperative morbidities are similar between the robotic and conventional laparoscopic approaches, and oncological outcomes such as the quality of the mesorectum and the status of resection margins are also equivalent. The possible superiority of robotic surgery in terms of the preservation of autonomic function has yet to be established in research based on larger numbers of patients. Although robotic rectal surgery is safe, feasible, and appears to overcome some of the technical limitations associated with conventional laparoscopic surgery, the advantages provided by this technical innovation are currently limited. To justify its expensive cost, robotic surgery is more suitable for select patients, such as obese patients, men, those with cancer of the lower rectum, and those receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy.","output":"Robotic surgery for rectal cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Human infectious diseases are contributed equally by the host immune systems efficiency and any pathogens infectivity.

Here, we describe an outbreak of FLS in Arizona from which an IBV variant that is nearly 90% homologous to DMV/1639 using the Spike subunit 1 gene, named AZ/FLS/17, was isolated and used in challenge experiments. Three-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks were challenged with AZ/FLS/17 or M41 in high and low doses, and the disease outcomes were compared. Overall, no differences in microscopic lesions or viral loads in the reproductive tract were detected between AZ/FLS/17- and M41-infected birds. To minimize the losses linked to FLS in the problematic flocks, an updated live-attenuated IBV vaccine protocol including the use of the Ma5 strain at the hatchery was implemented, resulting in a drastic reduction of false layers in the subsequent flocks. To monitor the circulation of wild-type and vaccine strains in this population, a molecular surveillance study was performed. Samples were collected at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days of age, and from laying hens at 30 and 36 wk. In older birds, the IBV strains detected were more diverse than at 1 and 7 days of age.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the patient population with retained ureteral stents with regards to stent sizes to better understand if these factors could play a pivotal role in their encrustation. METHODS After institutional review board approval, we retrospectively analyzed the data of patients who underwent multimodal surgical procedures for the removal of retained ureteral stents from 2010-2018. The primary outcomes analyzed were ureteral stent length and diameter, location of stent placement, and patients' demographics as potential etiologies for encrustation. RESULTS We included 30 patients with 32 encrusted ureteral stents and 37 patients with 46 forgotten non-retained ureteral stents. Indications for stenting included urolithiasis, malignancy, pregnancy, ureteral stricture, and ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Stent diameters ranged from 6 Fr. to 8.5 Fr. Stent lengths ranged from 22 to 30 cm, and multilength stents were used too. Smaller diameter stents were less likely to be retained when compared to larger diameter stents (>6 Fr.) (p=0.002). Overall stent length was not found to be significant (p=0.251); however, the difference in stent surface area differed by over 1cm (p<0.001). Patients who were uninsured were more likely to have retained stents (p=0.003). Patients who reside with longer commuting distance to the main academic medical center were more likely to have retained stents (p=0.010). CONCLUSIONS Retained ureteral stents could be avoided. Taking into consideration ureteral anatomical variation among patients, smaller diameter stents and smaller surface area may prevent encrustation.

In this study five groups of masks were investigated that are of particular relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: re-usable, fabric two-layer and multi-layer masks, disposable procedure/surgical masks, KN95 and N95 filtering facepiece respirators. Experimental work focussed on the particle penetration through mask materials as a function of particle diameter, and the total inward leakage protection performance of the mask system. Geometric mean fabric protection factors varied from 1.78 to 144.5 for the fabric two-layer and KN95 materials, corresponding to overall filtration efficiencies of 43.8% and 99.3% using a flow rate of 17 L/min, equivalent to a breathing expiration rate for a person in a sedentary or standing position conversing with another individual. Geometric mean total inward leakage protection factors for the 2-layer, multi-layer and procedure masks were <2.3, while 6.2 was achieved for the KN95 masks. The highest values were measured for the N95 group at 165.7. Mask performance is dominated by face seal leakage. Despite the additional filtering layers added to cloth masks, and the higher filtration efficiency of the materials used in disposable procedure and KN95 masks, the total inward leakage protection factor was only marginally improved. N95 FFRs were the only mask group investigated that provided not only high filtration efficiency but high total inward leakage protection, and remain the best option to protect individuals from exposure to aerosol in high risk settings. The Mask Quality Factor and total inward leakage performance are very useful to determine the best options for masking.

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search using the databases: PubMed, Embase, and EuropePMC. Data on visceral fat area (VTA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), and total fat area (TFA) were collected. The outcome of interest was severe COVID-19.

The corresponding inhibition rate of acrylamide was 76.59%. Compared to the control group, the oil absorption of coating chips decreased significantly, whereas the addition of sodium alginate did not affect the quality of potato chips. Scanning electron microscope analysis revealed that coating with sodium alginate could effectively prevent oil uptake, which might contribute to acrylamide mitigation.

We aimed to perform a systematic review of published cases of this novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children associated with COVID-19. Evidence review. A literature search of Pubmed, Embase, BioRxiv, MedRxiv and COVID-19 specific research repositories (Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global Research Database) was conducted from December 30th, 2019 to June 30th, 2020.

After screening the full text, 40 observational studies and case reports were included, comprising 687 cases (published between May 9th, 2020 and June 30th, 2020). Findings. In contrast to classic Kawasaki disease, epidemiological enrichment for adolescents (median age 9 [6.0-12.3]) and ethnic minorities (35.8% black and 24.5% Hispanic/Latino) was observed. There was a male predominance (59.1%). Apart from obesity (24.4%), pre-existing conditions were infrequent. The majority suffered from gastrointestinal (87.2%) and cardiocirculatory (79.2%) manifestations. Respiratory symptoms (51.2%) were less frequent. Over half of patients (56.3%) presented with hemodynamic shock, and critical care interventions were often necessary (inotropics (56.5%), mechanical ventilation (22.9%), non-invasive ventilation (30.6%), extracorporal membrane oxygenation (ECMO;4.5%)).

METHODS A cohort of patients with knee osteoarthritis undergoing primary TKA at two hospitals (a regional university hospital and a capital's metropolitan hospital) was prospectively followed for 12 months. Patients were assessed preoperatively and at 4 postoperative time-points, with the use of self-reported measurements for pain, physical function and depression with the following evaluation tools: Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], Knee Society Scoring system [KSS], Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, [CES-D10] and visual analog scale [VAS] for pain). General linear modelling for repeated measures was used to evaluate the effect of each independent variable including clinical and sociodemographic data. Differences between groups at different time points were tested by the independent samples t-test. RESULTS Of the 224 eligible patients, 204 (162 females, mean age 69.2) were included in the analysis. Response rate at one year was 90%. At 6 weeks after surgery, despite improvement in pain and alleviation of the depressive mood, the physical function remained less satisfactory. Females presented lower scores in terms of quality of life, both preoperatively and 6 weeks after TKA. Significant improvement was already experienced at 3 months postoperatively. According to WOMAC, KSS, CES-D10 and pain VAS scores the Qol was significantly improved 12 months after TKA (P < 0.001).

Both classical and biochemical complementation analysis leads us to predict that the majority of MHV-A59 ORF1a replicase gene products (non-structural proteins nsp1Cnsp11) form a single complementation group (cistron1) while the replicase gene products encoded in ORF1b (non-structural proteins nsp12Cnsp16) are able to function in trans and comprise at least three, and possibly five, further complementation groups (cistrons IICVI). Also, we have identified mutations in the non-structural proteins nsp 4, nsp5, nsp10, nsp12, nsp14, and nsp16 that are responsible for the ts phenotype of eight MHV-A59 mutants, which allows us to conclude that these proteins are essential for the assembly of a functional replicase-transcriptase complex. Finally, our analysis of viral RNA synthesis in ts mutant virus-infected cells allows us to discriminate three phenotypes with regard to the inability of specific mutants to synthesize viral RNA at the non-permissive temperature. Mutant LA ts6 appeared to be defective in continuing negative-strand synthesis, mutant Alb ts16 appeared to form negative strands but these were not utilized for positive-strand RNA synthesis, and mutant Alb ts22 was defective in the elongation of both positive- and negative-strand RNA.

Collected parameters were age, sex, body mass index, COVID-19-related symptoms, patients comorbidities, surgical procedure, personal protection equipment (PPE) used in operating rooms, rate of postoperative infection among healthcare staff and complications, within 30-postoperative days. 68 patients, who underwent surgery, resulted COVID-19-positive in the perioperative period. Symptomatic patients were 63 (92.5%). Fever was the main symptom in 36 (52.9%) patients, followed by dyspnoea (26.5%) and cough (13.2%). We recorded 22 (32%) intensive care unit admissions, 23 (33.8%) postoperative pulmonary complications and 15 (22%) acute respiratory distress syndromes. As regards the ten postoperative deaths (14.7%), 6 cases were related to surgical complications. One surgeon, one scrub nurse and two circulating nurses were infected after surgery due to the lack of specific PPE. We reported less surgery-related pulmonary complications and mortality in Sars-CoV-2-infected patients, than in literature. Emergent and oncological surgery should not be postponed, but it is mandatory to use full PPE, and to adopt preoperative screenings and strategies that mitigate the detrimental effect of pulmonary complications, mostly responsible for mortality.","output":"Complications and mortality in a cohort of patients undergoing emergency and elective surgery with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection: an Italian multicenter study.

It is thus essential to ensure observability to understand these microservice systems behaviors and troubleshoot their problems. As an important means to achieve the observability, distributed tracing and analysis is known to be challenging. While many companies have started implementing distributed tracing and analysis for microservice systems, it is not clear whether existing approaches fulfill the required observability. In this article, we present our industrial survey on microservice tracing and analysis through interviewing developers and operation engineers of microservice systems from ten companies. Our survey results offer a number of findings. For example, large microservice systems commonly adopt a tracing and analysis pipeline, and the implementations of the pipeline in different companies reflect different tradeoffs among a variety of concerns. Visualization and statistic-based metrics are the most common means for trace analysis, while more advanced analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining are seldom used. Microservice tracing and analysis is a new big data problem for software engineering, and its practices breed new challenges and opportunities.","output":"Enjoy your observability: an industrial survey of microservice tracing and analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had rapidly spread since FEB/MAR 2020. Policy to prevent transmission of COVDI-19 resulted in multi-dimensional impact on social interaction. We aimed to develop a beneficial survey tool with favorable quality and availability, the Societal Influences Survey Questionnaire (SISQ), to evaluate social influences on people during this pandemic. The SISQ was developed with 15 items and 4-point Likert scales consisting of five factors. These include social distance, social anxiety, social desirability, social information, and social adaptation. Construct validity and reliability were performed to verify the SISQ. A total of 1912 Taiwanese were recruited. The results demonstrated that the SISQ has acceptable reliability, with Cronbachs alphas ranging between 0.57 and 0.76. The SISQ accounted for 58.86% and satisfied the requirement of KaiserCMayerCOlkinvalues (0.78) and significant Bartletts Test of sphericity. Moreover, the confirmatory factor analysis fit indices also indicated the adequacy of the model. As for multiple comparison, females scored higher than males in factor of social distance. Unemployed participants and those without partners scored higher in several domains of factors. The survey method and survey instrument prove reliable and valuable, also providing different categories of assessment results regarding social influences and their impacts.

The evolution and spread of SARS has resulted in an international effort coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). We have formulated a discrete mathematical model to investigate the transmission of SARS and determined the basic reproductive number for this model to use as a threshold to determine the asymptotic behavior of the model. The dependence of the basic reproductive number on epidemic parameters has been studied. The parameters of the model have been estimated on the basis of statistical data and numerical simulations have been carried out to describe the transmission process for SARS in China. The simulation results matches the statistical data well and indicate that early quarantine and a high quarantine rate are crucial to the control of SARS.","output":"A discrete epidemic model for SARS transmission and control in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in early 2020, Mongolia implemented rapid emergency measures and did not report local transmission until November 2020. We conducted a national seroprevalence survey to monitor the burden of SARS-CoV-2 in Mongolia in the months surrounding the first local transmission. METHODS: During October-December 2020, participants were randomly selected using age stratification and invited for interviews and blood samples at local primary health centres. We screened for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, followed by two-step quantitative SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology tests for positive samples. Weighted and test-adjusted seroprevalences were estimated. We used chi-square, Fisher's exact and other tests to identify variables associated with seropositivity. FINDINGS: A total of 5000 subjects were enrolled. We detected SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in 72 samples. Crude seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 144% (95%CI,121-167). Population weighted and test-adjusted seroprevalences were 136% (95%CI,111-163) and 145% (95%CI,111-163), respectively. Age, sex, geographical, and occupational factors were not associated with seropositivity (p>005). Symptoms and signs within past 3 months and seropositivity were not associated at the time of the survey (p>005). INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Mongolia was low in the first year of the pandemic potentially due to strong public health measures, including border restrictions, educational facilities closure, earlier adoption of mask-wearing and others. Our findings suggest large-scale community transmission could not have occurred up to November 2020 in Mongolia. Additional serosurveys are needed to monitor the local pandemic dynamic and estimate how far from herd immunity Mongolia will be following-up with vaccination programme in 2021 and 2022.

Compliance with these restrictions is vital and depends greatly on the level of trust in the institutions central to their development and implementation. The objectives of this study were to assess: (1) the effects of the Dutch lockdown measures imposed in March 2020 on trust in government and trust in science; and (2) whether these differ across social groups. We draw on unique data from the high-quality Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel, which comprises a true probability sample of Dutch households (average participation rate: 80.4%). Our data were collected on an ongoing basis from December 2017 to March 2020 (n = 2219). Using the implementation of lockdown measures in mid-March as a natural experiment, we employed difference-in-differences analyses to assess the causal effect of the Dutch lockdown measures on trust in government and trust in science. We estimated that the imposition of the measures caused an 18% increase (95% confidence interval (CI):15%-21%)) in trust in government and a 6% increase (95% CI: 4%-8%) in trust in science. The impact on trust in government was greater among the participants aged 65 and older and those with poor self-assessed health, although the relevant CIs were wide and, in the case of self-assessed health, included the null. No differential effects were observed for trust in science. Our study indicates that the strict public-health measures imposed in the Netherlands during an acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic generated trust in the institutions involved in drafting and implementing them, especially among those with a higher risk of serious health outcomes. This suggests that, to prevent a major public-health crisis, people appreciate firm government intervention during the acute phase of an infectious disease pandemic.","output":"Dutch COVID-19 lockdown measures increased trust in government and trust in science: A difference-in-differences analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic posed a dramatic challenge to practically all heads of government: the measures they took had an enormous impact on the lives and livelihoods of their citizens.

Early research has demonstrated that parents have had less access to their infants in the hospital due to restrictions on parental presence secondary to the pandemic. It is unknown how parents have perceived their experiences in the NICU since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to describe the lived experience of parents who had an infant in the NICU in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to inform healthcare providers and policy makers for future development of policies and care planning. METHODS: The study design was a qualitative description of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on parents experiences of having an infant in the NICU. Free-text responses to open-ended questions were collected as part of a multi-method study of parents experiences of the NICU during the first six months of the pandemic. Participants from the United States were recruited using social media platforms between the months of May and July of 2020. Data were analyzed using a reflexive thematic approach. FINDINGS: Free-text responses came from 169 parents from 38 different states in the United States. Three broad themes emerged from the analysis: (1) parents NICU experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic were emotionally isolating and overwhelming, (2) policy changes restricting parental presence created disruptions to the family unit and limited family-centered care, and (3) interactions with NICU providers intensified or alleviated emotional distress felt by parents. A unifying theme of experiences of emotional distress attributed to COVID-19 circumstances ran through all three themes. CONCLUSIONS: Parents of infants in the NICU during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic experienced emotional struggles, feelings of isolation, lack of family-centered care, and deep disappointment with system-level decisions. Moving forward, parents need to be considered essential partners in the development of policies concerning care of and access to their infants.

The redox status is responsible for maintenance of cell signaling and cell stress adaptation. Physiological roles of redox homeostasis maintenance in avian species, including poultry, have received limited attention and are poorly characterized. However, for the last 5 years, this topic attracted much attention, and a range of publications covered some related aspects. In fact, transcription factor Nrf2 was shown to be a master regulator of antioxidant defenses via activation of various vitagenes and other protective molecules to maintain redox homeostasis in cells/tissues. It was shown that Nrf2 is closely related to another transcription factor, namely, NF-B, responsible for control of inflammation; however, its roles in poultry have not yet been characterized. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe a current view on NF-B functioning in poultry with a specific emphasis to its nutritional modulation under various stress conditions. In particular, on the one hand, it has been shown that, in many stress conditions in poultry, NF-B activation can lead to increased synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines leading to systemic inflammation.

We sought to examine the association of patient-to-intensivist ratio (PIR) with hospital mortality in Australia/New Zealand (ANZ) ICUs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of adult admissions to ANZ ICUs (August 2016CJune 2018) using two cohorts: narrow, based on previously used criteria including restriction to ICUs with a single daytime intensivist; and broad, refined by individual ICU daytime staffing information. The exposure was average daily PIR and the outcome was hospital mortality. We used summary statistics to describe both cohorts and multilevel multivariable logistic regression models to assess the association of PIR with mortality. In each, PIR was modeled using restricted cubic splines to allow for non-linear associations. The broad cohort model included non-PIR physician and non-physician staffing covariables. RESULTS: The narrow cohort of 27,380 patients across 67 ICUs (predicted mortality: median 1.2% [IQR 0.4C1.4%]; mean 5.9% [sd 13.2%]) had a median PIR of 10.1 (IQR 7C14). The broad cohort of 91,206 patients across 73 ICUs (predicted mortality: 1.9% [0.6C6.5%]; 7.6% [14.9%]) had a median PIR of 7.8 (IQR 5.8C10.2).

METHODS: We conducted a selective literature review to identify the indicators used and to derive appropriate definitions. We calculated crude and age-adjusted indicators for selected countries. RESULTS: The proportion of deaths (case fatality proportion [CFP]; number of deaths/ total number of cases) is commonly used to estimate the severity of a disease. If the CFP is used for purposes of comparison, the existence of heterogeneity in the detection and registration of cases and deaths has to be taken into account. In the early phase of an epidemic, when case numbers rise rapidly, the CFP suffers from bias. For these reasons, variants have been proposed: the \\"confirmed CFP\\" (number of deaths/total number of confirmed cases), and the \\"delay-adjusted CFP,\\" which considers the delay between infection with the disease and death from the disease. The indicator mortality (number of deaths/total population) has at first sight the advantage of being based on a defined denominator, the total population. During the outbreak of a disease, however, the cumulative deaths rise while the total population remains stable. The phase of the epidemic therefore has to be considered when using this indicator. In this context, R0 and R(t) are important indicators. R0 estimates the maximum rate of spread of a disease in a population, while R(t) describes the dynamics of the epidemic at a given time. Age-adjusted analysis of the CFP shows that the differences between countries decrease but do not dis - appear completely.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the neurological decline of patients with dementia and the caregivers' burden during the pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study. Caregivers of dementia patients following in the outpatient clinic were included. A structured telephone interview composed of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Beck Depression (BDI) and Anxiety (BAI) Inventories to address cognitive, behavioral, and functional changes associated with social distancing during the Sars-Cov-2 outbreak. Patients were divided in two groups according to caregivers' report: with perceived Altered Cognition (AC) and Stable Cognition (SC). RESULTS: A total of 58 patients (median age: 57 years [21-87], 58.6%females) and caregivers (median age: 76.5 years [55-89], 79.3%females) were included. Cognitive decline was shown by most patients (53.4%), as well as behavioral symptoms (48.3%), especially apathy/depression (24.1%), and functional decline (34.5%). The AC group (na??=a??31) presented increased behavioral (67.7%versus 25.9%, pa??=a??0.002) and functional (61.3%versus 3.7%, pa??<a??0.001) changes when compared to the SC group. In the AC group, ZBI, BDI, NPI-Q caregiver distress, and NPI-Q patient's severity of symptoms scores were worse than the SC group (pa??<a??0.005 for all).

Creating accurate and explainable mortality prediction models helps identify the most critical risk factors in the patients survival/death status and early detect the most in-need patients. This study proposes a highly accurate and efficient machine learning model for predicting ICU mortality status upon discharge using the information available during the first 24 hours of admission. The most important features in mortality prediction are identified, and the effects of changing each feature on the prediction are studied. We used supervised machine learning models and illness severity scoring systems to benchmark the mortality prediction. We also implemented a combination of SHAP, LIME, partial dependence, and individual conditional expectation plots to explain the predictions made by the best-performing model (CatBoost). We proposed E-CatBoost, an optimized and efficient patient mortality prediction model, which can accurately predict the patients discharge status using only ten input features. We used eICU-CRD v2.0 to train and validate the models; the dataset contains information on over 200,000 ICU admissions. The patients were divided into twelve disease groups, and models were fitted and tuned for each group. The models predictive performance was evaluated using the area under a receiver operating curve (AUROC). The AUROC scores were 0.86 [std:0.02] to 0.92 [std:0.02] for CatBoost and 0.83 [std:0.02] to 0.91 [std:0.03] for E-CatBoost models across the defined disease groups; if measured over the entire patient population, their AUROC scores were 7 to 18 and 2 to 12 percent higher than the baseline models, respectively. Based on SHAP explanations, we found age, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urine nitrogen, and creatinine level as the most critical cross-disease features in mortality predictions.","output":"E-CatBoost: An efficient machine learning framework for predicting ICU mortality using the eICU Collaborative Research Database"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Onychomycosis is the most common nail condition seen in clinical practice, with significant impact on quality of life.

In times of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, patients underwent 6MWTs wearing a surgical mask in ambulatory care. We investigated the impact of wearing a mask on 6-minute walk distances (6MWDs). METHOD: 6MWDs of 64 patients with end-stage lung diseases wearing an oronasal surgical mask were retrospectively compared to previously investigated 6MWDs of the same cohort, in a pre-COVID-19 pandemic era, without wearing a mask. Four patients were excluded due to a primary vascular disease, 29 patients due to clinically unstable pulmonary functions, and 1 patient due to a psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: The median age of the patients included was 55 (46-58) years; 15 (48%) were male. Ten (32.2%) were on the Eurotransplant lung transplant waiting list with a median LAS of 34.3 (31.9-36.2). Twenty (64.5%) patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, 7 (22.6%) had interstitial lung diseases, and 4 (12.9%) had other end-stage lung diseases. The mean 6MWD without versus with wearing a mask was 306.9 (101.9) versus 305.7 (103.8) m, with a mean difference of -1.19 m (95% confidence interval -13.4 to 11.03). The observed difference is statistically equivalent to zero (p < 0.001). No significant differences in 6MWDs were observed between the clinical groups.

However, newly emerging variants may affect their protective efficacy. Decreased efficacy of the Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca vaccines against B.1.351 has been reported. The spread of variants creates a tremendous challenge for the prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic via vaccination. Several response strategies, including accelerating massive rollouts of current vaccines, increasing vaccine immunogenicity by increasing vaccination doses, and accelerating next-generation vaccines against variants, have been suggested.

The aim of this study was to assess the co-incidence of cirrhosis, alcohol abuse, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and fatty liver disease in patients in the population of north-eastern Poland, to analyse the usefulness of -fetoprotein (AFP) in the diagnosis of HCC and to assess the effectiveness of HCC treatment in this group. Material and methods The study involved 104 patients diagnosed with HCC. The age, sex, comorbidities, HCC risk factors and levels of AFP were analysed. The effect of antiviral therapy of HCV and HBV on HCC development was observed and the effectiveness of therapies used in the treatment of HCC was assessed. Results Over 90% of patients with HCC were older than 45 years. The incidence of HCC was higher in men than in women. Patients with HCC were also diagnosed with cirrhosis (72%), alcohol abuse (35%), HCV infection (35%), HBV infection (24%), and fatty liver disease (13%). HCC developed in 9/25 (36%) patients positive for HBV despite effective antiviral therapy. The highest AFP levels were found in HBV-positive patients. The mean survival time was 19 months for partial hepatectomy and 16 months for thermal ablation. Conclusions The main predisposing factor for HCC is cirrhosis, followed by alcohol abuse and infection with HCV. Effective antiviral therapy for HBV does not prevent the development of HCC in all cases. Since 29% of patients were disqualified from HCC treatment due to an advanced stage of cancer, it indicates insufficient screening for HCC.

DESIGN: Vitamin D and omega 3 trial (VITAL), a nationwide, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial with a two-by-two factorial design. SETTING: Nationwide in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: 25 871 participants, consisting of 12 786 men 50 years and 13 085 women 55 years at enrollment. INTERVENTIONS: Vitamin D (2000 IU/day) or matched placebo, and omega 3 fatty acids (1000 mg/day) or matched placebo. Participants self-reported all incident autoimmune diseases from baseline to a median of 5.3 years of follow-up; these diseases were confirmed by extensive medical record review. Cox proportional hazard models were used to test the effects of vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids on autoimmune disease incidence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint was all incident autoimmune diseases confirmed by medical record review: rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, autoimmune thyroid disease, psoriasis, and all others. RESULTS: 25 871 participants were enrolled and followed for a median of 5.3 years. 18 046 self-identified as non-Hispanic white, 5106 as black, and 2152 as other racial and ethnic groups. The mean age was 67.1 years. For the vitamin D arm, 123 participants in the treatment group and 155 in the placebo group had a confirmed autoimmune disease (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99, P=0.05). In the omega 3 fatty acids arm, 130 participants in the treatment group and 148 in the placebo group had a confirmed autoimmune disease (0.85, 0.67 to 1.08, P=0.19). Compared with the reference arm (vitamin D placebo and omega 3 fatty acid placebo; 88 with confirmed autoimmune disease), 63 participants who received vitamin D and omega 3 fatty acids (0.69, 0.49 to 0.96), 60 who received only vitamin D (0.68, 0.48 to 0.94), and 67 who received only omega 3 fatty acids (0.74, 0.54 to 1.03) had confirmed autoimmune disease. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation for five years, with or without omega 3 fatty acids, reduced autoimmune disease by 22%, while omega 3 fatty acid supplementation with or without vitamin D reduced the autoimmune disease rate by 15% (not statistically significant).

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of parturients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection disease (COVID-19). Their epidemiologic history, chest computed tomography scans, laboratory measurements, and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity were evaluated. We also recorded the patients demographic and clinical characteristics, anesthesia and surgery-related data, maternal and neonatal complications, as well as the health status of the involved medical staff. RESULTS: The clinical characteristics of 17 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those previously reported in non-pregnant adult patients. All of the 17 patients underwent Cesarean delivery with anesthesia performed according to standardized anesthesia/surgery procedures. Fourteen of the patients underwent continuous epidural anesthesia with 12 experiencing significant intraoperative hypotension. Three patients received general anesthesia with tracheal intubation because emergency surgery was needed. Three of the parturients are still recovering from their Cesarean delivery and are receiving in-hospital treatment for COVID-19. Three neonates were born prematurely. There were no deaths or serious neonatal asphyxia events. All neonatal SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were negative. No medical staff were infected throughout the patient care period. CONCLUSIONS: Both epidural and general anesthesia were safely used for Cesarean delivery in the parturients with COVID-19.

At Oslo University Hospital entry to NICU was denied to all except healthy mothers in March 2020. The absolute access ban for fathers lasted for 10 weeks. The aim of this study was to explore parental experiences with an infant hospitalized in the NICU during this absolute visitation ban period. METHODS: We invited post discharge all parents of surviving infants that had been hospitalized for at least 14 days to participate. They were interviewed during autumn 2020 using an explorative semi-structured interview approach. Data were analyzed via inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nine mothers and four fathers participated. The COVID-19 regulations strongly impacted the parents experiences of their stay. The fathers limited access felt life-impacting. Parents struggled to become a family and raised their voices to be heard. Not being able to experience parenthood together led to emotional loneliness. The fathers struggled to learn how to care for their infant. The regulations might lead to a postponed attachment. On the other hand, of positive aspect the parents got some quietness. Being hospitalized during this first wave was experienced as exceptional and made parents seeking alliances by other parents. Social media was used to keep in contact with the outside world. CONCLUSIONS: The regulations had strong negative impact on parental experiences during the NICU hospitalization.

However, the association of blood groups with susceptibility to COVID-19 infections or related death are limited. In the present report, we performed an epidemiological investigation in the Indian population to decipher the importance of blood groups concerning susceptibility or mortality in COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on COVID-19 infection and mortality was obtained from the website of the Government of India. Prevalence of ABO blood groups in different states and union territories of India were searched using different databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar. Relevant articles were downloaded, and data were extracted. Spearman's rank coefficient analysis was employed to study the correlation between blood group frequencies and COVID-19 infection or mortality rate. RESULTS: A significant inverse correlation was observed between the frequency of O blood group and the COVID-19 mortality rate (Spearman r=-0.36, P=0.03), indicating a possible protective role of O blood group against COVID-19 related death. In contrast, the prevalence of blood group B was positively correlated with COVID-19 death/million (Spearman r=0.67, P<0.0001), suggesting B blood type as a deleterious factor in COVID-19 infection.

METHODS: A putative ARDS-suppressing drug Keguan-1 was first developed and then evaluated by a randomized, controlled two-arm trial. The two arms of the trial consist of a control therapy (alpha interferon inhalation, 50 g twice daily; and lopinavir/ritonavir, 400 and 100 mg twice daily, respectively) and a testing therapy (control therapy plus Keguan-1 19.4 g twice daily) by random number table at 1:1 ratio with 24 cases each group. After 2-week treatment, adverse events, time to fever resolution, ARDS development, and lung injury on newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients were assessed. RESULTS: An analysis of the data from the first 30 participants showed that the control arm and the testing arm did not exhibit any significant differences in terms of adverse events. Based on this result, the study was expanded to include a total of 48 participants (24 cases each arm). The results show that compared with the control arm, the testing arm exhibited a significant improvement in time to fever resolution (P=0.035), and a significant reduction in the development of ARDS (P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: Keguan-1-based integrative therapy was safe and superior to the standard therapy in suppressing the development of ARDS in COVID-19 patients.

COVID-19 skin lesions ? taste disorder Symptoms: Sore throat Medication:  Clinical Procedure:  Specialty: Otolaryngology OBJECTIVE: Unusual clinical course BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that spread from China is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The head and neck region can be variably affected in adult patients, and taste and smell disorders are typical manifestations. However, pediatric clinical signs are less severe, making the onset diagnosis challenging to interpret. The variability of nasal olfactory symptoms in children and adolescents is intertwined with possible warning signs, including gastrointestinal, ocular, or dermato-logical symptoms. We present a case involving a 15-year-old boy with clinically confirmed COVID-19 who had late-onset rash and transient taste and smell disorders. CASE REPORT: The boys clinical history revealed that a family member was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the preceding 3 days, the boys eating habits had changed; he perceived a metallic taste while eating and had a loss of appetite. He also had erythematous skin lesions on the lower limbs for the 2 previous days. A sore throat, nasal congestion, and a runny nose were reported on head and neck examination. A real-time polymerase chain reaction test was positive, confirming the initial diagnostic hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in children and adolescents can be asymptomatic, but it can also occur with fever, dry cough, fatigue, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Due to the unique immune characteristics of pediatric and adolescent patients, the correct interpretation of the gustatory and skin symptoms associated with specific laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to the most appropriate management and supportive care.","output":"A Case of COVID-19 with Late-Onset Rash and Transient Loss of Taste and Smell in a 15-Year-Old Boy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The global spread of COVID-19 has led to a wide range of responses from governments, including in the European Union (EU). Measures involve travel restrictions, school closings, bans on public gatherings, emergency investments in healthcare, contact tracing and social welfare. However, responses have varied in scope, stringency and timing. The aim of this study was to analyse government response measures in the EU and differences across EU countries, in 2020. Methods Using Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker indices (Stringency Index, Containment and Health Index, Economic Support Index, Overall Government Response Index;all scored 1-100), estimates were analysed for the EU and each country, in 2020. Results While the Stringency, Overall Government Response and Containment and Health indices were generally in line with COVID-19 incidence progression (peak in April-May, decrease in the summer, new increase in the fall and second peak in November-December), for all EU countries, the Economic Support Index showed heterogeneous patterns between countries. In the EU, the Stringency Index ranged from 1,85 to 96,30 (median:54,63;SD:21,07), the highest median in Ireland and the lowest Croatia. The Containment and Health Index ranged from 1,92 to 84,29 (median:52,88;SD:17,77), again with Ireland showing the highest median, but this time, Estonia the lowest. For the Economic Support Index, ranging from 12,50 to 100 (median:75,00;SD:20,36), Cyprus had the highest median, and Germany the lowest. The Overall Government Response Index ranged from 1,67 to 83,78 (median:55,83;SD:18,36), with the highest median in Cyprus and the lowest in Estonia. Conclusions There was wide variation in response measures across the EU countries, in 2020. The Economic Support Index showed quite a different pattern compared to the other ones. Understanding these trends and patterns allows for mutual learning and better preparedness for future pandemics. Key messages There was wide variation in response measures across the EU in 2020, especially in economic support.

DESIGN Cross-sectional survey study. Participants and setting: Infection preventionists in acute care hospitals in the United States (US), the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Japan. METHODS Data collected from hospital surveys distributed between 2015 and 2017 were evaluated to determine the use of practices to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), central-line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Descriptive statistics were used to examine hospital characteristics and the percentage of hospitals reporting regular use of each infection prevention practice. RESULTS Survey response rates were 59% in the United States, 65% in the Netherlands, 77% in Switzerland, and 65% in Japan. Several recommended practices were used in the majority of hospitals: aseptic catheter insertion and maintenance (CAUTI), maximum sterile barrier precautions (CLABSI), semirecumbent patient positioning (VAP), and contact precautions and routine daily cleaning (CDI). Other prevention practices for CAUTI and VAP were used less frequently, particularly in Swiss and Japanese hospitals. Established surveillance systems were also lacking in Dutch, Swiss and Japanese hospitals.

This paper explores how natural processes could give rise to this puzzling combination of characteristics. Our model is based on available data regarding the emergence of historic influenzas, early COVID-19 cases and spreading, the microbiome of permafrost, long-distance airborne transport of viruses reaching stratospheric levels, ultraviolet immunosuppression, sunlight variations, weather patterns, Arctic thawing, and global warming. Atmospheric conveyance is supported by hemispheric distribution disparities, ties of COVID-19 cases to air pollution particulate concentrations, and contemporaneous animal infections. The following sequence is proposed: (1) virus emergence after hot Arctic summers, predominantly near solar irradiance maxima or involving wildfires, indicates release of large amounts of ancient viruses during extensive permafrost melting, which are then incorporated in autumn polar air circulation, where cold storage and little sunlight permit survival. (2) Pandemics onset in winter to spring at rather few locations: from climate data on Wuhan, emergence occurs where the North Polar Jet stream hovers while intersecting warmer, moist air, producing rain which deposits particulates with the viral harvest on a vulnerable human population. (3) Spring and summer increases in COVID-19 cases link to high solar irradiance, implicating ultraviolet immune suppression as one means of amplification. (4) Viruses multiplied by infected humans at close range being incorporated in atmospheric circulation explains rapid global spread, periodic case surges (waves), and multi-year durations. Pollution and wind geography affect uptake and re-distribution. Our model can be tested, e.g., against permafrost stored in laboratories as well as Artic air samples, and suggests mitigating actions.","output":"Possible Roles of Permafrost Melting, Atmospheric Transport, and Solar Irradiance in the Development of Major Coronavirus and Influenza Pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent growing evidences suggest that body weight (Bwt) variability, a repeated loss and regain of weight within a specific period, causes metabolic disturbances and can be a marker for poor homeostasis. Although there have been many studies about the association between Bwt variability and various health status, its association with the incidence of dementia among elderly people has not been examined. Methods: We performed a retrospective elderly cohort study from 19,987 participants with mean age 73 years old in the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We examined the risk of incident dementia, including Alzheimer's dementia and vascular dementia, according to the quartile of Bwt variability, represented as coefficient of variation (Bwt-CV), SD (Bwt-SD), and variability independent of the mean (Bwt-VIM). Results: In fully adjusted model, the group with the highest Bwt variability (Bwt-VIM Q4) showed an increased risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.206-1.603) and Alzheimer's dementia (HR 1.46, CI 1.240-1.724) compared to the lowest quartile (Bwt-VIM Q1). We also found that subjects with the highest Bwt variability (Q4) and underweight BMI had a significantly increased risk of developing dementia (HR 1.994, 95% CI 1.302-3.054), while subjects with low Bwt variability (Q1 and Q2) and obese BMI had decreased risk of dementia (HR 0.664, 95% CI 0.505-0.872 and HR 0.648, 95% CI 0.493-0.852, respectively) compared to reference group (lowest Bwt variability (Q1) with normal baseline BMI). The effect of Bwt variability on the incidence of dementia was more prominent in subjects <75 years old and abnormal BMI groups (P for interaction < 0.05).

In north Cyprus, vaccine distribution started with CoronaVac followed by BNT162b2, and ChAdOx1 vaccines. An option to obtain a third booster dose with BNT162b2 or CoronaVac was later offered to people fully inoculated with CoronaVac. There are few simultaneous and comparative real-world antibody data for these three vaccines as well as boosters after CoronaVac vaccination. Our study was aimed at evaluating antibody responses after these vaccination schemes. METHODS: We did a prospective, longitudinal population-based study to measure SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG concentrations, assessed by assaying blood samples collected, in participants in north Cyprus who had received the BNT162b2, ChAdOx1, or CoronaVac vaccine at 1 month and 3 months after the second dose. Participants were recruited when they voluntarily came to the laboratory for testing after vaccination, solicited from health-care access points, or from the general population. We also evaluated antibody responses 1 month after a booster dose of BNT162b2 or CoronaVac after primary CoronaVac regimen. Demographics, baseline characteristics, vaccination reactions, and percentage of antibody responders were collected by phone interviews or directly from the laboratory summarised by vaccine and age group. Antibody levels were compared between groups over time by parametric and non-parametric methods. FINDINGS: Recruitment, follow-up, and data collection was done between March 1 and Sept 30, 2021. BNT162b2 induced the highest seropositivity and anti-spike RBD IgG antibody titres, followed by ChAdOx1, and then by CoronaVac. In addition, the rate of decline of antibodies was fastest with CoronaVac, followed by ChAdOx1, and then by BNT162b2. For the older age group, the rate of seropositivity at 3 months after the second dose was 100% for BNT162b2, 90% for ChAdOx1, and 60% for CoronaVac. In the multivariate repeated measures model, lower antibody titres were also significantly associated with male sex, older age, and time since vaccination. Boosting a two-dose CoronaVac regimen at 6 months with a single BNT162b2 dose led to significantly increased titres of IgG compared with boosting with CoronaVac; for the 60 years and older age group, the geometric mean fold rise in antibody titre after the booster relative to 1 month post-baseline was 79 (95% CI 58C108) in the BNT162b2 boost group versus 28 (16C50) in the CoronaVac group. INTERPRETATION: These longitudinal data can help shape vaccination strategies. Given the low antibody titres and fast decline in the CoronaVac group in individuals 60 years or older, more potent vaccine options could be considered as the primary vaccination or booster dose in these high-risk populations to sustain antibody responses for longer. FUNDING: Crowdfunded in north Cyprus.","output":"Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike receptor binding domain IgG antibody responses after CoronaVac, BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 COVID-19 vaccines, and a single booster dose: a prospective, longitudinal population-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and aim: The aim of this study is to assess if people who chose to receive the preventive Natural Bioenergetics (NB) COVID-19 treatment would experience safely a strong reduction in frequency and severity of COVID-19 major symptoms (fever, cough, and shortness of breath) compared to the general population.

We aimed to describe trajectories of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak compared to before the outbreak, and to determine if trajectories were modified by pre-pandemic loneliness, poor sleep quality and mental health problems. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study with 1836 Swedish university students entering the study before 13 March 2020, the onset of the pandemic, with follow-ups within three (FU1) and six months (FU2) of the outbreak. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to estimate mean differences in symptom levels over time-periods, and to estimate potential effect modifications. RESULTS: We found small differences in mean levels of the depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) over time. Compared to before the pandemic, depression increased by 0.25 points of 21 (95% CI: 0.04 to 0.45) at FU1 and decreased by 0.75/21 (95% CI:-0.97 to -0.53) at FU2.

No study has shown a definite transmission of COVID 19 through ocular mucosa or secretions. In summary, ocular manifestations in COVID 19 patients commonly comprise ocular surface symptoms. Although a low prevalence of ocular symptoms was encountered among patients infected by SARS CoV 2, it is imperative for all ophthalmologists to understand the full spectrum of COVID 19 symptoms or signs including those of the eyes as well as to adopt appropriate protective measures during clinical practice.","output":"Ocular manifestation, comorbidities, and detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 from conjunctiva in coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Most coal mine field application processes are carried out using empirical formulas because of the insufficient understanding of the fracture development law of the static blasting technology. This lack of understanding results in poor coal seam gas extraction. In this study, a stress-damage coupling model was established to investigate the construction parameters of the static blasting technology using COMSOL simulation software. Then, a stress-damage-seepage coupling model was designed to study the evolution of the fracture field (seepage field) during the static blasting process using realistic failure process analysis simulation software. Finally, the influencing factors and fracturing effects were analyzed comprehensively. The research results show the following. (1) Comparing the simulation results with previous field tests reveals that the seepage law of the numerical simulation of the static blasting technology is consistent with the field test results, verifying the rationality of the stress-damage-seepage coupling model. (2) The development of coal seam fractures is affected by the expansion pressure, elastic modulus, and guide hole arrangement; the guide hole arrangement can play a role in guiding the development direction of fractures and enhancing the effect of fracturing. (3) The coal body mainly experienced the following five stages of fracturing: coal body compaction, microdamage formation, microfracture formation, large fracture formation, and fracture propagation. In addition, because of the rapid release of soundless cracking agents during the large fracture formation stage, the gas flow decreased in a short time. (4) The static blasting technology causes the coal seam permeability coefficient to increase. Compared with conventional extraction, the effective influence radius in the horizontal direction increases by 5.1 times, and the effective influence radius in the vertical direction increases by approximately 3 times. The static blasting technology can increase the number of coal seam fractures and significantly reduce the coal seam gas pressure, thereby enhancing coal seam permeability and realizing safe coal mining.","output":"Coupling Model of Stress-Damage-Seepage and Its Application to Static Blasting Technology in Coal Mine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The role of an acute care surgery (ACS) service during the COVID-19 pandemic is not well established. METHODS: A retrospective review of the ACS service performance in an urban tertiary academic medical center. The study was performed between January and May 2020. The demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of patients treated by the ACS service 2 months prior to the COVID surge (pre-COVID group) and during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (surge group) were compared. RESULTS: Trauma and emergency general surgery volumes decreased during the surge by 38% and 57%, respectively; but there was a 64% increase in critically ill patients. The proportion of patients in the Department of Surgery treated by the ACS service increased from 40% pre-COVID to 67% during the surge. The ACS service performed 32% and 57% of all surgical cases in the Department of Surgery during the pre-COVID and surge periods, respectively. The ACS service managed 23% of all critically ill patients in the institution during the surge. Critically ill patients with and without confirmed COVID-19 infection treated by ACS and non-ACS intensive care units during the surge did not differ in demographics, indicators of clinical severity, or hospital mortality:13.4% vs. 13.5% (P = .99) for all critically ill patients; and 13.9% vs. 27.4% (P = .12) for COVID-19 critically ill patients.

Nicotinamide can be used to replenish cellular NAD+ supplies. We hypothesize that an insufficient cellular NAD+ supply is the root cause of metabolic shifts in macrophages. We assert that manipulation of nicotinamide pathways may correct deleterious immune responses.

This study evaluated the effect of the COVID-19 quarantine on dietary and alcohol consumption habits and body weight of Italian university students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey was carried out among university students than 18 years in July 2020. The online self-administered questionnaire included demographic and anthropometric data (reported weight and height), weight, and dietary habits changes during of the COVID-19 lockdown. RESULTS: A total of 520 respondents have been included in the study. A total of 393 (~76%) were female, 3.8% was obese, and the mean age was 23  4 years. Numerous students reported a change in their eating habits during the lockdown with an increase in consumption of chocolate (40%), ice cream, and desserts (34%), but most of all an increase of homemade bread and pasta (60%), pizza (47%), and homemade sweets (55%). The students also reported an increase of vegetables, fresh fruit, legumes, eggs, and coffee, but also of processed meat, fried foods, cheeses, butter, and sweet beverage, and a reduction in alcohol intake. The weight gain was observed in 43.8%, and males have greater weight gain than females (57% vs. 46%, respectively; P = 0.04). A greater increase in body weight was observed in obese as compared to those with normal weight (77% vs. 44%, respectively; P < 0.001).

Evidence suggests that sonification could be a viable strategy to maximize learning and rehabilitation. Recent studies investigated sonification of action observation, reporting beneficial effects, especially in Parkinson's disease. However, research on simulation training-a training regime based on action observation and motor imagery, in which actions are internally simulated, without physical execution-suggest that action observation alone is suboptimal, compared to the combined use of action observation and motor imagery. In this study, we explored the effects of sonified action observation and motor imagery on corticospinal excitability, as well as to evaluate the extent of practice-dependent plasticity induced by this training. Nineteen participants were recruited to complete a practice session based on combined and congruent action observation and motor imagery (AOMI) and physical imitation of the same action. Prior to the beginning, participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups, one group (nine participants) completed the practice block with sonified AOMI, while the other group (ten participants) completed the practice without extrinsic auditory information and served as control group. To investigate practice-induced plasticity, participants completed two auditory paired associative stimulation (aPAS) protocols, one completed after the practice block, and another one completed alone, without additional interventions, at least 7 days before the practice. After the practice block, both groups significantly increased their corticospinal excitability, but sonification did not exert additional benefits, compared to non-sonified conditions. In addition, aPAS significantly increased corticospinal excitability when completed alone, but when it was primed by a practice block, no modulatory effects on corticospinal excitability were found. It is possible that sonification of combined action observation and motor imagery may not be a useful strategy to improve corticospinal, but further studies are needed to explore its relationship with performance improvements. We also confirm the neuromodulatory effect of aPAS, but its interaction with audiomotor practice remain unclear.","output":"Does sonification of action simulation training impact corticospinal excitability and audiomotor plasticity?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For COVID-19 vaccination India has primarily relied on two private firms. During the second wave of the pandemic, when shortages were reported in some parts of the country, when desperate attempts were made to scale up production, when exports were suspended, the absence of the public sector was strongly felt. An obvious question that came up was why India with a long traditional of public sector vaccine manufacturing had to rely on only two private firms. While private vaccine manufacturers in India have made commendable progress in the last few decades, the public sector has lost its dominance and has now become a marginal player. This is not because of any inherent deficiencies of the public sector vaccine sector or lack of capabilities to deliver. The basic problem has been underinvestment and neglect by government. Particularly in situations where mass vaccination is required, it is critically important to ensure uninterrupted supplies of vaccines at affordable prices. To minimize the uncertainty associated with private sector investments, production and pricing, presence of a strong public sector is crucial. The government has aided the growth of the private sector.

Forty-two percent of patients with DRVI were ?4 years old. Fifty-eight percent of patients with DRVI had underlying chronic lung disease. DRVI was associated with upper respiratory tract illness; lower respiratory tract illness, including pneumonia; systemic influenza-like illnesses; and exacerbations of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. All of the common acute respiratory viruses were identified; picornaviruses and influenzavirus A were the most common. The rate of DRVI (11.6%) was highest in the epidemiological studies in which cell culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction were used together.

To define these models, we exploit a representation of the Wasserstein space closely related to its weak Riemannian structure, by mapping the data to a suitable linear space and using a metric projection operator to constrain the results in the Wasserstein space. By carefully choosing the tangent point, we are able to derive fast empirical methods, exploiting a constrained B-spline approximation. As a byproduct of our approach, we are also able to derive faster routines for previous work on PCA for distributions. By means of simulation studies, we compare our approaches to previously proposed methods, showing that our projected PCA has similar performance for a fraction of the computational cost and that the projected regression is extremely flexible even under misspecification. Several theoretical properties of the models are investigated and asymptotic consistency is proven.

Objective We aimed to characterize EoE and EGID patients who had COVID-19, assess severity of COVID-19 in the EoE/EGID population, and evaluate for COVID-19-induced EoE/EGID flares. Methods We established an online global registry collecting physician entered, de-identified data related to patient demographics, EoE/EGID disease features, comorbidities, and treatments, COVID-19 source of exposure, symptoms, illness severity, hospitalizations, and deaths. Results Ninety four cases were reported between March 2020 and April 2021 (median age 21 years (range 1.5-53); 73% male). Most had atopy (73%), and 80% had isolated EoE. Prior to COVID-19, the EoE/EGID activity was reported as clinical remission in 51 (54%) and moderate in 20 (21%). EoE/EGID treatments at the time of COVID-19 included PPIs 49(52%), swallowed/topical steroids 48(51%), and dietary elimination 34(36%). COVID-19 symptoms included cough (56%), fever (49%), anosmia (21%), and ageusia (22%). Most patients with COVID-19 had a mild course (70%), with 15% asymptomatic, 12% moderate, and 2% severe. Three patients were hospitalized, and no ICU admissions or deaths were reported. Mean time from first symptoms to resolution in symptomatic patients was 10 days (range 1-90). A single EGID flare was reported during COVID-19. Conclusions In a global EoE/EGID registry, relatively few COVID-19 cases have been reported. COVID-19 severity was comparable to the general population. Based on this registry it does not appear that EoE patients are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 infection or that COVID-19 leads to EGID flares.","output":"Eosinophilic Esophagitis Patients Are Not At Increased Risk of Severe COVID-19: A Report from a Global Registry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since late 2019, the outbreak of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide. As it is a newly emerged disease, many of its manifestations and complications are unknown to us. Cardiac involvement and arrhythmias are another aspect of the disease about which very little is known. CASE SUMMARY: A 71-year-old male patient presented at the Emergency Department complaining of fever, a dry cough, and dyspneoa. He was admitted due to these symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and a chest CT and PCR test confirmed the diagnosis. During admission, cardiac involvement was detected, i.e. second-degree atrioventricular block with intermittent left bundle branch block (LBBB) which progressed to fixed LBBB and eventually developed into atrial fibrillation/flutter with bradycardia. Both cardiac troponin and echocardiographic findings for detecting myocarditis were negative. We waited 14 days for resolution of atrioventricular block before permanent pacemaker implantation, but the condition still did not improve after the waiting period. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory infection but cardiac involvement is not uncommon in the course of the disease. Arrhythmia, during this infection, seems to be caused by an inflammatory response in the myocardium, electrolyte disturbances, and hypoxia; the course of the disease in our case study shows that the virus can preferentially and irreversibly involve the cardiac conduction system.","output":"A case report of a rare cardiac complication in novel coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases and a major cause of premature death in industrialized societies. A predisposing factor for essential hypertension is prehypertension: blood pressure (BP) values at rest that are at the higher end of the normal range. Abnormally enhanced cardiovascular responses to motor and emotional tasks have been found as predictors of essential hypertension. Yet, knowledge regarding the BP reaction to aversive stimuli and motor reaction in prehypertension is limited. METHODS: We compared the reaction to aversive and neutral stimuli inducing an emotional response (experiment 1) and to the isometric handgrip exercise (IHE) inducing a motor response (experiment 2), between prehypertensive and normotensive controls. BP reactions were measured and analyzed in a continuous fashion, in contrast to previous studies that averaged BP responses across blocks. We applied a multilevel B-spline model, a continuous analysis that enabled a better understanding of the BP time course and the detection of subtle differences between groups. RESULTS: In both tasks, we found that prehypertensive individuals showed enhanced DBP reactions compared with normotensive controls; prehypertensive individuals exhibited lower BP responses to aversive pictures and higher BP responses to the IHE. These results are in line with previous studies with healthy or hypertensive participants and suggest abnormalities already in the prehypertensive stage. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency and health risks related to prehypertension, understanding the autonomic reactions to emotional and motor stimuli in this population is of clinical and theoretical importance and could serve as a behavioural marker to identify at-risk groups.","output":"Abnormalities in emotional and motor reactions among young prehypertensive individuals: employing continuous blood pressure analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"People who initiated or continued regular exercise after a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation had a slightly lower risk of heart failure over three years of follow-up compared with those who took no exercise.

Previous studies have found that breastmilk exhibited potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is still unknown which component(s) in the breastmilk is responsible for its antiviral activity. Here, we identified Lactoferrin (LF), MUC1 and -Lactalbumin (-LA) from human breastmilk by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and in vitro confirmation that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed their antiviral activity using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system and transcription and replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles (trVLP) in the Huh7.5, Vero E6 and Caco-2-N cell lines. Additionally, we found that LF and MUC1 could inhibit viral attachment, entry and post-entry replication, while -LA just inhibit viral attachment and entry. Importantly, LF, MUC1 and -LA possess potent antiviral activities towards not only wild-type but also variants such as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma) and B.1.617.1 (kappa).

Responses were analysed thematically. RESULTS: The participants reported markedly decreasing their PA following the enactment of physical distancing measures. The inability to subsequently engage in regular PA was a source of frustration for participants. Interview analysis revealed two themes that contributed to the understanding of why these individuals felt they needed PA coaching to increase PA; namely, a desire for both listening support and PA self-regulation support. CONCLUSION: The individuals who decreased PA due to COVID-19 desired an autonomy-supportive counselling style, centred on listening support and self-regulatory support.

However, little is known as to how each of these two events have impacted the other. A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted to determine the impact of the pandemic on preparedness and response to natural disasters and the impact of past experiences with natural disasters in responding to the pandemic. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 representatives of 24 different community-based programs in southern Louisiana. Data were analyzed using procedures embedded in the Rapid Assessment Procedure C Informed Community Ethnography methodology, using techniques of immersion and crystallization and focused thematic analysis. Results: The pandemic has impacted the form and function of disaster preparedness, making it harder to plan for evacuations in event of a hurricane. Specific concerns included being able to see people in-person, providing food and other resources to residents who shelter in place, finding volunteers to assist in food distribution and other forms of disaster response, competing for funds to support disaster-related activities, developing new support infrastructures, and focusing on equity in disaster preparedness. However, several strengths based on disaster preparedness experience and capabilities were identified, including providing a framework for how to respond and adapt to COVID and integration of COVID response with their normal disaster preparedness activities.

The aim of our study was to investigate a potential temporal association between measures against COVID-19 in February-April 2020 and incidence of other infectious diseases reported to MSIS. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We compared the number of disease cases reported to MSIS during weeks 6-14 in 2020 with the median of cases reported in corresponding weeks during three previous years (2017-2019). RESULTS: Compared to the median of cases reported during corresponding weeks in three previous years, physicians and laboratories reported 47 % fewer cases (159 vs. 301) in week 12, 50 % fewer cases (131 vs. 261) in week 13, and 69 % fewer cases (77 vs. 252) in week 14. There was a reduction in the number of notifications of all included disease groups. INTERPRETATION: The observed decline in reporting of diseases other than COVID-19 may indicate a reduced risk of communicable diseases due to comprehensive advice and the requirement for social distancing. However, it is also possible that the sensitivity of the surveillance system was affected by increased resource use on COVID-19 cases management.","output":"Registrerte meldingspliktige smittsomme sykdommer under covid-19-responsen./ Registrerte meldingspliktige smittsomme sykdommer under covid-19-responsen./ Reporting of notifiable infectious diseases during the COVID-19 response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The G-quadruplex structure is a highly conserved drug target for preventing infection of several human pathogens.

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted on peripheral blood CD4(+) T cells. Thousands of differentially expressed genes were identified in both asthma groups compared with heathy controls. The expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes associated with IFN-related signaling pathways was specifically affected in obese asthmatics, while the gap junction and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand binding pathways were enriched in both asthma groups. Furthermore, obesity gene markers were also upregulated in CD4(+) T cells from obese asthmatics compared with the two other groups. Additionally, the enriched genes of the three abovementioned pathways showed a unique correlation pattern with various laboratory and clinical parameters. The specific activation of IFN-related signaling and viral infection pathways might provide a novel view of the molecular mechanisms associated with the development of the low type-2 obesity-associated asthma phenotype, which is a step ahead in the development of new stratified therapeutic approaches.","output":"Differential Regulation of Interferon Signaling Pathways in CD4(+) T Cells of the Low Type-2 Obesity-Associated Asthma Phenotype"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: In addition to examining the pathophysiology and treatment of the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), it is very important to investigate the psychological effects of the pandemic on healthcare workers.

Participants answered the questionnaire applied via the internet and sent the answers in the same way. For each participant, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (phq-9, range 0-27), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (gad-7, range 0-21), Insomnia Severity Index (isi, range 0-28) criteria are respectively depression, anxiety, and it was used to assess the severity of insomnia symptoms. Results: It was observed that 24.7% of the nurses participating in our study had depression symptoms, 38.8% had anxiety symptoms, and 45.4% had insomnia symptoms. In the female nurse group, we found that depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms were more pronounced. There was no statistically significant difference in 3 scales according to the years of intensive care work. Discussion: Nurses treating COVID-19 patients are probably exposed to the highest risk of infection due to their close, frequent contact with patients and working longer hours than normal. The spread of the virus, the health of the family and others, changes in work, and concerns about isolation can affect the mental state of healthcare workers during this pandemic process.

Understanding why the general population is not proactive in reducing the spread of this illness is critical to learning how to address this issue. This study explores Malawian COVID-19 risk perception and the associated constraints in the adoption of mitigations. A Health Belief Model (HBM) approach was used to understand factors that undermine COVID-19 messages to achieve behavior change. Methods: The study applied a rapid appraisal and photovoice methodology in this qualitative inquiry to better understand individual risk perception regarding COVID-19. We selected 33 participants from three major cities in Malawi. We transcribed verbatim audio interviews and videos. Transcripts were coded manually to derive key themes and concepts. Results: Religious and political beliefs strongly influenced COVID-19 risk perception. Critical religious factors included the coming of Christ, the wrath of God, and the coming of the beast. Politically, participants believed that COVID-19 lockdown measures were a ploy by the ruling party to remain in power. Conclusion: The study suggests that religious beliefs and political environment undermine self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among urban dwellers in Malawi.

From late April 2020, venetoclax was available to patients aged >16y with NPM1 mutation without FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), patients aged >50y with NPM1, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations (regardless of FLT3 status) and patients aged >60y without favourable-risk cytogenetics. Venetoclax could be given with either azacitidine or low-dose cytarabine (LDAC), with the latter recommended mainly for patients with NPM1 mutation. We report a health-system-wide real world data collection for toxicity and patient outcomes across 65 NHS Hospitals. Methods Each patient was registered on a central NHS database. Clinicians certified that their patient met the above criteria, had not received previous AML treatment, and was fit for induction chemotherapy. Anonymised data were retrospectively collected by treating physicians. Venetoclax dose, duration and toxicity information was requested for the first 4 cycles of therapy. Response definitions were as per European Leukaemia Network (ELN) guidelines. A total of 870 patients have been registered on the scheme, with outcomes reported here for those with follow-up information at a data cut on 1st August 2021. Results There were 301 patients, median age 72y (range 34 - 90) with 62% male. The majority (81%) had an ECOG performance status of 0-1. AML was secondary to a previous haematological disorder in 33%, therapy-related in 10% and de novo in the remaining 57%. MRC cytogenetic risk was intermediate in 70% and adverse in 27%. NPM1 mutations were detected in 28% and FLT3-ITD in 12%. Next-generation sequencing results were available in 86% of patients, which detected mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 in 28%, ASXL1 in 20%, RUNX1 in 17% and TP53 in 12%. The ELN risk was favourable for 23%, intermediate for 30% and adverse for 44%. A majority received venetoclax in combination with azacitidine (85%), with the remaining 15% receiving LDAC. The LDAC cohort was enriched for de novo AML (76% vs 54%) and NPM1-mutated disease (56% vs 23%). Most patients (81%) followed the recommended initial schedule of venetoclax 100mg daily for 28 days in combination with posaconazole or voriconazole. Patients spent a median 14 days in hospital in cycle 1, then a median of 0 days for cycles 2-4. In cycles 1, 2, 3 and 4, the median number of days for recovery of neutrophils to >0.5x10 9/L was 33, 25, 24 and 14 respectively, and the median number of days to recovery of platelets to >50x10 9/L was 22, 3, 0 (no drop below 50) and 0. The composite complete remission (CR) / CR with incomplete haematological recovery (CRi) rate was 70%. MRD data is being collected. The best response was morphological leukaemia free state (MLFS) in 2%, partial remission in 7% and refractory disease in 11%. CR/CRi was higher in de novo (78%) compared to secondary AML (57%, p=0.02); NPM1 mutated (78% vs 67%, p=0.02) and IDH1/IDH2 mutated disease (85% vs 62%, p=0.02). ELN favourable risk patients had the highest CR/CRi rate (85%, intermediate 71%, adverse 60%, p=0.01). Median follow-up was 8.2 months (95%CI 7.8 - 9.0) with median overall survival (OS) 12.8 months (95%CI 10.9 - not reached). Mortality at day 30 was 5.7% and day 60 was 8.4%. 12-month overall survival was 51%, increasing to 71% in those who achieved CR/CRi. Survival was poorer in secondary (HR 1.9, p <0.01) and therapy-related AML (HR 2.1, p=0.02), better in NPM1 mutated (HR 0.6, p=0.02) and IDH mutated (HR 0.5, p=0.02) disease and poorer with TP53 mutation (HR 2.0, p=0.01). Overall survival did not differ for patients treated with LDAC compared to azacitidine (HR 1.1, p=0.7). Conclusion This large real-world study demonstrates CR/CRi and survival rates comparable to those reported in prospective clinical trials. Importantly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the adoption of venetoclax regimens permitted the great majority of treatment to be delivered as an outpatient with significant resource saving at a time of critically constrained inpatient resources. The data support prospective comparisons of venetoclax-based regimens to IC in fit adults with AML particularly in older patients with de novo AML, NPM1-mutated and IDH-mutated disease.

Although the advent of the vaccines abated the global burden, they were not effective against all the variants of SCoV-2. This trend warrants shifting the focus on the development of small molecules targeting the crucial proteins of the viral replication machinery as effective therapeutic solutions. The PLpro is a crucial enzyme having multiple roles during the viral life cycle and is a well-established drug target. In this study, we identified 12 potential inhibitors of PLpro through virtual screening of the FDA-approved drug library. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that these molecules bind to the PLpro through multiple interactions. Further, IC(50) values obtained from enzyme-inhibition assays affirm the stronger affinities of the identified molecules for the PLpro. Also, we demonstrated high structural conservation in the catalytic site of PLpro between SCoV-2 and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) through molecular modelling studies. Based on these similarities in PLpro structures and the resemblance in various signalling pathways for the two viruses, we propose that HCoV-229E is a suitable surrogate for SCoV-2 in drug-discovery studies. Validating our hypothesis, Mefloquine, which was effective against HCoV-229E, was found to be effective against SCoV-2 as well in cell-based assays. Overall, the present study demonstrated Mefloquine as a potential inhibitor of SCoV-2 PLpro and its antiviral activity against SCoV-2. Corroborating our findings, based on the in vitro virus inhibition assays, a recent study reported a prophylactic role for Mefloquine against SCoV-2. Accordingly, Mefloquine may further be investigated for its potential as a drug candidate for the treatment of COVID.","output":"Repurposing of FDA Approved Drugs Against SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like Protease: Computational, Biochemical, and in vitro Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Among COVID-19 hospitalized patients, high incidence of alterations in inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers correlates with a poor prognosis.

Among the different methods working in continuous mode, in this paper we will focus in particular on Multicolumn Countercurrent Solvent Gradient Purification (MCSGP) which has been specifically designed for challenging separations of target biomolecules from their product-related impurities. The improvements come from the automatic internal recycling of the impure fractions inside the chromatographic system, which results in an increased yield without compromising the purity of the pool.

Structure-function analyses demonstrated that FMDV 2B is an ion channel-forming protein. Infrared spectroscopy measurements using partially overlapping peptides that spanned regions between amino acids 28 and 147 demonstrated the adoption of helical conformations in two putative transmembrane regions between residues 60 and 78 and between residues 119 and 147 and a third transmembrane region between residues 79 and 106, adopting a mainly extended structure. Using synthetic peptides, ion channel activity measurements in planar lipid bilayers and imaging of single giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) revealed the existence of two sequences endowed with membrane-porating activity: one spanning FMDV 2B residues 55 to 82 and the other spanning the C-terminal region of 2B from residues 99 to 147. Mapping the latter sequence identified residues 119 to 147 as being responsible for the activity. Experiments to assess the degree of insertion of the synthetic peptides in bilayers and the inclination angle adopted by each peptide regarding the membrane plane normal confirm that residues 55 to 82 and 119 to 147 of 2B actively insert as transmembrane helices. Using reverse genetics, a panel of 13 FMD recombinant mutant viruses was designed, which harbored nonconservative as well as alanine substitutions in critical amino acid residues in the area between amino acid residues 28 and 147. Alterations to any of these structures interfered with pore channel activity and the capacity of the protein to permeabilize the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to calcium and were lethal for virus replication. Thus, FMDV 2B emerges as the first member of the viroporin family containing two distinct pore domains.IMPORTANCE FMDV nonstructural protein 2B is able to insert itself into cellular membranes to form a pore. This pore allows the passage of ions and small molecules through the membrane. In this study, we were able to show that both current and small molecules are able to pass though the pore made by 2B. We also discovered for the first time a virus with a pore-forming protein that contains two independent functional pores. By making mutations in our infectious clone of FMDV, we determined that mutations in either pore resulted in nonviable virus. This suggests that both pore-forming functions are independently required during FMDV infection.","output":"Molecular Characterization of the Viroporin Function of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Nonstructural Protein 2B."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic pushed almost all institutions to adopt online and virtual education.

METHODS We surveyed 1,444 Australian adults online in October 2019. To identify factors associated with vaccination site, we used Pearson's chi-square test. We used thematic analysis to describe responses to the question, 'Please explain why you chose to get vaccinated there'. RESULTS Most participants (73%) received the influenza vaccine in a medical setting, while 13% received it at a pharmacy and 14% at their workplace. Being vaccinated in pharmacy was associated with being under 65 years of age (p<0.01), marital status (p=0.01), and not having a high-risk comorbidity (p<0.01). Workplace vaccination was associated with being under 65 (p<0.01), household income (p<0.01), not having a regular general physician/practice (p=0.01), having private insurance (p<0.01), and not having a high-risk comorbidity (p<0.01). There was no association between site of vaccination and first-time vaccination (p=0.71, p=0.22). CONCLUSIONS Despite new policies allowing pharmacists to administer influenza vaccines, most Australian adults are still vaccinated in medical settings. Pharmacy and workplace vaccination settings were more common among younger adults without high-risk comorbidities. Implications for public health: Workplaces, pharmacies and other non-medical settings may provide an opportunity to increase influenza vaccination among healthy, working-age adults who might otherwise forego annual vaccination.

We performed a cross-sectional age-, sex-, and race- stratified survey of the general US population. Of the 1,005 respondents, 37% (95% CI 34.0, 39.9) felt that NPIs were inconvenient, while only 0.9% (95% CI 0.3, 1.5) of respondents believed that NPIs would not reduce their personal risk of illness. Respondents were most uncertain regarding the efficacy of mask and eye protection use, with 30.6% and 22.1%, respectively, unsure whether their use would slow disease spread. On univariate logistic regression analyses, NPI adherence was associated with a belief that NPIs would reduce personal risk of developing COVID-19 (OR 3.06, 95% CI [1.25, 7.48], p=0.014) and with a belief that the NPIs were not difficult to perform (OR 1.79, 95% CI [1.38, 2.31], p<0.0001). Respondents were compliant with straightforward, familiar, and heavily-encouraged NPI recommendations such as hand-washing; more onerous approaches, such as avoiding face touching, disinfecting surfaces, and wearing masks or goggles, were performed less frequently.

Cysteine cathepsins (Cts) prevalently exist in whole organisms, varying from prokaryotes to mammals, and possess greatly conserved cysteine residues in their active sites. Cts are engaged in the digestion of cellular proteins, activation of zymogens, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Host cells are entered by SARS-CoV-2 via endocytosis. Cathepsin L and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate 5-kinase are crucial in endocytosis by cleaving the spike protein, which permits viral membrane fusion with the endosomal membrane and succeeds in the release of the viral genome to the host cell. Therefore, inhibition of cathepsin L may be advantageous in terms of decreasing infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. Coordinate inhibition of multiple Cts and lysosomal function by different drugs and biological agents might be of value for some purposes, such as a parasite or viral infections and antineoplastic applications. Zn2+ deficiency or dysregulation leads to exaggerated cysteine cathepsin activity, increasing the autoimmune/inflammatory response.

METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 complicated with NTI who were treated at our hospital were included in this retrospective study. Patients were divided into low TSH and normal TSH groups, as well as low and normal-high FT4 group, according to the reference range of TSH or FT4 levels. The 90-day mortality and critical illness rates were compared among patients with low and normal TSH levels, as well as among patients with low FT4 levels and normal-high FT4 levels; in addition, differences in demographic and laboratory data were compared. A Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations of TSH and FT4 levels with mortality. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients with low FT3 levels and without a history of thyroid disease were included, 68% of whom had normal FT4 and TSH levels.

Although no significant difference in the critical illness rate was found (P = 0.296), the mortality rate was significantly higher in the low FT4 group (P = 0.038). Low TSH levels were independently related to 90-day mortality (hazard ratio = 2.78, 95% CI:1.42-5.552, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Low FT4 and TSH concentrations were associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 presenting with NTI; moreover, low TSH levels were an independent risk factor for mortality in these patients.","output":"Prognostic significance of low TSH concentration in patients with COVID-19 presenting with non-thyroidal illness syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are remitting and relapsing diseases that mainly interest the gastrointestinal tract. IBD is associated with a condition of psycho-social discomfort that deeply compromises the quality of life and the competence of patient to be fully engaged in their self-management. As a consequence, effective care of IBD patients should include not only medical but also psychological support in order to improve patients' wellbeing. Although this, to date there is no standardized approach to promote psychological wellbeing of IBD patients in order to improve the perception of the quality of the care. To fill this gap, a consensus conference has been organized in order to define the psychosocial needs of IBD patients and to promote their engagement in daily clinical practice. This paper describes the process implemented and illustrates the recommendations deriving from it, which focus on the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in IBD management. RESULTS: The consensus conference has been organized in three phases: (1) literature review about life experiences, engagement, and psychosocial needs of IBD patients; (2) workshops with IBD experts and patients representatives; (3) drafting of statements and voting. Seventy-three participants were involved in the consensus conference, and sixteen statements have been voted and approved during the consensus process. CONCLUSIONS: The main conclusion is the necessity of the early detection of C and, in case of need, intervention on- psycho-social needs of patients in order to achieve patient involvement in IBD care.","output":"Promoting psycho-social wellbeing for engaging inflammatory bowel disease patients in their care: an Italian consensus statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To compare vascular measurements to determine stent types and configurations for abdominal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) by comparing results of contrast material-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) angiography and nonenhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was institutional review board approved, and all patients provided written informed consent. Fifty patients (45 men and five women; mean age, 76.0 years) admitted for elective abdominal EVAR underwent preoperative abdominal CT angiography (triplanar reformatted images; section thickness of 1-3 mm) and nonenhanced MR angiography (triplanar two-dimensional single-shot turbo field-echo images; section thickness of 6 mm). Two observers independently completed standard measurement and device selection forms for endovascular stent planning for CT and MR angiography. Pearson and intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to evaluate intermodality and interobserver differences. RESULTS No significant difference was found in aortic neck diameter (observer 1: CT, 18.5 mm; MR, 19.0 mm; P = .43) (observer 2: CT, 19.6 mm; MR, 19.3 mm; P = .59), aortic neck diameter 15 mm distal to the lowest renal artery (observer 1: CT, 19.2 mm; MR, 19.2 mm; P = .38) (observer 2: CT, 19.6 mm; MR, 19.6 mm; P = .91), aortic neck length (observer 1: CT, 43.6 mm; MR, 43.6 mm; P = .85) (observer 2: CT, 44.4 mm; MR, 44.0 mm; P = .93), or other key vascular measurements (P = .23-.99) for preoperative planning. These included aneurysm diameter, lowest renal artery to aortic bifurcation length, aortic bifurcation diameter, common iliac artery diameters, external iliac artery diameters, length between orifices of lower renal and internal iliac arteries, and iliac artery sealing length. CT and MR angiography measurements showed very strong correlation (r = 0.92-0.99). Intraclass correlation coefficients between observers ranged from 0.90 to 0.98. Stent types and configurations determined with CT measurements remained unaltered when reassessed with MR measurements.

The UK government implemented a national lockdown to slow the rate of infection at the end of March 2020, lasting until early summer 2020. The results from a UK nationwide survey suggest the majority of inflammatory bowel disease patients were followed up using technology-enabled care services (TECS) during this time. We therefore aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on nutritional status of children with inflammatory bowel disease, focusing on the effect of national lockdown from March to early summer 2020. METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. All patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, aged <18 years, and under the care of Southampton Children's Hospital were eligible for inclusion. Those patients who attended an outpatient appointment during time period 1 (November 2019 to February 2020), and following the period of national lockdown, time period 2 (July to November 2020), were included in the analysis. RESULTS In total, 116 patients had paired measures. Using the World Health Organization criteria of nutritional status, 19% (n = 22/116) were mildly malnourished with a body mass index Z score (BMIZ) < -1. In this group, the mean BMIZ was -1.3  0.9 at time point 1 versus -1.9  0.9 at time point 2 (p = 0.03). The mean BMIZ score of those children who were overweight at time point 1 was 1.2  1.2 versus 1.6  1.4 at time point 2 (p = 0.2) During the period of lockdown, 27% of malnourished children (n = 6/22), 2% of normally nourished children (BMIZ > -1 to < 1) (n = 1/51) (p  0.0001) and none of the overweight children (BMIZ > 1) (n = 0/43) children (p  0.0001) had a TECS nutrition review. CONCLUSIONS Dietetic reviews were severely restricted during the first national lockdown. Patients with low BMIZ prior to lockdown became more malnourished.

Epiglottitis, which used to be prevalent in children under age 5, is now seen more often in adults than in children. This decline in childhood epiglottitis is due to the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine. Streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, are now important causes of epiglottitis. Croup is a viral infection, usually due to parainfluenza virus, that primarily affects children ages 6 months to 3 years old.

The objective of this paper is to critically review the available evidence regarding the lessons learned from the Chinese experience regarding COVID-19 prevention and management. The steps that have led to a near disappearance of new cases in China included rapid sequencing of the virus to establish testing kits which allowed tracking of infected persons in and out of Wuhan. In addition, aggressive quarantine measures included the complete isolation of Wuhan and then later Hebei and the rest of the country, as well as closure of all schools and non-essential businesses. Other measures included the rapid construction of two new hospitals and the establishment of Fangcang shelter hospitals. In the absence of a vaccine, the management of COVID-19 included antivirals, high flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, interferons, intravenous immunoglobulin and convalescent plasma infusions. These measures appeared to provide only moderate success. While some measures have been supported by weak descriptive data, their effectiveness is still unclear pending well-controlled clinical trials. In the end, it was the enforcement of drastic quarantine measures that stopped SARS-CoV-2 from spreading. The earlier the implementation, the less likely resources will be depleted. The most critical factors in stopping a pandemic are early recognition of infected individuals, carriers and contacts, and early implementation of quarantine measures with an organized, proactive and unified strategy at a national level.

The objective of this study is to assess the prognostic capability of these tests in predicting clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective case series including all patients at least 16 years old with COVID-19 who were admitted from one of five Emergency Departments between March 6th and April 4th, 2020. We included 1123 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19. We analyzed white blood cell count (WBC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), D-dimer, ferritin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). We looked at clinical outcomes including death, the need for endotracheal intubation (ETT), the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), and ICU admission. We report Spearman's (2) and statistical significance for each correlation with outcomes. We also report positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios. RESULTS: The mean age of our patient population was 62 (SD 16). Thirty-seven percent of patients self-reported Spanish/Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, 47% reported their race as Black or African-American, and 10% reported their race as non-Hispanic white.

Transmission of the pathogen has occurred through animal-to-human contact at first followed by human-to-human contact within families and health care facilities. DATA AND METHODS: This study is based on a retrospective analysis of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and July 2015. A Geoadditive variable model for binary outcomes was applied to account for both individual level risk factors as well spatial variation via a fully Bayesian approach. RESULTS: Out of 959 confirmed cases, 642 (67%) were males and 317 (33%) had died. Three hundred and sixty four (38%) cases occurred in Ar Riyad province, while 325 (34%) cases occurred in Makkah. Individuals with some comorbidity had a significantly higher likelihood of dying from MERS-CoV compared with those who did not suffer comorbidity [Odds ratio (OR) = 2.071; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.307, 3.263]. Health-care workers were significantly less likely to die from the disease compared with non-health workers [OR = 0.372, 95% CI: 0.151, 0.827]. Patients who had fatal clinical experience and those with clinical and subclinical experiences were equally less likely to die from the disease compared with patients who did not have fatal clinical experience and those without clinical and subclinical experiences respectively. The odds of dying from the disease was found to increase as age increased beyond 25 years and was much higher for individuals with any underlying comorbidities.

The model was trained using the official reported data. The optimal values of the models parameters that maximize the forecasting accuracy were determined. The forecasting accuracy of the model was assessed using seven statistical assessment criteria, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R(2)), mean absolute error (MAE), ef?ciency coef?cient (EC), overall index (OI), coefficient of variation (COV), and coef?cient of residual mass (CRM). A reasonable forecasting accuracy was obtained. The forecasting accuracy of the suggested model is compared with two other models.

The second is an artificial intelligence based model called nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). Finally, the proposed LSTM model was applied to forecast the total number of confirmed cases as well as deaths in six different countries; Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, and USA. These countries have different epidemic trends as they apply different polices and have different age structure, weather, and culture.

Past research has studied this dichotomy on-screen in conditions remote from natural situations where the scene would be omnidirectional and the entire field of view could be of use. In this study, we had participants looking for objects in simulated everyday rooms in virtual reality. By implementing a gaze-contingent protocol we masked central or peripheral vision (masks of 6 deg. of radius) during trials. We analyzed the impact of vision loss on visuo-motor variables related to fixation (duration) and saccades (amplitude and relative directions). An important novelty is that we segregated eye, head and the general gaze movements in our analyses. Additionally, we studied these measures after separating trials into two search phases (scanning and verification). Our results generally replicate past on-screen literature and teach about the role of eye and head movements. We showed that the scanning phase is dominated by short fixations and long saccades to explore, and the verification phase by long fixations and short saccades to analyze. One finding indicates that eye movements are strongly driven by visual stimulation, while head movements serve a higher behavioral goal of exploring omnidirectional scenes. Moreover, losing central vision has a smaller impact than reported on-screen, hinting at the importance of peripheral scene processing for visual search with an extended field of view. Our findings provide more information concerning how knowledge gathered on-screen may transfer to more natural conditions, and attest to the experimental usefulness of eye tracking in virtual reality.","output":"Effects of Transient Loss of Vision on Head and Eye Movements during Visual Search in a Virtual Environment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The notorious COVID 19 pandemic has caused rapid and drastic changes in cancer care worldwide in 2020.

The objective of this commentary is to evaluate some of the challenges faced by undocumented farmworkers in the context of the current global pandemic and possible risk mitigation strategies. Undocumented farmworkers make considerable contributions to the U.S. economy and food production, but they are at an elevated risk for contracting Covid-19. Their risk is compounded by their employment and legal status, as well as their poor working and living conditions which makes it difficult for them to observe Covid-19 precautionary measures. U.S. immigration policy disincentivizes undocumented farmworkers from seeking healthcare services. Contact tracing challenges could be overcome by gaining trust with subsequent increased testing and care. Extending eligibility of safety net programs for undocumented farmworkers will help to ease the burden of Covid-19, thereby improving their overall health and productivity.","output":"The Novel Coronavirus and Undocumented Farmworkers in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Thirty-day mortality of patients with hip fracture is well researched and predictive; validated scoring tools have been developed (Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, NHFS). COVID-19 has significantly greater mortality in the elderly and comorbid patients which includes hip fracture patients. Non-operative treatment is not appropriate due to significantly higher mortality, and therefore, these patients are often exposed to COVID-19 in the peri-operative period. What is unclear is the effect of concomitant COVID-19 infection in these patients. METHODS: A multicentre prospective study across ten sites in the United Kingdom (responsible for 7% of hip fracture patients per annum in the UK). Demographic and background information were collected by independent chart review. Data on surgical factors included American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, time to theatre, Nottingham Hip fracture score (NHFS) and classification of fracture were also collected between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020 with a matched cohort from the same period in 2019. RESULTS: Actual and expected 30-day mortality was found to be significantly higher than expected for 2020 COVID-19 positive patients (RR 3.00 95% CI 1.57C5.75, p < 0.001), with 30 observed deaths compared against the 10 expected from NHFS risk stratification. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection appears to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality in hip fracture patients. Whilst non-operative management of these fractures is not suggested due to the documented increased risks and mortality, this study provides evidence to the emerging literature of the severity of COVID-19 infection in surgical patients and the potential impact of COVID-19 on elective surgical patients in the peri-operative period.","output":"Thirty-day mortality following surgical management of hip fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings from a prospective multi-centre UK study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and warrant COVID-19 vaccination to reduce nosocomial infections.

An anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2,254 full-time doctors/nurses in three Chinese provinces during 10/2020-11/2020. The prevalence of BICV was 75.1%/68.0% among nurses/doctors under the most optimum scenario of this study (free/80% effectiveness/rare mild side effects); it dropped to 64.6%/56.5% if it costed 600 Yuan (USD90). Similar prevalence was obtained (72.7%/71.2%) if the vaccination was recommended by the government/hospitals but dropped to <50% if effectiveness was 50% or mild side effects were common; 13.0% preferred to take up COVID-19 vaccination at the soonest (81.8% would wait and see). Scientific proof (completion of phase III clinical trials and approval from health authorities) was rated the highest in its impacts on vaccination decision, followed by vaccines' performance, and then logistics. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy (but neither perceived susceptibility nor perceived barriers) were significantly associated with the two BICV outcomes.

METHODS A modified percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy technique is described. The technique was performed on 10 patients in the surgical intensive care unit. RESULTS Ten patients underwent percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy. There were 7 males, and the average age for the group was 60.8 years. The average number of ventilator days before the operation was 26.3. All procedures were successful, and no patient had any procedure-related complications.

Although DNA viruses use host high-fidelity polymerases for their replication, and therefore should have lower mutation rates, it has been shown that some of them have evolutionary rates comparable to those of RNA viruses. Notably, these viruses have large proportions of their genes with at least one overlapping instance. Hence, gene overlapping could be a modulator of virus evolution beyond the RNA world. To test this hypothesis, we use the genus Begomovirus of plant viruses as a model. Through comparative genomic approaches, we show that terminal gene overlapping decreases the rate of virus evolution, which is associated with lower frequency of both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations. In contrast, terminal overlapping has little effect on the pace of virus evolution. Overall, our analyses support a role for gene overlapping in the evolution of begomoviruses and provide novel information on the factors that shape their genetic diversity.","output":"Gene Overlapping as a Modulator of Begomovirus Evolution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.","output":"Assessing Behavioral Economic-Based Approaches to Address COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ventilation is of primary concern for maintaining healthy indoor air quality and reducing the spread of airborne infectious disease, including COVID-19.

However, the task is challenged by ambiguous boundary, irregular shape, various position and size of the lesions, as well as the difficulty in acquiring a large set of annotated volumetric images for training. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel convolutional neural network called PF-Net and incorporate it into a semi-supervised learning framework based on Iterative Confidence-based Refinement And Weighting of pseudo Labels (I-CRAWL). Our PF-Net combines 2D and 3D convolutions to deal with CT volumes with large inter-slice spacing, and uses multi-scale guided dense attention to segment complex PF lesions. For semi-supervised learning, our I-CRAWL employs pixel-level uncertainty-based confidence-aware refinement to improve the accuracy of pseudo labels of unannotated images, and uses image-level uncertainty for confidence-based image weighting to suppress low-quality pseudo labels in an iterative training process. Extensive experiments with CT scans of Rhesus Macaques with radiation-induced PF showed that: 1) PF-Net achieved higher segmentation accuracy than existing 2D, 3D and 2.5D neural networks, and 2) I-CRAWL outperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods for the PF lesion segmentation task.

However, infection leading to efficient viral release was not observed in any of the studied cell lines. The apparent differences were attributed to particularities of mouse and hamster cell lines, which might have led to the repression of viral DNA synthesis and to the low level of GFP expression mediated by Ad11pe3GFP. Moreover, our results revealed that undetectable hexon protein hampered the assembly of virus particles in CHO and MDCK cells. Ad11p differed from Ad5 in the ability for viral DNA synthesis when infecting CHO cells. Although a defective Ad has been successfully developed for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in clinical applications, it has been difficult to generate one that can be used as an oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Fortunately, our replication-competent Ad 11p vector might solve this problem. Regarding the use of Ad-vector candidates for vaccine purposes, this study demonstrates the selection of animal cell lines and determination of suitable virus doses in in vitro experiments.","output":"Susceptibility of Dog, Hamster, and Mouse Cells to the Replication-Competent Adenovirus 11p E1/E3 Green Fluorescence Protein Vector Has Implications for the Selection of Animal Vaccine Models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review investigated the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the synergy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, preeclampsia (PE), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Maternal health is a great concern when treating pregnant women fighting this triad of diseases, which is highly prevalent in South Africa. MicroRNAs are involved in fine-tuning of physiological processes. Disruptions to the balance of this minute protein can lead to various physiological changes that are sometimes pathological. RECENT FINDINGS: MicroRNAs have recently been implicated in PE and have been linked to the anti-angiogenic imbalance evident in PE. Recent in silico studies have identified potential host miRNAs with anti-viral properties against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies have demonstrated dysregulated expression of several miRNAs in HIV-1 infection along with the ability of HIV-1 to downregulate anti-viral host microRNAs. This review has highlighted the significant gap in literature on the potential of miRNAs in women with HIV-associated PE in synergy with the novel SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, this review has provided evidence of the critical role that the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of miRNA plays in viral infections and PE, thereby providing a foundation for further research investigating the potential of therapeutic miRNA development with fewer side-effects for pregnant women.","output":"The Involvement of MicroRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 Infection Comorbid with HIV-Associated Preeclampsia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rheumatologists increasingly receive consults for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for cancer. ICIs can cause inflammatory syndromes known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Several rheumatologic irAEs are reported including inflammatory arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and myositis. For patients who present with musculoskeletal symptoms while on ICI therapy, it is important to have an algorithm for evaluation. The differential diagnosis includes a range of musculoskeletal syndromes like crystalline arthritis, mechanical issues, and osteoarthritis, in addition to irAEs. After diagnosing a rheumatologic irAE, rheumatologists must work with the patient and their oncologist to form a treatment plan. Treatment of irAEs is guided by severity. Evidence for management is limited to observational studies. Inflammatory arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in mild cases, corticosteroids for moderate to severe cases, and sometimes require other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Myositis due to ICIs can be accompanied by myocarditis or myasthenia gravis. Corticosteroids and holding the ICI are usually required to treat myositis; some patients with severe myositis need intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis.

To evaluate the anti-arthritis efficacy and the underlying mechanisms of kaempferol, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were treated with kaempferol intragastrically (200 mg  kg(?1)  d(?1)) and intraperitoneally (20 mg  kg(?1)  d(?1)). Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies showed that the oral administration of kaempferol produced distinct anti-arthritis effects in model mice with arthritis in terms of the spleen index, arthritis index, paw thickness, and inflammatory factors; the bioavailability (1.5%, relative to that of the intraperitoneal injection) and circulatory exposure of kaempferol (C(max) = 0.23  0.06 ng/mL) and its primary metabolite kaempferol-3-O-glucuronide (C(max) = 233.29  89.64 ng/mL) were rather low. In contrast, the intraperitoneal injection of kaempferol caused marginal anti-arthritis effects, although it achieved a much higher in vivo exposure. The much higher kaempferol content in the gut implicated a potential mechanism involved in the gut. Analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA revealed that CIA caused imbalance of 14 types of bacteria at the family level, whereas kaempferol largely rebalanced the intestinal microbiota in CIA mice. A metabolomics study showed that kaempferol treatment significantly reversed the perturbation of metabolites involved in energy production and the tryptophan, fatty acid and secondary bile acid metabolisms in the gut contents of the CIA mice.

The implications of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal and childhood well-being need to be characterized. We aimed to characterize the fetal immune response to maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing and T cell receptor sequencing on cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) from newborns of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the third trimester (cases) or without SARS-CoV-2 infection (controls). RESULTS: We identified widespread gene expression changes in CBMCs from cases, including upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and major histocompatibility complex genes in CD14(+) monocytes, transcriptional changes suggestive of activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, and activation and exhaustion of natural killer cells. Lastly, we observed fetal T cell clonal expansion in cases compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: As none of the infants were infected with SARS-CoV-2, our results suggest that maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection might modulate the fetal immune system in the absence of vertical transmission. IMPACT: The implications of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of vertical transmission on fetal and childhood well-being are poorly understood. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection might modulate the fetal immune system in the absence of vertical transmission.

Here we present an update of COVID-19 outcomes in New York City (NYC) from the initial surge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]). We sought to determine the hospitalization and mortality rates and their associated factors, specifically recent chemotherapy and immunotherapy use. Methods: Data were abstracted from gynecologic oncology patients with COVID-19 infection among 8 New York City (NYC) area hospital systems. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to analyze COVID-19 related hospitalization and mortality. Results: Of 193 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID-19, the median age at diagnosis was 65.0 years (interquartile range, 53.0-73.0 years). A total of 106 of the 193 patients (54.9%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients 13 (12.3%) required invasive mechanical ventilation and 39 (36.8%) required ICU admission. No patients requiring mechanical ventilation survived. A total of 34 of 193 (17.6%) patients died of COVID-19 complications. On multivariable analysis, hospitalization was associated with an age greater than or equal to 65 years (odds ratio [OR] 2.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 4.07), Black race (OR 2.53, CI 1.24, 5.32), performance status greater than or equal to 2 (OR 3.67, CI 1.25, 13.55) and greater than or equal to 3 comorbidities (OR 2.00, CI 1.05, 3.84). Only former or current history of smoking (OR 2.75, CI 1.21, 6.22) was associated with death due to COVID-19 on multivariable analysis. A total of 13 of 34 (38.23%) patients who died of COVID-19 complications received cytotoxic chemotherapy, while 4 of 34 (11.76%) patients received immunotherapy. However, recent cytotoxic chemotherapy use was not predictive of COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality on multivariable analysis.

This protects staff, but puts patients at risk of nosocomial infection via PPE gowns. Anecdotal reports of such infections in ITUs during Covid are frequent. We therefore explored the use of short-sleeved gowns with hand and arm hygiene as an alternative to sessional gowns. Methods ITU Staff were invited for simulation suite training in Covid intubation and proning. They were trained in a specific hand and arm washing technique before performing simulated tasks using both standard and modified (short sleeved) PPE. Fluorescent powder was used to simulate micro-organisms, and detected using standardised photos under U/V light. Teams of staff were randomised to use standard or modified PPE first. Individuals were questioned about their feeling of personal safety, comfort and the patients safety at 4 intervals. Results 68 staff and 17 proning volunteers were studied in 17 sessions. Modified PPE completely prevented staff contamination during Covid intubation, which occurred in 30/67 staff wearing standard PPE (p = 0.0029, McNemar). Conversely, proning volunteers were contaminated by staff in 15/17 sessions with standard PPE and in 1/17 with modified PPE (P = 0.0227 McNemar). Impressions of staff comfort were superior with modified PPE (p< 0.001, t-test); personal safety scored higher with standard PPE , but the difference decreased during the session (p<0.001 start, 0.068 end). Impressions of patient safety were initially similar (p=0.87) but finished strongly in favour of modified PPE (p<0.001). Conclusions Modified PPE using short sleeves and hand/arm cleansing appears superior to standard PPE with sessional gowns in preventing transfer of contamination between staff and patients. A clinical trial of this strategy is merited.","output":"Reduction in transfer of micro-organisms between patients and staff using short-sleeved gowns and hand/arm hygiene in Intensive Care during the Covid pandemic: a simulation-based randomised trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to describe our experience in an interventional radiology unit in a hospital in Spain that was severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Current investigations on ZIKV replication have revealed the construction of replication compartments (RCs) and the utilization of host cellular endomembranes, without careful examination of the cytoskeletal network. Here, we investigated the function of vimentin, one of the intermediate filaments (IFs) that play a central role in basic cellular functions and diseases, in the life cycle of ZIKV infection. Using advanced imaging techniques, we uncovered that vimentin filaments have drastic reorganization upon viral protein synthesis, to form a perinuclear cage-like structure that embraces and concentrates RCs. Genetically removal of vimentin markedly reduced viral genome replication, viral protein production and infectious virions release, without interrupting viral binding and entry. Furthermore, proteomics and transcriptome screens by mass spectrometry and RNA sequencing identified intense interaction and regulation between vimentin and hundreds of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident RNA-binding proteins. Among them, the cytoplasmic-region of ribosome receptor binding protein 1 (RRBP1), an ER transmembrane protein directly binds viral RNA, can interact with vimentin, resulting in modulation of ZIKV replication. Together, our work discovered a dual role for vimentin as being not only a structural element for RCs but also an RNA-binding-regulating hub in the ZIKV infection model, unveiling another layer of the complexity between host and virus interaction.","output":"Host cytoskeletal vimentin serves as a structural organizer and an RNA-binding protein regulator to facilitate Zika viral replication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, scientists have shifted their focus from studying psychological resilience as a single, isolated construct (e.g. attribute or outcome) to studying it as a dynamic process encompassing a number of temporally related elements. Models depicting this process explain why some people adapt to stressor exposure, whereas others do not. To date, these process models did not sufficiently explain how people adapt differently to a stressor. To address this issue, we developed a new model of psychological resilience, called the Psychological Immunity-Psychological Elasticity (PI-PE) model. The aim of this article is to clarify this model and to discuss its added value. First, we explain how we derived the PI-PE model from the literature regarding both the crucial elements in any resilience process model and the (mal)adaptive outcomes following stressful events. Secondly, we describe the different elements that make up the model. Characteristic of the PI-PE model is that it distinguishes between two pathways of psychological resilience C psychological immunity and psychological elasticity C with four adaptive outcomes, namely sustainability, recovery, transformation and thriving. To explain how people arrive at these different outcomes, we argue that two consecutive mechanisms are critical in these pathways: tolerance and narrative construction. Taken as a whole, the PI-PE model presents a comprehensive framework to inspire both research and practice.

Medical services can be apportioned as procedural care (eg, surgery, radiology, or laboratory testing and others) or cognitive care, also known as Evaluation and Management (E/M) services, in which the provider formulates an assessment and plan after obtaining information from the patient's history, examination, and diagnostic tests.Providing a medical opinion and plan using the telephone as the technology that links the provider and the patient is an example of a non-face-to-face E/M service. Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes and the details for how to provide telephone services have been available for decades but have not been reimbursed and therefore were rarely used. In recent years, as new technologies have evolved, there has been slow and steady acceptance that non-face-to-face E/M care can be an adjunct to or replacement for some face-to-face E/M services. These technologies and the descriptors for associated CPT and Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes were introduced over the past few years and have become known by the generic term telehealth. They have been slowly incorporated into medical practice. Most of these services were introduced in the consumer retail market, in which the cost was borne directly by the patient, or as private contract services, in which the cost was borne by the consulting hospital, such as with telestroke services. In both the consumer retail model and private contract model, the care delivered usually did not involve CPT or HCPCS coding. The adoption of telehealth has been slow, in part because of the initial costs and several regulatory constraints, as well as the reluctance of patients, providers, and the insurance industry to change the concept that medical care could only be delivered when the patient and their provider were in physical proximity.After the COVID-19 pandemic reached the United States, the US Department of Health & Human Services issued a public health emergency and declared a Section 1135 Waiver that lifted many of the administrative constraints.

Our aim was to examine ventilation characteristics and outcomes in invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 in Argentina, an upper middle-income country. METHODS: In this prospective, multicentre cohort study (SATICOVID), we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 who were on invasive mechanical ventilation and admitted to one of 63 ICUs in Argentina. Patient demographics and clinical, laboratory, and general management variables were collected on day 1 (ICU admission); physiological respiratory and ventilation variables were collected on days 1, 3, and 7. The primary outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. All patients were followed until death in hospital or hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality, identification of independent predictors of mortality, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and patterns of change in physiological respiratory and mechanical ventilation variables. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04611269, and is complete. FINDINGS: Between March 20, 2020, and Oct 31, 2020, we enrolled 1909 invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19, with a median age of 62 years [IQR 52C70]. 1294 (678%) were men, hypertension and obesity were the main comorbidities, and 939 (492%) patients required vasopressors. Lung-protective ventilation was widely used and median duration of ventilation was 13 days (IQR 7C22). Median tidal volume was 61 mL/kg predicted bodyweight (IQR 60C70) on day 1, and the value increased significantly up to day 7; positive end-expiratory pressure was 10 cm H(2)O (8C12) on day 1, with a slight but significant decrease to day 7. Ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO(2)) to fractional inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) was 160 (IQR 111C218), respiratory system compliance 36 mL/cm H(2)O (29C44), driving pressure 12 cm H(2)O (10C14), and FiO(2) 060 (045C080) on day 1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome developed in 1672 (876%) of patients; 1176 (616%) received prone positioning. In-hospital mortality was 577% (1101/1909 patients) and ICU mortality was 570% (1088/1909 patients); 462 (438%) patients died of refractory hypoxaemia, frequently overlapping with septic shock (n=174). Cox regression identified age (hazard ratio 102 [95% CI 101C103]), Charlson score (116 [111C123]), endotracheal intubation outside of the ICU (ie, before ICU admission; 137 [110C171]), vasopressor use on day 1 (129 [107C155]), D-dimer concentration (102 [101C103]), PaO(2)/FiO(2) on day 1 (0998 [0997C0999]), arterial pH on day 1 (101 [100C101]), driving pressure on day 1 (105 [103C108]), acute kidney injury (166 [136C203]), and month of admission (110 [103C118]) as independent predictors of mortality. INTERPRETATION: In patients with COVID-19 who required invasive mechanical ventilation, lung-protective ventilation was widely used but mortality was high. Predictors of mortality in our study broadly agreed with those identified in studies of invasively ventilated patients in high-income countries. The sustained burden of COVID-19 on scarce health-care personnel might have contributed to high mortality over the course of our study in Argentina. These data might help to identify points for improvement in the management of patients in middle-income countries and elsewhere. FUNDING: None.

We aimed to determine variations in antithyroid antibody titres during pregnancy and after delivery. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in a single centre. Antibody titres of 142 patients were measured to assess variations in the levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor antibodies (TRAbs), thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAbs), and thyroid globulin antibodies (TgAbs). We compared the titres of each antibody between adjacent time periods (eg, first trimester (T1) vs second trimester (T2), T2 vs third trimester (T3), T3 vs the postpartum period (PP)) by paired t-test or the Wilcoxon test. Then, we analysed data from patients with complete laboratory examination results in all four periods with the Friedman test, performing comparisons among groups. RESULTS: In the TgAb group, significant differences existed between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 in the LT4 subgroup and between T1 and T2 in the no-medication subgroup. In the TRAb group, significant differences existed between T1 and T2 in the LT4 subgroup. In the TPOAb group, significant differences existed among each group in the LT4 subgroup, and there were significant differences between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3 in the no-medication subgroup. The Friedman test showed that the P-values were 0.013 and 0.004 in the LT4 and no-medication subgroups of the TgAb group, respectively; 0.122 in the LT4 subgroup of the TRAb group; and <0.001 and 0.272 in the LT4 and no-medication subgroups of the TPOAb group, respectively. In the LT4 subgroup of the TgAb group, the P-values for comparisons of time periods were 0.602 between T1 and T2, 0.602 between T2 and T3, 0.006 between T1 and T3, and 0.602 between T3 and PP. In the no-medication subgroup of the TgAb group, the P-values were 0.078 between T1 and T2, 1.000 between T2 and T3, 0.011 between T1 and T3, and 0.078 between T3 and PP. In the LT4 subgroup of the TPOAb group, the P-values were 0.09 between T1 and T2, 0.014 between T2 and T3, <0.001 between T1 and T3, and 0.772 between T3 and PP. CONCLUSION: We can conclude that the TgAb and TPOAb titres dropped during pregnancy.","output":"Variations in the Antithyroid Antibody Titre During Pregnancy and After Delivery"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) is an emerging shrimp (Penaeus monodon) disease caused by Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) since 2013 in Bangladesh. The aim of this work was to evaluate a PCR and RT-PCR techniques as rapid methods for detecting V. parahaemolyticus AHPND-positive P. monodon using genetic markers. Healthy and diseased shrimp (P. monodon) samples were collected from three monitoring stations. The samples were enriched in TCBS plates and DNA extraction from the cultured bacteria. DNA quantifications, PCR amplification, RT-PCR, and gene sequencing were done for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus AHPND-positive P. monodon. The sequence of PCR amplicons showed 100% identity and significant alignment with V. parahaemolyticus. The primers used provided high specificity for V. parahaemolyticus in PCR detection compared with another Vibrio species. In the PCR, amplification resulted positive amplicons, whereas, non-AHPND isolates showed no amplicons. Neighbor-joining methods indicated that all genes evolved from a common ancestor and clades have different traits with very low genetic distance and low variability. The pairwise alignment scores of atpA, tox, blaCARB, 16S rRNA, and pirA genes were 100.0, 98.90, 98.89, 95.53, and 41.42, respectively. The RT-qPCR exposed variable expression levels for all genes in the AHPND-positive strain. Homology analysis and distance matrix exhibited all genes to have the lowest similarity and most divergence, offering the highest specificity. In this study, the expression and variability of target genes confirmed the presence of V. parahaemolyticus in all sampling sites. The results suggested that PCR amplification, RT-qPCR, and gene sequencing can be used for the rapid detection of V. parahaemolyticus in AHPND-positive P. monodon that may lead to subsequent prevention and treatment research in the future for managing this disease.","output":"Diagnosis, genetic variations, virulence, and toxicity of AHPND-positive Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Penaeus monodon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A recent cohort study1 at Suizhou in China identified that the proportion of subjects who wore eyeglasses was lower in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than in the general population.

Despite government support, teachers and students faced numerous challenges in the online teaching and learning process than expected. Extensive research has been undertaken to investigate the context of online education from the perspective of students, but less emphasis has been given to examining the views of teachers. Thus, the study aimed to explore attitudes of academics towards online teaching during the Covid-19 outbreak. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Sri Lanka, with the population consisting of academics representing all state universities. An email survey was conducted randomly, and 355 academics responded to a Google form, out of which 332 refined questionnaires were used for analysis. Multi-item reflective indicators were used to operationalize the research constructs on a 7-point Likert scale. The face, content, and construct validities were ensured appropriately. The reflective-reflective two-stage hierarchical approach with disjoint option was applied to analyze the data using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) model. After rigorous and careful examination of data, the descriptive statistics revealed that the university academics are pretty distressed with their Internet connections and facilities at home to conduct online lectures. Findings Active student participation was just above the average, while teacher's attitudes towards online education, their willingness to continue it further seem quite unsatisfactory. Teacher readiness for online education appears to be acceptable only to a certain extent. The key findings of the study disclosed that the attitudes towards online teaching are determined by perceived usefulness, teacher readiness, perceived student participation whereas active student participation, a conducive teaching environment and institutional support have no significant impact on attitude towards online teaching. Further, the study contributed to the education literature analyzing online education in the Sri Lankan context. Originality/value This study sparked the debate and contributed to the literature exploring the concept from the side of teachers in which attitudes of teachers towards online teaching in Sri Lankan Contest.","output":"Academics' attitudes towards online education amidst the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the creation of the problem-oriented medical record, the building of problem lists has been the focus of many studies. To date, this issue is not well resolved, and building an appropriate contextualized problem list is still a challenge. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to present the process of building a shared multipurpose common problem list at the Geneva University Hospitals. This list aims to bridge the gap between clinicians language expressed in free text and secondary uses requiring structured information. METHODS: We focused on the needs of clinicians by building a list of uniquely identified expressions to support their daily activities. In the second stage, these expressions were connected to additional information to build a complex graph of information. A list of 45,946 expressions manually extracted from clinical documents was manually curated and encoded in multiple semantic dimensions, such as International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision; International Classification of Primary Care 2nd edition; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms; or dimensions dictated by specific usages, such as identifying expressions specific to a domain, a gender, or an intervention. The list was progressively deployed for clinicians with an iterative process of quality control, maintenance, and improvements, including the addition of new expressions or dimensions for specific needs. The problem management of the electronic health record allowed the measurement and correction of encoding based on real-world use. RESULTS: The list was deployed in production in January 2017 and was regularly updated and deployed in new divisions of the hospital. Over 4 years, 684,102 problems were created using the list. The proportion of free-text entries decreased progressively from 37.47% (8321/22,206) in December 2017 to 18.38% (4547/24,738) in December 2020. In the last version of the list, over 14 dimensions were mapped to expressions, among which 5 were international classifications and 8 were other classifications for specific uses. The list became a central axis in the electronic health record, being used for many different purposes linked to care, such as surgical planning or emergency wards, or in research, for various predictions using machine learning techniques. CONCLUSIONS: This study breaks with common approaches primarily by focusing on real clinicians language when expressing patients problems and secondarily by mapping whatever is required, including controlled vocabularies to answer specific needs. This approach improves the quality of the expression of patients problems while allowing the building of as many structured dimensions as needed to convey semantics according to specific contexts. The method is shown to be scalable, sustainable, and efficient at hiding the complexity of semantics or the burden of constraint-structured problem list entry for clinicians. Ongoing work is analyzing the impact of this approach on how clinicians express patients problems.","output":"Building a Shared, Scalable, and Sustainable Source for the Problem-Oriented Medical Record: Developmental Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is attributed to direct or indirect unguarded contact with infected subjects or inanimate objects.

Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction. These data demonstrated that although EDU pretreatment appears not to prevent initial ozone damage, it does reduce the infiltration of PMNs and might therefore prevent amplification of the injury associated with this cell type.","output":"Pretreatment with EDU decreases rat lung cellular responses to ozone"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The epidemic of COVID-19 has spread dramatically affecting more than 140 million people and leading to more than 3 million deaths. We aimed to investigate what factors pose a risk for disease severity and death. METHODS: We prospectively included patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from San Marco Hospital (Catania, Italy), who had been admitted by Dec 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, were collected and compared between severe and non-severe patients, as well as between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable methods to explore the risk factors associated with disease severity and death. RESULTS: Overall, 463 patients were included, of whom 33.7% had severe disease and 14.0% died in hospital. Patients with severe disease were older (p < 0.001) and more likely to have had heart failure (p = 0.038). With respect to the risk of death, increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, and chronic renal failure were more common among non-survivors than survivors (p-values<0.05). In particular, a logistic regression model confirmed age (OR = 1.14; 95%CI=1.10-1.20; p < 0.001) and heart failure (OR = 14.8; 95%CI=2.7-80.8; p = 0.002) as the main risk factors for death. The comparison between the first and the second waves of the epidemic did not reveal differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, however, the treatment approach has changed significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of severe and/or fatal COVID-19 was higher among older patients with comorbidities. These findings lay the foundation for prediction models that could inform shielding policies and vaccine prioritisation strategies. KEY MESSAGES: The risk of severe and fatal COVID-19 is substantially elevated among older patients with previous comorbidities. These findings are important to inform shielding policies and vaccine prioritisation strategies.","output":"Risk factors for severe and fatal COVID-19 among patients admitted to an Italian hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background In December 2020, Public Health England with NHS Test and Trace initiated a pilot study in which close contacts of people with confirmed COVID-19 were given the option to carryout lateral flow device antigen tests at home, as an alternative to self-isolation for 10-14 days. In this study, we evaluated acceptability of and engagement with daily testing, and assessed levels of adherence to the rules relating to behaviour following positive or negative test results. Methods We conducted a service evaluation of a pilot study, involving an online cross-sectional survey offered to adult (> 18 years) contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who were invited to participate in seven days of daily testing instead of isolation. We used a comparison group of contacts who were not offered testing and performed self-isolation. Herein, we examine survey responses from a subset of those who took part in the pilot study and who responded to the evaluation questionnaire. Results Acceptability of daily testing was lower among survey respondents who were not offered the option of having it and among people from ethnic minority groups. Overall, 52% of respondents reported being more likely to share details of people that they had been in contact with following a positive test result, if they knew that their contacts would be offered the option of daily testing. Only 2% reported that they would be less likely to provide details of their contacts. On the days that they were trying to self-isolate, 19% of participants reported that they left the house, with no significant demographic group differences. Following a negative test, 13% of respondents reported that they increased their contacts, but most (58%) reported having fewer risky contacts. Conclusions Our data suggest that daily testing is potentially acceptable, and may facilitate sharing contact details of close contacts among those who test positive for COVID-19, and promote adherence to self-isolation. A better understanding is needed of how to make this option more acceptable for all households. The impact of receiving a negative test on behaviour remains a risk that needs to be monitored and mitigated by appropriate messaging. Future research should examine attitudes and behaviour in a context where infection levels are lower, testing is more familiar, much of the population has been vaccinated and restrictions on activity have been reduced.","output":"Engagement with daily testing instead of self-isolating in contacts of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Premiers en matire de dfiance vaccinale relative au COVID-19 aux c?ts des serbes, des croates, les fran?ais ntaient quenviron 40 %  souhaiter se faire vacciner en dcembre dernier contre la COVID-19.

Defense responses motivate organisms to detect and react to threats and potential danger as a precursor to anxiety. Accurate measurement of temporal defense responses is important for understanding clinical anxiety and mood disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Within these conditions, anxiety is defined as a state of prolonged defense response elicitation to a threat that is ambiguous or unspecific. In this study, we aimed to develop a data-driven approach to capture temporal defense response elicitation through a multi-modality data analysis of physiological signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and eye-tracking information. A fear conditioning paradigm was adopted to develop a defense response classification model. From a classification model based on 42 feature sets, a higher order crossing feature set-based model was chosen for further analysis with cross-validation loss of 0.0462 (SEM: 0.0077). To validate our model, we compared predicted defense response occurrence ratios from a comprehensive situation that generates defense responses by watching movie clips with fear awareness and threat existence predictability, which have been reported to correlate with defense response elicitation in previous studies. We observed that defense response occurrence ratios are correlated with threat existence predictability, but not with fear awareness. These results are similar to those of previous studies using comprehensive situations. Our study provides insight into measurement of temporal defense responses via a novel approach, which can improve understanding of anxiety and related clinical disorders for neurobiological and clinical researchers.","output":"Using physiological signals to predict temporal defense responses: a multi-modality analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As a crucial element of Chinas political and cultural life, banners, or bioy, have been around for decades, in support of national-level policies such as family planning and the governing mottos of Presidents.

Based on the analysis of the early COVID-19 banners and the related online comments, this article analyzes the language style patterns of the banners and the mode of banner circulation. The study found that the manner in which the banners are circulated goes beyond a unidirectional path of on-site instant communication. This process is facilitated by social networks and mass media, which, during circulation, twice created a banner upgrade. The upgrades created decontextualization and function extension of the banners, whereas audience feedback triggered an adaptive adjustment of the language style of the banners.

Older adults (over age 65) are perceived as most physiologically vulnerable to COVID-19 and at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to social isolation imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias we used a random sampling of older adults to understand uptake and acceptance of technologies to support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in technology use for virtual socialization amongst older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based regionally representative survey using random-digit dialing to participants over age 65 living in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with open-text responses analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults with an average age of 72 years old and 63.7% female. Most respondents (89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others and slightly more than half (56%) reported using technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. 55.9% of respondents reported adopting new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported key barriers to using technology including: (1) lack of access (including finance, knowledge, and age); (2) lack of interest (including a preference for telephone, and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults reported numerous facilitators, including: (1) knowledge of technologies (whether self-taught or via external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searching); (3) technology accessibility (including environments, user-friendly technology, and receiving clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (because everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults use of technology is limited by sampling biases, but the current study that used random sampling demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Virtual socialization is most promising to mitigate potential mental health effects related to virus containment strategies. Addressing barriers by mobilizing telephone training and task lists, and mobilizing facilitators described by participants such as facilitated socialization activities are important strategies that can be implemented within and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.","output":"Older adults' experiences of technology use for socialization during the COVID-19 pandemic: A regionally representative cross-sectional survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dramatically altered our lives in 2020, a vivid reminder that infectious disease continues to threaten society..","output":"Meet the Future Leaders in the Field of Host-Microbe Interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Medical Council of India (MCI) implemented competency-based curriculum for undergraduate medical education nationwide in 2019, with assessment of competencies being its integral component.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) underscores the need to innovate and accelerate the development of effective vaccination strategies against EIDs. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules play a central role in the immune system by determining the peptide repertoire displayed to the T-cell compartment. Genetic polymorphisms of the HLA system thus confer a strong variability in vaccine-induced immune responses and may complicate the selection of vaccine candidates, because the distribution and frequencies of HLA alleles are highly variable among different ethnic groups. Herein, we build on the emerging paradigm of rational epitope-based vaccine design, by describing an immunoinformatics tool (Predivac-3.0) for proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery that accounts for ethnic-level variations in immune responsiveness. Predivac-3.0 implements both CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitope predictions based on HLA allele frequencies retrieved from the Allele Frequency Net Database. The tool was thoroughly assessed, proving comparable performances (AUC ~0.9) against four state-of-the-art pan-specific immunoinformatics methods capable of population-level analysis (NetMHCPan-4.0, Pickpocket, PSSMHCPan and SMM), as well as a strong accuracy on proteome-wide T-cell epitope predictions for HIV-specific immune responses in the Japanese population. The utility of the method was investigated for the COVID-19 pandemic, by performing in silico T-cell epitope mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein according to the ethnic context of the countries where the ChAdOx1 vaccine is currently initiating phase III clinical trials. Potentially immunodominant CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell epitopes and population coverages were predicted for each population (the Epitope Discovery mode), along with optimized sets of broadly recognized (promiscuous) T-cell epitopes maximizing coverage in the target populations (the Epitope Optimization mode). Population-specific epitope-rich regions (T-cell epitope clusters) were further predicted in protein antigens based on combined criteria of epitope density and population coverage. Overall, we conclude that Predivac-3.0 holds potential to contribute in the understanding of ethnic-level variations of vaccine-induced immune responsiveness and to guide the development of epitope-based next-generation vaccines against emerging pathogens, whose geographic distributions and populations in need of vaccinations are often well-defined for regional epidemics.","output":"A Proteome-Wide Immunoinformatics Tool to Accelerate T-Cell Epitope Discovery and Vaccine Design in the Context of Emerging Infectious Diseases: An Ethnicity-Oriented Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: More than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing. Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODS: We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in ?le-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. RESULTS: We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. CONCLUSIONS: As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity.

Particularly, recent evidences suggested that men may be considered as at higher risk of poor prognosis or death once the infection occurred and concerns surfaced in regard of the risk of a possible testicular injury due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Several data support the existence of a bivalent role of testosterone (T) in driving poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. On one hand, this is attributable to the fact that T may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells by means of an enhanced expression of transmembrane serine-protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). At the same time, younger man with normal testicular function compared to women of similar age are prone to develop a blunted immune response against SARS-CoV-2, being exposed to less viral clearance and more viral shedding and systemic spread of the disease. Conversely, low levels of serum T observed in hypogonadal men predispose them to a greater background systemic inflammation, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, and immune system dysfunction, hence driving harmful consequences once SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred. Finally, SARS-CoV-2, as a systemic disease, may also affect testicles with possible concerns for current and future testicular efficiency. Preliminary data suggested that SARS-CoV-2 genome is not normally found in gonads and gametes, therefore sex transmission could be excluded as a possible way to spread the COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most data support a role of T as a bivalent risk factor for poor prognosis (high/normal in younger; lower in elderly) in COVID-19. However, the impact of medical treatment aimed to modify T homeostasis for improving the prognosis of affected patients is unknown in this clinical setting. In addition, testicular damage may be a harmful consequence of the infection even in case it occurred asymptomatically but no long-term evidences are currently available to confirm and quantify this phenomenon. Different authors excluded the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in sperm and oocytes, thus limiting worries about both a potential sexual and gamete-to-embryos transmission of COVID-19.

We aimed to provide robust estimates, accounting for censoring and ascertainment biases. METHODS: We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation. FINDINGS: Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 178 days (95% credible interval [CrI] 169C192) and to hospital discharge to be 247 days (229C281). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70 117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 367% (95% CrI 356C380). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 138% (123C153), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (032% [027C038] in those aged <60 years vs 64% [57C72] in those aged 60 years), up to 134% (112C159) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 14% [04C35] in those aged <60 years [n=360] and 45% [18C111] in those aged 60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 066% (039C133), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 184% (110C76) in those aged 80 years or older.

Pathogenic treponemes is a Gram-negative, motile, spirochete pathogen that causes syphilis in human.

Ccarateum causes pinta. Out of these four high morbidity diseases, venereal syphilis is mediated by sexual contact; the other three diseases are transmitted by close personal contact. The global distribution of syphilis is alarming and there is an increasing need of proper treatment and preventive measures. Unfortunately, effective measures are limited. RESULTS: Here, the genome sequences of 53 T. pallidum strains isolated from different parts of the world and a diverse range of hosts were comparatively analysed using pan-genomic strategy. Phylogenomic, pan-genomic, core genomic and singleton analysis disclosed the close connection among all strains of the pathogen T. pallidum, its clonal behaviour and showed increases in the sizes of the pan-genome.

Treatment effect favoring intervention was seen across all clinical outcomes in the extended time window (absolute risk difference of 19.3% for mRS 0-2 at 90 days). There were more asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage events within the intervention arm (48.5% versus 11.5%, P = .004) but no difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS Patients with an extended time window could potentially benefit from endovascular treatment. Ongoing randomized controlled trials using imaging to identify late presenters with favorable brain physiology will help cement the paradigm of using time windows to select the population for acute imaging and imaging to select individual patients for therapy.","output":"Time for a Time Window Extension: Insights from Late Presenters in the ESCAPE Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The principles behind the taxonomy of the microorganisms, especially the -molecular approach (using the sequence of the 16S RNA in the small subunit of the ribosome) in the identification of bacteria, are discussed.

This study was performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 2 such technologies, PCRCelectrospray ionization (ESI)/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS, with respect to phenotypic and biochemical profiling as a reference standard method. A positive challenge set of blood culture bottles was used to compare PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS performance on a matched set of samples. METHODS: We performed characterization of bloodstream infections from blood cultures using the Ibis T5000 PCR-ESI/MS and the Bruker MALDI Biotyper 2.0 (MALDI-TOF/MS) platforms for microbial identification. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by independent comparison of each method to phenotypic and biochemical characterization with Vitek2 analysis as the reference standard identification. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy, represented as positive agreement, at the genus level was 0.965 (0.930C0.984) for PCR-ESI/MS and 0.969 (0.935C0.987) for MALDI-TOF/MS, and at the species level was 0.952 (0.912C0.974) with PCR-ESI/MS and 0.943 (0.902C0.968) for MALDI-TOF/MS. No statistically significant difference was found between PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS in the ability to rapidly identify microorganisms isolated from blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that PCR-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS are equivalent in their ability to characterize bloodstream infections with respect to the reference standard, and highlight key differences in the methods that allow for each method to have a unique niche as a tool for rapid identification of microbes in blood cultures.","output":"Comparative Analysis of PCRCElectrospray Ionization/Mass Spectrometry (MS) and MALDI-TOF/MS for the Identification of Bacteria and Yeast from Positive Blood Culture Bottles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Driven by demand for high standards in university education, efforts have been made in the UK to address the perceived imbalance between teaching and research. However, teaching is still perceived by many as having less credibility and is attributed less importance. The purpose of our research was to explore how distinct types of academic job profiles (research or education focused, or balanced) impact on biomedical scientists' perceptions of the lecturer role. Specifically, we investigated the experiences of biomedical scientists in post\\\\1990 medical schools, which are known for their commitment to excellence in both research and education. We conducted 22 face\\\\to\\\\face, semi\\\\structured interviews with biomedical scientists in five schools. Focusing on experiences of work, the interviews covered: motivations, role expectations, teaching, research and career. The recorded qualitative data were transcribed and then analysed thematically. Our results, offering an insight into the working lives of biomedical scientists in medical education, suggest that in settings with a dual emphasis on education and research, individuals on balanced contracts can experience a strong pull between research and teaching. In addition to posing significant challenges with respect to workload management, this can impact profoundly on professional identity. In contrast to the balanced role, research or education focused roles appear to have clearer requirements, leading to higher employee satisfaction. We conclude that to assist the educational mission of Higher Education, attention should be paid to balanced contracts, to (a) ensure employee support, (b) mitigate against negative perceptions of teaching, and ultimately, (c) guard against staff attrition.","output":"Teaching, research or balanced?

In 2019 we had over 21,000 minutes of Operating Room/Procedural Area (ORPA) holds where patients were recovered in the procedural areas. Recovering patients in the Operating Room (OR) has financial implications, since there is loss of revenue when the room is not being utilized for a scheduled procedure. In addition to the financial cost of delayed OR start times, dissatisfaction of the patients, surgery staff, and surgeons was also evident. The goal was to streamline, coordinate, and optimize patient recovery in a value focused environment while also assigning post procedural/surgical patients to the appropriate level of recovery. Our goal was a 40% decrease in the time delays associated with ORPA holds over the course of 6 months. We identified a multitude of causes and developed a process where Anesthesia recovers patients in the recovery room as opposed to the procedural areas, which we call the Anesthesia Recovery Program (ARP). Our ARP plan is triggered whenever an ORPA hold will exceed 10 minutes. The anesthesia team is directed to move the patient to a recovery room slot that is not staffed by RNs. The anesthesia provider monitors the patient in the recovery area until an RN-staffed slot becomes available. Additionally, a decision tree was created with guidelines in place in order to stratify recovery area assignments by optimizing the recovery workflow. The initial results showed an 85% decrease in ORPA holds. Having patients recovered by anesthesia providers improved turnover times and increased elective cases during business hours.

The formation of osteoid or early cartilage was observed after 4 weeks in specimens treated with SDF-1 and either BMP-2 or TGF-1. The density of cellular infiltrate and formation of differentiated tissue were lower in scaffolds treated only with BMP-2 or TGF-1.

METHODS The device comprises a 5-Fr catheter, a 14-mm long stainless steel tube for generating the pulsed water jet, a nozzle and an optical quartz fiber. The pulsed water jet was generated at pulse rates of 3 Hz by irradiating the physiological saline (4C) within the stainless steel tube with an holmium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser at 1.1 J/pulse. Mechanical characteristics were evaluated using a force meter. The device was used only for the part of submucosal dissection in the swine ESD model. Tissues removed using the pulsed jet device and a conventional electrocautery device, and the esophagus, were histologically examined to assess thermal damage. RESULTS The peak impact force was observed at a stand-off distance of 40 mm (1.1 J/pulse). ESD using the pulsed jet device was successful, as the tissue specimens showed precise dissection of the submucosal layer. The extent of thermal injury was significantly lower in the dissected bed using the pulsed jet device.

The old model consisted of Standard Biopsy (SBx), that is random sampling of the prostate gland under ultrasound guidance (TRUS), in subjects with clinical suspicion of PCa. This involves the risk of not diagnosing a high percentage of tumors (up to 30%) and of an incorrect risk stratification.

The inflammasome consists of a cytosolic pattern recognition receptor, an adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis\\\\associated speck\\\\like protein containing a CARD) and the protease caspase\\\\1. Assembly of the complex leads to the cleavage and activation of caspase\\\\1 that triggers processing and release of the cytokines interleukin (IL)\\\\1 and IL\\\\18, and ultimately cell death via the process of pyroptosis.

Very few case reports exist about cardiac thrombus in COVID-19 patients with Myocardial infarction (MI) but our patient purely had increased thromboembolic risk from COVID-19 without MI. CASE PRESENTATION: A 49-year-old male with a history of HTN, IDDM, CKD stage 3, and asthma presented to the hospital with six days of progressive dyspnea with fever, fatigue, and cough. He tested positive for COVID-19 two days prior. He was hypoxic at 83% on room air. Pertinent physical exam revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally and no murmurs. Lab work showed creatinine 1.93 mg/dl, troponin 0.357 ng/ml, B-natriuretic peptide (BNP) 275 pg/ml. D-dimer 1,369 ng/ml, Ferritin 1,569 ng/ml, and CRP >8 mg/dl. Chest x-ray showed bilateral patchy nodular opacities. CTA chest showed pneumonia and bilateral effusions without pulmonary embolism. The patient was started on oxygen supplementation, dexamethasone, and enoxaparin 30 mg every 12 hours. On day 2, Remdesivir was initiated as kidney function had improved. The enoxaparin dose was increased to 0.5mg/kg (60 mg every 12 hours) due to worsening D-dimer at 2268 ng/ml. On day 3, he had worsening respiratory failure and was transitioned to a high flow respiratory system on 60L. Repeat BNP increased to 475.4 pg/ml and D-dimer to >7650 ng/ml. Troponin plateaued at 0.3 ng/ml. He was switched to a low-intensity heparin protocol of 10 units/kg/hr. A trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed an ejection fraction of 57% with a questionable apical clot and without wall motion abnormality. A TTE with contrast showed a spherical echogenic mass 1.87 x 1.64 cm, consistent with left ventricular (LV) thrombus attached to the septum. He was then switched to a high-intensity heparin protocol of 15 units/kg/hr and then transitioned to warfarin with a plan for outpatient cardiac MRI. On day 11, he was discharged home on 2L of oxygen. DISCUSSION: Thromboembolic disease is a well-known complication of COVID-19. The pathophysiology of thromboembolism in COVID-19 is multifactorial including platelet dysfunction, viral-mediated endothelial inflammation, hypercoagulability, and acquired antiphospholipid antibodies.LV thrombus is a known complication of MI and dilated cardiomyopathy but our patient did not have associated MI. His only apparent predisposing factor was hypercoagulability due to COVID-19. TTE with contrast increases the visibility of the thrombus. But, cardiac MRI with contrast remains the gold standard for its diagnosis. Anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment as it reduces the major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac thrombus is a rare thromboembolic phenomenon that needs to be considered in COVID-19 patients with or without MI. Immediate parenteral anticoagulation is key for reducing complications. REFERENCE #1: Roberts KA, Colley L, Agbaedeng TA, Ellison-Hughes GM, Ross MD.

In Protocol B, after 6 minutes of untreated VF, pigs received 6 minutes of conventional CPR flat, and after ROSC were randomized HUP versus Flat as in Protocol A. The primary endpoint was cerebral perfusion pressure (CerPP). Multivariate analysis-of-variance (MANOVA) for repeated measures was used. Data were reported as mean  SD. RESULTS: In Protocol A, intracranial pressure (ICP) (mmHg) was significantly lower post-ROSC with HUP (9.1  5.5) versus Flat (18.5  5.1) (p < 0.001). Conversely, CerPP was higher with HUP (62.5  19.9) versus Flat (53.2  19.1) (p = 0.004), respectively. Protocol A and B results comparing HUP versus Flat were similar. CONCLUSION: Post-ROSC head and thorax elevation in a porcine model of cardiac arrest resulted in higher CerPP and lower ICP values, regardless of VF duration or CPR method.

Recently, we showed that DDX3X specifically recognizes the HCV 3' untranslated region (UTR), leading to the activation of IKK- and a cascade of lipogenic signaling to facilitate lipid droplet biogenesis and viral assembly (Q. Li, V. Pene, S. Krishnamurthy, H. Cha, and T. J. Liang, Nat Med 19:722-729, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3190). The interaction of DDX3X with HCV core protein seems to be dispensable for its proviral role. In this study, through systematic imaging and biochemical and virologic approaches, we identified a dynamic association between DDX3X and various cellular compartments and viral elements mediating multiple functions of DDX3X in productive HCV infection. Upon HCV infection, the HCV 3'UTR interacts with DDX3X and IKK-, which redistribute to speckle-like cytoplasmic structures shown to be stress granules (SGs). As viral proteins accumulate in infected cells, DDX3X granules together with SG-associated proteins redistribute and colocalize with HCV core protein around lipid droplets (LDs). IKK-, however, does not relocate to the LD but translocates to the nucleus. In HCV-infected cells, various HCV nonstructural proteins also interact or colocalize with DDX3X in close proximity to SGs and LDs, consistent with the tight juxtaposition of the replication complex and the assembly site at the surface of LDs. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of DDX3X and multiple SG components markedly inhibits HCV infection. Our data suggest that DDX3X initiates a multifaceted cellular program involving dynamic associations with HCV RNA and proteins, IKK-, SG, and LD surfaces for its crucial role in the HCV life cycle. IMPORTANCE DDX3X is a proviral host factor for HCV infection. Recently, we showed that DDX3X binds to the HCV 3'UTR, activating IKK- and cellular lipogenesis to facilitate viral assembly (Q. Li et al., Nat Med 19:722-729, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3190). Here, we report associations of DDX3X with various cellular compartments and viral elements that mediate its multiple functions in the HCV life cycle. Upon infection, the HCV 3'UTR redistributes DDX3X and IKK- to speckle-like cytoplasmic structures shown to be SGs. Subsequently, interactions between DDX3X, SG, and HCV proteins facilitate the translocation of DDX3X-SG complexes to the LD surface. HCV nonstructural proteins are shown to colocalize with DDX3X in close proximity to SGs and LDs, consistent with the tight juxtaposition of the HCV replication complex and assembly site at the LD surface. Our data demonstrate that DDX3X initiates a multifaceted cellular program involving dynamic associations with HCV elements, IKK-, SGs, and LDs for its critical role in HCV infection.","output":"Dynamic Interaction of Stress Granules, DDX3X, and IKK- Mediates Multiple Functions in Hepatitis C Virus Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The economic impact of COVID-19 has been catastrophic for state and local governments. By Federal Reserve estimates, income and sales revenues will have declined by over $50 billion in fiscal year 2020 and may decline by as much as $137 billion in 2021. Pandemics are, of course, not the only catastrophic risks we may face in coming years. Financial crises, natural disasters, social justice crises, and climate change-related catastrophes all present serious risks, and often have a compounding and exacerbating effect on one another. These risks are also especially salient for state and local governments, which are at the forefront of crisis response. The legitimacy of government is tested and measured by its ability to respond to these challenges, but existing state and local financial frameworks have proven too thin and brittle to absorb shocks like COVID-19 or the Financial Crisis. This commentary describes how a national resilience fund, with subaccounts created for each state and territory, would strengthen the ability of state and local governments to respond to crises that are likely to arise in the coming years. A national resilience fund could be based on a familiar, flexible structure that has been in use for decades: the unemployment trust fund. Such a structure would help insulate the resilience fund from local political pressures, yet would have the financial strength to help state and local governments absorb the costs associated with severe crises such as pandemics and natural disasters, thereby helping to preserve governmental legitimacy in times of severe social stress.","output":"Toward a National Resilience Fund"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies the intergenerational impact of parental job loss on school performance during the Great Recession in Spain.

The null hypothesis was that there would be no differences between study groups regarding bleaching sensitivity. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Sixty patients participated in this split-mouth study. The subjects received desensitizing-containing hydrogen peroxide in half of the maxillary arch, and the other half received a desensitizing-free hydrogen peroxide, defined by random sequence, in two dental bleaching sessions. The bleaching sensitivity was evaluated during bleaching and from 1 h to 48 h after each bleaching session using a visual analog scale and numeric rating scale; the McNemar test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used for statistical analysis. The color was measured at baseline and 30 days post-bleaching, evaluated with paired t tests (P = .05). RESULTS: Statistically similar risks of bleaching sensitivity were observed (P = 1.000), but the intensity of bleaching sensitivity was lower (P < .011) on average by 1.32 visual analog scale units in the group bleached with the desensitizer-containing gel during up to 24 h assessment times.

However, the emergence of DCTs has amplified concerns over privacy issues as consumers are confronted with the ethical dilemma that arises regarding serving public and private interests. In other words, to what extent are consumers willing to negotiate their privacy concerns to gain perceived social benefits? Drawing on Social Exchange Theory as the theoretical lens to examine interpersonal relations between the government and consumers, this study investigates the extent to which consumers' perceived social benefits (e.g., reciprocity, trust, and reputation) mediate the relationship between privacy concerns and the intention to use DCT applications. Based on 269 usable responses, the results revealed that government trust was insignificant in mediating the relationship between privacy concerns and intention to use the DCT application. Rather, the expected reciprocal benefits and reputation enhancement were found to have significant mediating effects. Perceived government regulation was also found to moderate the relationship between privacy concerns and government trust. The paper concludes with suggestions for practitioners and policymakers on the plausible strategies to encourage the adoption of DCT applications. ? 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","output":"Navigating privacy concerns through societal benefits: A case of digital contact tracing applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Evaluating the impact of 6 weeks of LIVE online exercise classes in the West of Scotland Adult CF Unit using the Beam platform for people with cystic fibrosis (pwCF).

Prompt identification of patients at risk of intubation or death is un unmet need. Objective: To derive a prognostic score for the risk of intubation or death in patients with critical COVID-19 by assessing biomarkers of hypercoagulability, endothelial cell activation and inflammation and a large panel of clinical analytes. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational monocentric study enrolling 118 patients with COVID-19 admitted in the intensive care unit. At the 1st day of ICU admission all patients were assessed for the following biomarkers : protein C, protein S, antithrombin, D-Dimer, fibrin monomers, factors VIIa, V, XII, XII, VIII, von Willebrand antigen, fibrinogen, procoagulant phospholipid dependent clotting time, TFPI, thrombomodulin, P-selectin, heparinase, microparticles exposing tissue factor, IL-6, complement C3a, C5a, thrombin generation, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, hemogram, platelet count) and clinical predictors. The clinical outcomes were intubation and mortality during hospitalization in ICU. Results: The intubation and mortality rate were 70 % and 18% respectively. Multivariate analysis led to the derivation of the COMPASS- COVID19-ICU score composed of P-Selectin, D-Dimer, free TFPI, TF activity, IL-6 and FXII, age and duration of hospitalization. The score predicted the risk of intubation or death with high sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.92, respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Critical COVID-19 is related with severe endothelial cell activation and hypercoagulability orchestrated in the context of inflammation. The COMPASS-COVID19-ICU score is an accurate predictive model for the evaluation of the risk of mechanical ventilation and death in patients with critical COVID-19. The assessment with the COMPASS- COVID-19-ICU score is feasible in tertiary hospitals.

METHODS AND RESULTS: DSS, i.e., Dextran Sulfate Sodium, (3%) was administered to C57BL/6J mice in the drinking water daily for 6 days in DSS and curcumin groups. Then mice in curcumin groups were orally administered with 50 or 150 mg/kg curcumin for 7 days. On day 13, mice were sacrificed. Results showed that oral administration with curcumin relieved macroscopic pathological manifestations, e.g. colon length and histological change. Moreover, it enhanced intestinal barrier via increasing expression of tight junction proteins, e.g. occludin, ZO-1, claudin-3; alleviated DSS-induced intestinal apoptosis via suppressing caspase-3 pathway; mitigated intestinal inflammation via inhibiting the MAPK/NFB/STAT3 pathway.

At present, the understanding of PDCoV pathogenesis is very limited, which seriously hinders effective prevention and control. In this study, liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LCCMS/MS) combined with tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling was performed to compare the differential expression of proteins in PDCoV-infected and mock-infected LLC-PK cells at 18 h post-infection (hpi). In addition, the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) technique was used to verify the quantitative proteome data. A total of 4624 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were quantitated, of which 128 were significantly upregulated, and 147 were significantly downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that these DEPs were involved mainly in the defense response, apoptosis, and the immune system, and several DEPs may be related to interferon-stimulated genes and the immune system. Based on DEP bioinformatics analysis, we propose that PDCoV infection may utilize the apoptosis pathway of host cells to achieve maximum viral replication. Meanwhile, the host may be able to stimulate the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway to resist the virus. Overall, in this study, we presented the first application of proteomics analysis to determine the protein profile of PDCoV-infected cells, which provides valuable information with respect to better understanding the host response to PDCoV infection and the specific pathogenesis of PDCoV infection.","output":"Tandem Mass Tag-Based Quantitative Proteome Analysis of Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)-Infected LLC Porcine Kidney Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report the first experimental parametric analysis of subwavelength monolithic high-contrast grating (MHCG) mirrors.

Combinations of social distancing, and test, trace, and isolate strategies can reduce the number of new infections per infected individual below 1, thus driving declines in case numbers, but may be both challenging and costly. These interventions must also be maintained until development and (now likely) mass deployment of a vaccine (or therapeutics), since otherwise, many susceptible individuals are still at risk of infection. We use a simple analytical model to explore how low levels of infection, combined with vaccination, determine the trajectory to community immunity. Understanding the repercussions of the biological characteristics of the viral life cycle in this scenario is of considerable importance. We provide a simple description of this process by modelling the scenario where the effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] is maintained at 1. Since the additional complexity imposed by the strength and duration of transmission-blocking immunity is not yet clear, we use our framework to probe the impact of these uncertainties. Through intuitive analytical relations, we explore how the necessary magnitude of vaccination rates and mitigation efforts depends crucially on the durations of natural and vaccinal immunity. We also show that our framework can encompass seasonality or preexisting immunity due to epidemic dynamics prior to strong mitigation measures. Taken together, our simple conceptual model illustrates the importance of individual and vaccinal immunity for community immunity, and that the quantification of individuals immunized against SARS-CoV-2 is paramount.","output":"Trajectory of individual immunity and vaccination required for SARS-CoV-2 community immunity: a conceptual investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly worldwide since the first cases were observed in Wuhan, China.

As there is no proper medicine or vaccine against the virus SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 to control the spread of the virus, all the countries are taking many steps as preventive measures, like lockdown, stay-at-home, social distancing, sanitization, use of mask, etc. For almost three months of lockdown many countries are relaxing the lockdown period and the movement of people. The objective of this study is to develop a new mathematical model, called the SEIQRS model in imprecise environment and to find out the essentiality of quarantine, stay-at-home orders, lockdown as precautionary measures to protect the human community. Methods: In this study, after developing the COVID-19 SEIQRS model, the SEIQRS fuzzy model and the SEIQRS interval model are constructed by taking parameters as triangular fuzzy numbers and interval numbers respectively. Solution curves are drawn for two imprecise models by using MATLAB R2014a software package and the sensitivity analysis is also performed with respect to the control parameters. The next generation matrix approach is adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R0) from the SEIQRS model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. Results: The basic reproduction number (R0) is calculated for this model and to get the stability and disease free equilibrium the value of the basic reproduction number must be less than 1. Also, we find the solution curves in different uncertain environments and sensitivity studies show the importance of newly added population (), rate of spreading asymptomatic infection ( ), rate of developing symptoms of infection ( ), proportion of infected population in quarantine ( ). Interpretation & conclusions: Our model shows that quarantine, lockdown are essential to control the spread of the disease as at present there is no such medicine or vaccine to combat COVID-19. Once the virus establishes transmission within the community, it will very difficult to stop the infection. As a measure of public health, healthcare and community preparedness, it would be serious to control any impending outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. ? 2022 L&H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

Alternatives to in-office outpatient medical evaluations are necessary. We aimed to analyze how quickly orthopedic surgery providers at a large academic institution adopted telemedicine, and identify any factors that were associated with earlier or \\"faster\\" telemedicine adoption. Methods: We analyzed the telemedicine activity of 39 providers within the Department of Orthopedic Surgery between March 16, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and constructed logistic regression models to identify characteristics with significant association to earlier or faster telemedicine adoption. Results: No significant predictors of percentage of visits conducted via telemedicine were found. However, increased experience and practice at multiple locations was associated with slower telemedicine adoption time, while Professor level academic rank was associated with a faster time to achieving 10% of pre-COVID visit volumes via telemedicine. Higher pre-COVID visit volumes were also significantly associated with faster telemedicine adoption. Demographic factors, including, age, gender, practice locations, academic degrees, pediatric specialty, and use of physician assistants/nurse practitioners, were not found to have significant associations with telemedicine use. Conclusions: These results indicate that telemedicine has an important role to play within academic orthopedic surgery practices, with a wide and diverse range of orthopedic surgery providers choosing to utilize it during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previous studies on other betacoronaviruses suggested that betacoronavirus infection is associated with the host autophagy pathway. However, it is unclear whether any components of autophagy or virophagy can be therapeutic targets for COVID-19 treatment. In this report, we examined the antiviral effect of four well-characterized small molecule inhibitors that target the key cellular factors involved in key steps of the autophagy pathway. They include small molecules targeting the ULK1/Atg1 complex involved in the induction stage of autophagy (ULK1 inhibitor SBI0206965), the ATG14/Beclin1/VPS34 complex involved in the nucleation step of autophagy (class III PI3-kinase inhibitor VPS34-IN1), and a widely-used autophagy inhibitor that persistently inhibits class I and temporary inhibits class III PI3-kinase (3-MA) and a clinically approved autophagy inhibitor that suppresses autophagy by inhibiting lysosomal acidification and prevents the formation of autophagolysosome (HCQ). Surprisingly, not all the tested autophagy inhibitors suppressed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that inhibition of class III PI3-kinase involved in the initiation step of both canonical and noncanonical autophagy potently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 at a nano-molar level. In addition, this specific kinase inhibitor VPS34-IN1, and its bioavailable analogue VVPS34-IN1, potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in ex vivo human lung tissues.

In this paper, we present an optimization framework to address the dynamic double-dose vaccine allocation problem whereby the available vaccine doses must be administered to different age-groups to minimize specific societal objectives. In particular, we first identify an age-dependent Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemic model including an extension capturing partially and fully vaccinated people, whereby we account for age-dependent immunity and infectiousness levels together with disease severity. Second, we leverage our model to frame the dynamic age-dependent vaccine allocation problem for different societal objectives, such as the minimization of infections or fatalities, and solve it with nonlinear programming techniques. Finally, we carry out a numerical case study with real-world data from The Netherlands. Our results show how different societal objectives can significantly alter the optimal vaccine allocation strategy. For instance, we find that minimizing the overall number of infections results in delaying second doses, whilst to minimize fatalities it is important to fully vaccinate the elderly first.","output":"Optimizing Vaccine Allocation Strategies in Pandemic Outbreaks: An Optimal Control Approach (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we investigate controlling images of Latinx immigrants in the US press.

PEth allows for the development of a CM model that includes increasingly less frequent monitoring of abstinence to assist high risk groups, such as formerly homeless individuals, maintain long-term abstinence. AIMS: Investigate whether PEth-based CM intervention targeting alcohol abstinence in formerly homeless, currently housed individuals with alcohol use disorders is: (1) acceptable and feasible for housing program tenants and personnel; and is associated with increased (2) alcohol abstinence and (3) housing tenure.

The study evaluated the effectiveness of this technique in terms of soft tissue contours in esthetic areas with the use of the pink esthetic score (PES). MATERIALS AND METHODS In this retrospective study, 39 consecutive patients were treated and followed by two experienced clinicians for single-tooth implant treatment in the esthetic zone. Treatment consisted of flapless extraction, immediate implant placement, inorganic bovine bone filling of the periimplant gap, and connective tissue grafting. A provisional crown was placed at the time of implant placement. The final crown was positioned 5 to 8 months after surgery. To assess the esthetic outcome of the technique, the soft tissue around the tooth to be extracted was scored according to the PES by seven evaluators before the surgery at visit 1 (v1), and at least 1 year after the final prosthesis placement at visit 2 (v2). RESULTS After a mean follow-up of 4 years, the mean total PES score on a scale from 1 to 10 was 5.64 and 7.07 at v1 and v2, respectively.

Reports from cities and states have suggested a discordant impact on black Americans, but no nationwide study has yet been performed. We sought to understand the differential outcomes for black and white Americans infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We obtained case-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on 76,442 white and 48,338 non-Hispanic Black patients diagnosed with COVID-19, ages 0 to >80+, outlining information on hospitalization, ICU admission, ventilation, and death outcomes. Multivariate Poisson regressions were used to estimate the association of race, treating white as the reference group, controlling for sex, age group, and the presence of comorbidities. RESULTS: Black patients were generally younger than white, were more often female, and had larger numbers of comorbidities. Compared to white patients with COVID-19, black patients had 1.4 times the risk of hospitalization (RR 1.42, p < 0.001), and almost twice the risk of requiring ICU care (RR 1.68, p < 0.001) or ventilatory support (RR 1.81, p < 0.001) after adjusting for covariates.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May 9, 2020 to June 9, 2020, among frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) in India to understand their perceived stigmatizing experiences (SE) and self-esteem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Google forms, an online forms tool, was used to create the survey, and samples were recruited through snowball sampling. Data comprised baseline characteristics of HCWs and their responses to the modified version of the Inventory of Stigmatizing Experiences and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Results: Of the 600 participants (mean age: 30.9  6.7 years), 76% comprised of nurses. Most participants were residing in urban areas and working in government sectors in clinical areas. Approximately 66.3% HCWs had at least 1 SE, and 51.7% reported a high impact of stigma (SI) across their various life domains, viz. quality of life, social contacts, self-esteem, and family relations, but 73% had normal self-esteem. The SI was more at the family level than at the individual level. The prevalence of SE (69.5% vs. 56.6%) and psychosocial SI (54.5% vs. 44.1%) was higher among nurses than among doctors. Being a nurse and working in clinical areas were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.01, respectively) for predicting SE likelihood. Conclusion: Although HCWs have their own apprehensions, they do have high self-esteem and continue to deliver professional duties despite their SE.

An absence of staff, service user and system-related outcomes specific to trauma-informed care presented barriers to monitoring the adoption of trauma-informed approaches and progress over time across the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys Foundation NHS Trust. This paper describes the co-production of a new self-assessment tool, Roots, a discussion-based framework that facilitates learning and improvement by reflecting on positive or negative examples of trauma-informed services. Methods: Using secondary data obtained from an affiliated national trauma summit and instruments found in literature, domains and items were co-produced with the help of trauma-informed care leads, NHS staff and service users. The research design consisted of community-based co-production methods such as surveys, focus groups, and expert consultations. Results: Adopting trauma-informed care requires enthusiasm and commitment from all members of the organisation. Services must adapt to meet the dynamic needs of staff and service users to ensure they remain trauma-informed; this must be done as a community. Conclusions: Following an extensive co-production process, the Roots framework was published open-access and accompanied by a user manual.

Results: Data was collected for 86 telephone and 56 videoconference consults. The actual activity-based funding claimed for telephone consults was $0, even though $86 of activity-based funding was available for each consult. This represented a $0 reimbursement for the staff time spent conducting the telephone consults, and a missed opportunity to claim $86 per consult. Activity-based funding was claimed for all but one videoconference consult with an average of $205 received per consult, when $221 per consult was available. Videoconference consults were an average of 2.3 min shorter than telephone consults.

The role of fat distribution, particularly visceral fat (often linked to metabolic abnormalities), is still unclear. The adipose tissue represents a direct source of cytokines responsible for the pathological modifications occurring within adipose tissue in obese subjects. Adipokines are a crucial connection between metabolism and immune system: their dysregulation in obesity contributes to chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and metabolic comorbidities. Therefore the increased amount of visceral fat can lead to a proinflammatory phenotypic shift. This review analyzes the interrelation between obesity and COVID-19 severity, as well as the cellular key players and molecular mechanisms implicated in adipose inflammation, investigating if adipose tissue can constitute a reservoir for viral spread, and contribute to immune activation and cytokines storm.

Overall, there were 3 key components to ODANNs development phase, namely: (i) data hydration and pre-processing were performed on COVID-19 related Twitter data ranging between 23 January 2020 and 10 May 2020, which amounted to over 100 million Tweets written in English language; (ii) multiple NLP features extraction methods were subsequently leveraged to encode the hydrated Twitter data into useful semantic word vectors for training ODANN under an optimal set of hyperparameters; and (iii) historical time-series data of defined characteristics were also assimilated into ODANNs selected hidden layer(s) to model the G parameter daily with a lead-time of 1 day. By far, our experimental results demonstrated that by adopting a rolling time-window size of 5 days, with respect to the number of historical time-series records for assimilating different data features, enabled ODANN to outperform other traditional time-series models and recent studies, in terms of the computed RMSE and MAE scores attained from the models testing step.

We aimed to evaluate the selected miRNAs expression based on bioinformatic analysis and their changes before and after an ultramarathon run. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiac tissue-specific targets were identified with the Tissue 2.0 database. Gene-gene interaction data were retrieved from the STRING app for Cytoscape. Twenty-three endurance athletes were recruited to the study. Athletes ran to completion (100 km) or exhaustion (52C91 km, median 74 km). All participants completed pre- and post-run testing. miRNAs expressions were measured both before and after the race. RESULTS: Enrichment analysis of the signaling pathways associated with the genes targeted by miRNAs selected for qRT-PCR validation (miR-1-3p, miR-126, miR-223, miR-125a-5p, miR-106a-5p, and miR-15a/b). All selected miRNAs showed overlap in regulation in pathways associated with cancer, IL-2 signaling, TGF- signaling as well as BDNF signaling pathway. Analysis of metabolites revealed significant regulation of magnesium and guanosine triphosphate across analyzed miRNA targets. MiR-1-3p, miR-125a-5p, miR-126, and miR-223 expressions were measured in 23 experienced endurance athletes, before and after an ultramarathon wherein athletes ran to completion (100 km) or exhaustion (52C91 km, median 74 km). The expressions of miR-125a-5p, miR-126, and miR-223 were significantly increased after the race (p = 0.007, p = 0.001, p = 0.014, respectively). MiR-1-3p expression post-run showed a negative correlation with the post-run levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (r = ?0.632, p = 0.003). Higher miR-1-3p expression was found in runners, who finished the race under 10 h compared to runners who finished over 10 h (p = 0.001). Post-run miR-125a-5p expression showed a negative correlation with the peak lactate during the run (r = ?0.576, p = 0.019). CONCLUSION: Extreme physical activity, as exemplified by an ultramarathon, is associated with changes in circulating miRNAs expression related to inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac muscle function. In particular, the negative correlations between miR-125a-5p and lactate concentrations, and miR-1-3p and hs-CRP, support their role in specific exercise-induced adaptation. Further studies are essential to validate the long-term effect of these observations.","output":"Altered Circulating MicroRNA Profiles After Endurance Training: A Cohort Study of Ultramarathon Runners"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim: The inference of coronavirus evolution is largely based on mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Aufgrund des hohen Risikos von schweren Neutropenien und Infektionen mit FCR muss bei Patienten im Alter von >65 Jahren Bendamustin und Rituximab (BR) in Betracht gezogen werden. Diese konventionellen Chemo-Immuntherapien sind jedoch mit Nebenwirkungen verbunden, die durch die eher unspezifische Wirkungsweise der Chemotherapie verursacht werden. Es besteht daher ein dringender Bedarf an Alternativen, insbesondere an chemotherapiefreien Regimen. In der Erstlinienbehandlung von ?lteren Patienten mit CLL und Begleiterkrankungen ist der Anti-CD20-Antik?rper Obinutuzumab die neue Standardtherapie. In der CLL11-Studie erwies sich die Kombination von Obinutuzumab mit Chlorambucil als sicher und fhrte zu deutlich verbesserten Ansprechraten und PFS-Zeiten im Vergleich zu Chlorambucil allein oder kombiniert mit Rituximab. Der BCL2-Antagonist Venetoclax (GDC-0199/ABT-199) zeigte bei Patienten mit rezidivierter und refrakt?rer CLL eine auff?llige Aktivit?t mit Tumorlysesyndrom als dosislimitierender Toxizit?t. 400mg Venetoclax wurde als eine sichere und wirksame Dosis ermittelt. Mehrere Patienten, die mit der Kombination aus Venetoclax und Rituximab bei rezidivierter refrakt?rer CLL behandelt wurden, erreichten sogar MRD-Negativit?t. Die FDA hat Venetoclax am 12. April 2016 fr die Behandlung der rezidivierten CLL mit 17p/TP53 zugelassen. Daher haben Venetoclax plus CD20-Antik?rper-basierte Kombinationen das Potenzial, in der Erstlinientherapie der CLL h?here Raten an MRD-Negativit?t zu erzielen und gleichzeitig niedrigere Raten an Toxizit?ten zu induzieren, sodass eine Chemotherapie ersetzt werden k?nnte. Darber hinaus zeigten Venetoclax und Obinutuzumab in einer pr?klinischen Studie an einem murinen Non-Hodgkin-Lymphom-Xenograft-Modell eine synergistische Aktivit?t und in einem CLL-Lymphknotenmodell eine additive Aktivit?t. Die Kombination scheint in der Erstlinienbehandlung von CLL-Patienten mit koexistierenden Erkrankungen vertr?glich zu sein, w?hrend das Toxizit?tsprofil beider Medikamente mit dem der derzeit in der Behandlung der CLL eingesetzten Chemotherapien vergleichbar ist.

This chapter contextualizes what has been transpiring in Australia with the pandemic, with particular attention upon Tasmania, including discussion about the new COVIDSafe.App, and then explains the potential application of a Systems Dynamics Modeling exercise of the COVID-19 spread, in collaboration with a custom-built 2D/3D geographic information system (GIS) Dynamic Scenario Planning Model to spatially visualize potential what-if scenarios of COVID-19 spread (and other future pandemics) to identify high-risk areas and vulnerable communities in the northern areas of Tasmania that is aiding real-time pattern mapping and preparation work and to further consider and enable the most effective emergency response and recovery scenarios.","output":"Quarantined within a quarantine: COVID-19 and GIS Dynamic Scenario Modeling in Tasmania, Australia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This survey investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical practice of endodontics among the AAE members by evaluating the impact on clinical activities, patient screening, infection control measurements, potential transmission, clinical protocols as well as psychological concerns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was developed to query AAE members from all seven districts. The survey consisted of 24 questions, eight demographic questions, and 16 questions related to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on the clinical practice. RESULTS: A total of 454 AAE members participated in the survey. As of July 2020, most endodontists were active in front line treatment of dental patients (82%). N95 respirator face mask was described by 83.1% of the participants as special measures beyond the regular PPE. Rubber dam isolation was recognized by the majority of the participants at some level to reduce the chance of COVID-19 cross-infection. Most of the endodontist participants acknowledged trauma followed by swelling, pain, postoperative complication to be emergencies. The majority of respondents reported being concerned about the effect of COVID-19 upon their practice. No differences in worries about COVID-19 infection were related to demographics (p>.05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the Endodontists are aware of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking special precautions, and are concerned about contracting and spreading the virus. Despite the conflict between their roles as health care providers and family members with the potential risk of exposing their families, most of them remain on duty providing front line care for dental treatment.","output":"A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY ON THE IMPACT OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19) ON THE CLINICAL PRACTICE OF ENDODONTISTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is strongly associated with increased risk for depression. Approximately 25% of pregnant women develop depression. Treatment for depression during pregnancy has several complexities: the use of psychiatric medications during pregnancy might result in developmental problems in the child and must be used with caution. Psychosocial interventions are effective, but they require specialized professionals. Low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) such as Brazil do not have enough mental health professionals needed to meet this demand. In this context, smartphone-based interventions show immense potential. We developed Motherly, a smartphone application (app) designed to treat maternal depression. We aim to test the efficacy of Motherly in addition to brief cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) to treat maternal depression. METHODS: We will conduct a 2-arm parallel-randomized controlled clinical trial in which 70 pregnant women aged between 16 and 40 years with depression will be randomized to intervention or active control. The intervention group will have access to Motherly, a smartphone app based on three concepts: psychoeducation, behavior monitoring, and gaming elements. Motherly is composed of a package of interventions composed of modules: mental health, sleep, nutrition, physical activity, social support, prenatal/postnatal support, and educational content. The main focus of Motherly is delivering behavioral activation (BA), a brief and structured psychological treatment. The app allows participants to schedule and engage in, and monitor activities according to a plan to avoid acting exclusively according to their mood. The active control group will have access to a simplified version of the app consisting of educational content about various aspects of pregnancy, maternal physical and mental health, and infant development (BA, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, among other functionalities, will not be present in this version). Both groups will receive four sessions of brief CBT in 8 weeks. Participants will be evaluated by assessors blind to randomization and allocation status. Assessments will occur at baseline (T0), midpoint (T1, week 4C5), posttreatment (T2, week 8), and follow-up (T3, when the child is 2 months old). Maternal mental health (prenatal anxiety, psychological well-being, perceived stress, depression, depression severity, and sleep quality), quality of life, physical activity levels, and infant developmental milestones and social/emotional problems will be measured. Our primary outcome is the change in maternal prenatal depression from baseline to posttreatment (8 weeks). DISCUSSION: The potential of digital technology to deliver mental health interventions has been increasingly recognized worldwide. There is a growing literature on interventions using smartphone applications to promote mental health, both with or without the intermediation of a mental health professional. Our study adds to the literature by testing whether an app providing an intervention package, including CBT, psychoeducation, nutrition, physical activity, and social support, can promote maternal and child health and well-being. In particular, we aim to treat depression, for which the use of digital technologies is still scarce. Smartphone applications designed to treat maternal depression are especially relevant because of the potential to circumvent barriers that prevent pregnant women from accessing mental health care.

An increasing number of publications report neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19. However, no studies have comprehensively reviewed the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of the central and peripheral nervous systems involvement in these patients. This study aimed to describe the features of the central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19 in terms of pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, neuropathology, neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and cerebrospinal fluid findings. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of all the original studies reporting patients with neurological involvement by COVID-19, from December 2019 to June 2020, without language restriction. We excluded studies with animal subjects, studies not related to the nervous system, and opinion articles. Data analysis combined descriptive measures, frequency measures, central tendency measures, and dispersion measures for all studies reporting neurological conditions and abnormal ancillary tests in patients with confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 143 observational and descriptive studies reported central and peripheral nervous system involvement by COVID-19 in 10,723 patients. Fifty-one studies described pathophysiologic mechanisms of neurological involvement by COVID-19, 119 focused on clinical manifestations, 4 described neuropathology findings, 62 described neuroimaging findings, 28 electrophysiology findings, and 60 studies reported cerebrospinal fluid results. The reviewed studies reflect a significant prevalence of the nervous systems involvement in patients with COVID-19, ranging from 22.5 to 36.4% among different studies, without mortality rates explicitly associated with neurological involvement by SARS-CoV-2. We thoroughly describe the clinical and paraclinical characteristics of neurological involvement in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence synthesis led to a categorical analysis of the central and peripheral neurological involvement by COVID-19 and provided a comprehensive explanation of the reported pathophysiological mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infection may cause neurological impairment. International collaborative efforts and exhaustive neurological registries will enhance the translational knowledge of COVID-19s central and peripheral neurological involvement and generate therapeutic decision-making strategies.

Therefore, it is important to seek for ways to increase the resilience and alleviate the psychological pressure of the patients who are quarantined due to infection with COVID-19. The present study was conducted to assess an online multimedia psychoeducational intervention regarding the feasibility, adherence, patient satisfaction and effectiveness on resilience and perceived stress of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19. METHOD: This was a pilot cluster randomized parallel-controlled trial with hospital wards as the units of randomization. Participants in this fully online trial were 50 consecutive patients who were hospitalized in 2 hospitals in Shiraz, after being diagnosed with COVID-19. Before the beginning of the intervention, four inpatient wards inside two of the hospitals were randomly assigned to either intervention or control conditions. All eligible participants in the wards allocated to the intervention condition received online multimedia psychoeducational interventions during the 2 weeks, whilst the patients in the wards allocated to the control condition were offered the opportunity to receive telephone-based psychological counseling if needed. Psychoeducational interventions mainly included cognitiveCbehavioural techniques, stress management techniques, mindfulness-based stress reduction and positive psychotherapy. The patients were assessed regarding resilience and perceived stress at baseline and after two weeks. RESULTS: Of 27 patients starting multimedia psychoeducational interventions, 26 (96.29%) completed post-assessments. A high level of adherence (80.76%) and satisfaction (Mean = 29.42; SD = 4.18) with the online multimedia psychoeducational interventions was found. Compared with the control group, the patients who used online multimedia psychoeducational interventions reported greater resilience (Mean(intervention) = 81.74; Mean(control) = 72.86; adjusted t (46) = 2.10; p = 0.04; CI: 0.39 to 17.38; dppc2 = 0.83) and fewer perceived stress (Mean(intervention) = 22.15; Mean(control) = 29.45; adjusted t (46) = 2.66; p = 0.01; CI: ? 12.81 to ? 1.78; dppc2 = ? 0.77) after 2 weeks. DISCUSSION: The findings of the present study provided a successful first attempt at implementing feasible online multimedia psychoeducational interventions to promote resilience and mitigate stress among the patients who were hospitalized due to infection with COVID-19. The present results could help mental health professionals to determine which psychological techniques should be emphasized to promote patients resilience in the context of COVID-19 disease.

All modes of transportation have, to some extent, already been affected, and maritime is the last to join them. Currently available technology makes autonomous merchant ships a possible alternative to conventional, manned vessels with seafarers. This upcoming shift requires the preparation of necessary policies, such as rethinking obsolete training curricula, in relation to a variety of aspects of the industry, including the future of seafaring as a profession. To formulate such policies, the views of professional seafarers and scholars are sometimes solicited, but the opinions of industry entrants are often neglected. However, the latter may also have some interesting views on the future of their profession, which may be relevant to policy-makers. The results of a worldwide survey, conducted using the Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) method, suggest that the future generation of seafarers fears automation less than their mentors. Although they expect their skills to be useful in automation-driven shipping, they also feel that their Maritime Education and Training institutions (MET) are not doing enough to prepare them for the challenges that the future may hold. This may be due to a lack or poor coverage of shipping autonomization issues in MET curricula, which was mentioned by as many as 41.9% of the respondents. This finding advocates for rethinking the curricula of METs and human resources management in the shipping industry of the future.","output":"Implications of autonomous shipping for maritime education and training: the cadets perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To inform expectations around the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination campaign, we analyzed associations of COVID-19 priority grouping, socio-demographics, and behavioral factors with receiving flu vaccine. METHODS: Using the 2018 National Health Interview Survey, we classified 24,772 adults into four COVID-19 vaccination priority groups: healthcare workers, medically vulnerable, non-healthcare essential workers, and the general population. We performed multiple logistic regression to compare the relative odds of receiving flu vaccine by priority group, socio-demographics, and health-related factors. RESULTS: Healthcare workers, medically vulnerable adults, essential workers, and the general population comprise 8.9%, 58.4%, 6.6%, and 26.1 % of the US population, respectively. Compared with healthcare workers, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of receiving flu vaccine were significantly lower in medically vulnerable adults (aOR=0.43, 95% CI=0.37, 0.48), essential workers (aOR=0.28, 95% CI=0.23, 0.34), and the general population (aOR=0.32, 95% CI=0.28, 0.37).

Here we show that ischemia and excess NMDA receptor activation C conditions that trigger neuronal swelling -- cause actin filaments to undergo a rapid and extensive reorganization within the somatodendritic compartment. Normally, F-actin is concentrated within dendritic spines, with relatively little F-actin in the dendrite shaft. However, beginning <5 min after incubation of neurons with NMDA, F-actin depolymerizes within dendritic spines and polymerizes into long, stable filament bundles within the dendrite shaft and soma. A similar actinification of the somatodendritic compartment occurs after oxygen/glucose deprivation in vitro, and in mouse brain after photothrombotic stroke in vivo. Following transient, sub-lethal NMDA exposure these actin changes spontaneously reverse within 1-2 hours. A combination of Na+, Cl-, water, and Ca2+ entry are all necessary, but not individually sufficient, for induction of actinification. Spine F-actin depolymerization is also required. Actinification is driven by activation of the F-actin polymerization factor inverted formin-2 (INF2). Silencing of INF2 renders neurons more vulnerable to NMDA-induced membrane leakage and cell death, and formin inhibition markedly increases ischemic infarct severity in vivo. These results show that ischemia-induced actin filament reorganization within the dendritic compartment is an intrinsic pro-survival response that protects neurons from death induced by swelling.","output":"INF2-mediated actin filament reorganization confers intrinsic resilience to neuronal ischemic injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of the Amplatzer vascular plug II (AVPII) for transvenous occlusion of patent ductus arteriosus in a non-selective population of dogs, with a focus on the surgical technique, short term outcome and associated complications. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study. Records of thirty-two consecutive dogs treated for a left-to-right shunting patent ductus arteriosus with the AVPII were reviewed. RESULTS: Ductal occlusion with an AVPII occlusion device was attempted in 32 dogs weighing 1.1-53.8 kg. Transvenous occlusion was successful in 30 dogs. One dog required a transarterial approach for occlusion. One dog died during catheterisation of the right heart but prior to transductal catheterisation. Mean ductal ampulla diameter was 7.9 mm (range, 4.1-15.4 mm) and median size of deployed devices was 10 mm (range 4-20 mm). Mean device to ampulla ratio was 1.34  0.15. Device was positioned in situ with no residual flow on follow-up echocardiographic assessment (> one month) in all dogs where deployment was attempted. Occlusion success rate was 96.9% and mortality rate was 3.1%. Four dogs (13.3%) demonstrated minor complications, with none having long-term significance.

METHODS: We searched Embase, Medline, bioRxiv, and medRxiv up to 22 June 2020. We included cohorts or cross-sectional studies which systematically tested populations regardless of symptoms for COVID-19, or case series of any size reporting contact investigations of asymptomatic index patients. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed quality using pre-specified criteria. Only moderate/high quality studies were included. The main outcomes were proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons at testing and through follow-up, and secondary attack rate among close contacts of asymptomatic index patients. A qualitative synthesis was performed. Where appropriate, data were pooled using random effects meta-analysis to estimate proportions and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Of 6,137 identified studies, 71 underwent quality assessment after full text review, and 28 were high/moderate quality and were included. In two general population studies, the proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection at time of testing was 20% and 75%, respectively; among three studies in contacts it was 8.2% to 50%. In meta-analysis, the proportion (95% CI) of asymptomatic COVID-19 infection in obstetric patients was 95% (45% to 100%) of which 59% (49% to 68%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up; among nursing home residents, the proportion was 54% (42% to 65%) of which 28% (13% to 50%) remained asymptomatic through follow-up. Transmission studies were too heterogenous to meta-analyse. Among five transmission studies, 18 of 96 (18.8%) close contacts exposed to asymptomatic index patients were COVID-19 positive.

Hybrid ELM models (PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM) were proposed for estimating ET 0 in different climate zones of China. ? PSO-ELM model had the highest accuracy, followed by GA-ELM and ABC-ELM. ? Hybrid ELM models outperformed standalone ELM and empirical models in different climate zones. ? PSO-ELM model with T max , T min and RH obtained accurate ET 0 estimates in TCZ, SMZ and TMZ. ? PSO-ELM model with only T max and T min was better performance on ET 0 estimates in MPZ. Accurate prediction of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET 0) is important for regional water resources management and optimal design of agricultural irrigation system. In this study, three hybrid models (PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM) integrating the extreme learning machine model (ELM) with three biological heuristic algorithms, i.e., PSO, GA and ABC, were proposed for predicting daily ET 0 based on daily meteorological data from 2000 to 2019 at twelve representative stations in different climatic zones of China. The performances of the three hybrid ELM models were further compared with the standalone ELM model and three empirical models (Hargreaves, Priestley-Talor and Makkink models). The results showed that the hybrid ELM models (R 2 = 0.973C0.999) all performed better than the standalone ELM model (R 2 = 0.955C0.989) in four climatic regions in China. The estimation accuracy of the empirical models was relatively lower, with R2 of 0.822C0.887 and RMSE of 0.381C1.951 mm/d. The R 2 values of PSO-ELM, GA-ELM and ABC-ELM models were 0.993, 0.986 and 0.981 and the RMSE values were 0.266 mm/d, 0.306 mm/d and 0.404 mm/d, respectively, indicating that the PSO-ELM model had the best performance. When setting T max , T min and RH as the model inputs, the PSO-ELM model presented better performance in the temperate continental zone (TCZ), subtropical monsoon region (SMZ) and temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) climate zones, with R 2 of 0.892, 0866 and 0.870 and RMSE of 0.773 mm/d, 0.597 mm/d and 0.832 mm/d, respectively. The PSO-ELM model also performed in the mountain plateau region (MPZ) when only T max and T min data were available, with R2 of 0.808 and RMSE of 0.651 mm/d. All the three biological heuristic algorithms effectively improved the performance of the ELM model.

In the first wave of disease, Israels Arab minority exhibited far lower morbidity and mortality rates, compared with the general population. However, this trend reversed completely during the second wave. We describe the rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in Arab and Jewish localities during the first and second peaks of the outbreak and address socio-cultural aspects of the pandemic. Methods: : A retrospective national archive study was conducted in Israel. Data were obtained from the Ministry of Health's database, including daily information on Arab, Jewish or mixed localities, from February to September 2020. Results: : In April 2020, positive test rate was 3 times lower and death rate 10.7 times lower in the Arab compared to the Jewish population. During the second wave, morbidity and mortality rose dramatically in the Arab population, with 12% positive test rate in the Arab compared to 9% in the Jewish population and similar death rates in both populations. Conclusions: : Following a promising start in the first wave, a surge in infections occurred in the Arab population during the second wave. The huge burden on the health system resulting from high morbidity across all population groups contributed to the decision to implement a second national lockdown. This unique pattern highlights the changing experience of a minority group during the second wave and demonstrates how COVID-19 exacerbates existing disparities.","output":"Changes in COVID-19 Morbidity in an Ethnic Minority Between First and Second Pandemic Waves"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extralobar pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital disease of the primitive foregut.

To assess the impact of containment measures of the COVID-19 pandemic on pneumonia hospitalizations in children from 0 to 14 years of age in Brazil. METHODS: Data from hospital admissions for pneumonia were obtained from the Department of Informatics of Brazilian Public Health System database in the period of 2015-2020 and analyzed by macroregions and age groups. To evaluate the effect of containment measures, on the incidence of pneumonia, the absolute reduction and relative reduction were calculated by analyzing the subsets 2015-2019 vs. 2020. RESULTS: Comparing the subsets of April-August 2015-2019 vs. April-August 2020 for Brazil (total), there was an significant reduction in the average incidence of hospitalizations, with numbers ranging from -82% [IRR 0.17 (0.14-0.21)] for <4 years (prepandemic 741.8/100,000 vs. pandemic 132.7/100.000), -83% [IRR 0.17 (0.10-0.27)] for 5-9 years (prepandemic 113.6/100,000 vs. pandemic 19.6/100.000), -77% [IRR 0.23 (0.11-0.46)] for 10-14 (prepandemic 42.0/100,000 vs. pandemic 9.8/100.000) and -82% [IRR 0.18 (0.15-0.21)] for all children &#8804;14 years (prepandemic 897.4/100,000 vs. pandemic 162.1/100.000).

Those subjects with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection. PURPOSE: To investigate the response to different treatments against COVID-19 in patients with a pre-existing CVD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis following Cochrane, PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines (PROSPERO ref:CRD42020183057). Eligible articles reported in-hospital mortality rate in COVID-19 patients with CVD after testing specific treatments. Statistical concordance was performed by Cohen's kappa coefficient. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality rate, secondary outcome was the length of hospital stay (LOS). The analysis utilised a random-effects model. Categorical variables were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and continuous variable with weighted mean difference (WMD) and standard deviation with 95% confidence interval (CI). I(2) and Chi-tests were used to assess studies' heterogeneity. Publication bias was visualised by L'Abbe' plot and funnel plot with Egger's test. Subgroup analysis (pooling analysis) was also performed to compare the three groups' mortality differences: 'CVD treated' vs.'CVD untreated' vs.'no-CVD (treated and untreated)'. Meta-regression models were used to determine the effects of specific treatments and risk factors on the primary outcomes. R-studio used for analysis. RESULTS: Of 1,673 articles retrieved, 46 studies included CVD patients from which 11 included control group, finally five were comparative studies and were included in the quantitative analysis. From those studies, the sample size was 130 (mean age 63.92.7 years; 55.3% male). There was 100% concordance between reviewers equating to a Cohen's kappa coefficient of =1. The most frequent CV risk factor (CVRF) was hypertension (60%) followed by diabetes (28.5%). The most frequent CVD seen in patients was coronary artery disease at 9.09% and peripheral arterial disease at 5.4%. Mortality rate was significant higher in the CVD treated group (RR:1.52; 95% CI [1.05,2.21], CVD treated vs overall population p=0.03). Meta-regression showed that no treatment was significant associated to mortality and systemic hypertension, but an independent risk factor for mortality. Pooled single analysis showed no difference between treated vs untreated CVD patients. There was certain degree of heterogeneity (I(2) 50%) across the studies. L'Abbe and funnel plot visualized not significant dispersion (Egger test, p=0.71). There was no difference in terms of LOS [0,79, 95% CI (?0.48, 2,05); p-value 0.22]. CONCLUSIONS: This quantitative analysis showed that CVD patients despite specific treatments were exposed to significant higher mortality when compared to the overall population.

However, Heinsberg was not included as an area reporting local or community transmission per the national case definition at the time. In early March, two residents from a long-term care facility (LTCF) in Sittard, a Dutch town located in close vicinity to the district of Heinsberg, tested positive for COVID-19. In this study we aimed to determine whether cross-border introduction of the virus took place by analysing the LTCF outbreak in Sittard, both epidemiologically and microbiologically. METHODS: Surveys and semi-structured oral interviews were conducted with all present LTCF residents by health care workers during regular points of care for information on new or unusual signs and symptoms of disease. Both throat and nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from residents suspect of COVID-19, based on regional criteria, for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction. Additionally, whole genome sequencing was performed using a SARS-CoV-2 specific amplicon-based Nanopore sequencing approach. Moreover, twelve random residents were sampled for possible asymptomatic infections. RESULTS: Out of 99 residents, 46 got tested for COVID-19. Out of the 46 tested residents, nineteen (41%) tested positive for COVID-19, including 3 asymptomatic residents. CT-values for asymptomatic residents seemed higher compared to symptomatic residents. Eleven samples were sequenced, along with three random samples from COVID-19 patients hospitalized in the regional hospital at the time of the LTCF outbreak. All samples were linked to COVID-19 cases from the cross-border region of Heinsberg, Germany. CONCLUSIONS: Sequencing combined with epidemiological data was able to virtually prove cross-border transmission at the start of the Dutch COVID-19 epidemic.

Although bats are regarded as the most likely natural hosts for SARS-CoV-2 [3], the origins of the virus remain unclear. Here, we report a novel bat-derived coronavirus, denoted RmYN02, identified from a metagenomics analysis of samples from 227 bats collected from Yunnan Province in China between May and October, 2019. Notably, RmYN02 shares 93.3% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 at the scale of the complete virus genome and 97.2% identity in the 1ab gene, in which it is the closest relative of SARS-CoV-2 reported to date. In contrast, RmYN02 showed low sequence identity (61.3%) to SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and might not bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Critically, and in a similar manner to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 was characterized by the insertion of multiple amino acids at the junction site of the S1 and S2 subunits of the spike (S) protein.

Here, we show that cigarette smoke causes a dose-dependent upregulation of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, in rodent and human lungs. Using single-cell sequencing data, we demonstrate that ACE2 is expressed in a subset of secretory cells in the respiratory tract. Chronic smoke exposure triggers the expansion of this cell population and a concomitant increase in ACE2 expression. In contrast, quitting smoking decreases the abundance of these secretory cells and reduces ACE2 levels. Finally, we demonstrate that ACE2 expression is responsive to inflammatory signaling and can be upregulated by viral infections or interferon treatment. Taken together, these results may partially explain why smokers are particularly susceptible to severe SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, our work identifies ACE2 as an interferon-stimulated gene in lung cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infections could create positive-feedback loops that increase ACE2 levels and facilitate viral dissemination.","output":"Cigarette smoke exposure and inflammatory signaling increase the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in the respiratory tract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The purpose was to analyse the associations between dental and trait anxiety, fear of COVID-19 and the duration and frequency of spontaneous hand-to-face contact (self-contact).

It is called COVID-19 because it was caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in 2019. A total of 1.9 M deaths and 87.9 M cases have been reported all over the world where 49M cases have recovered so far. Scientists are working hard to find chemotherapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in a combination of several hazardous stresses, making them more resistant and beneficial. So to break down the viral system, the disease targets are examined. OBJECTIVE: In today's review, a comprehensive study of spike protein explains the main purpose of the novel coronavirus and how to prevent the spread of the disease virus, cross-transmission from infected to a healthy person. METHOD: Covid-19 has already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to global death and wide illness. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. However, the intermediate host of the novel coronavirus is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of disease, one of the viral targets, such as the spike protein that binds to human cells and causes the disease and its genetic structure, is considered with potential inhibitors. RESULTS: It has been shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS- CoV-2 spike and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor interact and further replication of coronavirus spike protein causes its invasion in the host cell. The human Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, Locus E (LY6E) inhibits the entry of CoV into host cells by interfering with the human gene, spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Some natural formulations have also been shown to prevent spike protein from binding to the host cell. CONCLUSION: With the development of the LY6E gene activator that can inhibit spike protein-ACE2-mediated membrane fusion, new opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 treatment may emerge. Existing antiviral fusion inhibitors and natural compounds targeting spike resistance can serve as a template for further SARS-CoV-2 drug formulation.","output":"Exploring Spike Protein as Potential Target of Novel Coronavirus and to Inhibit the Viability utilizing Natural Agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Prophylactic platelet transfusions are frequently used to prevent bleeding in hospitalised patients with thrombocytopenia.

Puerarin (Pue, a monomeric Chinese herbal medicine extract) has been reported to alleviate Cd-induced cell injury by regulating autophagy pathways; however, its detailed mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, to investigate the detailed mechanisms by which Pue targets autophagy to alleviate Cd hepatotoxicity, alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) cells were used to construct a model of Cd-induced hepatocyte injury in vitro. First, the protective effect of Pue on Cd-induced cell injury was confirmed by changes in cell proliferation, cell morphology, and cell ultrastructure. Next, we found that Pue activated autophagy and mitigated Cd-induced autophagy blockade. In this process, the lysosome was further activated and the lysosomal degradation capacity was strengthened. We also found that Pue restored the autophagosome-lysosome fusion and the expression of Rab7 in Cd-exposed hepatocytes. However, the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and autophagic flux were inhibited after knocking down Rab7, and were further inhibited after combined treatment with Cd. In addition, after knocking down Rab7, the protective effects of Pue on restoring autophagosome-lysosome fusion and alleviating autophagy blockade in Cd-exposed cells were inhibited. In conclusion, Pue-mediated alleviation of Cd-induced hepatocyte injury was related to the activation of autophagy and the alleviation of autophagy blockade.

By screening a phage-display library of biosynthetic protein sequences build on a rigid alpha-helicoidal HEAT-like scaffold (named Reps), we selected candidates recognizing the spike receptor binding domain (RBD). Two of them (F9 and C2) bind the RBD with affinities in the nM range, displaying neutralisation activity in vitro and recognizing distinct sites, F9 overlapping the ACE2 binding motif. The F9-C2 fusion protein and a trivalent Rep form (C2-foldon) display 0.1 nM affinities and EC50 of 8-18 nM for neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. In hamsters, F9-C2 instillation in the nasal cavity before or during infections effectively reduced the replication of a SARS-CoV-2 strain harbouring the D614G mutation in the nasal epithelium. Furthermore, F9-C2 and/or C2-foldon effectively neutralized SARS-CoV-2 variants (including delta and omicron variants) with EC50 values ranging from 13 to 32 nM. With their high stability and their high potency against SARS-CoV-2 variants, Reps provide a promising tool for SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics to target the nasal cavity and mitigate virus dissemination in the proximal environment. Author Summary The entry of SARS-CoV-2 in permissive cells is mediated by the binding of its spike to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the cell surface. To select ligands able to block this interaction, we screened a library of phages encoding artificial proteins (named Reps) for binding to its receptor binding domain (RBD). Two of them were able to bind the RBD with high affinity and block efficiently the virus entry in cultured cells. Assembled Reps through covalent or non-covalent linkages blocked virus entry at lower concentration than their precursors (with around 20-fold activity increase for a trimeric Rep). These Reps derivates neutralize efficiently SARS-CoV-2 , ,  and Omicron virus variants. Instillation of an Rep dimer in the nasal cavity effectively reduced virus replication in the hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 and pathogenicity.","output":"Biosynthetic proteins targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike as anti-virals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moringa oleifera L. from the Moringaceae family is a perennial tree widely cultivated in many tropic regions and easily grown even in adverse conditions. M. oleifera is also known as the miracle tree, which for centuries has been indicated for traditional medicine. With no reports of side effects, in doses achievable by ingestion, different parts of M. oleifera is used to treat several conditions, such as malnutrition, diabetes, blindness, anemia, hypertension, stress, depression, skin, arthritis, joints and kidney stones disorders. This plant also showed capacity of helping in maintenance of the cardiovascular system health, blood-glucose levels and providing anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activity as well as the regulation of urinary tract and lactation in nursing women. The seed and leaves powder has water purification properties through flocculation. It also supplements the food in the human diet and in the fortification of livestock feed, especially in developing countries. So, M. oleifera properties have also been applied to cosmetic and byproducts industries due to the high nutritive and protective properties of its seed oil. According to the holistic or traditional medicine, M. oleifera has very relevant therapeutic properties and applications depending on the constitution, somatic and psychological needs of patients. It is usually referred as a natural product that can treat different physical and psychological health aspects, offering an energetic action and structural rebuilder of the body and promoting emotions of highly positive attitudes towards life. The high and specific immunological potential of M. oleifera leads us to suggest an in-depth study to assess the hypothesis of conferring a supportive effect against Covid-19 disease.","output":"A review of properties, nutritional and pharmaceutical applications of Moringa oleifera: integrative approach on conventional and traditional Asian medicine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"siRNA interference therapy can silence tumor cell target genes and specifically regulate tumor cell behavior and function, which is an effective antitumor therapy.

CAPA was defined using composite clinical criteria. Fine and Gray competing risks regression was used to analyze clinical outcomes and multilevel mixed-effects ordinal logistic regression was used to compare longitudinal disease severity scores. RESULTS: Amongst the cohort of 396 people, 39 met criteria for CAPA. Compared to those without, patients with CAPA were more likely to have underlying pulmonary vascular disease (41% vs 21.6%, p=0.01), liver disease (35.9% vs 18.2%, p=0.02), coagulopathy (51.3% vs 33.1%, p=0.03), solid tumors (25.6% vs 10.9%, p=0.017), multiple myeloma (5.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.027), corticosteroid exposure during index admission (66.7% vs 42.6%, p=0.005), and had a lower BMI (median 26.6 vs 29.9, p=0.04). People with CAPA had worse outcomes as measured by ordinal severity of disease scores, requiring longer time to improvement (adjusted odds ratio 1.081.091.1, p<0.001), and advancing in severity almost twice as fast (subhazard ratio, sHR 1.31.82.5, p<0.001). People with CAPA were intubated twice as long as those without (sHR) 0.40.50.6, p<0.001) and had a longer hospital length of stay [median (IQR) 41.1 (20.5, 72.4) vs 18.5 (10.7, 31.8), p<0.001].

Measures adopted to mitigate risk from the pandemic have had severe impacts on tourism, remittances, and international trade, among other aspects of the political economy of the region, and are thus impacting on food systems, food security and livelihoods. Of particular concern will be the interplay between loss of incomes and the availability and affordability of local and imported foods. In this paper, we examine some of the key pathways of impact on food systems, and identify opportunities to strengthen Pacific food systems during these challenging times. The great diversity among Pacific Island Countries and Territories in their economies, societies, and agricultural potential will be an important guide to planning interventions and developing scenarios of alternative futures. Bolstering regional production and intraregional trade in a currently import-dependent region could strengthen the regional economy, and provide the health benefits of consuming locally produced and harvested fresh foods - as well as decreasing reliance on global supply chains.

OBJECTIVE To identify influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates, including barriers and facilitators to vaccination, among homebound and ambulatory individuals with PD and related disorders. METHODS Cross-sectional US-based study among individuals with PD, aged > 65 years, stratified as homebound or ambulatory. Participants completed semi-structured interviews on vaccination rates and barriers, and healthcare utilization. RESULTS Among 143 participants, 9.8% had missed all influenza vaccinations in the past 5 years, and 32.2% lacked any pneumococcal vaccination, with no between-group differences. Homebound participants (n = 41) reported difficulty traveling to clinic (p < 0.01) as a vaccination barrier, and despite similar outpatient visit frequencies, had more frequent emergency department visits (31.7% vs. 9.8%, p < 0.01) and hospitalizations (14.6% vs. 2.9%, p = 0.03).

Abstract Introduction We analysed the neurological complications of patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients and methods We conducted a retrospective, observational, descriptive study of consecutive patients admitted to the ICU due to severe respiratory symptoms secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 April and 1 June 2020. Results We included 30 patients with neurological symptoms; 21 were men (72.40%), and mean age (standard deviation [SD]) was 57.41 years (11.61). The mean duration of ICU stay was 18.83 days (14.33). The neurological conditions recorded were acute confusional syndrome in 28 patients (93.33%), neuromuscular disease in 15 (50%), headache in 5 (16.66%), cerebrovascular disease in 4 (13.33%), and encephalopathies/encephalitis in 4 (13.33%). CSF analysis results were normal in 6 patients (20%). Brain MRI or head CT showed alterations in 20 patients (66.6%). EEG was performed in all patients (100%), with 8 (26.66%) showing abnormal findings. In 5 of the 15 patients with clinical myopathy, diagnosis was confirmed with electroneuromyography. We found a correlation between older age and duration of ICU stay (P = .002; 95% CI, 4.032-6.022; OR:). Conclusions Severe COVID-19 mainly affects men, as observed in other series. Half of our patients presented acute myopathy, and almost all patients left the ICU with acute confusional syndrome, which fully resolved; no correlation was found with EEG or neuroimaging findings.

However, a subfield has also arisen, specifically focused on how these modifications affect viral RNA, with the possibility that viruses can also be used as a model to best determine the role that these modifications play on cellular mRNAs. First, virologists focused on the most abundant internal mRNA modification, m6A, mapping this modification and elucidating its effects on the RNA of a wide range of RNA and DNA viruses. Next, less common RNA modifications including m5C, Nm and ac4C were investigated and also found to be present on viral RNA. It now appears that viral RNA is littered with a multitude of RNA modifications. In biological systems that are under constant evolutionary pressure to out compete both the host as well as newly arising viral mutants, it poses an interesting question about what evolutionary benefit these modifications provide as it seems evident, at least to this author, that these modifications have been selected for. In this review, I discuss how RNA modifications are identified on viral RNA and the roles that have now been uncovered for these modifications in regard to viral replication.

Given high population heterogeneity in 25(OH)D3 plasma concentration profiles, vitamin D3 dose regimen needs to be personalised. The objective of this study is to establish a model that accurately predicts 25(OH)D3 pharmacokinetics (PK) on an individual level to enable selection of an appropriate dose regimen for anyone. Methods: Plasma or serum concentrations of Vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 from different trials were compiled together. We then developed a series of Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3 in a stepwise manner to select the best model to optimally recapitulate the 10g and 100g daily dose data. Each arm of the clinical trials was simulated individually. Model predictions were qualified with PK data at other doses. Results: From data exploration, we observed an interesting phenomenon: the increase in plasma 25(OH)D3 after repeat dosing was negatively correlated with 25(OH)D3 baseline levels. Our final model assumes a first-order vitamin D3 absorption, linear vitamin D3 elimination and a non-linear 25(OH)D3 elimination which is described with an Emax function. This model offers a simple explanation to the apparent paradox: the negative correlation might arise from the non-linear 25(OH)D3 elimination process. The model was also able to accurately predict plasma 25(OH)D3 after repeat dosing at daily doses other than 10g and 100g, which was reassuring. Conclusions: We developed a PBPK model to recapitulate PK of plasma vitamin D3 and 25(OH)D3. A personalised vitamin D3 supplementation protocol requires measurement of 25(OH)D3 baseline levels.

Adaptive management (AM), long-used in natural resource management, is a structured decision-making approach to solving dynamic problems that accounts for the value of resolving uncertainty via real-time evaluation of alternative models. We propose an AM approach to design and evaluate intervention strategies in epidemiology, using real-time surveillance to resolve model uncertainty as management proceeds, with foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) culling and measles vaccination as case studies. We use simulations of alternative intervention strategies under competing models to quantify the effect of model uncertainty on decision making, in terms of the value of information, and quantify the benefit of adaptive versus static intervention strategies. Culling decisions during the 2001 UK FMD outbreak were contentious due to uncertainty about the spatial scale of transmission. The expected benefit of resolving this uncertainty prior to a new outbreak on a UK-like landscape would be 45C60 million relative to the strategy that minimizes livestock losses averaged over alternate transmission models. AM during the outbreak would be expected to recover up to 20.1 million of this expected benefit. AM would also recommend a more conservative initial approach (culling of infected premises and dangerous contact farms) than would a fixed strategy (which would additionally require culling of contiguous premises). For optimal targeting of measles vaccination, based on an outbreak in Malawi in 2010, AM allows better distribution of resources across the affected region; its utility depends on uncertainty about both the at-risk population and logistical capacity. When daily vaccination rates are highly constrained, the optimal initial strategy is to conduct a small, quick campaign; a reduction in expected burden of approximately 10,000 cases could result if campaign targets can be updated on the basis of the true susceptible population.

The incidence of the disease is particularly on the rise in broiler chicken flocks eliminating the preventive use of antibiotics. To date, no alternative allows for the efficient prevention of NE and a control of the disease using a vaccinal strategy would be mostly prized. For this purpose, comparative and subtractive reverse vaccinology identifying putative immunogenic bacterial surface proteins is one of the most promising approaches. RESULTS: A comparative genomic study was performed on 16 C. perfringens strains isolated from healthy broiler chickens and from broilers affected with necrotic enteritis. Results showed that the analyzed genomes were composed of 155,700 distinct proteins from which 13% were identified as extracellular, 65% as cytoplasmic and 22% as part of the bacterial membrane. The evaluation of the immunogenicity of these proteins was determined using the prediction software VaxiJen?. CONCLUSIONS: For the most part, proteins with the highest scores were associated with an extracellular localisation. For all the proteins analyzed, the combination of both the immunogenicity score and the localisation prediction led to the selection of 12 candidate proteins that were mostly annotated as hypothetical proteins. We describe 6 potential candidates of higher interest due to their antigenic potential, their extracellular localisation, and their possible role in virulence of C. perfringens.","output":"Putative antigenic proteins identified by comparative and subtractive reverse vaccinology in necrotic enteritis-causing Clostridium perfringens isolated from broiler chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) is the pathogenic coronavirus responsible for the global pandemic of COVID-19 disease. The Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 attaches to host lung epithelial cells through the cell surface receptor ACE2, a process dependent on host proteases including TMPRSS2. Here, we identified small molecules that can reduce surface expression of TMPRSS2 using a 2,700 FDA-approved or current clinical trial compounds. Among these, homoharringtonine and halofuginone appear the most potent agents, reducing endogenous TMPRSS2 expression at sub-micromolar concentrations. These effects appear to be mediated by a drug-induced alteration in TMPRSS2 protein stability. We further demonstrate that halofuginone modulates TMPRSS2 levels through proteasomal-mediated degradation that involves the E3 ubiquitin ligase component DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 1 (DCAF1). Finally, cells exposed to homoharringtonine and halofuginone, at concentrations of drug known to be achievable in human plasma, demonstrated marked resistance to SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infection. Given the safety and pharmacokinetic data already available for the compounds identified in our screen, these results should help expedite the rational design of human clinical trials designed to combat COVID-19 infection.","output":"A high throughput screen for TMPRSS2 expression identifies FDA-approved and clinically advanced compounds that can limit SARS-CoV-2 entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Usutu virus (USUV; genus Flavivirus; family Flaviviridae) is a mosquito-borne, positive-sense RNA virus that is currently causing significant die-offs in numerous bird species throughout Europe and has caused infections in humans.

Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~ 50%. Slight increases in mask adherence and/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (R(e)) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will also lower exposure viral load tenfold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy would only lower R(e) if dosed as post-exposure prophylaxis and if given to ~ 50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine. To confirm this prediction, we used a regression model of King County, Washington data and simulated the counterfactual scenario without mask wearing to estimate that in the absence of additional interventions, mask wearing decreased R(e) from 1.3C1.5 to ~ 1.0 between June and September 2020.","output":"Slight reduction in SARS-CoV-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic has spread towards all the seven continents.

METHODS: Participants were 273 [M (SD) age = 22 (2.1) years, 55% female, 32% from minoritized groups] EA completed an online survey of adherence to 11 preventative health behaviors recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during summer 2020. Participants rated adherence via a visual analog scale. Participants also reported demographic information and completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA). RESULTS: Median levels of adherence to preventative recommendations ranged from 66% to 100%. Highest adherence levels (Mdn > 90%) were reported for quarantining if exposed to COVID-19; covering mouth when sneezing; avoiding the elderly/those at high risk; and avoiding large gatherings. Median adherence was <80% for mask wearing; maintaining a 6-foot distance; avoiding in-person visits with romantic partners or friends; and disinfecting surfaces.

As a result, school closures and other non-pharmaceutical interventions were recommended as the first line of defense in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Assessing school reopening scenarios is a priority for states, administrators, parents, and children in order to balance educational disparities and negative population impacts of COVID-19. To address this challenge, we used an agent-based model that simulates communities across the United States including daycares, primary, and secondary schools to quantify the relative health outcomes of reopening schools. We explored different reopening scenarios including remote learning, in-person school, and several hybrid options that stratify the student population into cohorts (i.e., split cohort) in order to reduce exposure and disease spread. In addition, we assessed the combined impact of reduced in-person attendance in workplaces (e.g., through differing degrees of reliance on telework and/or temporary workplace closings) and school reopening scenarios to quantify the potential impact of additional transmission pathways contributing to COVID-19 spread. Scenarios where split cohorts of students return to school in non-overlapping formats resulted in significant decreases in the clinical attack rate (i.e., the percentage of symptomatic individuals), potentially by as much as 75% . These split cohort scenarios have impacts which are only modestly lesser than the most impactful 100% distance learning scenario. Split cohort scenarios can also significantly avert the number of cases--approximately 60M and 28M--depending on the scenario, at the national scale over the simulated eight-month period. We found the results of our simulations to be highly dependent on the number of workplaces assumed to be open for in-person business, as well as the initial level of COVID-19 incidence within the simulated community. Our results show that reducing the number of students attending school leads to better health outcomes, and the split cohort option enables part-time in-classroom education while substantially reducing risk. The results of this study can support decisions regarding optimal school reopening strategies that at the population level balance education and the negative health outcomes of COVID-19.","output":"Using an Agent-Based Model to Assess K-12 School Re-openings Under Different COVID-19 Spread Scenarios - United States, School Year 2020/21"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in February 2003.

Methods Plasma and sera samples were obtained from pregnant women with COVID-19 infection classified into mild (n=10) or severe (n=9) in addition to normotensive pregnancies as controls (n=10) and patients with preeclampsia (n=13). A panel of plasmatic biomarkers was assessed including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), soluble TNF-receptor I (sTNFRI), heparan sulfate (HS), von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, activity and multimeric pattern, 2-antiplasmin (2AP), C5b9, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETS), placental growth factor (PlGF), fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and angiopoietin 2 (Ang2). Additionally, microvascular endothelial cells were exposed patients serum, and changes in the cell expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on cell membrane and VWF release to the extracellular matrix were evaluated through immunofluorescence. Changes in inflammation cell signaling pathways were also assessed by of P38MAPK phosphorylation. Statistical analysis included univariate and multivariate methods. Results Biomarker profiles in mild COVID-19 were similar to controls. Both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 showed significant alterations in the majority of circulating biomarkers with distinctive profiles. While severe COVID-19 exhibited higher concentrations of VCAM-1, sTNFR-I, HS, VWF antigen and NETS with a significant reduction of PlGF as compared to controls; preeclampsia presented a marked increase in VCAM-1, sTNFR-I (significantly increased compared to controls and to severe COVID-19) with a striking reduction in VWF antigen, VWF activity and 2AP. As expected, reduced PlGF, increased sFlt-1 and Ang2 and a very high sFlt-1/PlGF ratio were also observed in preeclampsia. In addition, a significant increase in C5b9 and NETS was also detected in preeclampsia compared to controls. The principal component analysis demonstrated a clear separation between preeclampsia and the rest of groups (first and second components explained 42.2% and 13.5% of the variance), mainly differentiated by variables related to VWF, sTNFRI, HS and sFlt-1. VWF multimeric analysis revealed the absence of VWF high-molecular-weight multimers in preeclampsia (similar profile to von Willebrand disease type 2A) whereas in healthy pregnancies and COVID-19 patients, VWF multimeric pattern was normal. Sera from both preeclampsia and severe COVID-19 patients induced an overexpression of ICAM-1 and VWF in endothelial cells in culture compared to controls. However, the effect of preeclampsia was less pronounced than the one triggered by severe COVID-19. Immunoblots of lysates from endothelial cells exposed to mild and severe COVID-19, and preeclampsia sera showed an increase in p38MAPK phosphorylation. Severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia were statistically different from controls, suggesting that both severe COVID-19 and preeclampsia sera can activate inflammatory signaling pathways.

This may predispose to native aortic root thrombosis (NART). METHODS Patients who underwent Stage 1 Norwood palliation at Children' Hospital Colorado between 2003 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed for NART. Additional cases were identified by a systematic literature review. Patient factors, operative details, presentation, diagnostic modalities, treatments, and outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS Three cases were identified among 241 patients who had undergone Stage 1 Norwood palliation at Children's Hospital Colorado (mean follow-up 48 months). A 4th case identified at Children's Hospital Colorado had undergone stage 1 palliation elsewhere. Twelve additional cases were identified from the systematic literature review. Cases presented with new arrythmias (38%, n=6/16), evidence of ischemia (31%, n=5/16), incidentally (19%, n=3/16), inability to wean from post-operative support (6%, n=1/16) and cardiac arrest (6%, n=1/16). The diagnosis was made by TTE (50%, n=8/16), TEE (19%, n=3/16), cardiac catheterization (25%, n=4/16), and cardiac CT (6%, n=1/16). Importantly, 44% (n=7/16) of cases were missed by TTE and subsequently diagnosed by other modalities. Treatment strategies were surgical thrombectomy (38%, n=6/16), anticoagulation alone (38%, n=6/16), direct catheter thrombolysis (19%, n=3/16), and systemic thrombolysis (6%, n=1/16). The rate of mortality or transplant listing was 44% (n=7/16). CONCLUSIONS NART is an underappreciated complication of Norwood palliation with high mortality. There should be a high index of suspicion for NART in patients after Norwood palliation with an unexplained complicated clinical course.

METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed searching for \\"optic neuropathy\\" and \\"optic neuritis,\\" cross-referencing patients who had orbital MRI with and without contrast. Cases were excluded with known history of orbital trauma or surgery, previous diagnoses known to affect LG size, and poor image quality. LGs were outlined in consecutive axial and coronal slices, and volumes were generated using OsiriX software; cross-sectional area of the orbit was measured by outlining the bony orbit in largest axial section. RESULTS One hundred orbits from 50 patients were included (26 AAs, 24 whites). Mean LG volumes as measured in coronal and axial section were 0.714 and 0.671 cm, respectively; mean orbital area was 10.42 cm. Axial orbital size was found to be highly correlated (P < 0.01) with LG volume. No significant correlation was found with LG volume and age, sex, race, or laterality. CONCLUSIONS This article presents normal values for LG volumes by MRI of AAs and whites. LG volumes were highly correlated with orbital size, a relationship which has not been explored in the recent literature. Such an assessment of LG size relative to patients' orbital dimensions may be more clinically useful than comparison to population-based measures of normal LG volume alone.

In this research, we propose a novel deep language model to extract patient-reported symptoms from clinical text. The deep language model integrates syntactic and semantic analysis for symptom extraction and identifies the actual symptoms reported by patients and conditional or negation symptoms. The deep language model can extract both complex and straightforward symptom expressions. We used a real-world clinical notes dataset to evaluate our model and demonstrated that our model achieves superior performance compared to three other state-of-the-art symptom extraction models. We extensively analyzed our model to illustrate its effectiveness by examining each components contribution to the model.

Diffuse alveolar injury from SARS-CoV-2 increases risk of alveolar rupture. Pneumothorax is a rare complication that has been documented in the literature. Objective: The study aims to investigate the significance of pneumothorax as a complication in patients with previously healthy lungs with acute respiratory failure due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: This is a case-control study of adult patients without existing lung disease managed for acute respiratory failure who developed pneumothorax as a complication of the disease. Patients with iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax, history of chronic lung disease, or previous pneumothorax were excluded. To avoid sample bias from excluding possible false-negatives, the control group (documented SARSCoV- 2 negative) also included patients from the same time period without SARS-CoV-2 testing and a remote unexposed group from a year before. Chi-square analysis was used to determine the relationship between the development of pneumothorax and SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the null hypothesis being no difference in the frequency of pneumothorax among positive SARS-CoV-2 patients and negative SARS-CoV-2 patients. Results: One-hundred-and-thirty charts of patients with symptoms of SAR-CoV-2 were reviewed. Thirty-four patients were documented to be SARS-CoV-2 positive, twelve of which had pneumothorax as a complication of the disease, ninety-one percent of whom were mechanically-ventilated. The control group had ninety-six patients with documented SARS-CoV-2 negative tests, were untested, or part of the historical group. Six patients from the control group had pneumothorax as a complication, two of which were negative for SARS-CoV-2, and three were untested. A Chi-square analysis yielded an X2 statistic of 17.7549 with a p-value of 0.000025.Discussion: Pvalue rejects the null hypothesis in 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01 levels of significance which means that there is a statistically significant difference in the frequency of pneumothorax between the case and control groups. Calculations were done under the assumption that those with negative SARS-CoV-2 tests were indeed free of the virus. There is a probability of underestimation as the tests used may have not been 100-percent sensitive. The four cases of pneumothorax in the control group may have been false-negatives as these patients exhibited imaging findings suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and were likely infected with the virus as well.Conclusion: Pneumothorax is a significant complication in patients without existing lung disease who develop acute respiratory failure and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

There is, however, a paucity of evidence on the impact of air pollution exposure on ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality among the Asian aged population. In response, this research seeks to investigate the degree of proximity between exposure to ambient PM(2.5), household PM(2.5), ground-level ozone (O(3)), and IHD mortality in the top seven Asian economies with the highest aging rates. This investigation is held in two phases. In the first phase, grey modeling is employed to assess the degree of proximity among the selected variables, and then rank them based on their estimated grey weights. In addition, a grey-based Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (G-TOPSIS) is adopted to identify the key influencing factor that intensifies IHD mortality across the selected Asian economies. According to the estimated results, South Korea was the most afflicted nation in terms of IHD mortality owing to ambient PM(2.5) and ground-level O(3) exposure, whereas among the studied nations India was the biggest contributor to raising IHD mortality due to household PM(2.5) exposure. Further, the outcomes of G-TOPSIS highlighted that exposure to household PM(2.5) is a key influencing risk factor for increased IHD mortality in these regions, outweighing all other air pollutants. In conclusion, this grey assessment may enable policymakers to target more vulnerable individuals based on scientific facts and promote regional environmental justice. Stronger emission regulations will also be required to mitigate the adverse health outcomes associated with air pollution exposure, particularly in regions with a higher elderly population.","output":"Long-Term Air Pollution Exposure and Ischemic Heart Disease Mortality Among Elderly in High Aging Asian Economies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Therapies for Ebola virus disease are urgently needed, but they must be rigorously tested for safety and efficacy before any mass roll-out to patients.

Extensive atrial tissue fibrosis identified by delayed enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with poor outcomes of AF catheter ablation. OBJECTIVE To characterize the feasibility of atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI and its association with subsequent AF ablation outcome. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter, prospective, observational cohort study of patients diagnosed with paroxysmal and persistent AF (undergoing their first catheter ablation) conducted between August 2010 and August 2011 at 15 centers in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Delayed enhancement MRI images were obtained up to 30 days before ablation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Fibrosis quantification was performed at a core laboratory blinded to the participating center, ablation approach, and procedure outcome. Fibrosis blinded to the treating physicians was categorized as stage 1 (<10% of the atrial wall), 2 (10%-<20%), 3 (20%-<30%), and 4 (30%). Patients were followed up for recurrent arrhythmia per current guidelines using electrocardiography or ambulatory monitor recording and results were analyzed at a core laboratory. Cumulative incidence of recurrence was estimated by stage at days 325 and 475 after a 90-day blanking period (standard time allowed for arrhythmias related to ablation-induced inflammation to subside) and the risk of recurrence was estimated (adjusting for 10 demographic and clinical covariates). RESULTS Atrial tissue fibrosis estimation by delayed enhancement MRI was successfully quantified in 272 of 329 enrolled patients (57 patients [17%] were excluded due to poor MRI quality). There were 260 patients who were followed up after the blanking period (mean [SD] age of 59.1 [10.7] years, 31.5% female, 64.6% with paroxysmal AF). For recurrent arrhythmia, the unadjusted overall hazard ratio per 1% increase in left atrial fibrosis was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08; P < .001). Estimated unadjusted cumulative incidence of recurrent arrhythmia by day 325 for stage 1 fibrosis was 15.3% (95% CI, 7.6%-29.6%); stage 2, 32.6% (95% CI, 24.3%-42.9%); stage 3, 45.9% (95% CI, 35.5%-57.5%); and stage 4, 51.1% (95% CI, 32.8%-72.2%) and by day 475 was 15.3% (95% CI, 7.6%-29.6%), 35.8% (95% CI, 26.2%-47.6%), 45.9% (95% CI, 35.6%-57.5%), and 69.4% (95% CI, 48.6%-87.7%), respectively. Similar results were obtained after covariate adjustment. The addition of fibrosis to a recurrence prediction model that includes traditional clinical covariates resulted in an improved predictive accuracy with the C statistic increasing from 0.65 to 0.69 (risk difference of 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation, atrial tissue fibrosis estimated by delayed enhancement MRI was independently associated with likelihood of recurrent arrhythmia.

Predicting this event by using hematological biomarkers may provide opportunities for adopting preventive measures against unfavorable neurovascular complications. The aim of this study is to determine the hematological predictors of carotid artery vasospasm during carotid stenting. Material and methods: A total of 120 patients who underwent carotid stenting were divided into two groups: those with and without carotid artery vasospasm. Carotid artery vasospasm was angiographically defined as transient or persistent emergent stenosis or irregularity of the vessel wall without evidence of thrombosis during carotid stenting. The hematological parameters were compared between 21 patients who developed carotid artery vasospasm (17.5%) and 99 patients who did not (82.5%). Results: The mean age of the patients with carotid artery vasospasm and without carotid artery vasospasm was 66 8 and 70 8 years, respectively.

METHODS: The ACS-NSQIP dataset was evaluated for elective ileostomy closures from 1/1/2015 to 12/31/2016. Demographic characteristics, operative, and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. The primary outcome was 30-day major morbidity (Clavien class III and greater). Secondary outcomes were rates and predictors of major morbidity, superficial site infection (SSI), reoperation, and readmission from multivariate logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: We retrospectively evaluated 1885 patients. The median operative time was 65 (IQR 50C90) minutes and median length of stay was 3 (IQR 2C5) days. Major morbidity was recorded in 6.7%, including mortality (1.0%), deep/organ space SSI (2.6%), dehiscence (0.8%), reintubation (0.5%), sepsis (1.7%), septic shock (0.8%), and reoperation (3.7%). Readmission was recorded in 9.7% and 6.2% had SSI.

With the onset and spread of Covid-19, the attention of the health care system has pivoted to handling the disease, potentially at the cost of other health care needs. This paper explores whether this shift has come at the cost of non Covid related health care, especially the use of MCH services. Methods: Graphs, descriptive statistics and paired t-tests of significance are used to compare levels of inpatient and outpatient health care service utilization before and after the onset and spread of the virus. The analysis is based on a survey of 59 health centers and 29 public hospitals located in urban Ethiopia, the most acutely affected region of the country. Data on the use of health care services for a period of 24 months was gathered from the health management information systems (HMIS) of these facilities. Results: There is a sharp reduction in the use of both inpatient (20-27%) and outpatient (27-34%) care, particularly in Addis Ababa, which has been most acutely affected by the virus. However, the decline does not come at the cost of MCH services. The use of several MCH components (skilled birth attendant deliveries, immunization, post-natal care) remains unaffected throughout the period while others (family planning services, ante-natal care) experience a decline (8-17%) in the immediate aftermath but recover soon after. Conclusion: Concerns about the crowding out of MCH services due to the focus on Covid 19 are unfounded. Pro-active measures taken by the government and health care facilities to ring-fence the use of essential health care services have mitigated service disruptions.

At present, we aimed to investigate whether FOXO3 is a target of punicalin to prevent IL-1- and TNF--induced chondrocyte dysfunction in vitro and in vivo models. Cell and mouse models of chondrocyte dysfunction were established to determine the pharmacological value of hydrolyzable tannin, punicalin, which was extracted from the pomegranate. FOXO3 protein levels in the nucleus and cytoplasm were analysed using western blot. Safranine O staining was performed to evaluate the expansion of growth plate and chondrocyte differentiation in IL-1- and TNF--treated mice. In IL-1- and TNF--treated chondrocytes and mice, IL-1 and TNF- evoked phosphorylation and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FOXO3, as well as reduced FOXO3 expression levels in the nucleus. However, punicalin treatment repressed FOXO3 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic transfer. Punicalin treatment improved IL-1 and TNF--induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of chondrocyte and the abnormal expansion of growth plate and hypertrophic zone. Moreover, punicalin could maintain the normal phenotype of chondrocyte via mediating multiple gene expression. Punicalin showed a beneficial effect on IL-1- and TNF--stimulated chondrocytes and cartilaginous metabolic disorders via preserving the transcriptional activity of FOXO3.

Lineage B.1.1 most probably evolved within Italy and spread from central to south Italian regions, and to European countries. The lineage B.1.1.1 entered Italy only in the second half of March and remained localized in Piedmont until June 2020.

We conducted a multicenter, one-arm, proof-of-concept interventional study. Patients with COVID-19 with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, elevated C-reactive protein level and need for mechanical ventilation and/or continuous positive airway pressure were enrolled. One to three units (each of 250-300 mL) of hyperimmune plasma (neutralizing antibody titer 1:160) were administered. The primary outcome measure was 7-day hospital mortality. Secondary study outcomes were PaO2/FiO2, changes in laboratory and radiological parameters, weaning from mechanical ventilation and safety of the intervention. The study enrolled 46 patients between March 25 and April 21, 2020. The mean age of the patients was 63 years and 61% were male. Thirty of the patients were on continuous positive airway pressure and seven were intubated. The mean PaO2/FiO2 was 128 (standard deviation [SD] 47). Bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray were present in 36 patients (84%). The mean duration of symptoms and ARDS was 14 (SD 7) and 6 (SD 3) days, respectively. Three patients (6.5%) died within 7 days as compared to an expected 15% according to national statistics and 30% in a small concurrent cohort of 23 patients. The upper one-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) was 13.9%, allowing rejection of the null hypothesis of a 15% mortality. The PaO2/FiO2 increased by 112 units (95% CI: 82-142) in survivors and the severity of the chest X-ray findings decreased in 23% (95% CI: 5%-42%). C-reactive protein, ferritin and lactate dehydrogenase levels decreased by 60%, 36% and 20%, respectively. Weaning from continuous positive airway pressure was achieved in 26/30 patients and it was possible to extubate three of the seven patients who had been intubated. Five serious adverse events occurred in four patients (2 likely and 2 possibly treatment-related). In conclusion, hyperimmune plasma showed promising benefits in COVID-19. Although these benefits need to be confirmed in a randomized controlled trial, this proof-of-concept study could open the way to future developments including hyperimmune plasma banking, standardized pharmaceutical products and monoclonal antibodies.","output":"Mortality reduction in 46 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with hyperimmune plasma.

METHODS: From April 1 to April 28, 2020, the authors conducted a national survey advertised via e-mail lists, social media, and direct e-mail. Participants were self-selecting, U.S.-based volunteers. Scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, General Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C were used. The relationships between personal resilience and risk factors, work culture and stressors and supports, and COVID-19-related events were examined. RESULTS: Of 1,685 participants (76% female, 88% White), 31% (404 of 1,311) endorsed mild anxiety, and 33% (427 of 1,311) clinically meaningful anxiety; 29% (393 of 1,341) reported mild depressive symptoms, and 17% (233 of 1,341) moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 5% (64 of 1,326) endorsed suicidal ideation; and 14% (184 of 1,300) screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder.

We hope that our research will help control the COVID-19 waves and a future crisis of this nature. METHODS: COVID-19 case data were obtained from Our World in Data database. Combined with case data, we made a retrospective study by analyzing the government policies and non-pharmaceutical interventions taken during this pandemic in these four representative Asian countries (South Korea, Japan, India, and China). RESULTS: From January 2020 to May 18, 2021, South Korea and Japan experienced three waves of COVID-19 outbreaks, but the number of daily new confirmed cases per million people was relatively small in both countries, and South Korea had fewer daily new confirmed cases per million than Japan. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan in late 2019, China successfully contained the first wave of the outbreak and was not currently experiencing a large-scale resurgence of the epidemic (Until May 18, 2021). India is experiencing a grim second wave of the epidemic, with far more daily new confirmed cases per million people than South Korea and Japan. CONCLUSION: Successful practices in China and South Korea show that case identification and management, coupled with close contact tracing and isolation, is a powerful strategy. The lessons of Japan and India show that social distancing is an effective measure, but only if it is rigor and persistent.

Concerns were raised regarding the impact of resources reorganization on certain emergency pathology management. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of the outbreak (in terms of reduction of neurosurgical emergencies) during lockdown in different regions of Spain. METHODS: We analyzed the impact of the outbreak in four different affected regions by descriptive statistics and univariate comparison with same period of two previous years. These regions differed in their incidence level (high/low) and in the time of excess mortality with respect to lockdown declaration. That allowed us to analyze their influence on the characteristics of neurosurgical emergencies registered for every region. RESULTS: 1185 patients from 18 neurosurgical centers were included. Neurosurgical emergencies that underwent surgery dropped 24.41% and 28.15% in 2020 when compared with 2019 and 2018, respectively. A higher reduction was reported for the most affected regions by COVID-19. Non-traumatic spine experienced the most significant decrease in number of cases. Life-threatening conditions did not suffer a reduction in any health care region. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affected dramatically the neurosurgical emergency management. The most significant reduction in neurosurgical emergencies occurred on those regions that were hit unexpectedly by the pandemic, as resources were focused on fighting the virus. As a consequence, life-threating and non-life-threatening conditions mortality raised.

Recent work implicates increased corticostriatal functional connectivity as a marker of response to non-CLZ, dopamine (DA) D2-receptor blocking antipsychotic drugs. However, it is undetermined whether this connectivity finding also relates to CLZs unique efficacy, or if response to CLZ is associated with changes in striatal DA functioning. OBJECTIVE: In a cohort of 22 individuals with TRS, we examined response to CLZ in relation to the following: (1) change in corticostriatal functional connectivity; and (2) change in a magnetic resonance-based measure of striatal tissue iron (R2), which demonstrates utility as a proxy measure for elements of DA functioning. METHODS: Participants underwent scanning while starting CLZ and after 12 weeks of CLZ treatment. We used both cortical and striatal regions of interest to examine changes in corticostriatal interactions and striatal R2 in relation to CLZ response (% reduction of psychotic symptoms). RESULTS: We first found that response to CLZ was associated with an increase in corticostriatal connectivity between the dorsal caudate and regions of the frontoparietal network (P < 0.05, corrected). Secondly, we observed no significant changes in striatal R2 across CLZ treatment. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results indicate that changes in corticostriatal networks without gross shifts in striatal DA functioning underlies CLZ response. Our results provide novel mechanistic insight into response to CLZ treatment.

Rather than cooperate to contain and respond to a common threat, the world's leading powers-the United States and China-have increasingly blamed each other through wildly speculative theories about the origins of the virus. The World Health Organization sought to coordinate a global response, but it has been hamstrung and has come under attack. Given past cooperation between major powers to mobilize and eradicate smallpox and previous US leadership to fight HIV/AIDS and the 2014 West African Ebola crisis, the limited cooperation and lack of leadership are puzzling. What explains the anemic global response to date? This article draws from structural international relations theory to suggest a partial but somewhat dissatisfying answer. International organizations are inherently weak and now face opposition by major powers. The international system simultaneously incentivizes states to cooperate and address common threats, but it also encourages countries to take care of themselves, potentially at the expense of others.

The aim of our study was to assess the prevalence of malnutrition in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia using bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA), and to evaluate the relationship of their nutritional status with the severity and outcome of disease. Methods: Among 150 consecutive patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia, 37 (24.3%) were classified as malnourished by BIVA, and were followed-up for 60 days from admission. Outcome measures were differences in the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, in-hospital mortality, and the duration of hospital stay in survivors. Results: During 60 days of follow-up, 10 (27%) malnourished patients and 13 (12%) non-malnourished patients required invasive mechanical ventilation (p = 0.023), and 13 (35%) malnourished patients and 9 (8%) non-malnourished patients died (p < 0.001).

How does ecocritical discourse help us to see the ways Hong Kong's success has contributed to its vulnerability? What are the tropes that defined the development of Hong Kong in the colonial period and how have they been re-imagined in the post-handover period? Will Hong Kong's post-handover reappropriation of nature encourage other former colonies to adopt a green agenda and lead to the cross-fertilization of ecocritcal, historical, cultural and social discourses? This paper adopts an ecocritical perspective and revisits some of the central natural symbols that have shaped the grand narrative of Hong Kong. It reconsiders the natural tropes- the barren rock - that were used to reinforce colonial superiority, the ways that geography has determined the city's destiny, and the role of the official flower in the creation of the city's identity. Citing developments in the post-handover period (the Save Choi Yuen Village movement, the rise of organic communities, and the tactics of protestors in the summer of 2019), the paper reveals how natural tropes have been liberated from their traditional associations.

In the case of connective tissue disorders, AMDs are prescribed for a prolonged duration in small doses, and their effect is observed after few weeks, whereas in the case of viral infections, they are prescribed in larger doses for a short duration to achieve a quick saturation effect. In rheumatic diseases, AMDs are well tolerated, and their side effects are rare. However, in some viral diseases, the effect of AMDs is questionable or not so noticeable as suggested during the initial prognosis. They are mainly used as an additive therapy to antiviral drugs, but recent studies have shown that AMDs can diminish the efficacy of some antiviral drugs and may cause respiratory, kidney, liver, and cardiac complications.","output":"Antimalarial drugsare they beneficial in rheumatic and viral diseases?considerations in COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Conventional chest and abdominal MRI require breath-holds to reduce motion artifacts. Neonates and infants require general anesthesia with intubation to enable breath-held acquisitions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to validate a free-breathing approach to reduce general anesthesia using a motion-insensitive radial acquisition with respiratory gating. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled children <3 years old who were referred for MRI of the chest or abdomen. They were divided into two groups according to MRI protocol: (1) breath-held scans under general anesthesia with T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo (SSFSE) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted modified Dixon, and (2) free-breathing scans using radial sequences (T2-W MultiVane XD and contrast-enhanced T1-W three-dimensional [3-D] Vane XD). Two readers graded image quality and motion artifacts. RESULTS: We included 23 studies in the free-breathing cohort and 22 in the breath-hold cohort. The overall imaging scores for the free-breathing radial T2-W sequence were similar to the scores for the breath-held T2-W SSFSE sequence (chest, 3.6 vs. 3.2, P=0.07; abdomen, 3.9 vs. 3.7, P=0.66). The free-breathing 3-D radial T1-W sequence also had image quality scores that were similar to the breath-held T1-W sequence (chest, 4.0 vs. 3.0, P=0.06; abdomen, 3.7 vs. 3.9, P=0.15). Increased motion was seen in the abdomen on the radial T2-W sequence (P<0.001), but increased motion was not different in the chest (P=0.73) or in contrast-enhanced T1-W sequences (chest, P=0.39; abdomen, P=0.15). The mean total sequence time was longer in free-breathing compared to breath-held exams (P<0.01); however, this did not translate to longer overall exam times (P=0.94). CONCLUSION: Motion-insensitive radial sequences used for infants and neonates were of similar image quality to breath-held sequences and had decreased sedation and intubation.","output":"Free-breathing magnetic resonance imaging with radial k-space sampling for neonates and infants to reduce anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"#ERSCongress 2020 best-abstract awardees summarise their virtual European Respiratory Society International Congress experience and views on the evolving field of research for their respective assembly https://bit.ly/3kJ9JrJ","output":"European Respiratory Society International Congress 2020: highlights from best-abstract awardees"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been hugely successful in alleviating hospitalization and deaths caused by the newly emerged coronavirus that is the cause of COVID. However, although the parentally administered vaccines are very effective at reducing severe disease, they do not induce sterilizing immunity. As the virus continues to circulate around the globe, it is still not clear how long protection will last, nor whether variants will emerge that escape vaccine immunity. Animal models can be useful to complement studies of antigenicity of novel variants and inform decision making about the need for vaccine updates. The Syrian golden hamster is the preferred small animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since virus is efficiently transmitted between hamsters, we developed a transmission challenge model that presents a more natural dose and route of infection than the intranasal challenge usually employed. Our studies demonstrate that an saRNA vaccine based on the earliest Wuhan-like virus spike sequence induced neutralizing antibodies in sera of immunized hamsters at similar titres to those in human convalescent sera or vaccine recipients. The saRNA vaccine was equally effective at abrogating clinical signs in animals who acquired through exposure to cagemates infected either with a virus isolated in summer 2020 or with a representative Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant isolated in December 2020. The vaccine also reduced shedding of infectious virus from the nose, further reinforcing its likely effectiveness at reducing onwards transmission. This model can be extended to test the effectiveness of vaccination in blocking infections with and transmission of novel variants as they emerge.","output":"A self-amplifying RNA vaccine protects against SARS-CoV-2 (D614G) and Alpha variant of concern (B.1.1.7) in a transmission-challenge hamster model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, research studies on nutraceutically important polyphenolic substances have attracted intensive attention. Berberis vulgaris is an important source of polyphenolic compounds and is often used in traditional medicine. In this study, the extraction of rutin and apigenin rich oil from Berberis vulgaris fruits was evaluated by supercritical carbon dioxide (Sc-CO(2)) extraction method with and without co-solvent. As valuable antioxidants, rutin and apigenin content of extracts were analyzed by HPLC, and their amounts were maximized via parametric optimization. The rutin compound studied in this research has the potential to be a drug against the COVID-19 virus. The operating conditions were considered in the range of 35C70 C temperatures, 140C240 bar of pressures, 0.35C1.00 mm of mean particle sizes, 3C7 l/min of CO(2) flow rates, and 0C8% w/w co-solvent. As a result of Sc-CO(2) extractions, the amounts of rutin and apigenin were found as 173  14.97 g/g and 2.91  0.11 g/g, respectively, with the 8% (w/w) co-solvent addition. The amounts of rutin and apigenin obtained by Soxhlet extractions were found as 208.81  8.48 g/g and 6.55  0.21 g/g, respectively. When the Sc-CO(2) method was compared with the Soxhlet method, it was seen that the fast and eco-friendly Sc-CO(2) method was an ideal extraction method by providing 76.89% rutin and 44.53% apigenin recoveries. As a result of this study, the maximum extraction conditions for rutin and apigenin were obtained as 160 bar, 40 C, 0.35 mm particle size, 3 l/min CO(2), 8% w/w co-solvent ratio, and 120 min extraction period.

However, there are no data on resources and barriers to training and factors associated with fellow productivity. METHODS We surveyed United States pediatric pulmonology fellowship program directors (FPDs) between March and October 2019. Our primary outcome was fellow productivity ( >75% of fellows in the past 5 years had a manuscript accepted in a peer-reviewed journal). Analyses included descriptive statistics, 2 and Fisher's exact tests for categorical values, and t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for numerical values. RESULTS 61% (33/54) FPDs completed the survey. 79% reported that most fellows completed clinical, basic science or translational research. However, only 21% reported that most fellows pursued research positions after graduation; academic clinical positions were more common. For 21%, lack of funding and competing clinical responsibilities were barriers to completing scholarly activity. Only 39% had highly productive programs; those FPDs were more likely to be highly satisfied with fellow scholarly activity products (p = 0.049) and have >6 publications in the previous 3 years (p = 0.03). 52% of FPDs believed that pediatric pulmonary training should be shortened to 2 years for those pursuing clinical or clinician-educator careers.

A better understanding of the role of virus infections in this condition is needed to improve clinical management and preventive measures. The aim of the study was therefore to assess the association between specific respiratory viruses and childhood CAP. METHODS A case-control study was conducted during 3 years in Stockholm, Sweden. Cases were children aged 5 years with radiological CAP. Healthy controls were consecutively enrolled at child health units during routine visits and matched to cases on age and calendar time. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and analysed by real-time PCR for 15 viruses. Multivariate conditional logistic regression was used to account for coinfections with other viruses and baseline characteristics. RESULTS A total of 121 cases, of which 93 cases met the WHO criteria for radiological pneumonia, and 240 controls were included in the study. Viruses were detected in 81% of the cases (n=98) and 56% of the controls (n=134). Influenza virus, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus were detected in 60% of cases and were significantly associated with CAP with ORs >10. There was no association with parainfluenza virus, human enterovirus or rhinovirus and coronavirus and bocavirus were negatively associated with CAP.

One such approach for evaluating body water composition in various circumstances is bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). This study aims to appraise the usefulness of the Body Composition Monitor (BCM, Fresenius Medical Care, Germany) in assessing body fluid composition and intercompartmental shifts before and after open major abdominal surgery. This prospective, clinician blinded observational study enrolled all the patients scheduled consecutively for elective major open abdominal surgery during a 1-year period starting from January 1st, 2016. BIA parameters-total body water (TBW), extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), absolute fluid overload (AFO), and relative fluid overload (RFO) were measured before and after surgery. The results were compared with fluid balance and outcome parameters such as organ dysfunction, ICU-and hospital length of stay (-LOS). The study population included 71 patients aged 60.2  12 of whom 60.6% men and with a BMI of 26.3  5.1 kg/m2. Postoperative acute kidney injury, respiratory dysfunction, and infections occurred in 14.0%, 19.7% and 28.1% of cases, respectively. The median LOS in ICU was 20 h and the hospital-LOS was 10 days. Positive intraoperative fluid balance (2.4  1.0 L) resulted in a significant increase of TBW (1.4  2.4 L) and of ECW (1.4  1.2 L). Intraoperative fluid balance significantly correlated with TBW change (r = 0.23, p = 0.04) and with AFO change (r = 0.31, p < 0.01).

A quantitative assay was recently developed by Abbott Laboratories to measures antibodies against the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. In addition to assessing disease prevalence, this assay is useful towards determining the scale and duration of the humoral response to infection and vaccination. Here we evaluated the clinical and analytical performance of the quantitative Abbott AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay and characterized the longitudinal dynamics of the IgG response against SARS-CoV-2 in 402 infected individuals up to 322 days post-symptom onset. METHODS: To assess test sensitivity, 1257 serum specimens derived from 402 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR were analyzed on the Abbott Alinity platform. To evaluate test specificity, 394 specimens were tested from patients who were symptomatic but PCR negative for SARS-CoV-2, as well as 305 archived pre-pandemic samples. To further characterize test performance metrics, we evaluated assay precision and linearity. RESULTS: The Abbott AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay exhibited diagnostic specificity of 99.02% using 305 pre ? COVID-19 serum specimens and 98.73% using 394 PCR negative specimens. Using 1257 sequential serum samples collected from PCR-confirmed individuals, clinical test sensitivity of the assay was 39.7% at 3C7 days, 75.9% at 8C14 days, 95.6% at 15C21 days, and 98.7% at 4C5 weeks post-symptom onset. The assay is linear across the analytical measurement range claimed by the manufacturer (22C25,000 AU/mL) and exhibited good analytical precision. The median concentration of IgG increased steadily from <22 AU/mL at 3C7 days post-symptom onset, to a peak of 14,421 AU/mL at 6C7 weeks. Although antibody concentration started to decline at 8C9 weeks following symptom onset, all patients remained seropositive during the observation period. When the positivity rate of this assay was compared with the Abbott anti-NP IgG and EUROIMMUN anti-S1 IgG tests, clinical sensitivity of the Abbott AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay was the highest at all time points with the exception of 4C5 weeks after symptom onset.

With current pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) though the molecular analysis with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the cornerstone of diagnosis, the critical role of chest imaging including CT scan and baseline X-ray became apparent early in the course due to concern for less than optimal sensitivity of PCR testing. Delay in molecular diagnosis due to a shortage of testing kits and laboratory personnel also makes imaging an important modality in early diagnosis for appropriate triage and isolation decisions. CT scan technology is widely available in developed parts of the world but in developing countries, CT scanner is not widely available especially in rural settings.

Assessments have been conducted into the short-term cognitive effects of nicotine and into diseases such as Parkinson's, Tourette syndrome, ADHD or ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Analyses of nicotine administration protocols and safety were conducted after reviewing Medline and Science Direct databases performing a search using the words [transdermal nicotine] AND [non-smoker] AND selected diseases. RESULTS: Among 298 articles identified, there were 35 reviewed publications reporting on 33 studies of non-smokers receiving transdermal nicotine for >48hours. In the 16 randomized trials, 7 crossover, 1 case/control and 9 open studies patients received an initial nicotine dose of between 2.5mg and 15mg/day. In 22 studies, daily doses increased by 2 to 7 steps in 3 to 96 days until the dose was between 5mg and 105mg/day. The target nicotine dose was 19.0620.89mg/day. The 987 non-smokers (534 never-smokers, 326 ex-smokers and 127 classified as \\"non-smokers\\") received or did not receive nicotine. The most common side-effects were nausea and skin itching. Forty-three (7.1%) non-smokers stopped treatment because of an adverse event of nicotine. No hospitalization related to nicotine side-effects were reported. CONCLUSION: Despite a relatively safe tolerance profile, transdermal nicotine therapy in non-smokers can only be used in clinical trials. There is a lack of formal assessment of the potential risk of developing a tobacco addiction.

However, students' implicit and self-controlled learning processes in games make it difficult to understand their problem-solving behaviors. Observational and qualitative methods, such as interviews and exams, fail to capture students' in-process difficulties. By integrating data mining techniques, this study explored students' problem-solving processes in a puzzle-based game. First, we applied the Continuous Hidden Markov Model to identify students' problem-solving phases and the transition probabilities between these phases. Second, we employed sequence mining techniques to investigate problem-solving patterns and strategies facilitating students' problem-solving processes. The results suggested that most students were stuck in a certain phase, with only a few able to transfer to systematic phases by applying efficient strategies. At the beginning of the puzzle, the most popular strategy was testing one dimension of the solution at each attempt. In contrast, the other two strategies (remove or add untested dimensions one by one) played pivotal roles in promoting transitions to higher problem-solving phases. The findings of this study shed light on when, how, and why students advanced their effective problem-solving processes. Using the Continuous Hidden Markov Model and sequence mining techniques, we provide considerable promise for uncovering students' problem-solving processes, which helps trigger future scaffolds and interventions to support students personalized learning in game-based learning environments.","output":"Uncovering students problem-solving processes in game-based learning environments"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Metamemory training (MMT) is a useful training strategy for improving cognitive functioning in the older adult population.

It acts as a retrieval signal, returning proteins that have left the compartment in which they reside. The second type of information has been found in the membrane-spanning domain of several ER and Golgi proteins and, though the mechanism by which it operates is still unclear, it acts as a retention signal, keeping the protein at a particular location within the organelle. The presence of both a retrieval signal and a retention signal in a trans-Golgi network resident protein suggests that more than one mechanism operates to ensure correct localization of resident proteins along the exocytic pathway.","output":"Retention and retrieval in the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The travel restrictions caused by the epidemic outbreak in early 2020 worldwide have caused many changes in all aspects of life, especially in the acoustic environment.

Therefore, treatment of hypoxemia is a clinical priority in the treatment of such patients. In this regard, newer strategies such as High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) and non-invasive mechanical ventilators that can provide non-invasive high fraction of inspired oxygen are gaining clinical significance. Our objective was to compare oxygen supply by HFNO with Non-Rebreather Masks and Nasal Cannula (NRMs + NC) in terms of treatment costs and mortality in a group of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care unit admission. Material: and Methods: This was a retrospective and single-center study involving 54 patients who were admitted to an Intensive Care Unit with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection between July 2020 and August 2020. Results: : HFNO was compared with NMRs + NC in terms of mortality and duration of hospital stay. The two groups were comparable in age (p=0.45), gender (p=0.33), and mortality (p=0.43). Also, there was no significant difference in oxygen saturation at admission (p=0.63), duration of intensive care (p=0.35), total length of hospital stay (p=0.057), and need for invasive mechanical ventilator (p=0.39) between the study groups. The levels of WBC (p=0.36), platelets (p=0.12), lymphocytes (p=0.98), CRP (p=0.11), pro-calcitonin (p=0.20), D-dimer (p=0.74), ferritin (p=0.14), urea (p=0.74), and creatinine (p=0.35) were also similar between the two groups. Conclusion: Oxygen support by NRMs + NC was comparable to HFNO in terms of mortality, need for invasive mechanic ventilation, length of intensive care, and length of hospital stay. We believe that NRMs + NC may represent an inexpensive and easily accessible therapeutic substitute for HFNO, particularly when the risk of transmission and costs related with HFNO use are considered.","output":"Feasibility of Non-Rebreather Masks and Nasal Cannula as a Substitute for High Flow Nasal Oxygen in Patients with Severe COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe and evaluate a risk-stratified triage pathway for inpatient urology consultations during the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. This pathway seeks to outline a urology patient care strategy that reduces the transmission risk to both healthcare providers and patients, reduces the healthcare burden, and maintains appropriate patient care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consultations to the urology service during a 3-week period (March 16 to April 2, 2020) were triaged and managed via one of 3 pathways: Standard, Telemedicine, or High-Risk. Standard consults were in-person consults with non COVID-19 patients, High-Risk consults were in-person consults with COVID-19 positive/suspected patients, and Telemedicine consults were telephonic consults for low-acuity urologic issues in either group of patients. Patient demographics, consultation parameters and consultation outcomes were compared to consultations from the month of March 2019. Categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and continuous variables using Mann-Whitney U test. A P value <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Between March 16 and April 2, 2020, 53 inpatient consultations were performed. By following our triage pathway, a total of 19/53 consultations (35.8%) were performed via Telemedicine with no in-person exposure, 10/53 consultations (18.9%) were High-Risk, in which we strictly controlled the urology team member in-person contact, and the remainder, 24/53 consultations (45.2%), were performed as Standard in-person encounters. COVID-19 associated consultations represented 18/53 (34.0%) of all consultations during this period, and of these, 8/18 (44.4%) were managed successfully via Telemedicine alone.

Recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to suspend elective dental procedures and avoid aerosol-generating procedures posed significant challenges in the management of patients presenting with endodontic emergencies and uncertainty of outcomes for endodontic procedures initiated, but not completed, before shutdown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the success of palliative care on endodontic emergencies during the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the stability of teeth with long-term Ca(OH)2 placement because of delays in treatment completion. METHODS: Patients presenting for endodontic emergencies during COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place orders received palliative care, including pharmacologic therapy and/or non-aerosol-generating procedural interventions. Part I of the study evaluated the effectiveness of palliative care, and need for aerosol-generating procedures or extractions was quantified. Part II of the study evaluated survivability and rate of adverse events for teeth that received partial or full root canal debridement and placement of calcium hydroxide before shutdown. RESULTS: Part I: Twenty-one patients presented with endodontic emergencies in 25 teeth during statewide shutdown. At a follow-up rate of 96%, 83% of endodontic emergencies required no further treatment or intervention after palliative care. Part II: Thirty-one teeth had received partial or full root canal debridement before statewide shutdown. Mean time to complete treatment was 13 weeks. At a recall rate of 100%, 77% of teeth did not experience any adverse events due to delays in treatment completion. The most common adverse event was a fractured provisional restoration (13%), followed by painful and/or infectious flare-up (6.4%), which were managed appropriately and therefore seemed successful. Only 1 tooth was fractured and nonrestorable (3%), leading to a failed outcome of tooth extraction. The remaining 4 outcome failures (13%) were due to patient unwillingness to undergo school-mandated COVID testing or patient unwillingness to continue treatment because of perceived risk of COVID infection. CONCLUSIONS: Palliative care for management of endodontic emergencies is a successful option when aerosol-generating procedures are restricted. This treatment approach may be considered in an effort to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19 infection during subsequent shutdowns. Prolonged Ca(OH)2 medicament because of COVID-19 related delays in treatment completion appeared to have minimal effect on survival of teeth.","output":"To Drill or Not to Drill: Management of Endodontic Emergencies and In-Process Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, and the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19).

Moreover, it has been reported that infected subjects, both with and without clinical signs of COVID-19, can transmit the virus. Since the infection typically enters through mouth, nose, and eyes, dentistry is one of the medical practices at highest risk of infection due to the frequent production of aerosol and the constant presence of saliva.

Treatment recommendations must consider this risk for elderly and vulnerable cancer patients. We re-analyzed trials in elderly glioblastoma (GBM) patients, incorporating COVID-19 risk, in order to provide a quantitative framework for comparing different radiation (RT) fractionation schedules on patient outcomes. METHODS: We extracted individual patient-level data (IPLD) for 1,321 patients from Kaplan-Meier curves from five randomized trials on treatment of elderly GBM patients including available subanalyses based on MGMT methylation status. We simulated trial data with incorporation of COVID-19 associated mortality risk in several scenarios (low, medium, and high infection and mortality risks). Median overall survival and hazard ratios were calculated for each simulation replicate. RESULTS: Our simulations reveal how COVID-19-associated risks affect survival under different treatment regimens. Hypofractionated RT with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) demonstrated the best outcomes in low and medium risk scenarios. In frail elderly patients, shorter courses of RT are preferable. In patients with methylated MGMT receiving single modality treatment, TMZ-alone treatment approaches may be an option in settings with high COVID-19-associated risk. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of COVID-19-associated risk models into analysis of randomized trials can help guide clinical decisions during this pandemic. In elderly GBM patients, our results support prioritization of hypofractionated RT and highlight the utility of MGMT methylation status in decision-making in pandemic scenarios.

In recent times, the recycling of MSW has drawn attention as the process can add value through resources from the recovered waste materials and facilitates the process of circular economy. However, during the unprecedented coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the risk of infection with the highly contagious virus has proven detrimental to the continuation of MSW as a valuable resource. The volume of waste, especially household waste, is higher; face masks, PPE (personal protective equipment), and hazardous materials such as batteries and empty chlorine bottles are examples of extra waste that have arisen during the pandemic.

The results showed that nanoflower -MnO2 exhibited best removal efficiency due to its high oxygen vacancy, high Mn3+ content, easily released lattice oxygen and unique tunnel structure which make its Mn-O bond easier to activate. Further study of the mechanism revealed that the process of removing TCS by MnO2 was the first adsorption and then oxidation process and the detailed reaction process was clarified. 3-chlorophenol and 2,4-dichlorophenol were proved to be their oxidative product. Additionally, it was verified that oxidation dominated in the removal of TCS by MnO2 rather than adsorption through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations analysis.

Methods: We use daily data at the county level. The COVID-19 cases and fatalities data are from the New York Times. Social distancing measures are from SafeGraph. Both data are retrieved from the Unfolded Studio website. The county-level COVID-related policy responses are from the National Association of Counties. We use an event-study design and regression analysis to estimate the effect of the state-wide shelter-in-place order on social distancing and the number of cases and deaths. Results: We find that the growth rate of cases and deaths is significantly lower during the policy period when the percentage of the population that stays at home is highest. The crucial question is whether the policy has a causal impact on the sheltering percentages. The fact that some counties in Texas adopted local restrictive policies well before the state-wide policy helps us address this question. We do not find evidence that this top-down restrictive policy increased the percentage of the population that exercised social distancing.

Findings showed that the increase in WFH in vocational counseling psychologists during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with an increase in productivity and job satisfaction and with lower distractibility in WFH compared to work on-site. However, more frequent WFH was not significantly associated with improved work-life balance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vocational counselors who shared the office on-site with many colleagues experienced higher feeling of loneliness during WFH. Vocational counselors regarded the condition of WFH as productive and satisfying while work-life balance did not improve.

I describe the application of an emergency department (ED) disaster response plan to manage the SARS outbreak. METHODS: The ED implemented protection for staff, patients, and facility; infection control measures; and disaster-response workflow changes. The Ministry of Health, Singapore, centralized SARS cases in the hospital, and the ED became the national screening center. A screening questionnaire and a set of admission criteria were applied after assessment of clinical features and chest radiograph findings. RESULTS: For the duration of the outbreak that ended on May 31, 2003, the ED screened 11,461 persons for SARS, of whom 1,386 (12.9%) were admitted to rule out SARS and 235 (17%) were confirmed to have SARS. Among 10,075 persons discharged from the ED, there were 28 reattending patients who were admitted and diagnosed with SARS, giving an undertriage rate of 0.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1% to 0.4%). The sensitivity of an ED admission for SARS was 89.4% (95% CI 85.6% to 93.1%), and specificity was 89.7% (95% CI 89.2% to 90.3%). The positive predictive value was 17% (95% CI 15.7% to 18.4%), and the negative predictive value was 99.7% (95% CI 99.6% to 99.8%). No patient contracted SARS as a result of an ED visit. After full implementation of protective measures, 1 ED nurse with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus was treated for suspected SARS. CONCLUSION: Although the SARS outbreak was not a bioterrorism event, the ED disaster response was applicable in the outbreak's management. The use of a screening questionnaire and admission criteria enabled the ED to screen, treat, and safely discharge the majority of the patients.","output":"An emergency department response to severe acute respiratory syndrome(): A prototype response to bioterrorism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The Coronavirus 2019 pandemic prompted Gastroenterology (GI) practices to rapidly implement telehealth-based care in order to improve resource allocation, protect patient and staff wellbeing, and comply with public health measures. In 2020, we surveyed nearly 1,500 patients showing a satisfaction rate with telehealth services of over 80%. This current descriptive, survey-based study aims to assess patient satisfaction with telehealth services in comparison to in-person office visits and to portray the factors impacting the patient experience. Methods: An online survey was distributed to patients of eight community-based GI practices across the United States between January and April, 2021. Responses were recorded on a five-point Likert scale. The net promoter score (NPS), a metric for customer loyalty and satisfaction, was calculated to better assess the patient experience. A score between 0-30 denotes good quality of service with room for growth and improvement. Results: A total of 2928 patients had at least one telehealth visit (68.1% female, 87.1% White, mean age 64.5 years). Reason for visit was most often related to inflammatory bowel disease (18.4%), procedure preparation or follow-up (15.2%), or heartburn/reflux (13.4%). Most patients (54.7%) were likely to continue using telehealth services after the pandemic mainly due to shorter wait and travel times (41.1%), flexibility with personal schedule (30.7%), and ease of scheduling appointments on desired date (26.0%). Approximately 73% of respondents indicated that they received a similar quality of care through telehealth as compared to in-person visits and 61.1% stated that patient-physician interaction was also similar. Overall, the NPS for telehealth services among the participating GI practices was 25. Conclusion: Telehealth has become a valuable component of the healthcare system. Our results add to the existing literature regarding the high rate of patient satisfaction with telehealth and display the fact that the quality of virtual care can be perceived similar to that of in-person care. Furthermore, the calculated NPS confirms this level of satisfaction while signaling the need for continued growth and development of virtual care delivery.

The high mortality rate associated with this disease has been a major cause of concern. This paper aims at identifying the major factors influencing MERS recovery in KSA. METHODS: The data used for analysis was collected from the Ministry of Health website, KSA. The important factors impelling the recovery are found using machine learning. Machine learning models such as support vector machine, conditional inference tree, na?ve Bayes and J48 are modelled to identify the important factors. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis is also carried out to identify the significant factors statistically. RESULT: The main factors influencing MERS recovery rate are identified as age, pre-existing diseases, severity of disease and whether the patient is a healthcare worker or not. In spite of MERS being a zoonotic disease, contact with camels is not a major factor influencing recovery. CONCLUSION: The methods used were able to determine the prime factors influencing MERS recovery.

However, the large number of errors in Nanopore genome assembly affect the accuracy of genome analysis. Polishing is a procedure to correct the errors in genome assembly and can improve the reliability of the downstream analysis. However, the performances of the existing polishing methods are still not satisfactory. RESULTS We developed a novel polishing method, NeuralPolish, to correct the errors in assemblies based on alignment matrix construction and orthogonal Bi-GRU networks. In this method, we designed an alignment feature matrix for representing read-to-assembly alignment. Each row of the matrix represents a read, and each column represents the aligned bases at each position of the contig. In the network architecture, a bi-directional GRU network is used to extract the sequence information inside each read by processing the alignment matrix row by row. After that, the feature matrix is processed by another bi-directional GRU network column by column to calculate the probability distribution. Finally, a CTC decoder generates a polished sequence with a greedy algorithm. We used five real data sets and three assembly tools including Wtdbg2, Flye and Canu for testing, and compared the results of different polishing methods including NeuralPolish, Racon, MarginPolish, HELEN and Medaka.

INTRODUCTION: During this COVID pandemic, many countries have implemented lockdown measures and people have to work from home and many students and workers have to restrict themselves to home. During this period, their outdoor activities were limited. After the partial release of this lockdown many of them started to have some kind of physical activity and started experiencing body pains. We evaluated such patients for vitamin D3 levels and symptoms of fibromyalgia. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of patients from age group 18C60 presented to outpatient department or on telephonic consultation after partial release of lockdown. All patients who had mild back ache before lockdown and had symptoms exaggerated during this lockdown release were included. All patients were investigated for vitamin D3, PTH, thyroid profile, liver functional and kidney functional tests. RESULTS: Out of 120 patients presented to us in a period of 3 months, 31 patients had increased symptoms when compared to pre-lockdown status. 20 out of 31 patients had low vitamin D3 levels. 14 patients also developed symptoms of fibromyalgia. CONCLUSION: There might be many reasons for increased pain during lockdown, but we focussed specially only on vitamin D3 because of its association with increased symptoms of COVID-19. This is a gentle reminder to test for vitamin D3 levels and supplement if found deficient.

However, its successful application to medical images is severely handicapped with the limited amount of annotated training data. Transfer learning is commonly adopted for the medical imaging tasks. However, a large covariant shift between the source domain of natural images and target domain of medical images results in poor transfer learning. Moreover, scarcity of annotated data for the medical imaging tasks causes further problems for effective transfer learning. To address these problems, we develop an augmented ensemble transfer learning technique that leads to significant performance gain over the conventional transfer learning. Our technique uses an ensemble of deep learning models, where the architecture of each network is modified with extra layers to account for dimensionality change between the images of source and target data domains. Moreover, the model is hierarchically tuned to the target domain with augmented training data. Along with the network ensemble, we also utilize an ensemble of dictionaries that are based on features extracted from the augmented models. The dictionary ensemble provides an additional performance boost to our method. We first establish the effectiveness of our technique with the challenging ChestXray-14 radiography data set. Our experimental results show more than 50% reduction in the error rate with our method as compared to the baseline transfer learning technique. We then apply our technique to a recent COVID-19 data set for binary and multi-class classification tasks. Our technique achieves 99.49% accuracy for the binary classification, and 99.24% for multi-class classification.","output":"A novel augmented deep transfer learning for classification of COVID-19 and other thoracic diseases from X-rays"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radiological and functional sequelae of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia are still poorly understood.

Sacco University Hospital in Milan (Italy). During hospitalization, patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT), blood gas analysis, spirometry, and lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco), which were repeated 6 weeks post-discharge. Chest CTs were individually read by two expert radiologists, that calculated the total severity score (TSS). Twenty patients completed the study (mean age 58.2 years, 70% males). During the acute phase, mean DLco, alveolar volume (VA), and vital capacity (VC) were 56.0 (16.3), 64.8 (14.0), and 71.7 (16.9) % predicted, respectively, and were inversely associated with PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Fifty percent of patients had a restrictive ventilatory pattern; mean TSS was 7.9 (4.0). At follow up, gas exchange parameters were normalized; consolidations persisted in 10% of cases, while DLco was <80% predicted in 65% of patients and was independently predicted by Log10D-dimer at admission (? -18.675; 95%CI, -28.373--9.076; p = 0.001).

To date, no systematic reviews have been published on this topic. This systematic review aimed to summarize and highlight the frequency of bat infections reported in currently available observational studies for coronavirus. The purpose of this study was also to examine the differences between the pool prevalence by technique and country. We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess coronavirus (CoV) infection in bats and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We carried out random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). In all, 824 articles were retrieved (1960-2021). After screening by abstract/title, 43 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 33 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From the total of studies, the pool prevalence by RT-PCR (n=14,295 bats) for CoV was 9.8% (95% CI 8.7-10.9%);Italy reported the highest pooled prevalence (44.9%, 95% CI 31.6-58.1%), followed by the Philippines (29.6%). Regarding the ELISA, the pool prevalence for coronavirus from 15 studies, including 359 bats, was 30.2% (95% CI 14.7-45.6%). The results for coronaviruses with the MIF were significantly lower, 2.6% (95% CI 1.5-3.7%). A considerable proportion of infected bats tested positive, particularly by molecular tests. This essential condition highlights the relevance of bats and the need for future studies to detail their role as potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. In this meta-analysis, bats were positive in almost 10% by RT-PCR, suggesting their relevance and the need to understand their potential participation in maintaining wild zoonotic transmission.","output":"Molecular and serological prevalence of Coronavirus in Chiropterans: A systematic review with meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current series of studies, we draw upon implicit leadership theories, social learning theory, and research on decision making to investigate whether affect toward President Trump explains U.S. residents? evaluations of his leadership during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as the likelihood that that residents engage in personal protective behaviors.

MSCs are the leading cell source for stem cell therapy due to their regenerative and immunomodulatory properties, their low risk of tumorigenesis and lack of ethical constraints. However, clinical applications of MSCs remain limited. MSC therapeutic development continues to pose challenges in terms of preparation, purity, consistency, efficiency, reproducibility, processing time and scalability. Additionally, there are issues with their poor engraftment and survival in sites of disease or damage that limit their capacity to directly replace damaged cells. A key recent development in MSC research, however, is the now widely accepted view that MSCs primarily exert therapeutic effects via paracrine factor secretion. One of the major paracrine effectors are extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs represent a potential cell-free alternative to stem cell therapy but are also rapidly emerging as a novel therapeutic platform in their own right, particularly in the form of engineered EVs (EEVs) tailored to target a broad range of clinical indications. However, the development of EVs and EEVs for therapeutic application still faces a number of hurdles, including the establishment of a consistent, scalable cell source, and the development of robust GMP-compliant upstream and downstream manufacturing processes.

Although the swapped (1)-helix is fully buried inside the protein hydrophobic core, the interconversion of M(pro)-C is carried out without the hydrophobic core being exposed to solvent. The 3D domain swapping of M(pro)-C is activated by an order-to-disorder transition of its C-terminal (5)-helix foldon. Unfolding of this foldon promotes self-association of M(pro)-C monomers and functions to mediate the 3D domain swapping, without which M(pro)-C can no longer form the domain-swapped dimer.

AZD7442 is in development for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Here, we report primary Phase 3 study results of AZD7442 for pre-exposure prophylaxis of symptomatic COVID-19. METHODS: PROVENT (NCT04625725) is a Phase 3, 2:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single 300-mg AZD7442 dose (2 intramuscular injections; 150 mg each of tixagevimab and cilgavimab) for symptomatic COVID-19 prevention. Participants were unvaccinated adults ( 18 years old) without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, who may benefit from immunoprophylaxis with antibodies due to an increased risk of either inadequate response to vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The primary study endpoints were first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness post dose and prior to Day 183 (efficacy), and safety of AZD7442. RESULTS: In total, 5197 participants (mean age 53.5 years, 46% female) were randomized and dosed (safety analysis set): AZD7442 n=3460; placebo n=1737. In the primary efficacy analysis (full pre-exposure analysis set, n=5172), AZD7442 reduced the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% (95% confidence interval 46.0, 90.0) vs placebo (P< 0.001) (Table). Adverse events occurred in 35% and 34% of participants administered AZD7442 and placebo, respectively, and injection site reactions occurred in 2.4% and 2.1% of participants, respectively (safety analysis set). There was 1 case of severe/critical COVID-19 and 2 COVID-19Crelated deaths in the placebo arm.

The training of such networks involves carefully trading off entropy of the latent representation against reconstruction quality. The term quality crucially depends on the observer of the images which, in the vast majority of literature, is assumed to be human. In this paper, we aim to go beyond this notion of compression quality and look at human visual perception and image classification simultaneously. To that end, we use a family of loss functions that allows to optimize deep image compression depending on the observer and to interpolate between human perceived visual quality and classification accuracy, enabling a more unified view on image compression. Our extensive experiments show that using perceptual loss functions to train a compression system preserves classification accuracy much better than traditional codecs such as BPG without requiring retraining of classifiers on compressed images. For example, compressing ImageNet to 0.25 bpp reduces Inception-ResNet classification accuracy by only 2%. At the same time, when using a human friendly loss function, the same compression system achieves competitive performance in terms of MS-SSIM. By combining these two objective functions, we show that there is a pronounced trade-off in compression quality between the human visual system and classification accuracy.

The questionnaire collected anamnestic information, as well as data on state anxiety (STAI-Y), perception of quality of life (SF-12), perception of COVID-19 risks, and vaccine hesitancy. Results: Among participants, 19.3% reported hesitation. The most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine concerned safety and efficacy (4.9%) and the obligation of the Green Pass (4.9%). Conclusions: Findings suggest that delving into the phenomenon of vaccine hesitancy can help to enhance vaccination strategies in order to gain widespread acceptance, a key path to ensuring a quick way out of the current pandemic emergency.","output":"Vaccine Hesitancy and the Green Digital Pass: A Study on Adherence to the Italian COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to threaten the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, and small-molecule antivirals can provide an important therapeutic treatment option.

To date, no comprehensive study has been performed to evaluate HIV in patients with COVID-19. In the present study, we assessed the status of patients co-infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and HIV as a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic literature search strategy was conducted via reviewing original research articles published in Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases in 2019 and 2020. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA software, version 14.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, USA), to report the prevalence of HIV among patients with COVID-19. Case reports/case series were also evaluated as a systematic review. RESULTS: Sixty-three studies (53 case reports/case series and ten prevalence studies) were included in our study. A meta-analysis of prevalence studies showed that HIV infection among patients with COVID-19 was reported in 6 countries (Uganda, China, Iran, USA, Italy, and Spain) with an overall frequency of 1.2% [(95% CI) 0.8C1.7] among 14,424 COVID-19 patients. According to the case reports and case series, 111 patients with HIV have been reported among 113 patients with COVID-19 from 19 countries. Most of the cases were in the USA, China, Italy, and Spain. CONCLUSION: The small number of SARS-CoV-2-HIV co-infected patients reported in the literature makes it difficult to draw precise conclusions. However, since people with HIV are more likely to develop more severe complications of COVID-19, targeted policies to address this raised risk in the current pandemic should be considered. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying underlying diseases, co-infections, co-morbidities, laboratory findings, and beneficial treatment strategies for HIV patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and HIV co-infection; clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment strategies: A systematic review and meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Regarding the crucial role of deubiquitinase (DUB) enzymes in many viruses, in particular, Adenovirus, HSV-1, coxsackievirus, and SARS-CoV-2, DUB inhibition was reported as an effective new approach to find new effective antiviral agents.

Targeting of BTK with small molecule inhibitors has proven to be efficacious in several B cell malignancies. Interestingly, recent studies reveal increased BTK protein expression in circulating resting B cells of patients with systemic autoimmune disease (AID) compared with healthy controls. Moreover, BTK phosphorylation following BCR stimulation in vitro was enhanced. In addition to its role in BCR signaling, BTK is involved in many other pathways, including pattern recognition, Fc, and chemokine receptor signaling in B cells and myeloid cells. This broad involvement in several immunological pathways provides a rationale for the targeting of BTK in the context of inflammatory and systemic AID. Accordingly, numerous in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies support the potential of BTK targeting in these conditions. Efficacy of BTK inhibitors in various inflammatory and AID has been demonstrated or is currently evaluated in clinical trials. In addition, very recent reports suggest that BTK inhibition may be effective as immunosuppressive therapy to diminish pulmonary hyperinflammation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

METHODS Nasopharyngeal swabs from 453 adult SARS-CoV-2-infected patients from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Besan?on, France, were collected at the time of admission or consultation for RT-PCR analysis. Clinical information and concentrations of biological parameters (CRP, fibrinogen, LDH, prealbumin) were noticed. RESULTS Mean respiratory VL homogeneously decreased from 7.2 log10 copies/ml (95%CI: 6.6 to 7.8) on the first day of symptoms until 4.6 log10 copies/ml (95%CI: 3.8 to 5.4) at day 10 (slope=-0.24; R2=0.95). VL were poorly correlated with COVID-19 symptoms and outcome, excepted for dyspnea and anosmia, which were significantly associated with lower VL (p<0.05). CRP, fibrinogen, and LDH concentrations significantly increased over the first 10 days (median CRP concentrations from 36.8 mg/L at days 0-1 to 99.5 mg/L at days 8-10, p<0.01), whereas prealbumin concentrations tended to decrease. CONCLUSION Since SARS-CoV-2 respiratory viral loads regularly decrease in the acute phase of infection, determining the level of VL may help predicting the onset of virus shedding in a specific patient.

Therefore, we aim to evaluate medicine and traditional medicine (TM) students perception of the professional attributes relating to QOC for improving inter-disciplined professionalism training that promotes QOC in Vietnam. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried on 2039 students of 6 years at the University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City (HUMP) from the medical and TM faculty in March, 2021. The Vietnamese American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) questionnaire (2011) was used as the survey instrument. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to confirm the validity of the scale in TM students. Mean, MinCMax, standard deviation and sample paired t-test were performed for Likert scale. The one-way ANOVA was used for inferential statistics. RESULTS: The CFA demonstrated the validity of the Vietnamese questionnaire in measuring 4 QOC-relating professional attributes, previously found in medical students for TM students. In both faculties and across academic years, students perceived self-awareness and ensuring QOC as the leading important attribute, while social duty and professional habit as the least important attribute. Contrasting with preclinical phase, students perception did not differ significantly between the two faculties in their clinical years (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: TM students share universal QOC-relating professional traits with medical students. Moreover, exposure to clinical environment might increase inter-disciplined agreement on importance of these attributes. However, health sciences students underestimation of social duty and professional habit persists throughout 6 academic years.

This retrospective, single-center cohort study was conducted to investigate the effects of sleep quality on recovery from lymphopenia and clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to the West District of Wuhan Union Hospital between January 25 and March 15, 2020. The Richards-Campbell sleep questionnaire (RCSQ) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to assess sleep quality. The epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records and compared between the good-sleep group and poor-sleep group. In all, 135 patients (60 in good-sleep group and 75 in poor-sleep group) were included in this study. There were no significant between-group differences regarding demographic and baseline characteristics, as well as laboratory parameters upon admission and in-hospital treatment. Compared with patients in the good-sleep group, patients in the poor-sleep group had lower absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (day 14: median, 1.10 vs 1.32, P = 0.0055; day 21: median, 1.18 vs 1.48, P = 0.0034) and its reduced recovery rate (day 14: median, 56.91 vs 69.40, P = 0.0255; day 21: median, 61.40 vs 111.47, P = 0.0003), as well as increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; day 14: median, 3.17 vs 2.44, P = 0.0284; day 21: median, 2.73 vs 2.23, P = 0.0092) and its associated deterioration rate (day 14: median, -39.65 vs -61.09, P = 0.0155; day 21: median, -51.40% vs -75.43, P = 0.0003).

RESULTS: We observed an incidence of infection of 7.9%; most cases were asymptomatic. The main risk factor associated with infection was the duration of daily commute (relative risk 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.041]). CONCLUSIONS: We observed asymptomatic infection by COVID-19 among airport workers. Future research should contribute with knowledge for developing strategies that guarantee the protection of airport workers.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 and work-related transmission: results of a prospective cohort of airport workers, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epidemic outbreak (COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2) is an exceptional scenario of agri-food supply chain (AFSC) risk at the globalised level which is characterised by logistics network breakdown (ripple effects), demand mismatch (uncertainty), and sustainable issues. Thus, the aim of this research is the modelling of the sustainable based multi-tier system for AFSC, which is managed through the different emerging application of Internet of things (IoT) technology. Different IoT technologies, viz., Blockchain, robotics, Big data analysis, and cloud computing, have developed a competitive AFSC at the global level. Competitive AFSC needs cautious incorporation of multi-tiers suppliers, specifically during dealing with globalised sustainability issues. Firms have been advancing towards their multi suppliers for driving social, environments and economical practices.

To clarify the evolution of both VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) regions of GII.P17-GII.17, we analyzed both global and novel Japanese strains detected during 2013C2017. Time-scaled phylogenetic trees revealed that the ancestral GII.17 VP1 region diverged around 1949, while the ancestral GII.P17 RdRp region diverged around 2010. The evolutionary rates of the VP1 and RdRp regions were estimated at ~2.7  10(?3) and ~2.3  10(?3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The phylogenetic distances of the VP1 region exhibited no overlaps between intra-cluster and inter-cluster peaks in the GII.17 strains, whereas those of the RdRp region exhibited a unimodal distribution in the GII.P17 strains. Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar, although some substitutions, insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein. Moreover, some amino acid substitutions were estimated to be near the interface between monomers and the active site of the RdRp protein. These results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 virus has produced variants with the potential to alter viral antigenicity, host-binding capability, and replication property over the past 10 years.","output":"Evolutionary Analysis of the VP1 and RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Regions of Human Norovirus GII.P17-GII.17 in 2013C2017"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim to examine the severity of executive dysfunction among different Parkinson's disease (PD)-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subtypes in the early stages of the disease.

Since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, the only available treatments have been medical support or the emergency administration of experimental drugs. The absence of licensed vaccines and drugs against the Ebola virus impedes the prevention of viral infection. In this study, we generated recombinant baculoviruses (rBV) expressing the Sudan virus (SUDV) matrix structural protein (VP40) (rBV-VP40-VP40) or the SUDV glycoprotein (GP) (rBV-GP-GP), and SUDV virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced by co-infection of Sf9 cells with rBV-SUDV-VP40 and rBV-SUDV-GP. The expression of SUDV VP40 and GP in SUDV VLPs was demonstrated by IFA and Western blot analysis. Electron microscopy results demonstrated that SUDV VLPs had a filamentous morphology. The immunogenicity of SUDV VLPs produced in insect cells was evaluated by the immunization of mice. The analysis of antibody responses showed that mice vaccinated with SUDV VLPs and the adjuvant Montanide ISA 201 produced SUDV GP-specific IgG antibodies. Sera from SUDV VLP-immunized mice were able to block infection by SUDV GP pseudotyped HIV, indicating that a neutralizing antibody against the SUDV GP protein was produced. Furthermore, the activation of B cells in the group immunized with VLPs mixed with Montanide ISA 201 was significant one week after the primary immunization. Vaccination with the SUDV VLPs markedly increased the frequency of antigen-specific cells secreting type 1 and type 2 cytokines. To study the therapeutic effects of SUDV antibodies, horses were immunized with SUDV VLPs emulsified in Freunds complete adjuvant or Freunds incomplete adjuvant. The results showed that horses could produce SUDV GP-specific antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. These results showed that SUDV VLPs demonstrate excellent immunogenicity and represent a promising approach for vaccine development against SUDV infection.

We then identified patients with saliva samples that were confirmed to be PCR-negative and IgM-negative for SARS-CoV-2. The cross-reactivity of IgA-positive saliva samples with SARS-CoV-2 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a biotin-labeled spike recombinant protein (S1-mFc) covering the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2.

This study aimed to estimate age-specific adjusted relative and absolute effects of individual underlying conditions on hospitalisation, death and in-hospital death among COVID-19 cases.Methods: We analysed case-based COVID-19 data submitted to The European Surveillance System (TESSy) between 2 June and 13 December 2020 by nine European countries. We individually assessed the association between 11 underlying conditions with hospitalisation, death and in-hospital death. Two additional categorical exposures were created: number of underlying conditions (1,2,  3) and the presence of any underlying condition ( 1). Adjusted ORs (aOR) for the association between each exposure condition and outcome were estimated using two multivariable logistic regression models: 1) an age-adjusted model and 2) an age-interaction model (exposure condition*age). All models were adjusted for sex, reporting period (June-September;October-December) and reporting country. From the age-interaction model we estimated the predicted probability of the three outcomes for each level of condition and age-group, marginalised over the levels of each covariable.Findings: After controlling for age, sex, reporting period and reporting country in the age-adjusted models, cases with cancer, cardiac disorder, diabetes, immune deficiency disorder, kidney disease, liver disease, lung disease, neurological disorders, obesity, any underlying condition or up to three or more conditions were between 15 and 56 times more likely to be hospitalised or die than cases with no underlying condition. Asthma was associated with increased overall risk of hospitalisation, not death. Age was an important modifier of these associations, with an age interaction present in the majority of models. For all outcomes, age-specific aOR in the age-interaction models tended to decrease with increasing age, whereas predicted probabilities of the outcome increased with age. For instance, individuals aged <20 years with any underlying condition were significantly more likely to be hospitalised (aOR: 516, 95%CI: 442 - 602) and die (aOR: 3377, 95%CI: 1257 - 9075) compared to same-aged individuals without condition. The aOR fell to 177 (95%CI: 171 - 183) and 161 (95%CI: 155 - 168) respectively in individuals 80 years and older. Conversely, the predicted probabilities of hospitalisation and death among cases aged <20 years were 569% (95%CI: 497 - 651) and 0.15% (95%CI: 008 - 031), respectively, while they were 4455% (95%CI: 4368 - 4543) and 1631% (95%CI: 1544 - 1721), respectively for individuals aged 80 years and older. For some conditions, the probability of the outcome was at least as high in younger individuals with the condition as older cases without the condition.Interpretation: Several underlying conditions were found to have a significant independent effect on severe COVID-19 outcomes. Age is an important effect modifier in these associations. Interpretation of the results in this study is facilitated by considering together the estimates of relative (aOR) and absolute (predicted probabilities) effects that are presented. The presence of underlying conditions tended to have a larger relative effect in the young than the old, but the absolute probability of being hospitalised or dying increased with age. The finding that for some conditions, a younger person may have the same or even higher probability of severe outcome than an older person without it, has relevance for age and risk-factor based prioritisation of vaccination, particularly in the young.Funding Information: This study was funded through ECDC internal funding.Declaration of Interests: None to declare.","output":"Age Specific Associations Between Underlying Conditions and Hospitalisation, Death and In-Hospital Death Among Confirmed COVID-19 Cases: A Multi-Country Study Based on Surveillance Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been in use for 99 years, and is regarded as one of the oldest human vaccines known today. It is recommended primarily due to its effect in preventing the most severe forms of tuberculosis, including disseminated tuberculosis and meningeal tuberculosis in children; however, its efficacy in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis and TB reactivation in adults has been questioned. Several studies however have found that asides from its role in tuberculosis prevention, the BCG vaccine also has protective effects against a host of other viral infections in humans, an effect which has been termed: heterologous, non-specific or off-target. OBJECTIVES: As we approach 100 years since the discovery of the BCG vaccine, we review the evidence of the non-specific protection offered by the vaccine against viral infections, discuss the possible mechanisms of action of these effects, highlight the implications these effects could have on vaccinology and summarize the recent epidemiological correlation between the vaccine and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Several epidemiological studies have established that BCG does reduce all-cause mortality in infants, and also the time of vaccination influences this effect significantly. This effect has been attributed to the protective effect of the vaccine in preventing unrelated viral infections during the neonatal period. Some of such viral infections that have been investigated include: herpes simplex virus (HSV), human Papilloma virus (HPV), yellow fever virus (YFV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus type A (H1N1). These effects are thought to be mediated via induction of innate immune memory as well as heterologous lymphocytic activation. While epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation, the potential protection of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates is currently unclear. Ongoing clinical trials and further research may shed more light on the subject in the future. CONCLUSION: BCG is a multifaceted vaccine, with many numerous potential applications to vaccination strategies being employed for current and future viral infections. There however is a need for further studies into the immunologic mechanisms behind these non-specific effects, for these potentials to become reality, as we usher in the beginning of the second century since the vaccine's discovery.","output":"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG): the adroit vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"El documento contiene los procedimientos para el manejo ambulatorio de los casos leves de COVID-19","output":"Manejo ambulatorio de personas afectados por COVID-19 en el Per: Documento tcnico"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Due to the dramatic measures accompanying isolation and the general uncertainty and fear associated with COVID-19, patients and relatives may be at high risk for adverse psychological outcomes. Until now there has been limited research focusing on the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors in COVID-19 patients and their relatives. The objective of our study was to assess psychological distress in COVID-19 patients and their relatives 30 days after hospital discharge. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study at two Swiss tertiary-care hospitals we included consecutive adult patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 for a proven COVID-19 and their relatives. Psychological distress was defined as symptoms of anxiety and/or depression measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), i.e., a score of 8 on the depression and/or anxiety subscale. We further evaluated symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), defined as a score of 1.5 on the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: Among 126 included patients, 24 (19.1%) had psychological distress and 10 (8.7%) had symptoms of PTSD 30 days after hospital discharge. In multivariate logistic regression analyses three factors were independently associated with psychological distress in patients: resilience (OR 0.82; 95%CI 0.71 to 0.94; p = 0.005), high levels of perceived stress (OR 1.21; 95%CI 1.06 to 1.38; p = 0.006) and low frequency of contact with relatives (OR 7.67; 95%CI 1.42 to 41.58; p = 0.018). The model showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92. Among 153 relatives, 35 (22.9%) showed symptoms of psychological distress, and 3 (2%) of PTSD. For relatives, resilience was negatively associated (OR 0.85; 95%CI 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.007), whereas perceived overall burden caused by COVID-19 was positively associated with psychological distress (OR 1.72; 95%CI 1.31 to 2.25; p<0.001). The overall model also had good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.87. CONCLUSION: A relevant number of COVID-19 patients as well as their relatives exhibited psychological distress 30 days after hospital discharge.

AIMS: We investigated the association of exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination and stigma with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a culturally diverse sample of adults in Quebec (Canada). METHOD: A total of 3273 residents of the province of Quebec (49% aged 18-39 years, 57% women, 51% belonging to a minority ethno-cultural group) completed an online survey. We used linear and ordinal logistic regression to identify the relationship between COVID-19 experiences and mental health, and the moderating role of ethno-cultural identity. RESULTS: Mental health varied significantly based on socioeconomic status and ethno-cultural group, with those with lower incomes and Arab participants reporting higher psychological distress. Exposure to the virus, COVID-19-related discrimination, and stigma were associated with poorer mental health. Associations with mental health varied across ethno-cultural groups, with exposed and discriminated Black participants reporting higher mental distress. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate sociocultural inequalities in mental health related to COVID-19 in the Canadian context. COVID-19-related risk factors, including exposure, discrimination and stigma, jeopardise mental health. This burden is most noteworthy for the Black community. There is an urgent need for public health authorities and health professionals to advocate against the discrimination of racialised minorities, and ensure that mental health services are accessible and culturally sensitive during and in the aftermath of the pandemic.","output":"Ethno-cultural disparities in mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study on the impact of exposure to the virus and COVID-19-related discrimination and stigma on mental health across ethno-cultural groups in Quebec (Canada)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Psychological well-being indicates individuals positive psychological functioning and well-being.

Type III IFN (IFN-) exhibit cell-type specific and long-lasting functions in autoinflammation, tumorigenesis and antiviral defense. Here, we identify the deubiquitinating enzyme USP22 as central regulator of basal IFN- secretion and SARS-CoV-2 infections in native human intestinal epithelial cells (hIECs). USP22-deficient hIECs strongly upregulate genes involved in IFN signaling and viral defense, including numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), with increased secretion of IFN- and enhanced STAT1 signaling, even in the absence of exogenous IFNs or viral infection. Interestingly, USP22 controls basal and 23-cGAMP-induced STING activation and loss of STING reversed STAT activation and ISG and IFN- expression. Intriguingly, USP22-deficient hIECs are protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection, viral replication and the formation of de novo infectious particles, in a STING-dependent manner.

However, maternity care has been impacted with hospital policy driven changes in practice. Little qualitative research has investigated maternity clinicians perception of the impact of COVID-19 in a high-migrant population. AIM: To investigate maternity clinicians perceptions of patient experience, service delivery and personal experience in a high-migrant population. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with 14 maternity care clinicians in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Interviews were conducted from November to December 2020. A reflexive thematic approach was used for data analysis. FINDINGS: A key theme in the data was COVID-19 related travel restrictions result in loss of valued family support for migrant families. However, partners were often stepping-up into the role of missing overseas relatives. The main theme in clinical care was a shift in healthcare delivery away from optimising patient care to a focus on preservation and safety of health staff. DISCUSSION: Clinicians were of the view migrant women were deeply affected by the loss of traditional support. However, the benefit may be the potential for greater gender equity and bonding opportunities for partners. Conflict with professional beneficence principles and values may result in bending rules when a disconnect exists between relaxed community health orders and restrictive hospital protocols during different phases of a pandemic.

Comprising 3135 amino acids (aa), the large size of Pfs230 necessitates the use of sub-fragments as vaccine immunogens. Therefore, determination of which regions induce functional antibody responses is essential. We previously reported that of 27 sub-fragments spanning the entire molecule, only five induced functional antibodies. A functional antibody is defined herein as one that inhibits Plasmodium falciparum parasite development in mosquitoes in a standard membrane-feeding assay (SMFA). These five sub-fragments were found within the aa 443C1274 range, and all contained aa 543C730. Here, we further pinpoint the location of epitopes within Pfs230 that are recognized by functional antibodies using antibody depletion and enrichment techniques. Functional epitopes were not found within the aa 918C1274 region. Within aa 443C917, further analysis showed the existence of functional epitopes not only within the aa 543C730 region but also outside of it. Affinity-purified antibodies using a synthetic peptide matching aa 543C588 showed activity in the SMFA. Immunization with a synthetic peptide comprising this segment, formulated either as a carrier-protein conjugate vaccine or with a liposomal vaccine adjuvant system, induced antibodies in mice that were functional in the SMFA.

We sought to understand the variation in risk of COVID-19-related death across religious groups in England and Wales both before and after the first national lockdown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of usual residents in England and Wales enumerated at the 2011 Census (n=47 873 294, estimated response rate 94%) for risk of death involving COVID-19 using linked death certificates. Cox regression models were estimated to compare risks between religious groups. Time-dependent coefficients were added to the model allowing HRs before and after lockdown period to be estimated separately. RESULTS: Compared with Christians, all religious groups had an elevated risk of death involving COVID-19; the largest age-adjusted HRs were for Muslim and Jewish males at 2.5 (95% CI 2.3 to 2.7) and 2.1 (95% CI 1.9 to 2.5), respectively. The corresponding HRs for Muslim and Jewish females were 1.9 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1) and 1.5 (95% CI 1.7 to 2.1), respectively. The difference in risk between groups contracted after lockdown. Those who affiliated with no religion had the lowest risk of COVID-19-related death before and after lockdown. CONCLUSION: The majority of the variation in COVID-19 mortality risk was explained by controlling for sociodemographic and geographic determinants; however, those of Jewish affiliation remained at a higher risk of death compared with all other groups. Lockdown measures were associated with reduced differences in COVID-19 mortality rates between religious groups; further research is required to understand the causal mechanisms.","output":"Religious affiliation and COVID-19-related mortality: a retrospective cohort study of prelockdown and postlockdown risks in England and Wales"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID19 has had enormous consequences in the media.

Most critically ill patients have respiratory failure and there is an international effort to understand mechanisms and predictors of disease severity. Coagulopathy, characterized by elevations in D-dimer and fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs), is associated with critical illness and mortality in patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, increasing reports of microvascular and macrovascular thrombi suggest that hemostatic imbalances may contribute to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We review the laboratory and clinical findings of patients with COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, and prior studies of hemostasis in other viral infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome. We hypothesize that an imbalance between coagulation and inflammation may result in a hypercoagulable state. Although thrombosis initiated by the innate immune system is hypothesized to limit SARS-CoV-2 dissemination, aberrant activation of this system can cause endothelial injury resulting in loss of thromboprotective mechanisms, excess thrombin generation, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis and thrombosis.

We compared the personal response of individuals in low-/lower-middle income countries (LLMIC) to high-income countries (HIC) and what they witnessed by their establishments. METHODS: In May 2020, a survey was emailed to surgeons associated with the International Volunteering in Urology program. Responding participants were grouped into LLMIC or HIC. The survey questioned patient care and operating practice during the pandemic and personal attitudes regarding COVID-19, including personal risk of contraction and transmission. Results were compared by student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U, or chi-square test with p<0.05 being significant. RESULTS: 103 surveys were sent with 40 responses: 17 from LLMIC and 23 from HIC. The groups did not differ for age (p=0.13) or having children (p=0.06). Significantly more LLMIC respondents were male (p=0.03). HICs reported higher rates of COVID testing (83% vs. 6%;p<0.001). Groups had similar reports of operating per normal routine, having cared for or operated on COVID positive patients, and having personal patients die from COVID (p>0.05). Groups similarly had hospital guidelines on the care of COVID patients (p>0.05). Despite significantly more HICs performing telemedicine (87% vs. 18% p=0.0007), groups did not differ regarding working remotely (p=0.24). LLMICs expressed stronger concern regarding personal and family risk of contracting COVID, as well as being a possible vector of transmission (Figure 1). A Likert scale ranking of the pandemic (1 being unremarkable and 100 the worst seen) did not significantly differ between LLMIC and HIC (median 72.5 vs. 88.0;p=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Early in the pandemic, there were significant differences in attitudes regarding personal risk of COVID-19 upon survey of LLMIC and HIC surgeons despite seemingly little difference in impact on clinical practice. This may come from LLMICs having more personal experience with prior pandemics.

Identification of risk factors is crucial to prevent the COVID-19 spread by taking appropriate countermeasures effectively. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the potential risk factors contributing to the COVID-19 incidence rates at the district-level in Bangladesh. METHOD: ology: Spatial regression methods were applied in this study to fulfill the aim. Data related to 28 demographic, economic, built environment, health, and facilities related factors were collected from secondary sources and analyzed to explain the spatial variability of this disease incidence. Three global (ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial lag model (SLM), and spatial error model (SEM)) and one local (geographically weighted regression (GWR)) regression models were developed in this study. RESULTS: The results of the models identified four factors: percentage of the urban population, monthly consumption, number of health workers, and distance from the capital city, as significant risk factors affecting the COVID-19 incidence rates in Bangladesh. Among the four developed models, the GWR model performed the best in explaining the variation of COVID-19 incidence rates across Bangladesh with an R(2) value of 78.6%. CONCLUSION: Findings and discussions from this research offer a better insight into the COVID-19 situation, which helped discuss policy implications to negotiate the future epidemic crisis.

The release amount of microplastics in the static water by one mask was 360 items, and with the increase of vibration rate, the release amount also increased. The addition of organic solvents (detergent and alcohol) in water would increase the release of microplastics from masks. When the mask became fragments, the ability to release microplastic fibers into the environment was greatly improved due to the increase of exposure area. After two months of natural weathering, the masks become very fragile pieces and microplastics. A fully weathered mask could release several billions of microplastic fibers into the aquatic environment once these fragile fragments enter the water without reservation. The rapid growth of mask production and consumption and improper disposable is worrying. It is urgent to understand the potential environmental risks and significance of masks.","output":"Neglected microplastics pollution in global COVID-19: Disposable surgical masks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is that it disproportionately affects people from some specific ethnic and socio-economic minorities. In particular, since from the beginning of the pandemic it has been clear that people from Black and African American backgrounds seem to be hit especially hard by the virus, creating a substantial infection gap. The observed abnormal impact on these ethnic groups could probably be due to the co-occurrence of other known risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation and response to cures, although those factors do not seem able to explain fully and in depth the excess incidence of infections and deaths among African Americans. Here, we introduce the concept of diffusion segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on major US cities, we found that the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in African American communities at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with their level of diffusion segregation. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is potentially much more important to contain and curb the spreading of infectious diseases.","output":"Diffusion segregation and the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 in African American communities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective To trigger a reflection on the current working conditions of Nursing professionals in coping with the Covid-19 pandemic.

These terms are used worldwide; they are universal and recognised in various languages. Medical eponyms are immutable by the nature; they save valuable time by streamlining communication among health professionals. However, some of these terms lack accuracy and lead to confusion. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS This perspective article aims to analyse the current status of the divergent trends about redeeming (or not) the long-standing tradition of using medical eponyms. Multiple positions regarding the use of these terms have been expressed in the medical literature, and these are summarised in the manuscript. Although, this compilation is based primarily on the author's medical background and experience. RESULTS There is an interesting debate in the scientific community about the suitability of certain eponyms. Defenders and detractors argue a broad spectrum of points, but there is still no international consensus. The use of classical, ethical and well-recognised medical eponyms will remain a cornerstone in daily clinical settings, textbooks and medical journals. However, their use can be inconsistent or confused in specific conditions, and they can be influenced by local geography and culture. CONCLUSIONS There is a need to refrain from using unethical and controversial eponyms throughout the whole of science. Further academic and scientific efforts should be addressed to provide a structural systematisation, semantic classification and etymological categorisation on the use of medical eponyms.","output":"Medical eponyms: redeeming or not the long-standing tradition."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades the alveoli, where abundant alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside. How AMs respond to SARS-CoV-2 invasion remains elusive. Here, we show that classically activated M1 AMs facilitate viral spread; however, alternatively activated M2 AMs limit the spread. M1 AMs utilize cellular softness to efficiently take up SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, the invaded viruses take over the endo-lysosomal system to escape. M1 AMs have a lower endosomal pH, favoring membrane fusion and allowing the entry of viral RNA from the endosomes into the cytoplasm, where the virus achieves replication and is packaged to be released. In contrast, M2 AMs have a higher endosomal pH but a lower lysosomal pH, thus delivering the virus to lysosomes for degradation. In hACE2 transgenic mouse model, M1 AMs are found to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection of the lungs. These findings provide insights into the complex roles of AMs during SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with potential therapeutic targets.","output":"Distinct uptake, amplification, and release of SARS-CoV-2 by M1 and M2 alveolar macrophages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) datasets that are produced from clinical samples are often confounded by batch effects and inter-patient variability.

Attention is paid to initiatives intended to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic as an illustrative case to exemplify the contribution of citizen science to system-wide innovation in healthcare. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed methodology consisting of three sequential steps was developed. Firstly, a realist literature review was carried out to contextualize citizen science to healthcare. Then, an account of successfully completed large-scale, online citizen science projects dealing with healthcare and medicine has been conducted in order to obtain preliminary information about distinguishing features of citizen science in healthcare. Thirdly, a broad search of citizen science initiatives targeted to tackling the COVID-19 pandemic has been performed. A comparative case study approach has been undertaken to examine the attributes of such projects and to unravel their peculiarities. Findings: Citizen science enacts the development of a lively healthcare ecosystem, which takes its nourishment from the voluntary contribution of lay people. Citizen scientists play different roles in accomplishing citizen science initiatives, ranging from data collectors to data analysts. Alongside enabling big data management, citizen science contributes to lay people's education and empowerment, soliciting their active involvement in service co-production and value co-creation. Practical implications: Citizen science is still underexplored in healthcare. Even though further evidence is needed to emphasize the value of lay people's involvement in scientific research applied to healthcare, citizen science is expected to revolutionize the way innovation is pursued and achieved in the healthcare ecosystem. Engaging lay people in a co-creating partnership with expert scientist can help us to address unprecedented health-related challenges and to shape the future of healthcare.

Increased age is associated with a significant increase in postoperative atrial fibrillation risk. This common complication is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of nebivolol in preventing atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass surgery in patients over 60 years of age. METHODS In this prospective randomized study, 200 patients who were candidates for elective coronary artery bypass surgery were divided into two groups. The first group was administered with nebivolol and the second group was administered with metoprolol. Treatment was initiated four days prior to surgery, and patients were monitored for atrial fibrillation until discharge. Forty-one patients received 50 mg metoprolol succinate daily, which was initiated minimum 4 days before surgery. RESULTS Demographic data were similar in both groups. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in both groups was similar, with no significant difference being identified [n=20 (20%); n=18 (18%), P=0.718; respectively]. There were not any mortality at both groups during study. Inotropic agent requirement at ICU was similar for both groups [n=12 (12%), n=18 (18%), P=0.32]. CONCLUSION We compared the effectiveness of nebivolol and metoprolol in decreasing the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and determined that nebivolol was as effective as metoprolol in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation at patients.

Data came from the SC Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC). Descriptive statistics and trends for cases of infections and deaths were calculated. Cox proportional hazards were used to compare COVID-19 mortality in LTC residents to community dwelling older adults, controlling for age, gender, race, and pre-existing chronic health conditions. Until early January of 2021, significantly greater incidence rates of infection (116.2 per 10,000 per month) and hazard of death after infection (HR=1.83, 95% CI: 1.70-1.98) were experienced among LTC residents as compared to older adults in the community even after statewide mask mandates and visitation guidance. Since vaccine availability, COVID incidence rates among LTC residents fell by half (59.5 per 10,000 per month after vaccines), and the relative hazard of death compared to older adults in the community was diminished (HR=1.44, 95% CI:1.29-1.61). Reducing the gap between LTCF and community-wide infection and mortality rates suggests that vaccination against COVID-19 is correlated with reduced disease spread in the greater community and in LTCF.

Eligible patients, aged 18 years, had confirmed SARSCoV-2, oxygen saturation 94% on room air or required supplemental oxygen, with pulmonary infiltrates. Propensity score matching (up to 1:10 ratio) was used to ensure comparable populations. We assessed day 14 clinical recovery (determined using a 7-point ordinal scale) and day 28 all-cause mortality (coprimary endpoints). RESULTS: Altogether, 368 (remdesivir) and 1399 (non-remdesivir) patients were included in the matched analysis.

METHODS: Prostate cancer patients treated at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto (n=366) were evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), before treatment and after one year. All baseline evaluations were performed before the COVID-19 pandemic and 69.7% of the one-year assessments were completed after the first lockdown. Cognitive decline was defined as the decrease in MoCA from baseline to the one-year evaluation below 1.5 standard deviations of the distribution of changes in the whole cohort. Participants scoring below age- and education-specific normative reference values in the MoCA were considered to have cognitive impairment. Age- and education-adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were computed for the association between ADT and cognitive outcomes. RESULTS: Mean MoCA scores increased from baseline to the one-year evaluation (22.3 vs. 22.8, p<0.001).

We calculated monthly increases in vaccine doses, doses per vaccinator, and cold storage volumes for four-month SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns targeting risk groups compared to routine immunization baselines. RESULTS: Administering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to risk groups would increase total monthly doses by 27.0% for &#8805; 65 years, 91.7% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.1% for HCWs. Assuming median nurse density estimates adjusted for absenteeism and proportion providing immunization services, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination campaigns would increase total monthly doses per vaccinator by 29.3% for &#8805; 65 years, 99.6% for chronic diseases patients, and 1.2% for HCWs.

We begin with an analogy that conceptualizes principles as streetlamps that illuminate the empirical terrain, and we illustrate the analogy by showing how two familiar principles apply in new ways to brain-wide phenomena. We then focus the bulk of the review on describing three more principles that have wide utility for mapping brain-wide neural activity, making testable predictions from highly parameterized mechanistic models, and investigating the computational determinants of neuronal response patterns across the brain.","output":"Theoretical principles for illuminating sensorimotor processing with brain-wide neuronal recordings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility and total cost of laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS), which utilises conventional open surgery equipment without any sealing or coagulation devices and reduces port sites compared to conventional laparoscopy (CL). Fifty-seven consecutive, age-matched patients presenting with a tubal pregnancy were enrolled. In the LASS group, a 10 mm reusable umbilical optical trocar and a 10 mm suprapubic trocar was used. The other 30 patients were managed with multiport CL. All of the patients were asked to use the visual analogue scale and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale to evaluate their cosmetic satisfaction. The duration of surgery was 21.19  2.33 minutes for the LASS group and 36.9  4.9 minutes for the CL group (p < .001). The postoperative 6th-hour VAS score was 2.44  0.5 for the LASS group and 3.03  0.8 for the CL group (p: .005). All of the PSAS and OSAS parameter scores were significantly lower in LASS group than CL group. In conclusion, the LASS procedure is a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies with a shorter surgical duration, lower VAS scores, and better cosmetic scores than CL. Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Laparoscopy or laparotomy may be performed for the surgical management of ectopic pregnancy. Conventional laparoscopy has some advantages such as shorter hospital stay and recovery time and the better cosmetic results. However, the equipment used in conventional laparoscopy and single incision laparoscopy are more expensive than conventional open surgery equipment. What the results of this study add? Laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy (LASS) method has shorter operation time, lower VAS scores, better cosmetic scores and cheaper than conventional laparoscopy. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The LASS procedure looks like a feasible method for treating ectopic pregnancies and the feasibility of this procedure should be confirmed by a larger series of patients and randomised trials.","output":"Laparoscopy-assisted suprapubic salpingectomy 'Kaya technic' - a low-cost treatment of ectopic pregnancy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This study investigated (18)F-FDG PET/CT features of adenovirus-vectored vaccination against COVID-19 in healthy subjects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one health care workers had been vaccinated Vaxzevria and underwent FDG PET/CT as an optional test for a cancer screening program. Size and FDG uptake of the hypermetabolic lymph nodes were measured. Uptake value of spleen was also measured with liver for comparison. RESULTS: All examinees who underwent FDG PET/CT within 14 days interval showed hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies ipsilateral to vaccine injection. All examinees with hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy had simultaneous muscular uptakes until 23 days interval. Among 12 examinees who underwent FDG PET/CT more than 15 days after vaccination, only 3 male examinees did not show hypermetabolism in the axillary lymph nodes. There was no female examinee with negative hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy until 29 days after vaccination.

The outbreak of COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern is declared by World Health Organization on January 30, 2020. The known route of transmission is due to direct contact or via respiratory droplets. Recently, several studies reported SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in wastewater treatment plant samples. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater may predict COVID-19 occurrence qualitatively and quantitatively. The concept is known as wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) or sewage epidemiology. The present study reviewed the presence of coronavirus in wastewater and investigations relating to WBE development as a tool to detect COVID-19 community transmission. Few articles reported a correlation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater with the number of COVID-19 cases, whereas few reported higher prediction by wastewater surveillance than confirmed cases. The application of WBE is still in a preliminary stage but has the potential to indicate an early sign of transmission. The knowledge of persistence of coronavirus in municipal and hospital wastewater is needed for the application of WBE and to understand the chances of transmission. The studies reported more prolonged survival of coronavirus in low-temperature wastewater. Studies relating to the inactivation of coronavirus by disinfectants and removal of coronavirus are also presented. Research on the performance of the commonly adopted disinfection technologies in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 in municipal and hospital wastewater is required to reduce the risk associated with municipal and hospital wastewater.","output":"A review on presence, survival, disinfection/removal methods of coronavirus in wastewater and progress of wastewater-based epidemiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed lifestyles and quality of life (QoL) of the global population. Little is known regarding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or bronchopulmonary (BP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Methods: We prospectively evaluated seven specific constructs (depression, anxiety, stress, QoL, NET-related QoL, patient-physician relationship, psychological distress) by using validated screening instruments including the Depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21), the EORTC QLQ-C30, the EORTC QLQ GI.NET21, the patient doctor relationship questionnaire 9 (PDRQ9) and the Impact of event scale-revised (IES-R). Mental symptoms and concerns of patients with any stage, well-differentiated GEP or BP-NET were surveyed twice, during the plateau phase of the first (W1) and second epidemic waves (W2) in Italy. Results: We enrolled 197 patients (98 males) with a median age of 62 years (G1/G2: 96%;pancreas: 29%;small bowel: 25%;active treatment: 38%). At W1, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 32%, 36% and 26% respectively. The frequency of depression and anxiety increased to 38% and 41% at W2, with no modifications in the frequency of stress. By ordinal logistic regression analysis, female patients showed more severe forms of stress at W1 (OR=0.450.14;p=0.01), while the educational status was associated with the levels of anxiety at both W1 (OR=1.330.22;p=0.07) and W2 (OR=1.450.26;p=0.03). An improvement of the physical (p=0.03) and emotional functioning domains (p=0.001) was observed over time. Both nausea/vomiting (p=0.0002), appetite (p=0.02), treatment-related symptoms (p=0.005), disease-related worries (p=0.0006) and sexual function (p=0.02) improved between W1 and W2, suggesting that NET patients were able to cope with the perturbations caused by the pandemic. No difference was seen between W1 and W2 in the mean score (>4/5) of the PDRQ9. By IES-R, post-traumatic stress disorder was observed in 53% of patients at W2.

The urgency stems from the frequent tendency to focus attention on seemingly high promising digital health interventions despite being poorly validated in times of crisis. Aim In this paper, we describe a joint call for action to use and leverage evidence-based health informatics as the foundation for the COVID-19 response and public health interventions. Tangible examples are provided for how the working groups and special interest groups of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) are helping to build an evidence-based response to this crisis. Methods Leaders of working and special interest groups of the IMIA, a total of 26 groups, were contacted via e-mail to provide a summary of the scientific-based efforts taken to combat COVID-19 pandemic and participate in the discussion toward the creation of this manuscript. A total of 13 groups participated in this manuscript. Results Various efforts were exerted by members of IMIA including (1) developing evidence-based guidelines for the design and deployment of digital health solutions during COVID-19; (2) surveying clinical informaticians internationally about key digital solutions deployed to combat COVID-19 and the challenges faced when implementing and using them; and (3) offering necessary resources for clinicians about the use of digital tools in clinical practice, education, and research during COVID-19. Discussion Rigor and evidence need to be taken into consideration when designing, implementing, and using digital tools to combat COVID-19 to avoid delays and unforeseen negative consequences. It is paramount to employ a multidisciplinary approach for the development and implementation of digital health tools that have been rapidly deployed in response to the pandemic bearing in mind human factors, ethics, data privacy, and the diversity of context at the local, national, and international levels. The training and capacity building of front-line workers is crucial and must be linked to a clear strategy for evaluation of ongoing experiences.","output":"Evidence-Based Health Informatics as the Foundation for the COVID-19 Response: A Joint Call for Action"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this research is to try to conduct an outbreak modeling of a Corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic in West Nusa Tenggara (NTB) Province.

The purpose of this study was to examine how device-measured sedentary behaviour in young children differed across geographically, economically, and socio-demographically diverse populations, in an international sample. METHODS: This multinational, cross-sectional study included data from 1071 3-5-year-old children from 19 countries, collected between 2018 and 2020 (pre-COVID). Sedentary behaviour was measured for three consecutive days using activPAL accelerometers. Sedentary time, sedentary fragmentation and seated transport duration were calculated. Linear mixed models were used to examine the differences in sedentary behaviour variables between sex, country-level income groups, urban/rural settings, and population density. RESULTS: Children spent 56% (7.4 hours) of their waking time sedentary. The longest average bout duration was 81.1 +/- 45.4 min, and an average of 61.1 +/- 50.1 min/day was spent in seated transport. Children from upper-middle-income and high-income countries spent a greater proportion of the day sedentary, accrued more sedentary bouts, had shorter breaks between sedentary bouts, and spent significantly more time in seated transport, than children from low-and lower-middle-income countries. Sex and urban/rural residential setting were not associated with any outcomes. Higher population density was associated with several higher sedentary behaviour measures. CONCLUSIONS: These data advance our understanding of young children's sedentary behaviour patterns globally. Country income levels and population density appear to be stronger drivers of the observed differences, than sex or rural/urban residential setting.","output":"Levels and Correlates of Objectively Measured Sedentary Behaviour in Young Children: SUNRISE Study Results from 19 Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose Vaccination for SARS-CoV-2 is highly effective in preventing severe disease and death but its impact on reducing transmission outside households in reducing super spreading events are not so clear. Methods & Materials We reviewed Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) daily detailed reports on cases and clusters from April - June 2021. Cases were classified as: Fully vaccinated- completed two doses of vaccine at least fourteen days prior or not fully vaccinated. Cases were also categorized by whether they were diagnosed while under quarantine or by symptomatic or routine surveillance testing. Index cases were defined as the first cases identified in each cluster. Secondary cases were classified as non-index cases. Stratified analysis was performed on VassarStats (Vassar College, USA). Results 803 cases were reviewed; 187 (23%) were fully vaccinated, 56 (7%) were partially vaccinated and 560 (70%) were completely unvaccinated. There were a total of 77 clusters reported during this period, ranging from 3 to 108 cases primarily in malls, markets and bars. The proportion of index cases for these clusters who were fully vaccinated (20.8%) was similar (RR 0.864, 95% CI 0.511-1.46) to the secondary cases (23.6%). In contrast, the majority of index cases for clusters were identified through surveillance (96.1%) with only three of the 77 (3.9%) detected in quarantine while the majority of 726 secondary cases (68.2%) were detected in quarantine. Conclusion Although many of the clusters may not represent true superspreading events, it is still concerning that vaccinated individuals formed such a significant proportion of the index cases for clusters. More studies are clearly needed to better understand super-spreading events and to devise better vaccination strategies to prevent single cases from sparking clusters. As vaccination rates increase globally, preventing superspreading events will be a major part of controlling the pandemic.","output":"Vaccination may not have a significant impact on superspreading events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first identified in China in December 2019.

We show that the upper tail of COVID-19 cases in Chinese cities is well described by a power law distribution, with exponent less than one, and that a random proportionate growth model predicated by Gibrat's law is a plausible explanation for the emergence of the observed power law behavior. This finding is significant because it implies that COVID-19 cases in China is heavy-tailed and disperse, that a few cities account for a disproportionate share of COVID-19 cases, and that the distribution has no finite mean or variance. The power-law distributedness has implications for effective planning and policy design as well as efficient use of government resources.","output":"Power Law in COVID-19 Cases in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Eating, physical activity and other weight-related lifestyle behaviors may have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and people with obesity may be disproportionately affected.

Participants also reported on perceived changes in weight-related behaviors and whether they had experienced barriers to weight management, compared to before the lockdown. A large number of participants reported negative changes in eating and physical activity behavior (e.g. 56% reported snacking more frequently) and experiencing barriers to weight management (e.g. problems with motivation and control around food) compared to before lockdown. These trends were particularly pronounced among participants with higher BMI. During lockdown, higher BMI was associated with lower levels of physical activity and diet quality, and a greater reported frequency of overeating. Reporting a decline in mental health because of the COVID-19 crisis was not associated with higher BMI, but was predictive of greater overeating and lower physical activity in lockdown.

In parallel, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated the health and wellbeing benefits of spending time in nature. Here, we sought to examine whether spending time in nature was associated with lower levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in HGV drivers. 89 long-distance drivers (98.9% male, mean  SD age: 51.0  9 years, body mass index: 29.8  4.7 kg/m2) participating in a wider health promotion programme reported time spent in nature (during and before the Covid-19 pandemic) and symptoms of occupational fatigue, depression and anxiety. After controlling for covariates, truck drivers who visited nature at least once a week exhibited 16% less chronic fatigue prior to the pandemic, and 23% less chronic fatigue and 20% less acute fatigue during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed for either anxiety or depression.

Adipogenic differentiation of adipose-tissue-derived MSC (adMSC) is important in various pathological processes. Adipocytes and their progenitors are metabolically active and secrete molecules (adipokines) that have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties. Cell culturing in 2D is commonly used to study cellular responses, but the 2D environment does not reflect the structural situation for most cell types. Therefore, 3D culture systems have been developed to create an environment considered more physiological. Since knowledge about the effects of 3D cultivation on adipogenic differentiation is limited, we investigated its effects on adipogenic differentiation and adipokine release of adMSC (up to 28 days) and compared these with the effects in 2D. We demonstrated that cultivation conditions are crucial for cell behavior: in both 2D and 3D culture, adipogenic differentiation occurred only after specific stimulation. While the size and structure of adipogenically stimulated 3D spheroids remained stable during the experiment, the unstimulated spheroids showed signs of disintegration. Adipokine release was dependent on culture dimensionality; we found upregulated adiponectin and downregulated pro-inflammatory factors.

At the same time, they also provide evidence of innovation and adaptation among street-level bureaucrats. Respondents overwhelmingly praise the President, whose limited national response is seen as helpful to reduce fear and stigma.

Infants at high risk of severe disease include those born prematurely, those with chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised infants. RSV infects ciliated epithelial cells, causing sloughing of the epithelium, cytokine and inflammatory mediator release, increases in mucus production, and interstitial edema. Clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis are a combined result of viral toxicity and the immune response to infection. Innate immune responses are important to the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis, as severe infection tends to occur after maternal antibody protection has waned and before the infant's adaptive immune responses have matured. Immunoprophylaxis, in the form of intramuscular anti-RSV IgG(1), is effective in reducing rates of hospitalization for high-risk infants.","output":"BRONCHIOLITIS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Caudal septoplasty is a difficult procedure. The cutting and suture technique is suitable for caudal septoplasty, but a batten graft is always necessary and bears the risk of nasal tip projection loss. We established a modified cutting and suture technique (MCAST), without using a batten graft, and investigated its effectiveness in correcting nasal obstruction and preventing nasal tip projection loss. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 22 patients who underwent caudal septoplasty using MCAST. Subjective assessment by Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) score and objective assessment by computed tomography (CT) were performed before and after the surgery. For evaluating nasal tip projection, we asked patients about their awareness of external nasal deformity. Additionally, the nasal tip projection was measured by CT and compared before and after surgery. RESULTS: The median preoperative NOSE score reduced significantly after MCAST (P < 0.001). On CT, the ratio of the area of the convex side to that of the concave side in the anterior portion of the nasal cavity increased significantly after MCAST (P < 0.001). All patients were unaware of external nasal deformity. There were no significant differences in the mean preoperative and postoperative nasal tip height and nasolabial angle. The mean supra tip height was significantly greater postoperatively than preoperatively (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The MCAST was useful for correcting nasal obstruction with caudal septal deviation. There was no postoperative loss of nasal tip projection. The MCAST can be suitable for correcting C-shaped caudal deviations without dislocating the caudal septum from the anterior nasal septum.

Despite decades of research efforts, the precise mechanism of immune escape and the virulence factors encoded by Mtb involved remain to be explored. Mtb-specific genomic regions of deletion (RD)-encoded proteins and PE/PPE family proteins have been implicated in immune evasion. Here, we screened more than forty RD-encoded proteins which might be involved in facilitating bacterial survival in macrophages, and found that a Mtb PPE68/Rv3873 protein, encoded by Mtb-RD1, is essential for efficient Mtb intracellular survival in macrophages. In terms of mechanism, we found that the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Makorin Ring Finger Protein 1 (MKRN1) of macrophage interacted with PPE68 and promoted the attachment of lysine (K)-63-linked ubiquitin chains to the K166 site of PPE68. K63-ubiquitination of PPE68 further bound src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) to suppress K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and then remarkably suppressed TRAF6-driven NF-B and AP-1 signaling and TNF-, IL-6 and NO production. We demonstrate that the K63-linked ubiquitination of PPE68 by MKRN1 contributed to the PPE68-mediated mycobacterial immune escape.

However, little is known about the SDL resources medical students use. This study aimed to identify patterns in medical students' SDL behaviors, their SDL resource choices, factors motivating these choices, and the potential impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on these variables. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey comprising multiple-choice, ranked, and free-text response questions were disseminated to medical students across all 41 UK medical schools between April and July 2020. Independent study hours and sources of study materials prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared. Motivational factors guiding resource choices and awareness of Free Open Access Meducation were also investigated. Results: The target sample was 75 students per medical school across a total of 41 medical schools within the United Kingdom (3,075 total students), and 1,564 responses were analyzed.

Ideally, these novel antimicrobials should be less prone to the development of resistance. Peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are a promising class of compounds with a fundamentally different mode of action compared to traditionally used antibiotics. The difference in the mechanism of action implies differences both in the mechanisms of resistance and the chances of its emergence. To critically assess the potential of resistance development to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes, we review the available evidence for the development of resistance to these enzymes in vitro, along with the known mechanisms of resistance to lysozyme, bacteriocins, autolysins, and phage endolysins. We conclude that genetic determinants of resistance to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes are unlikely to readily emerge de novo. However, resistance to these enzymes would probably spread by the horizontal transfer between intrinsically resistant and susceptible species. Finally, we speculate that the higher cost of the therapeutics based on peptidoglycan degrading enzymes compared to classical antibiotics might result in less misuse, which in turn would lead to lower selective pressure, making these antibacterials less prone to resistance development.","output":"Resistance to peptidoglycan-degrading enzymes."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"While Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is efficacious in preventing HIV, little is known about PrEP use among those on community supervision.

Data on mechanism of injury and date of injury, presentation, and surgical repair were collected. This process was repeated for the same dates in the previous 5 years for comparison. Results : During the COVID-19 lockdown period, we saw 10 cases of serious ocular trauma (4 globe ruptures, 4 full-thickness lid lacerations, and 2 intra-ocular foreign bodies).

For high-throughput analyses of sphingolipids, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the method of choice, offering sufficient sensitivity, structural information, and quantitative precision for detecting hundreds to thousands of species simultaneously. While glycerolipids and phospholipids are predominantly non-hydroxylated, sphingolipids are typically dihydroxylated. However, species containing one or three hydroxylation sites can be detected frequently. This variability in the number of hydroxylation sites on the sphingolipid long-chain base and the fatty acyl moiety produces many more isobaric species and fragments than for other lipid categories.

A similar mechanism may occur in other RNA-viruses (influenza, rabies and Ebola), also verified in vitro for influenza, by interaction of p-cymene with viral nucleoproteins, and structural modification of their NLS site, weakening its interaction with importin A.

Sleep disturbance is one of the key symptoms of major depression and one of the proven risk factors for suicide. The objective of this study is to identify the risk factors associated with sleep disturbance which has developed as a general impact of COVID-19 and new normal life during the lockdown (a measure to control the spread of COVID-19) in Bangladesh. METHODS: Demographic characteristics, COVID-19, and lockdown related information have been collected from 1,128 individuals by conducting a web-based survey. Respondents perspective regarding sleep disturbance during COVID-19 lockdown is considered as the outcome of interest which is dichotomous. Descriptive statistics methods have been applied to explore the distribution of respondents demographic characteristics. Pearsons chi-square tests have been performed to relate the sleep disturbance status of the respondents to their demographic, personal, and COVID-19 related information. Furthermore, a multivariable logistic regression model has been adopted to identify the significant association of sleep disturbance with the demographic, COVID-19, and lockdown related information of respondents during the COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh. FINDINGS: The prevalence of sleep disturbance during the COVID-19 lockdown is found to be higher among participants aged 31C40 years. Gender disparity has also been observed in favor of male participants, whereas no significant regional heterogeneity has been found. Working from home or doing online classes during the lockdown has been found as a potential predictive factor of sleep disturbance. Losing a job has been considered as an adverse economic effect of COVID-19, which also induces sleep disturbance. Perception regarding the risk of getting infected and anxiety triggered the chance of developing sleep disturbance. The sleeping schedule is also found as a risk factor for sleep disturbance. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based policies are required to combat psychological challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19, primarily targeting the groups who are largely suffering from sleep disturbance.","output":"Identifying the Associated Risk Factors of Sleep Disturbance During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Bangladesh: A Web-Based Survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The main objective of this project is to ensure the safety precautions in public transportation.

This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to peoples usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on peoples wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worryboth general and COVID-19 specificand symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worriesrespectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.","output":"Resilience During Uncertainty?

Remote health monitoring through telemedicine can help people discover potential health threats in time. In the COVID-19 pandemic, remote health monitoring can help obtain and analyze biomedical signals including human body temperature without direct body contact. This technique is of great significance to achieve safe and efficient health monitoring in the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing remote biomedical signal monitoring methods cannot effectively analyze the time series data. This paper designs a remote biomedical signal monitoring framework combining the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G communication and artificial intelligence techniques. In the constructed framework, IoT devices are used to collect biomedical signals at the perception layer. Subsequently, the biomedical signals are transmitted through the 5G network to the cloud server where the GRU-AE deep learning model is deployed. It is noteworthy that the proposed GRU-AE model can analyze multi-dimensional biomedical signals in time series. Finally, this paper conducts a 24-week monitoring experiment for 2000 subjects of different ages to obtain real data. Compared with the traditional biomedical signal monitoring method based on the AutoEncoder model, the GRU-AE model has better performance. The research has an important role in promoting the development of biomedical signal monitoring techniques, which can be effectively applied to some kinds of remote health monitoring scenario.","output":"Exploring an Efficient Remote Biomedical Signal Monitoring Framework for Personal Health in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior work shows that older adults who establish future care plans have a lower risk of depression. Residents in long-term care may benefit from establishing a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order when cardiopulmonary resuscitation is unlikely to provide medical benefit. The current study examines whether having a DNR order in place prior to COVID-19 diagnosis was associated with fewer depressive symptoms during the illness course. Residents at a NYC skilled nursing facility with a positive COVID-19 PCR test between 3/1/2020 C 6/1/2020 were included (N=338).

Forty-eight percent, 46%, and 12% of participants had a DNR, DNI, or DNH order prior to COVID-19 illness, respectively. Average PHQ-9 score was 1.65 (SD=2.37).

Approximately 25% of all anti-cancer medication is now designed for oral use and this is likely to increase prospectively. These treatments are convenient for patients and are often preferred by them, yet there are similar safety and toxicity concerns as there are to intravenous treatment. Oral anti-cancer medications (OAMs) have the potential to alleviate capacity issues in cancer treating units as patients receive their treatment at home, however there remains a requirement for safe and efficient assessment and care. Consequently, the management of patients on OAMs is of paramount importance. The optimum setting, whether within primary or secondary care, in addition to the appropriate health care professional to carry out patient assessment and monitoring needs to be established. This paper presents a protocol for a scoping review which aims to systematically and comprehensively map the literature on the current management of adults receiving OAMs. The review will follow the published guidance to direct the various steps involved. The protocol will be guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework to ensure methodological and reporting quality. Independent full text review will be performed by two reviewers and any disagreements resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. The process will be iterative in nature. This scoping review will provide a narrative synthesis and map the literature on the management of individuals receiving OAMs. This work is an appropriate initial stage in presenting the literature to inform the subsequent steps in a multi-phased research study which aims to establish and analyse the safety and efficacy of an integrated care model for the management of patients receiving OAM in the community by an advanced practitioner.","output":"Current management of adults receiving oral anti-cancer medications: A scoping review protocol."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The Coronavirus (COVID-19) has advanced into 197 countries and territories leaving behind a total of 372,757 confirmed cases and 16231 deaths.

On March 22, 2020, the Turkish government enforced strict lockdown measures to reduce coronavirus disease transmission. This lockdown had a significant impact on the movement of people within the country, which resulted in a major drop in worldwide commercial activities. During this period, university campuses were emptied due to the transition to distance education. In this study, various air pollutants sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), ozone (O(3)), fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)), total bacteria, and total fungi were measured in different indoor environments at Eski?ehir Technical University Campus in Eski?ehir, Turkey during COVID-19 lock down period. Also, to calculate the indoor and outdoor ratios (I/O) of the pollutants, simultaneous outdoor measurements were also carried out. The average indoor SO(2,) NO(2,) O(3,) and PM(2.5) concentrations in different indoor environments ranged between 2.10 and 54.58, 1.36C30.89, 12.01C39.05, and 21C94 g/m(3), respectively.

Methods: Assumption-free k-nearest neighbour clustering from the principal component analysis of weekly incidence rates of German counties groups similar spreading behaviour. Different spreading dynamics was analysed by the derivative plots of the temporal evolution of tuples [x(t),x(t)] of weekly incidence rates and their derivatives. The effectiveness of the different shutdown measures in Germany during the second wave is assessed by the difference of weekly incidences before and after the respective time periods. Findings: The implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions of different extents resulted in four distinct time periods of complex, spatially diverse, and age-related spreading patterns during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. Clustering gave three regions of coincident spreading characteristics. October 2020 showed a nationwide exponential growth of weekly incidence rates with a doubling time of 10 days. A partial shutdown during November 2020 decreased the overall infection rates by 20C40% with a plateau-like behaviour in northern and southwestern Germany. The eastern parts exhibited a further near-linear growth by 30C80%. Allover the incidence rates among people above 60 years still increased by 15C35% during partial shutdown measures. Only an extended shutdown led to a substantial decrease in incidence rates. These measures decreased the numbers among all age groups and in all regions by 15C45%. This decline until January 2021 was about -1?25 times the October 2020 growth rates with a strong correlation of -0?96. Interpretation: Three regional groups with different dynamics and different degrees of effectiveness of the applied measures were identified. The partial shutdown was moderately effective and at most stopped the exponential growth, but the spread remained partly plateau-like and regionally continued to grow in a nearly linear fashion.

This implies compliance with key performance indicators (KPIs) required by applications. Key performance indicators at the application level are throughput, download time, round trip time, and video delay. They depend on the end-to-end connection between the server and the end-user device. For VHC networks, Telco operators must provide the required application quality. Moreover, they must meet the objectives of economic sustainability. Today, Telco operators rarely achieve the above objectives, mainly due to the push to increase the bit-rate of access networks without considering the end-to-end KPIs of the applications. The main contribution of this paper concerns the definition of a deployment framework to address performance and cost issues for VHC networks. We show three actions on which it is necessary to focus. First, limiting bit-rate through video compression. Second, contain the rate of packet loss through artificial intelligence algorithms for line stabilization. Third, reduce latency (i.e., round-trip time) with edge-cloud computing. The concerted and gradual application of these measures can allow a Telco to get out of the ultra-broadband\\"trap\\"of the access network, as defined in the paper.

During laparoscopic gastrostomy, it is standard to perform gastropexy, apposing visceral and parietal peritoneum. In some settings, due to altered anatomy from prior surgery, direct apposition of the stomach to the abdominal wall is not possible. This study reports a series of cases where laparoscopic gastrostomy was performed via a Witzel approach without gastropexy. METHODS A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients at a tertiary academic medical center who underwent Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy over a 3-year period. In each case, an 18-French tube was placed into the fundus of the stomach and secured with a purse-string suture. A 5-cm serosalized Witzel tunnel was created around the tube using running silk suture. No gastropexy was performed. RESULTS Six patients underwent 7 Witzel gastrostomy procedures. In three cases, patients had undergone prior major upper abdominal surgery where adhesive disease prevented gastropexy. In the other four cases, the patients had undergone prior gastric bypass with antecolic antegastric position of the roux limb. No patient suffered leak of gastric contents into the peritoneum, and there were no postoperative complications or mortality related to the gastrostomy. CONCLUSION In cases where enteral access is necessary, and where the stomach cannot reach the anterior abdominal wall for gastropexy due to prior surgeries, a Witzel gastrostomy without gastropexy is a safe option which resulted in no morbidity or mortality in our series.","output":"Use of a Laparoscopic Witzel Gastrostomy Without Gastropexy in Bariatric and General Surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by symptoms and signs of intestinal occlusion, in absence of any mechanical obstruction of the gut lumen. It causes impaired transit of intestinal contents and is determined by abnormalities of motor activity. The term CIP is used to indicate a heterogeneous group of disorders with many different pathogenic mechanisms. The defect in the regulation of intestinal transit can be at any level of motility control. Two main types of CIP are recognized, termed respectively myogenic (when smooth muscle cells are affected) and neurogenic (caused by abnormalities of extrinsic and/or intrinsic nervous supplies). Both types may be secondary to a variety of recognizable diseases or idiopathic. In myogenic CIP, intestinal transit is impaired because of lack of propulsive strength; in the neurogenic form, contractions are powerful but not sufficiently co-ordinated to propel intestinal contents aborally in an organized fashion. CIP belongs to the large and loosely defined group of digestive functional disorders. These disorders probably share common pathogenic mechanisms but with different expressiveness. The reasons why only some patients present recurrent symptomatological bouts resembling mechanical occlusion has not been clarified. This aspect is of great clinical relevance and deserves attention, as CIP patients, unlike other patients with severe functional disorders, may undergo repeated, useless and potentially dangerous operations. The diagnosis of CIP may be suggested by clinical features and is based on radiological, endoscopic, manometric, and histological findings. Recent technological improvements facilitate the recognition of this intriguing syndrome. In particular, manometric recording of the small bowel motility, which has long been considered an important research technique, can now also be regarded as a useful diagnostic tool.","output":"12 Pseudo-obstruction syndromes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a havoc across the globe, and has significantly affected oncology services, especially radiation therapy due to the need of social distancing as a measure for the pandemic mitigation.

In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the role of brachytherapy in various forms and different malignancy sites.","output":"Brachytherapy practice during the COVID-19 pandemic: a review on the practice changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type?1 receptor blockers (ARBs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs for the treatment of arterial hypertension, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. A number of studies, mainly in animals and not involving the lungs, have indicated that these drugs can increase expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is the cell entry receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is currently battering the globe. This has led to the hypothesis that use of ACEIs and ARBs may increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19. In this point of view paper, possible scenarios regarding the impact of ACEI/ARB pharmacotherapy on COVID-19 are discussed in relation to the currently available evidence. Although further research on the influence of blood-pressure-lowering drugs, including those not targeting the renin-angiotensin system, is warranted, there are presently no compelling clinical data showing that ACEIs and ARBs increase the likelihood of contracting COVID-19 or worsen the outcome of SARS-CoV?2 infections. Thus, unless contraindicated, use of ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19 patients should be continued in line with the recent recommendations of medical societies.","output":"Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) has brought out changes in our daily life and has caused severe morbidity and mortality across the globe. Especially, post covid complications may remain a threat to the patients life. It may also increase the burden on existing health infrastructure and the countrys economy. This disease affects the respiratory system and other organ systems of the body, such as the cardiovascular system. The aim of the present narrative review is to understand how COVID-19 infection deranges vascular homeostasis, leading to endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness in the acute phase and following infection. To this effect, definite keywords were employed to obtain relevant information using PubMed database and Google Scholar search engines. It was documented that preexisting cardiovascular disease enhances morbidity in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, an elevated risk of development of new onset cardiovascular events has also been reported. Even a small amount of myocardial injury was significantly associated with death. The presence of virus in myocardial cells has also been documented. Furthermore, endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness were documented in the acute phase and 3C4 weeks to 4 months after COVID infection. The virus enters endothelial cells by binding with ACE2 receptor on its surface and deranges cellular machinery. It results in reduced conversion of Ang II to Ang (1C7). Accumulated Ang II then activates PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and regulates endothelial activation and production of IL-6 and reactive oxygen species (ROS). An imbalance between renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and kallikrein kinin system (KKS) also occurs, which may cause endothelial dysfunction. It is understandable that the underlying pathophysiology of this altered arterial stiffness is multifactorial, involving various cellular and immunological biomolecules.","output":"Vascular Dysfunction and Its Cardiovascular Consequences During and After COVID-19 Infection: A Narrative Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Broadly speaking, pharmacological treatments for COVID-19 can be divided into those acting on upstream pathways early on in the disease process via suppression of viral replication or by inhibiting cell entry, and those acting on downstream pathways later on via selective attenuation of the adaptive immune cytokine-mediated inflammatory response. The antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to shorten duration of disease while interferon beta-1b may speed up viral clearance. The results with hydroxychloroquine have thus far been rather disappointing. Trials with selective cytokine blockers including anti-interleukin-1 (anti-IL-1) and anti-interleukin-6 (anti-IL-6), have shown some promise in more severe cases, with further confirmation being required from large-scale phase-3 randomised controlled trials. The likelihood is that combination therapy addressing both upstream and downstream pathways may be required to prevent progression of severe COVID-19 infection in susceptible older patients with comorbidities and we believe further studies are now warranted to specifically target such at-risk groups who are more prone to worse outcomes.","output":"Emerging pharmacotherapy for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A patient's infectivity is determined by the presence of the virus in different body fluids, secretions, and excreta. The persistence and clearance of viral RNA from different specimens of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) remain unclear. This study analyzed the clearance time and factors influencing 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA in different samples from patients with COVID-19, providing further evidence to improve the management of patients during convalescence. METHODS: The clinical data and laboratory test results of convalescent patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to from January 20, 2020 to February 10, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results for patients' oropharyngeal swab, stool, urine, and serum samples were collected and analyzed. Convalescent patients refer to recovered non-febrile patients without respiratory symptoms who had two successive (minimum 24 h sampling interval) negative RT-PCR results for viral RNA from oropharyngeal swabs. The effects of cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T lymphocytes, inflammatory indicators, and glucocorticoid treatment on viral nucleic acid clearance were analyzed. RESULTS: In the 292 confirmed cases, 66 patients recovered after treatment and were included in our study. In total, 28 (42.4%) women and 38 men (57.6%) with a median age of 44.0 (34.0-62.0) years were analyzed. After in-hospital treatment, patients' inflammatory indicators decreased with improved clinical condition. The median time from the onset of symptoms to first negative RT-PCR results for oropharyngeal swabs in convalescent patients was 9.5 (6.0-11.0) days. By February 10, 2020, 11 convalescent patients (16.7%) still tested positive for viral RNA from stool specimens and the other 55 patients' stool specimens were negative for 2019-nCoV following a median duration of 11.0 (9.0-16.0) days after symptom onset. Among these 55 patients, 43 had a longer duration until stool specimens were negative for viral RNA than for throat swabs, with a median delay of 2.0 (1.0-4.0) days. Results for only four (6.9%) urine samples were positive for viral nucleic acid out of 58 cases; viral RNA was still present in three patients' urine specimens after throat swabs were negative. Using a multiple linear regression model (Fa??=a??2.669, Pa??=a??0.044, and adjusted Ra??=a??0.122), the analysis showed that the CD4+ T lymphocyte count may help predict the duration of viral RNA detection in patients' stools (ta??=a??-2.699, Pa??=a??0.010). The duration of viral RNA detection from oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (15 days vs. 8.0 days, respectively; ta??=a??2.550, Pa??=a??0.013) and the duration of viral RNA detection in fecal samples in the glucocorticoid treatment group was longer than that in the non-glucocorticoid treatment group (20 days vs. 11 days, respectively; ta??=a??4.631, Pa??<a??0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in inflammatory indicators between patients with positive fecal viral RNA test results and those with negative results (Pa??>a??0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In brief, as the clearance of viral RNA in patients' stools was delayed compared to that in oropharyngeal swabs, it is important to identify viral RNA in feces during convalescence. Because of the delayed clearance of viral RNA in the glucocorticoid treatment group, glucocorticoids are not recommended in the treatment of COVID-19, especially for mild disease. The duration of RNA detection may relate to host cell immunity.","output":"Persistence and clearance of viral RNA in 2019 novel coronavirus disease rehabilitation patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION/AIMS It is unclear whether the heart is affected in pediatric patients with milder forms of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Therefore, we aimed to determine the presence of any cardiac abnormalities in these patients. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents with SMA types 2 and 3 between July 2018 and July 2019. All patients underwent a comprehensive cardiac evaluation, including history taking, physical examination, electrocardiography, echocardiography, measurement of cardiac biomarkers (cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)), and 24-hour Holter monitoring. RESULTS In total, 42 patients were enrolled (27 and 15 with SMA type 2 and 3, respectively). No patient had structural heart disease except for one with mitral valve prolapse. None had signs of ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. Both cTnT and NT-proBNP levels were normal in all patients. ECG showed sinus tachycardia in 7 patients (16.7%), and prolonged PR interval in one (2.4%). Holter monitoring detected benign ventricular arrhythmias in 2 patients (4.8%), and rare supraventricular premature beats in one. The mean 24-hour heart rate was elevated in 6 patients (14.3%), while both the minimum 24-hour heart rate and the maximum RR interval were increased in 23 (54.8%).

DESIGN: Pre-COVID-19 and lockdown surveys nested within two longitudinal Born in Bradford cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: 1860 mothers with a child aged 0C5 or 9C13, 48% Pakistani heritage. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ORs for a clinically important increase (5 points or more) in depression (eight item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8)) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)) in unadjusted regression analyses, repeated with exposures of interest separated by ethnicity to look for differences in magnitude of associations, and lived experience of mothers captured in open text questions. RESULTS: The number of women reporting clinically important depression/anxiety increased from 11% to 20% (95% CI 10%C13%; 18%C22%) and from 10% to 16% (95% CI 8%C11%; 15%C18%), respectively. Increases in depression/anxiety were associated with loneliness (OR=8.37, 95% CI 5.70 to 12.27; 8.50, 95% CI 5.71 to 12.65, respectively); financial (6.23, 95% CI 3.96 to 9.80; 6.03, 95% CI 3.82 to 9.51), food (3.33, 95% CI 2.09 to 5.28; 3.46, 95% CI 2.15 to 5.58) and housing insecurity (3.29, 95% CI 2.36 to 4.58; 3.0, 95% CI 2.11 to 4.25); a lack of physical activity (3.13, 95% CI 2.15 to 4.56; 2.55, 95% CI 1.72 to 3.78); and a poor partner relationship (3.6, 95% CI 2.44 to 5.43; 5.1, 95% CI 3.37 to 7.62). The magnitude of associations between key exposures and worsening mental health varied between ethnic groups. Responses to open text questions illustrated a complex interplay of challenges contributing to mental ill health including: acute health anxieties; the mental load of managing multiple responsibilities; loss of social support and coping strategies; pressures of financial and employment insecurity; and being unable to switch off from the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Mental ill health has worsened for many during the COVID-19 lockdown, particularly in those who are lonely and economically insecure. The magnitude of associations between key exposures and worsening mental health varied between ethnic groups.

METHODS: This type of research is experimental using a randomized controlled trial research design. This research was conducted for 2 weeks in AugustCSeptember 2021. The population of this study was pregnant women in Surabaya. The sampling technique used consecutive sampling technique and was divided into two groups, namely, the intervention group with 39 respondents and the control group with 39 respondents.

Success can be limited by dimensional incompatibilities between tracheal tubes (TTs) and SGAs. METHODS In this in vitro study, we tested the feasibility of TT passage through SGAs, removal of SGAs over TTs, and the ability to guide the flexible bronchoscope with 13 TT brands (internal diameter, 6.5-8.0 mm) and ten different SGAs (#4 and #5) in an intubation mannequin. RESULTS We tested 1,040 combinations of SGAs and TTs. Tracheal tube passage failed in 155 (30%) combinations of the five tested first-generation SGAs (117 [46%] with SGA #4, 38 [15%] with SGA #5) and in three (0.6%) combinations of the five tested second-generation SGAs (two [0.8%] with SGA #4 and one [0.4%] with SGA #5). The reason for failed passage of a TT through a first-generation SGA consistently was a too-narrow SGA connector. Removal of the SGA over the TT in the 882 remaining combinations was impossible for all sizes of reinforced TTs, except the Parker Reinforced TT, and was possible for all non-reinforced TTs. Only one combination with SGA #4 and 84 combinations with SGA #5 were not ideal to adequately guide the flexible bronchoscope.

Little has been written or studied about the impact of COVID-19 on families. This article explores the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on the mental health of families. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with Jordanian families through snowball sampling.The results show that 20 interviewees described varied and new experiences. Many of the families we interviewed displayed symptoms of mental health problems, including disrupted sleep patterns, changes in eating habits, excessive digital media use, anxiety, depression, excessive smoking, stomach aches, bedwetting among children, and persistent headaches. The study also demonstrated the psychological stress partners felt during the lockdown due to their worries about job security. They also communicated their hope that renewed family commitments might bring more stability to their relationships. During the lockdown, family members spent more time together, and it became harder to conceal any issues from each other.The findings of this research demonstrate a critical need for social workers, and it is hoped that future legislation will include a role for social workers in various fields of crisis. Moreover, social workers should encourage families to ask for intervention to overcome the long-term effects that may result from COVID-19.

CircRNAs are generated by a back-splicing mechanism during post-transcriptional processing and are abundantly expressed in eukaryotic cells. CircRNAs can act via the modulation of RNA transcription and protein production, and by the sponging of microRNAs (miRNAs). CircRNAs are now thought to be involved in many different biological and pathological processes. Some studies have suggested that the expression of host circRNAs is dysregulated in several types of virus-infected cells, compared to control cells. It is highly likely that viruses can use these molecules for their own purposes. In addition, some viral genes are able to produce viral circRNAs (VcircRNA) by a back-splicing mechanism. However, the viral genes that encode VcircRNAs, and their functions, are poorly studied. In this review, we highlight some new findings about the interaction of host circRNAs and viral infection.

METHODS: Between 2008 and 2020, we evaluated patients who underwent reoperative proximal thoracic aortic surgery. The patients were divided into 2 groups: (i) patients with no previous right axillary artery cannulation (primary cannulation group) and (ii) patients with a previous cannulated right axillary artery (recannulation group). We analysed the intraoperative data, cannulation-related complications, postoperative outcomes and compared the 2 groups (primary cannulation versus recannulation). RESULTS: The patient (n = 132) baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. There was no statistically significant difference in regard to the duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamp and antegrade cerebral perfusion time nor in regard to the total number of patients with cannulation-related complications between the 2 groups [n = 8 (8.0%) vs n = 1 (3.1%), P = 0.34]. The incidence of iatrogenic axillary artery dissection, iatrogenic aortic dissection, iatrogenic aortic dissection leading to death, axillary artery thrombosis, need for surgical repair, brachial plexus injury rates, malperfusion, high perfusion resistance and hyperperfusion syndrome revealed no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > 0.05).

Although the diagnosis of KD is generally not difficult, it is challenging in cases of incomplete KD lacking characteristic clinical manifestations. The incidence of incomplete KD is higher in infants younger than 6 months of age. Pneumonia is an extremely rare complication of KD and can be misinterpreted as atypical pneumonia rather than KD. Herein, we report a neonate with atypical KD and severe pneumonia who required mechanical ventilation. Case presentation Japanese one-month-old infant had only fever and rash on admission (day 1), and he was transferred to the intensive care unit for severe pneumonia on day 2. Although pneumonia improved following intensive care, he was diagnosed with KD on day 14 because of emerging typical clinical manifestations such as fever, bulbar nonexudative conjunctival injection, desquamation of the fingers, and coronary artery aneurysm. KD symptoms improved after three doses of intravenous immunoglobulin plus cyclosporine. However, small coronary aneurysms were present at the time of discharge. In a retrospective analysis, no pathogens were detected by multiplex real-time PCR in samples collected at admission, and the serum cytokine profile demonstrated prominent elevation of IL-6 as well as elevation of neopterin, sTNF-RI, and sTNF-RII, which suggested KD.

Coping responses can be broadly classified into four strategies: 1) problem-focused coping;2) emotion focused coping;3) socially supported coping;and 4) avoidance. While there is a wide variability of individual coping responses, to some extent they are also culturally specific. Objective: This study aimed to compare the differences in the prevalence and factor structure of coping responses during COVID-19 pandemic in three countries: Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Peru. Design: The sample included 501 participants from Russia, 456 participants from Kyrgyzstan, and 354 participants from Peru. The mean age of participants was 28 years in Russia (SD = 13.5);24 years in Kyrgyzstan (SD = 10.0);and 30 years in Peru (SD = 12.3). In Russia and Kyrgyzstan, coping strategies were assessed with an abbreviated Russian adaptation of the COPE (Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced) questionnaire. In Peru, coping responses were assessed using the Spanish version of the Brief COPE questionnaire. The average scores from fifteen COPE scales were used as the input data for linear modelling and factor analysis. Results: The coping scores varied substantially within each country. Differences between countries accounted for 17.7% of the total variability in religious coping;15.8% in acceptance;13.9% in mental disengagement;and less than 7% in the other coping strategies. No difference in the prevalence of coping responses was found between Russian and Kyrgyz participants after accounting for age and gender. In all three countries the coping responses were associated with the same four coping domains: problem-focused coping, socially supported coping, avoidance, and emotion-focused coping. Four factors explained up to 44% of the total variation in the COPE scores. Religious coping and mental disengagement were classified into different coping domains in the three countries. Conclusion: The results suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic, people from different countries apply the full range of coping responses within the four universal coping strategies. Religious coping and mental disengagement differed the most across the countries, suggesting that some coping behaviors can take on different roles within the system of coping responses to stressful events. We attribute these differences to differing cultural and socioeconomic characteristics, and the different measures taken by governments in response to COVID-19.

Going out is defined as moving from ones own home to a place or region beyond ones own home and is considered to reflect the daily and social life of community-dwelling older adults. This study investigates the relationship between the FGO and current psychological condition after the second wave of COVID-19 in community-dwelling older adults in Japan. Methods: This study adopted a self-administered questionnaire by mail. A total of 493 members of CO-OP Kagoshima were included in the analysis and divided into two groups according to the change in FGO. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted after a bivariate analysis to investigate the relationship between the FGO and psychological condition. Results: Significant differences were noted between the groups with decreased FGO and those with increased/unchanged FGO in general and pandemic-related psychological condition. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant relationship between FGO and psychological condition, such as mental fatigue, not smiling as much as before, and anxiousness to go outside. Conclusion: Community-dwelling older adults may have experienced a decrease in the frequency of going out and a detrimental effect on their psychological condition after the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may inform strategies to identify priorities for psychological approaches altered by COVID-19 to prevent confinement and stress in older adults.","output":"Association between Frequency of Going Out and Psychological Condition among Community-Dwelling Older Adults after the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examines the relationship of pneumococcal vaccination rates, influenza, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations (DTP), polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and Bacillus CalmetteCGuerin (tuberculosis) vaccination rates to COVID-19 case and death rates for 51 nations that have high rates of COVID-19 testing and for which nearly complete childhood, at-risk adult and elderly pneumococcal vaccination data were available.

These molecules function as both gastrointestinal toxins and superantigens (SAgs) which can simultaneously bind MHC-II and T cell receptor leading to a non-specific polyclonal T cell activation and massive proinflammatory cytokine release. Common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea; however, in more severe cases, systemic dissemination may result in toxic shock syndrome and can be lethal in a few hours. Only small amounts of these heat-stable toxins are needed to cause the disease. Therefore, it is highly important to detect quickly low concentrations of SAgs in biological samples. In this work, we report a surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based capture immunoassay for the detection of the SAg SEG. We analyzed the use of different amplification strategies. The SPR-based double-antibody sandwich approach could detect picomolar levels of SEG. The use of antibody-coated silica nanoparticles (AbSiNPs) as an alternative enhancing reagent also detected SEG in the picomolar range. Although AbSiNPs did not improve the limit of detection, for the same amount of SAg tested, AbSiNPs gave a higher response level than free antibodies. This work highlights the suitability of silica nanoparticles for signal amplification in SPR-based biosensors. Overall, SPR biosensors offer the capability for continuous real-time monitoring and high sensitivity that can be befitting for the detection of enterotoxins in food industries, laboratories and regulatory agencies.","output":"Optimized surface plasmon resonance immunoassay for staphylococcal enterotoxin G detection using silica nanoparticles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemics are an international threat to global health and health systems and then healthcare providers Nurses' managers who are responsible for organizing the nurses and their activities grapple with even more challenges, which are overlooked This study was conducted to elaborate on the nurse managers' experiences facing the Coronavirus pandemic Materials and Methods: This study adopted a conventional approach to qualitative content analysis Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 nurse managers working at the University Hospitals of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences from April 5, 2020 to June 15, 2020 The interviews continued until data saturation Data analysis was performed using the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim Results: Participants described their experiences about facing COVID-19 pandemic into three categories of 'facing the personnel's mental health', 'Managerial and equipment provision challenges', and 'adaptability and exultation process', with 13 sub-categories Conclusions: Dealing with critical conditions could make the frontline managers, and specially nurse managers, face serious challenges However, in case of proper crisis management andadaptation of sufficient supporting strategies, these threats could turn into an opportunity to exault the individuals and consequently the organizations engaged","output":"Nurse managers' perceptions and experiences during the COVID-19 crisis: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Following the April 16, 2020 release of the Opening Up America Again guidelines for relaxing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing policies, local leaders are concerned about future pandemic waves and lack robust strategies for tracking and suppressing transmission.

This study subanalysis endovascularly treated occlusions of the posterior cerebral artery in the P2 and P3 segment secondary preprocedural or periprocedural thrombus migration between January 2014 and June 2020. Technical feasibility was evaluated with the modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scale. Procedural safety was assessed by the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and intervention-related serious adverse events. RESULTS Among 71 patients with secondary posterior circulation DMVO who met the inclusion criteria, occlusions were present in 80.3% (57/71) located in the P2 segment and in 19.7% (14/71) in the P3 segment. Periprocedural migration occurred in 54.9% (39/71) and preprocedural migration in 45.1% (32/71) of cases. The first reperfusion attempt led in 38% (27/71) of all cases to mTICI 3. On multivariable logistic regression analysis, increased numbers of reperfusion attempts (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=0.39, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.88, p=0.009) and preprocedural migration (aOR=4.70, 95% CI,1.35 to 16.35, p=0.015) were significantly associated with mTICI 3. sICH occurred in 2.8% (2/71).

Accordingly, our objective was to test the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study (COVID Survey), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society (Main Survey). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination for COVID-19. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N=1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability test scores being vaccine-hesitant. With people with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.","output":"Pre-pandemic Cognitive Function and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy: Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths globally.
