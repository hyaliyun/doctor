In this work, we aimed to evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of D. pigrum 040417 in human respiratory epithelial cells and the potential ability of this immunobiotic bacterium to increase the protection against Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The respiratory commensal bacterium D. pigrum 040417 differentially modulated the production of IFN-, IL-6, CXCL8, CCL5 and CXCL10 in the culture supernatants of Calu-3 cells stimulated with poly(I:C) or challenged with SARS-CoV-2. The differential cytokine profile induced by the 040417 strain was associated with a significant reduction in viral replication and cellular damage after coronavirus infection. Of note, D. pigrum 030918 was not able to modify the resistance of Calu-3 cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating a strain-specific immunomodulatory effect for respiratory commensal bacteria. The findings of this work improve our understanding of the immunological mechanisms involved in the modulation of respiratory immunity induced by respiratory commensal bacteria, by demonstrating their specific effect on respiratory epithelial cells.

However, real-world data concerning the risk factors for death in patients with severe COVID-19 still remain vague. This study aimed to identify the potential risk factors associated with mortality in severe COVID-19 patients. METHODS: All consecutive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our institute for COVID-19 for severe COVID-19 pneumonia from April 1, 2020 to July 20, 2020 were included in the analysis. Patient characteristics, including complete medical history and comorbid diseases, blood test results during admission and on day 7, and clinical characteristics were compared between survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between survivors and nonsurvivors regarding age, gender, and preexisting cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, the rate of the medications including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blockers did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. The peak C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, fibrinogen, and d-dimer levels and the rate for chronic renal failure were significantly higher in nonsurvivors compared with survivors. Intubated patients had a higher risk of death than the others had. CONCLUSIONS: This study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in preexisting cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular medications between survivors and nonsurvivors who were admitted to ICU for severe COVID-19. Our findings indicate that the presence of chronic renal failure, a high peak ferritin concentration, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation appear predictive for mortality.

CS may trigger mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) extrusion into the cytosol, extracellular space, or foster its transfer by extracellular vesicles (EVs). The present study aimed to elucidate whether mtDNA is released upon CS exposure and in COPD. We measured cell-free mtDNA (cf-mtDNA) in the plasma of former smokers affected by COPD, in the serum of mice that developed CS-induced emphysema, and in the extracellular milieu of human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). Further, we characterized cells exposed to sublethal and lethal doses of CSE by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential and dynamics, superoxide production and oxidative stress, cell cycle progression, and cytokine expression. Patients with COPD and mice that developed emphysema showed increased levels of cf-mtDNA. In cell culture, exposure to a sublethal dose of CSE decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, increased superoxide production and oxidative damage, dysregulated mitochondrial dynamics, and triggered mtDNA release in extracellular vesicles. The release of mtDNA into the extracellular milieu occurred concomitantly with increased expression of DNase III, DNA-sensing receptors (cGAS, NLRP3), proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, CXCL2), and markers of senescence (p16, p21). Exposure to a lethal dose of CSE preferentially induced mtDNA and nuclear DNA release in cell debris.

Loxygnothrapie tait poursuivie  6 L/min, avec ajout de dexamthasone 6 mg/j et enoxaparine 4000 UI-anti-Xa. Le lendemain de son hospitalisation, la patiente prsenta une dysphonie brutale avec voix nasonne et douleurs abdominales. Il nexistait pas de gonflement des extrmits, ni du visage ou de la cavit buccale. Devant la prsence de signes ORL, atypiques dans le cadre dune infection respiratoire  SARS-CoV2, et au vu des antcdents de la patiente, une pousse dAEH dclenche par lpisode infectieux tait suspecte.

METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained quality database was performed. Patients who underwent MSA or LF and had FLIP measurements between April 2018 and June 2021 were included. FLIP measurements at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) were recorded without pneumoperitoneum at 40 mL balloon fill after hernia reduction, cruroplasty, and MSA or fundoplication. Reflux symptom index (RSI), GERD-HRQL, and dysphagia score were collected up to 2 years. Group comparisons were made using two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum and 2 tests, with statistical significance of p < 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent MSA and 100 patients underwent LF (66% Toupet, 34% Nissen). Type III hiatal hernia was present in 3.7% of MSA patients versus over 50% for fundoplication patients. Minimum diameter, cross-sectional area, and distensibility index (DI) were lower after MSA device placement compared to Nissen or Toupet fundoplication (p < 0.05). Postoperative follow-up showed no differences in RSI, GERD-HRQL, and dysphagia score between MSA and Nissen fundoplication (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative impedance planimetry provided objective information regarding the geometry of the GEJ during MSA. The ring of magnetic beads restores the anti-reflux barrier and transiently opens with food bolus and belching. The magnetic force of the beads may explain why the DI after MSA is lower yet postoperative quality of life is no different than Nissen fundoplication.","output":"S151: impedance planimetry (EndoFLIP?) after magnetic sphincter augmentation (LINX?) compared to fundoplication"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic with significant mortality risk.

Lecture based learning about psychiatric emergencies is a part of the induction programme for all junior doctors starting their placements however practical learning and practice of skills in this area is not. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue by providing an additional challenge to the delivery of face to face teaching for junior doctors both in clinical and educational settings. METHOD: The author offered a virtual role play based teaching session to two cohorts of Junior Doctors (GP trainees and foundation trainees) who were starting their psychiatric hospital placements at Surrey and Borders Partnership. The virtual sessions were conducted over Microsoft teams. This session had been run once before as face to face teaching (F2F) in January 2019 (N = 9) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this session were compared to data obtained from the virtual sessions in November 2020 and January 2021 (N = 16). Pre and post study questionnaires were administered via Microsoft Forms. Each session lasted 1 hour and consisted of 3 different role play scenarios based around acute psychiatric emergencies. One junior doctor volunteer acted as the patient in each scenario and another volunteer as the doctor. The other participants all acted as observers. Each scenario lasted 10 minutes with ten minutes for feedback from the researcher afterwards using the ALOBA framework. Categorical, ordinal data were collected using a Likert scale and general qualitative feedback was also gathered. RESULT: The questionnaire return rate was 100% for F2F teaching and 57% for virtual teaching. 100% of participants felt that F2F role play was an acceptable way to practice skills in acute psychiatry vs 75% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. 100% of participants found that F2F role play was quite or very effective in improving their confidence and perceived competence in acute psychiatry vs 88% of participants who felt this about virtual role play. CONCLUSION: Virtual role play based learning is an acceptable and effective method in improving the confidence and perceived competence of junior doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient psychiatry but it appears to be less effective than face to face role play based learning. The researcher will act upon the qualitative feedback obtained which suggested ways in which the virtual session could be improved.","output":"Evaluating virtual role play based learning to improve the confidence and competence of Junior Doctors undertaking on call shifts in inpatient Psychiatry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The use of cytokine-blocking agents has been proposed to modulate the inflammatory response in patients with COVID-19. Tocilizumab and anakinra were included in the local protocol as an optional treatment in critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This cohort study evaluated the effects of therapy with cytokine blocking agents on in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and admitted to intensive care unit. Methods: The association between therapy with tocilizumab or anakinra and in-hospital mortality was assessed in consecutive adult COVID-19 patients admitted to our ICU with moderate to severe ARDS. The association was evaluated by comparing patients who received to those who did not receive tocilizumab or anakinra and by using different multivariable Cox models adjusted for variables related to poor outcome, for the propensity to be treated with tocilizumab or anakinra and after patient matching. Results: Sixty-six patients who received immunotherapy (49 tocilizumab, 17 anakinra) and 28 patients who did not receive immunotherapy were included. The in-hospital crude mortality was 30,3% in treated patients and 50% in non-treated (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.56-1.05, p=0.069). The adjusted Cox model showed an association between therapy with immunotherapy and in-hospital mortality (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.19-0.83, p=0.015). This protective effect was further confirmed in the analysis adjusted for propensity score, in the propensity-matched cohort and in the cohort of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation within 2 hours after ICU admission. Conclusions: Although important limitations, our study showed that cytokine-blocking agents seem to be safe and to improve survival in COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU with ARDS and the need for mechanical ventilation.","output":"Effects of cytokine blocking agents on hospital mortality in patients admitted to ICU with acute respiratory distress syndrome by SARS-CoV-2 infection: Retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social media platforms are essential for online scholarly activities in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

At its core, however, the idea of farmers leveraging digital infrastructure in their operations is not new, as agronomic research in this vein has existed for over 30 years.

We then synthesize these in a discussion of the extent to which digital tools are believed to displace farmer decision-making and whether digital agriculture addresses the biophysical heterogeneity of farm landscapes or land itself has become an experimental technologya way to advance the general development of artificial intelligence.

Cancer-specific mobile health apps for patient-related outcomes allow patients to communicate with their clinicians and proactively track their symptoms, which have been shown to improve clinical management and disease outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of LogPAL, a novel iPhone-based mobile health app designed to help HNC survivors track and manage their posttreatment symptoms. METHODS: Patients who completed curative treatment for HNC in the preceding 24 months were recruited from 2 clinical sites within a single institution. Upon enrollment, participants completed a brief sociodemographic survey, downloaded the app onto their iPhone devices, and were asked to complete a series of biweekly questionnaires (based on the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) via the app for an 8-week study period. The primary feasibility endpoints included retention (retaining >80% of the enrolled participants for the duration of the study period), adherence (>50% of the participants completing 100% of the questionnaires over the study period), and usability (a mean system usability scale [SUS] score >68). Additional postintervention questions were collected to assess perceived usefulness, acceptance, and overall satisfaction. RESULTS: Between January and October 2019, 38 participants were enrolled in the study. Three participants dropped out, and 3 were classified as nonusers. The remaining 32 (87%) were eligible for analysis. Their mean age was 57.8 (SD 12.3) years (range 24-77 years, 81% [26/32] male). Overall, 375 of 512 (73.2%) questionnaires were completed, with 17 (53%) of the 32 participants adherent.

SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats as their reservoir hosts over time. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus also exerts its action on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This action causes infections in cells and establishes an infectious disease, COVID-19. Against this viral invasion, the human body starts to activate the innate immune system in producing and releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1?, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and other chemokines, such as G-CSF, IP10 and MCPl, which all develop and increase the inflammatory response. In cases of COVID-19, excessive inflammatory responses occur, and exaggerated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are detected in the serum, resulting in cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. This causes coagulation abnormalities, excessive oxidation developments, mitochondrial permeability transition, vital organ damage, immune system failure and eventually progresses to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. Additionally, the excessive inflammatory responses also cause mitochondrial dysfunction due to progressive and persistent stress. This damages cells and mitochondria, leaving products containing mitochondrial DNA and cell debris involved in the excessive chronic inflammation as damage-associated molecular patterns. Thus, the respiratory infection progressively leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation from acute respiratory distress syndrome, including vascular endothelial cell damage and coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorders. This condition causes central nervous system disorders, renal failure, liver failure and, finally, multiple organ failure. Regarding treatment for COVID-19, the following are progressive and multiple steps for mitigating the excessive inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm in patients. First, administering of favipiravir to suppress SARS-CoV-2 and nafamostat to inhibit ACE2 function should be considered. Second, anti-rheumatic drugs (monoclonal antibodies), which act on the leading cytokines (IL-1?, IL-6) and/or cytokine receptors such as tocilizumab, should be administered as well. Finally, melatonin may also have supportive effects for cytokine release syndrome, resulting in mitochondrial function improvement. This paper will further explore these subjects with reports mostly from China and Europe.","output":"Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Cytokine Storms for More Effective Treatments from an Inflammatory Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that every person aged six months and over receive the influenza vaccine every year.

METHODS This study is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained dataset of patients that underwent EUS-GE at one tertiary referral center. Primary outcome was the LC for EUS-GE defined by the number of cases needed to achieve proficiency and mastery using cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Moving average graphs and sequential time-block analysis were also performed to assess procedural time. Secondary outcomes included efficacy and safety of EUS-GE. RESULTS Eighty-seven consecutive patients underwent EUS-GE, mostly for malignant GOO. For consistency, 14 patients were excluded from analysis (noncautery-assisted EUS-GE 11, surgical anatomy 3). The same endoscopist performed all procedures using the same freehand technique. Technical success was achieved in 68 out of 73 (93%) patients. Immediate AEs occurred in 4 (5.5%) patients, whereas late AEs occurred only in 1 (1%) patient, all managed conservatively or endoscopically.

After the incidence peaked in the township in mid-September 2020, cases started declining even as lockdown restrictions were eased. Objectives A seroprevalence study was conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of the pandemic in this region. Methods We carried out a population-based seroprevalence study for IgG antibodies for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) among 5000 residents 12 years and above selected by the cluster random sampling. We selected 50 clusters in slums, 80 clusters in tenements, and 70 clusters from housing societies. The field work for collection of samples was carried out from October 07 to October 17, 2020. We used kit from Abbott (SARS-CoV-2 IgG), which employs chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. The prevalence of IgG antibodies was expressed as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). These were weighted for areas and cluster effect and further adjusted for test performance. Results The overall seropositivity for IgG was 34.04% (95% CIl 31.3%-36.8%). Slum dwellers had 40.9% positivity rate (95% CI 37.0%-44.7%), those in tenements 41.2% (95% CI 37.7%-44.8%) and people living in housing societies had 29.8% positivity (95% CI 25.8%-33.8%).

Infection of a plant, animal or microorganism with a virus can prevent infection with another virus. This phenomenon is known as viral interference. Viral interference is shown to result from two types of interactions, one taking place at the cell surface and the other intracellularly. Various viruses use different receptors to enter the same host cell, but various strains of one virus use the same receptor. The rate of virusCreceptor binding can vary between different viruses attacking the same host, allowing interference or coinfection. The outcome of the virusCvirusChost competition is determined by the Gibbs energies of binding and growth of the competing viruses and host. The virus with a more negative Gibbs energy of binding to the host cell receptor will enter the host first, while the virus characterized by a more negative Gibbs energy of growth will overtake the host metabolic machine and dominate. Once in the host cell, the multiplication machinery is shared by the competing viruses. Their potential to utilize it depends on the Gibbs energy of growth. Thus, the virus with a more negative Gibbs energy of growth will dominate. Therefore, the outcome can be interference or coinfection, depending on both the attachment kinetics (susceptibility) and the intracellular multiplication machinery (permittivity). The ratios of the Gibbs energies of binding and growth of the competing viruses determine the outcome of the competition.

Presently, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, proper hand washing helps prevent or at least slow the spread of infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. Proper education in hand washing routines requires multilateral action based on young people's knowledge, health behaviors, attitudes, experiences, and motivations. The TANTUdSZ Youth Health Education Program was implemented with students of contemporary teaching faculties of pedagogical and health sciences as well as with secondary school peer helpers and with the involvement of about 3000 pre-school, primary and secondary school students in Hungary in various fields of health development. One of the aims of the studies was to analyze and compare children's hand hygiene knowledge and skills before and after the pedagogical interventions in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational program. The longitudinal survey described in this paper assesses the short- and long-term changes of primary school students' (from class 1 to 4; n = 165) hand washing skills and the attitudinal changes in their health behaviors at three time points. Measurements were performed using a self-completion, anonymous questionnaire and hand-held scanner technology (Semmelweis Scanner), the latter measuring device detecting the purity of different hand areas with quantitative and digital evaluations. The educational intervention was effective in both short and long term compared to input (initial) measurements. However, the results showed a difference in the process of acquiring practical skills. There has been a significant progress in changing attitudes to hand washing. Age-specific health promotion education programs, especially in the pediatric population, should also focus on the long-term preservation of theoretical, practical knowledge, and health behaviors.

Probiotics were employed to prevent and reduce symptoms of infections caused by common viruses, especially respiratory tract viruses, but also for viral digestive infections (such as rotavirus, coronavirus, or norovirus) and other viral infections (such as viruses that cause hepatitis, human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes simplex virus). Different probiotics have been studied to see their possible effect against the abovementioned viruses, among which different Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus can be highlighted. In many cases, mixtures of various probiotic strains were used. Although the results obtained did not show similar results, in most cases, probiotic supplementation improved both barrier and biochemical immune responses, decreased susceptibility to viral infections, and enhanced the effects of concomitant vaccines. Works collected in this review show a beneficial effect of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of different viral infections. We found interesting results related to the prevention of viral infections, reduction of the duration of diseases, and decrease of symptoms.","output":"Probiotic Effects against Virus Infections: New Weapons for an Old War"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To analyze the contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus in cluster epidemics in Guangzhou and provide evidence for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Methods: All the individuals identified to be infected with 2019-nCoV in Guangzhou, including confirmed cases and asymptomatic cases, were included and classified as imported cases and local cases. The first case of each cluster epidemic was defined as index case, and the number of subsequent infections was calculated to evaluate the contagiousness and secondary attack rate of 2019 novel coronavirus in the shortest incubation period of 1-3 days. Results: As of 18 February, 2020, a total of 349 cases of 2019-nCoV infection, including 339 confirmed cases (97.13%) and 10 asymptomatic cases (2.87%) were reported in Guangzhou. There were 68 clusters involving 217 2019-nCoV infection cases (210 confirmed cases and 7 asymptomatic cases). The median number of subsequent infections caused by an index case in a cluster epidemic was 3, among which 2 were confirmed cases and 1 was asymptomatic cases, respectively. The average number of contagiousness was 2.18 in shorted incubation period of 1-3 days (The average number of infected cases were 2.18 cases by the index case in a cluster epidemic), the average infection number in family members was 1.86, and the infection ratio of family member transmission was 85.32% (1.86/2.18). The secondary attack rate in close contacts with shortest incubation period of 1-3 days was 17.12%-18.99%, the secondary attack rate in family members was 46.11%-49.56%. Conclusions: The cluster epidemic of COVID-19 in Guangzhou mainly occurred in families, the contagiousness was high.

METHODS: YouTube search strategy was optimised using a combination of COVID, safety, and surgery terms. Each video was screened by two independent reviewers. The search was conducted on 9 January 2021. The understandability and actionability of videos were evaluated using validated Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Quality of perioperative patient information was determined with a novel 4-point checklist based on recommendations by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The effect of video type on PEMAT and quality scores was assessed with Kruskal-Wallis Test. Scores were correlated with video metrics using Spearman's Rank. RESULTS: The primary search revealed 594 videos. After deduplication and exclusions, 108 materials were analysed. Majority of videos (n = 89) originated from the USA, with only 4 produced in the UK. Hospital-produced videos had the highest understandability scores [median (IQR): 83.33% (18.40%)] and patient testimonies the lowest [55.91% (33.24%)] (p=0.002). Hospital materials were also most actionable [2.25 (2.40)], with news reports scoring lowest [0.0 (0.8)] (p=0.049). Social distancing, preoperative COVID-19 testing, and wearing face masks were mentioned in 46, 41, and 48 videos respectively. Only 9 materials recommended self-isolation before surgery. There was no significant correlation between video metrics (e.g., length) and scores.

Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to measure the overall burden of the pandemic in terms of mortality. As such, excess mortality has received considerable interest since the outbreak of COVID-19 began. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends, correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, or autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be misinterpreted as excess mortality. We propose a novel approach that overcomes the named limitations and draws a more realistic picture of excess mortality. Our approach is based on an established forecasting model that is used in demography, namely, the Lee-Carter model. We illustrate our approach by using the weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our findings show evidence of considerable excess mortality during 2020 in Europe, which affects different countries, age, and sex groups heterogeneously. Our proposed model can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor excess mortality from specific causes of death.","output":"Assessing excess mortality in times of pandemics based on principal component analysis of weekly mortality datathe case of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral disease can cause substantial disruption to service personnel, resulting in debilitation and reduced effectiveness while deployed on military operations.

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of hospital-acquired TB infection due to persistent exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in healthcare settings. The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed an international system of infection prevention and control (IPC) interventions to interrupt the cycle of nosocomial TB transmission. The guidelines on TB IPC have proposed a comprehensive hierarchy of three core practices, comprising: administrative controls, environmental controls, and personal respiratory protection. However, the implementation of most recommendations goes beyond minimal physical and organisational requirements and thus cannot be appropriately introduced in resource-constrained settings and areas of high TB incidence. In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) the lack of knowledge, expertise and practice on TB IPC is a major barrier to the implementation of essential interventions. HCWs often underestimate the risk of airborne Mtb dissemination during tidal breathing. The lack of required expertise and funding to design, install and maintain the environmental control systems can lead to inadequate dilution of infectious particles in the air, and in turn, increase the risk of TB dissemination. Insufficient supply of particulate respirators and lack of direction on the re-use of respiratory protection is associated with unsafe working practices and increased risk of TB transmission between patients and HCWs. Delayed diagnosis and initiation of treatment are commonly influenced by the effectiveness of healthcare systems to identify TB patients, and the availability of rapid molecular diagnostic tools. Failure to recognise resistance to first-line drugs contributes to the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains, including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant Mtb. Future guideline development must consider the social, economic, cultural and climatic conditions to ensure that recommended control measures can be implemented in not only high-income countries, but more importantly low-income, high TB burden settings. Urgent action and more ambitious investments are needed at both regional and national levels to get back on track to reach the global TB targets, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Reducing the risk of tuberculosis transmission for HCWs in high incidence settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of personal protective equipment (PPE) by emergency medical services (EMS) providers requires specific attention, as it takes place in out-of-hospital unsecured settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate which PPE gown was less contaminating during doffing procedures in an EMS setting. Six well-trained healthcare worker (HCW) subjects tested 4 different gowns: (1) surgical gowns (SG), (2) full body coveralls (FBC), (3) self-made alternative PPEs (SMP), and (4) non-surgical isolation gowns (NSIG). An invisible tracer was sprayed on the gown after donning each subject. After doffing, each HCW was photographed under UV lights to show areas of fluorescent contamination on their clothes. The number, size, and intensity level of contaminated areas were noted, as well as observational deviation from the procedure and doffing time. In addition, the subjects were asked to take a questionnaire about their perception of the level of comfort, ease of doffing, and overall safety for each gown. RESULTS: Despite a well-trained team of HCW subjects, contamination while doffing was observed with every type of PPE gown, and with each HCW subject. All body areas were contaminated at least once, except the face. Contamination was more frequent while doffing FBCs. On the other hand, the removal of SG was found to be the least contaminating. The mean doffing time was significantly shorter with SG 1:29 and longer with FBC 2:26 (p=0.005). CONCLUSION: Results of this study converge towards the selection of surgical gowns over other types of PPE gowns, which met both contamination criteria as well as staff appreciation in this context.

METHODS: We utilized a high-speed camera (FASTCAM SA-3, Photron Limited) capable of recording small, transparent droplets with a black background and high-brightness lighting. The obtained video files were analyzed using post-processing software. We divided the 20 models into the control (a spray bottle model and a cough model) and experimental groups (digestive endoscopy models). The sedative, proficiency of digestive endoscopy and the amount of gas injected were modulated to change the level of released droplets. RESULTS: For the control groups, droplets were clearly observed using a high-speed camera. However, no droplet larger than 10 m in size was observed in the experimental groups. Furthermore, the changes in the sedative, proficiency of digestive endoscopy, and amount of gas injected did not affect droplet formation.

Any interference with this process has profound effect on viral replication and propagation. Pinpointing the structures adapted by the FSE and associated structural transformations involved in frameshifting has been a challenge. Using our graph-theory-based modeling tools for representing RNA secondary structures, RAG (RNA-As-Graphs), and chemical structure probing experiments, we show that the 3-stem H-type pseudoknot (3_6 dual graph), long assumed to be the dominant structure, is replaced by a different, HL-type 3-stem pseudoknot (3_3) as more residues, in particular the slippery sites 7 residues, are considered.

Vaccines have been developed in unprecedented time and quantifying levels of hesitancy towards vaccination among the general population is of importance. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using large nationally representative samples (n1000) to examine the percentage of the population intending to vaccinate, unsure, or intending to refuse a COVID-19 vaccine when available. Generic inverse meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to pool estimates and examine time trends. PubMed, Scopus and pre-printer servers were searched from January-November, 2020. Registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020223132). Findings: Twenty-eight nationally representative samples (n = 58,656) from 13 countries indicate that as the pandemic has progressed, the percentage of people intending to vaccinate and refuse vaccination have been decreasing and increasing respectively. Pooled data from surveys conducted during June-October suggest that 60% (95% CI: 49% to 69%) intend to vaccinate and 20% (95% CI: 13% to 29%) intend to refuse vaccination, although intentions vary substantially between samples and countries (I2 > 90%). Being female, younger, of lower income or education level and belonging to an ethnic minority group were consistently associated with being less likely to intend to vaccinate.

Candida species are well known to cause infections not only in our mouth, skin, and vagina, but they are also a frequent cause of life-threatening hospital bloodstream infections. The morphological and developmental pathways of Candida have been studied extensively, providing insight into the fungus development. Candida albicans is known to be the most pathogenic species responsible for a variety of infections in humans. Conventional anti-fungal drugs, mainly azoles drugs available in the market, have been used for years developing resistance in C. albicans. Hence, the production of new anti-fungal drugs, which require detailed molecular knowledge of fungal pathogenesis, needs to be encouraged.

The current number of diagnosed cases is ~422 million, expected to reach ~640 million by 2040. Type 2 diabetes, which constitutes ~95% of the cases, is characterized by insulin resistance and a progressive loss of ?-cell function. Despite intense research efforts, no treatments are yet able to cure the disease or halt its progression. Since all existing animal models of type 2 diabetes have serious drawbacks, one is needed that represents the complete pathogenesis, is low cost and non-obese, and can be developed relatively quickly. The aim of this study was to evaluate a low-cost, non-obese model of type 2 diabetes engendered by administering a daily high dose of tacrolimus (an immunosuppressant) to Wistar rats for 4 weeks. The biochemical and antioxidant markers were measured at basal and after the 4-week tacrolimus treatment. At week 4, the values of these parameters closely resembled those observed in human type 2 diabetes, including fasting blood glucose at 141.5 mg/dL, blood glucose greater than 200 mg/dL at 120 min of the glucose tolerance test, blood glucose at varied levels in the insulin tolerance test, and elevated levels of cholesterol and triglyceride. The tacrolimus treatment produced hypoinsulinemia and sustained hyperglycemia, probably explained by the alteration found in pancreatic ?-cell function and morphology.

It has also given rise to fears of an imminent economic crisis and recession. Social distance, self-isolation, and travel restrictions have led to a reduction in the workforce across all economical sectors and have led to a loss of many jobs. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured goods has decreased. On the other hand, the need for medical supplies has increased significantly. The food sector is also facing increased demand as a result of panic buying and storing food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarize the socioeconomic effects of COVID-19 on the various aspects of the world economy.

Especially the Malaysian paddy industry as country imports 30% of its overall consumption from different parts of the world. The real price of rice triplicating for the consumers, which was alarming for nations in this pandemic situation. The Government of Malaysia introduced the National Agrofood Policy 2011C2020 (NAP4) in 2010 as a guidance document for the implementation of agricultural sector development programs and projects in Malaysia. The NAP4 s 10-year term is to be finished by the end of 2020. Several sectors demonstrate substantial success after approximately 8 years of introduction, while the other classes often lag behind the goal and progress quite slowly. Agricultural sector performance is affected by many problems and challenges. In acknowledgment of the poor success of this field, the Ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Based Industry has launched new approaches, policies, and programs that can change the agricultural sector more rapidly. The new direction is aimed at ensuring national food security and boosting farm and revenues. The authorized government agency needs to revise the policy formulation where Malaysia needs to set stages to revolutionize and modernize the rice farming to address the problem faced by the paddy sector in this pandemic situation to adopt GF.

Evidence suggests continuity of care in England is declining. AIM To confirm reports of declining continuity of care, explore differences in decline according to practice characteristics, and examine associations between practice populations or appointment provision and changes in continuity of care. DESIGN AND SETTING Longitudinal design on GP Patient Survey data reported annually in June or July from 2012 to 2017, whereby the unit of analysis was English general practices that existed in 2012. METHOD Linear univariable and bivariable multilevel models were used to determine decline in average annual percentage of patients having a preferred GP and seeing this GP 'usually' according to practicelevel continuity of care, rural/urban location, and deprivation. Associations between percentage of patients having a preferred GP or seeing this GP usually and patients' experiences with the appointment system and practice population characteristics were modelled. RESULTS In 2012, 56.7% of patients had a preferred GP, which had declined by 9.4 percentage points (pp) (95% CI = -9.6 to -9.2) by 2017. Of patients with a preferred GP, 66.4% saw that GP 'usually' in 2012; this had declined by 9.7 pp (95% CI = -10.0 to -9.4) by 2017. This decline was visible in all types of practices, irrespective of baseline continuity, rural/urban location, or level of deprivation. At practice level, an increase over time in the percentage of patients reporting good overall experience of making appointments was associated with an increase in both the percentage of patients having a preferred GP and those able to see that GP 'usually'. CONCLUSION Patients reported a steady decline in continuity of care over time, which should concern clinicians and policymakers. Ability of practices to offer patients a satisfactory appointment system could partly counteract this decline.","output":"Is continuity of primary care declining in England?

All patients had a positive answer in the \\"Epidemiology of prolapse and incontinence\\" questionnaire (EPIQ, question number 35) and also had a POPQ 2nd degree. The primary outcome was the subjective success rate, measured by a negative answer to the Q35 of EPIQ: \\"Do you have a sensation that there is bulge in vagina or that something is falling out from your vagina\\" and also by rating their symptoms improvement by the \\"Patient Global Impression of Improvement\\". The secondary outcome was the objective success rate assessed by pelvic examination: cure was considered when POPQ <2nd degree in all vaginal compartments at 6 and 12 months.

This study examined the barriers and financial impact associated with SDD in a contemporary cohort of patients undergoing elective AF ablation. METHODS A single center retrospective review was conducted of the 249 first case-of-the-day outpatient AF ablations performed in 2019 to evaluate the proportion of patients that could have undergone SDD. Barriers to SDD were defined as any intervention that prevented SDD by 8PM. The financial impact of SDD was based on savings from avoidance of the overnight hospital stay and revenue related to management of chest pain facilitated by a vacant hospital bed. RESULTS SDD could have occurred in 157 patients (63%) without change in management and in up to 200 patients (80%) if avoidable barriers were addressed. Barriers to SDD included non-clinical logistical issues (43%), prolonged post-procedure recovery (42%) and minor procedural complications (15%). On multivariate analysis, factors associated with barriers to SDD included increasing age (p = 0.01), left ventricular ejection fraction 35% (p = 0.04), and severely dilated left atrium (p = 0.04). The financial gain from SDD would have ranged from $1,110,096 (assuming discharge of 63% of eligible patients) to $1,480,128 (assuming 80% discharge) over the course of a year. CONCLUSIONS Up to 80% of patients undergoing outpatient AF ablation were amenable to SDD if avoidable delays in care had been anticipated. Based on reduced hospital operating expenses and increased revenue from management of individuals with chest pain, this would translate to a financial savings of $1.5 million.

We investigated factors influencing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG antibody levels and time to seronegativation during the follow-up of severe and critically ill patients. We retrospectively reviewed serological evaluations drawn during the follow-up of severe or critical laboratory-proven COVID-19 patients hospitalized at a large academic hospital. Specific IgG titers were measured using a chemiluminescent assay targeting anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid protein IgG. The influence of time, demographic factors, clinical and paraclinical characteristics, and COVID-19 therapeutics on IgG levels were assessed through linear regression using a mixed-effect model, and delay until IgG negativation through a Weibull regression model. The cohort included 116 patients with a total of 154 IgG measurements drawn at a median of 79 days after diagnosis. IgG antibodies were increased with age (p = 0.005) and decreased significantly over time (p = 0.0002). Using elapsed time and age as covariates, we demonstrated higher IgG levels in patients with a higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.0026) and lower IgG levels in immunocompromised patients (p = 0.032). A high BMI was further found to delay and immunodeficiency to hasten significantly seronegativation, whereas no significant effect was observed with corticosteroids.

Given the drastic changes to resident roles, expectations, and responsibilities, many valuable lessons regarding resident concerns and wellness can be garnered from this unique experience. METHODS A voluntary survey was sent to 179 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency program directors to distribute to their residents. Questions focused on issues that may have occurred, program's responses, and expectations of programs during the pandemic. RESULTS In total, 507 residents completed the survey, and 10% reported being deployed to do nonorthopaedic-related care, with junior classes being more likely to receive this assignment (P < 0.001). The greatest concern for respondents was the possibility of getting family members sick (mean = 3.89, on scale of 1-5), followed by personally contracting the illness (mean = 3.38). DISCUSSION The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in numerous changes and novel sources of adversity for the orthopaedic surgery resident.

However, the etiological factors and prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers are not well known. Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) is a receptor of tachykinin peptide substance P (SP) and has a role in various pathological conditions, cancers, but its association with miscarriages and significance as a clinicopathological parameter are not studied. Accordingly, the present study aimed to clarify the localization and expression for NK-1R in human retained products of conception (POC). The role of NK-1R is not known in miscarriages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NK-1R expression was assessed in POC and normal placental tissues by immunohistochemistry. Three- to four-micrometer-thin sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were used for this purpose. Tissues were processed and then immunohistochemically stained with NK-1R antibody. Brain tissue was used as control for antibody. Protein expression was evaluated using the nuclear labeling index (%). Tissues were counterstained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB), and microscopy was performed at 10, 20, and 40 magnifications. RESULTS: Ten human POC tissues and 10 normal placental tissues were studied by immunohistochemistry to demonstrate the localization of NK-1R. The expression of NK-1R protein was high in all the cases of both groups. NK-1R expression showed no notable differences among different cases of miscarriages as well as normal deliveries at full term regardless of the mothers age and gestational age at which the event occurred. Statistically, no difference was found in both groups, which is in agreement with our hypothesis and previous findings. CONCLUSION: The expression of NK-1R was similar in all the cases, and it was intense. It shows that dysregulation of NK-1R along with its ligand SP might be involved in miscarriages and also involved in normal delivery. Our results provide fundamental data regarding this anti-NK-1R strategy. Thus, the present study recommends that SP/NK-1R system might, therefore, be considered as an emerging and promising diagnostic and therapeutic strategy against miscarriages. Hence, we report for the first time the expression and localization of NK-1R in POC. We suggest NK-1R antagonist in addition to the immunoglobulins and human chorionic gonadotropin to diagnose and treat spontaneous miscarriages.","output":"Elevated Neurokinin-1 Receptor Expression in Uterine Products of Conception Is Associated With First Trimester Miscarriages"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought significant changes in daily activities, such as, washing hands and wearing masks regularly During a pandemic, it is crucial to follow the recommendations from physicians and experts for mental and physical well-being Also, it is important to know the latest information on the pandemic situation Although smartwatches are very popular for monitoring and assisting daily life activities, existing systems are not directed towards coping up with the \\"new normal\\"life during pandemic Towards achieving this goal, we present CoPED, a comprehensive voice cognitive assistant on a smartwatch that reminds and assists people for different daily activities during the pandemic and beyond ? 2020 ACM","output":"CoPED: A smartwatch based voice cognitive assistant for the pandemic and beyond: Demo abstract"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak required a rapid adjustment to an unfamiliar and unique situation.

The National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) focuses on late phase treatment trials, while the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) conducts early phase treatment trials. We report findings on the experience and adaptations of these networks during COVID-19. Methods: Using 2019 and 2020 accrual data, we analyzed changes in accrual levels and demographics. We also evaluated changes in trial activation numbers and timelines. In July 2020, we surveyed 255 investigators from academic and community sites to assess changes in research practices and get feedback on modified processes implemented by NCI to address trial conduct during the pandemic. Results: Accrual across the NCTN and ETCTN fell significantly in midMarch 2020, dropping from a weekly average of 307 patients in February to 169 the week of March 23-29. Accrual began to recover in June and July but did not return to pre-pandemic levels until September. Accrual in November and December 2020 followed the patterns seen in 2019, with short-term drops around major holidays. Non-White participants were enrolled to NCTN and ETCTN trials at similar monthly rates throughout 2019 and 2020, with slightly higher overall enrollment in 2020 (23.7% vs. 22.7%). New trials continued to be developed and activated throughout 2020. Between 2017 and 2019, an average of 71 trials were activated per year (NCTN = 46, ETCTN = 25), compared to 84 activated in 2020 (NCTN = 58, ETCTN = 26). The average time to trial activation was similar or slightly longer in 2020 compared to 2019. The investigator survey yielded 111 responses (43.5% response rate). 43% of respondents' sites paused enrollment to phase 1 trials during the pandemic, compared to 18% for phase 3 trials. Many sites temporarily stopped opening new trials and processing specimens. Sites were more likely to keep enrolling to trials offering clear potential benefit and pause complex trials that required more patient contact. Respondents attributed some of the decline in accrual to a reduction in overall patient volume, increased patient concerns, and reduced research staff on site. Respondents were asked to rate the usefulness of modified trial processes NCI put in place during the pandemic. Telehealth was rated most useful (avg. 4.6/5), followed by shipping oral IND agents to enrolled patients (4.5/5), remote informed consent (4.2/5), coordinating care with local providers (3.9/5), and remote auditing (3.7/5). Conclusions: The cancer trials community has an opportunity to learn from working through the challenges of COVID-19. NCI will seek to continue and expand on modifications to clinical trial processes that have the potential to improve operational efficiency, reduce cost, and help bring trials to more patients.","output":"NCI's national treatment trial networks: Experience and adaptations during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused several disruptions in personal and collective lives worldwide. The uncertainties surrounding the pandemic have also led to multi-faceted mental health concerns, which can be exacerbated with precautionary measures such as social distancing and self-quarantining, as well as societal impacts such as economic downturn and job loss. Despite noting this as a \\"mental health tsunami,\\" the psychological effects of the COVID-19 crisis remains unexplored at scale. Consequently, public health stakeholders are currently limited in identifying ways to provide timely and tailored support during these circumstances. ObjectiveOur work aims to provide insights regarding peoples psychosocial concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic by leveraging social media data. We aim to study the temporal and linguistic changes in symptomatic mental health and support expressions in the pandemic context. MethodsWe obtain [~]60M Twitter streaming posts originating from the U.S. from 24 March-24 May 2020, and compare these with [~]40M posts from a comparable period in 2019 to attribute the effect of COVID-19 on peoples social media self-disclosure. Using these datasets, we study peoples self-disclosure on social media in terms of symptomatic mental health concerns and expressions of support. We employ transfer learning classifiers that identify the social media language indicative of mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, stress, and suicidal ideation) and support (emotional and informational support). We then examine the changes in psychosocial expressions over time and language, comparing the 2020 and 2019 datasets. ResultsWe find that all of the examined psychosocial expressions have significantly increased during the COVID-19 crisis - mental health symptomatic expressions have increased by [~]14%, and support expressions have increased by [~]5%, both thematically related to COVID-19. We also observe a steady decline and eventual plateauing in these expressions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have been due to habituation or due to supportive policy measures enacted during this period. Our language analyses highlight that people express concerns that are very specific to and contextually related to the COVID-19 crisis. ConclusionsWe studied the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 crisis by using social media data from 2020, finding that peoples mental health symptomatic and support expressions significantly increased during the COVID-19 period as compared to similar data from 2019. However, this effect gradually lessened over time, suggesting that people adapted to the circumstances and their \\"new normal\\". Our linguistic analyses revealed that people expressed mental health concerns regarding personal and professional challenges, healthcare and precautionary measures, and pandemic-related awareness.

The purpose of the present study was to assess and compare the incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in nursing home (NH) residents and staff, to identify viruses involved in ARI and to correlate viral etiology with clinical manifestations of ARI. METHODS: The prospective surveillance study was accomplished in a medium-sized NH in Slovenia (central Europe). Ninety NH residents and 42 NH staff were included. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from all participants at enrollment (December 5th, 2011) and at the end of the study (May 31st, 2012), and from each participant that developed ARI within this timeframe. Molecular detection of 15 respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal swab samples was performed. RESULTS: The weekly incidence rate of ARI in NH residents and NH staff correlated; however, it was higher in staff members than in residents (5.9 versus 3.8/1,000 person-days, P = 0.03), and was 2.5 (95 % CI: 1.36C4.72) times greater in residents without dementia than in residents with dementia. Staff members typically presented with upper respiratory tract involvement, whereas in residents lower respiratory tract infections predominated. Respiratory viruses were detected in 55/100 ARI episodes. In residents, influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and human metapneumovirus were detected most commonly, whereas in NH staff rhinovirus and influenza A virus prevailed. 38/100 ARI episodes (30/56 in residents, 8/44 in staff) belonged to one of three outbreaks (caused by human metapneumovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, respectively). NH residents had higher chances for virus positivity within outbreak than HN staff (OR = 7.4, 95 % CI: 1.73C31.48, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: ARI are common among NH residents and staff, and viruses were detected in a majority of the episodes of ARI. Many ARI episodes among NH residents were outbreak cases and could be considered preventable.

However, the layer-dependent, anisotropic properties of the organ have not been investigated using human tissue, particularly in regard to its viscoelastic and stress-softening behaviour. Restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic meant that fresh human tissue was not available for dissection. Therefore, in this study, the layer-specific material properties of the human oesophagus were investigated through ex vivo experimentation of the embalmed muscularis propria layer. For this, a series of uniaxial tension cyclic tests with increasing stretch levels were conducted at two different strain rates. The muscular layers from three different cadaveric specimens were tested in both the longitudinal and circumferential directions. The results displayed highly nonlinear and anisotropic behaviour, with both time- and history-dependent stress-softening. The longitudinal direction was found to be stiffer than the circumferential direction at both strain rates. Strain rate-dependent behaviour was apparent, with an increase in strain rate resulting in an increase in stiffness in both directions. Histological analysis was carried out via various staining methods; the results of which were discussed with regard to the experimentally observed stress-stretch response. Finally, the behaviour of the muscularis propria was simulated using a matrix-fibre model able to capture the various mechanical phenomena exhibited, the fibre orientation of which was driven by the histological findings of the study.","output":"Experimental investigations of the human oesophagus: anisotropic properties of the embalmed muscular layer under large deformation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective. Interprofessional team-based care has become the standard for practicing clinical pharmacists. However, it is difficult to simulate every aspect of this environment in the didactic curriculum. The purpose of this study was to determine if the addition of standardized patients (SP) or interprofessional student teams with SPs, to the use of a simulated electronic health record (EHR) improved student knowledge retention and perceptions.Methods. This was a prospective cohort study assessing three cohorts of first-year student pharmacists in pharmacy skills laboratory activities that occurred in 2018, 2019, and 2021. The primary objective of the study was to compare knowledge retention at 1-month related to the case material between groups. Each year an element of simulated experience was added onto the previous year's case. In 2018, students completed the case using the EHR web application only. In 2019, an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with SPs was combined with the previous year's experience. In 2021, student physician assistants were added to the 2019 experience. Case scores and student perceptions were also compared between groups.Results. Of the 260 potential participants, 238 students were included in the primary analysis. Significant improvement was demonstrated in one-month knowledge retention assessments with the addition of interprofessional team-based care and SPs. Mean knowledge retention assessment scores were 63.8%, 71.7%, and 76.1% respectively. There was also significant improvement in student perceptions.Conclusion.

The early recognition of rat pregnancy and confirmation of the exact embryonic day are vital. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of maternal weight at the time of conception to its increase throughout gestation, aiming to develop a mathematical model, which can be used for the determination of the exact day of pregnancy, set the threshold, and monitor pregnancy from the onset. We studied a total of 173 Wistar rats with a mean body weight of 238.22  34.9 g. After 72 h at the male's cages, we considered as Day 0 (D0) the day in which a copulatory plug or sperm was found during the vaginal smear examination. After that period the female animals were transferred into their cages, and weight monitoring started 14 days (D14) after D0, until parturition. Based on the statistical analysis, there is a correlation between maternal body weight at D0 and maternal body weight from D14 to D19. Moreover, the average weight gain from D14 to D19 is positively correlated to initial female body weight, while there is no correlation between each pregnant animal's weight from D14 to D19 and litter size. A mathematical model was developed as a tool for the verification of the day of pregnancy. In conclusion, continuous monitoring of maternal weight after D14 can be a reliable method for the recognition of pregnancy and determination of the exact gestational day.","output":"Maternal weight as an alternative determinant of the gestational day of Wistar rats housed in individually-ventilated cages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel coronavirus of zoonotic origin (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been recognized in patients with acute respiratory disease. COVID-19 causative agent is structurally and genetically similar to SARS and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The drastic increase in the number of coronavirus and its genome sequence have given us an unprecedented opportunity to perform bioinformatics and genomics analysis on this class of viruses. Clinical tests like PCR and ELISA for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. However, these techniques are expensive and not readily available for point-of-care (POC) applications. Currently, lack of any rapid, available, and reliable POC detection method gives rise to the progression of COVID-19 as a horrible global problem. To solve the negative features of clinical investigation, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of coronaviruses and describe various amplification assays, sensing, biosensing, immunosensing, and aptasensing for the determination of various groups of coronaviruses applied as a template for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. All sensing and biosensing techniques developed for the determination of various classes of coronaviruses are useful to recognize the newly immerged coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. Also, the introduction of sensing and biosensing methods sheds light on the way of designing a proper screening system to detect the virus at the early stage of infection to tranquilize the speed and vastity of spreading. Among other approaches investigated among molecular approaches and PCR or recognition of viral diseases, LAMP-based methods and LFAs are of great importance for their numerous benefits, which can be helpful to design a universal platform for detection of future emerging pathogenic viruses.

RESTORE2 is endorsed by the British Geriatric Society as the preferred tool for use in a care home setting. It incorporates: recognition of soft-signs; NEWS2 (National Early Warning Score 2); and SBAR-D (Situation Background Assessment Recommendation-Decision). Implementing RESTORE2 required a series of change interventions in a mesosystem environment in intermediate care bed-based rehabilitation setting in an independent care home. METHODS: The Flow Coaching Academy 5Vs Framework was used. A vision of CHAIN of CARE was developed (Care Home Assessment of Intervention Need and Communicate Act Review Evaluate). Stake-holder mapping was undertaken. A Sinek Circle distilled intentions. A global aim led to specific aims and informed driver diagrams. Problems and risks were mapped out with an Ishikawa diagram. A high-level process map of future state was and cross-functional swim-lane chart for RESTORE2 use were devised. A clinical value compass map was used to consider outcomes. PDSA cycles were used. RESULTS: The FCA Framework methodology, albeit without the ability to undertake Big Room meetings due to the COVID19 pandemic restrictions, enabled the development of a care-home tailored Treatment Escalation Plan; an electronic template Nursing Handover; Multidisciplinary Safety Brief; training of all nursing team in RESTORE2; and use of NEWS2 for all residents in the intermediate care setting.

Hydroxychloroquine has been suggested as a possible treatment; however, it is associated with multiple adverse reactions. We report a rare case of a patient with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis with Stevens-Johnson syndrome due to hydroxychloroquine. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is characterized by acute onset of a generalized rash that is pustular and erosive in nature, affecting limbs; trunk; face; and, less often, mucosal membranes. Although rare, it is important to be mindful of this side effect because the diagnosis is often delayed, and the disease has the potential to be life-threatening. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old American woman presented to our hospital with a painful, rapidly spreading rash. Its morphologic features included erythema multiforme-like lesions with extensive skin sloughing in various regions of the head, neck, and trunk and mucosal involvement. Her Nikolsky sign was negative, and she had no evidence of lesions on areas of skin trauma. Four weeks prior, she had been initiated on hydroxychloroquine for a presumed diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Three punch biopsies of the head and neck area revealed subcorneal pustules consistent with acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Treatment began with high doses of methylprednisolone, leading to only minimal improvement of existing areas and ongoing spread to new areas. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated, at which point disease stability was achieved. The patient's rash ultimately resolved, as did her cutaneous pain and pruritus. CONCLUSIONS: Among many potential adverse reactions involving hydroxychloroquine, cutaneous side effects are varied and can lead to significant morbidity or even death. The drug is currently being investigated in a multitude of trials for coronavirus disease2019 treatment, prevention, and prophylaxis after exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis is a rare side effect of hydroxychloroquine, and even fewer cases demonstrate histologic evidence of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis while clinically presenting with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Patients who develop Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis require best supportive care with aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement and prevention of further breakdown of the skin barrier. With the potential of widespread hydroxychloroquine use, it is important that providers be aware of its potential severe adverse drug reactions.","output":"Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome overlap due to hydroxychloroquine: a case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A syphilis outbreak among Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (respectfully referred to as Aboriginal) has resulted in almost 4000 notifications by 2020, with several congenital syphilis cases and infant deaths. Outbreak control efforts became coordinated under a National enhanced test and treat response in 2017. We evaluated the impact of these efforts and of expansion of testing interventions on syphilis prevalence. METHODS: We developed an individual-based mathematical model of infectious syphilis transmission among young heterosexual Aboriginal people aged 15C34 years living in and moving between regional and remote areas, and we assessed the impact of existing and hypothetical outbreak control responses on syphilis prevalence. RESULTS: The increased testing coverage achieved through the response (from 18% to 39% over 2011C2020) could stabilize the epidemic from 2021. To return to pre-outbreak prevalence (<0.24%) by 2025, testing coverage must reach 60%. The addition of annual community-wide screening, where 30% of youth in communities are tested over 6 weeks, would reduce prevalence to the pre-outbreak level within 4 years. If testing coverage had been scaled-up to 60% at the start of outbreak in mid-2011, the outbreak would have been mitigated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that to control the syphilis outbreak, the response needs to be delivered to enable the maximum coverage of testing to be reached in the shortest time to reduce the prevalence to pre-outbreak levels.

The mice received caudal vein injection of baicalein (25 mg/kg) on 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 15th days. We showed that baicalein administration significantly attenuated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and restored cardiac function. The protective effect of baicalein against cardiac hypertrophy was also observed in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes treated with ISO (10 M). In cardiomyocytes, ISO treatment markedly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited autophagy, which were greatly alleviated by pretreatment with baicalein (30 M). We found that baicalein pretreatment increased the expression of catalase and the mitophagy receptor FUN14 domain containing 1 (FUNDC1) to clear ROS and promote autophagy, thus attenuated ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, we revealed that baicalein bound to the transcription factor FOXO3a directly, promoting its transcription activity, and transactivated catalase and FUNDC1. In summary, our data provide new evidence for baicalein and FOXO3a in the regulation of ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy.

After a mean follow-up time of 13.1 months (median, 12.7 months), a total of 108 primary end point events occurred: 52 events (20.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 14.8-25.9]) in the usual care plus antimicrobial therapy group and 56 events (18.4 events per 100 patient-years [95% CI, 13.2-23.6]) in the usual care group, with no significant difference between groups (adjusted HR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.71-1.53; P = .83]. There was no statistically significant interaction between the effect of the prespecified antimicrobial agent (co-trimoxazole vs doxycycline) on the primary end point (adjusted HR, 1.15 [95% CI 0.68-1.95] in the co-trimoxazole group vs 0.82 [95% CI, 0.46-1.47] in the doxycycline group; P = .66). Serious adverse events occurring at 5% or greater among those treated with usual care plus antimicrobials vs usual care alone included respiratory events (16.5% vs 10.0%) and infections (2.8% vs 6.6%); adverse events of special interest included diarrhea (10.2% vs 3.1%) and rash (6.7% vs 0%). Conclusions and Relevance Among adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the addition of co-trimoxazole or doxycycline to usual care, compared with usual care alone, did not significantly improve time to nonelective respiratory hospitalization or death.

Based on a single-center experience during the course of one decade, we present data on safety and efficacy of previous MT devices compared with modern stent retriever and suction thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighty-one patients (29 women, 52 men, mean age 61.5 years, range 17-90) with angiographically confirmed BAO that had been treated by MT between 2001 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. Patients in group 1 (n = 60) had been treated between 2001 and 2008 with different devices available at that time. Patients in group 2 (n = 21) had been treated by modern stent retriever or local suction devices between 2008 and 2011. Recanalization rate, needle to recanalization time, procedure-related complications, and distal embolization of thrombotic material were recorded and compared. RESULTS Recanalization rates of 95% were high in both groups. Procedure-related dissection (n = 5) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 9) occurred in group 1 but not in group 2 (p < 0.016). Needle-to-recanalization time was less than half in group 2 compared with group 1 (54.6 vs. 132.3 min, p < 0.01). Frequency of distal embolization was comparable in both groups (47%). CONCLUSION High recanalization rates have been achieved since the introduction of MT in BAO. However, modern stent retriever and suction devices allow for safer and more rapid recanalization compared with previous MT devices.","output":"Mechanical thrombectomy in basilar artery thrombosis: technical advances and safety in a 10-year experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019.

METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial involving releases of wMel-infected A. aegypti mosquitoes for the control of dengue in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We randomly assigned 12 geographic clusters to receive deployments of wMel-infected A. aegypti (intervention clusters) and 12 clusters to receive no deployments (control clusters). All clusters practiced local mosquito-control measures as usual. A test-negative design was used to assess the efficacy of the intervention. Patients with acute undifferentiated fever who presented to local primary care clinics and were 3 to 45 years of age were recruited. Laboratory testing was used to identify participants who had virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) and those who were test-negative controls. The primary end point was symptomatic VCD of any severity caused by any dengue virus serotype. RESULTS: After successful introgression of wMel into the intervention clusters, 8144 participants were enrolled; 3721 lived in intervention clusters, and 4423 lived in control clusters. In the intention-to-treat analysis, VCD occurred in 67 of 2905 participants (2.3%) in the intervention clusters and in 318 of 3401 (9.4%) in the control clusters (aggregate odds ratio for VCD, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.15 to 0.35; P = 0.004). The protective efficacy of the intervention was 77.1% (95% CI, 65.3 to 84.9) and was similar against the four dengue virus serotypes. The incidence of hospitalization for VCD was lower among participants who lived in intervention clusters (13 of 2905 participants [0.4%]) than among those who lived in control clusters (102 of 3401 [3.0%]) (protective efficacy, 86.2%; 95% CI, 66.2 to 94.3). CONCLUSIONS: Introgression of wMel into A. aegypti populations was effective in reducing the incidence of symptomatic dengue and resulted in fewer hospitalizations for dengue among the participants.

Material: and methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients included in this study who were admitted to ICU between March 18 th 2020 until August 30 th 2020. All patients were analyzed under the same protocol at Hospital Alem?o Oswaldo Cruz, S?o Paulo, Brazil. Several factors were considered, such as: age, gender, symptoms before hospitalization, comorbidities, vasopressors use, radiological findings and use of high flow nasal catheter . The results were presented using the hazard ratio and its respective 95% confidence intervals. For statistical inferences, p <0.05 was adopted for all analysis. Results: : The median age was 72 years, 64,2 years (53-74) for patients who were discharged, and 79.9 years (71.4-88.4) for those deceased (p<0.001). The most common comorbidities associated were: systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes, thyroid disease, cardiovascular and kidney disease.

An inductive, interpretive, and naturalistic approach allowed the researcher to study these phenomena in their natural setting i.e., the community. This qualitative study used 5 focus groups with 17 people and employed thematic data analysis to identify key themes. All participants in the HLD speak from a personal perspective irrespective of any professional background. It transpired that 16 respondents worked in health and social care, which subsequently became noteworthy in the findings. Three key themes were identified: (a) feeling emotionally safe enough to have such sensitive conversations is vital; (b) participating in the HLD process increases the confidence of those participants who worked in health and social care, to undertake ACP conversations and (c) planning ahead is a complex, staged process rather than a single record-making event. The Covid-19 pandemic crisis reinforced the need to upstream ACP initiatives such as the HLD, as the norm for everyone, since all of us will one day die. It is recommended that the HLD be incorporated within ACP training given that the experiential nature of it and the use of groups was reported to build confidence in facilitating ACP conversations.

This time period likely represents the largest volume of telehealth visits in the United States health care history. Telehealth presents unique challenges within each subspecialty, and pediatric otolaryngology is no different. This retrospective review was designed to evaluate our division of pediatric otolaryngologys experience with telehealth during the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All telehealth and face-to-face visits for the month of April 2020 completed by the Pediatric Otolaryngology Division were reviewed. A survey, utilizing both open-ended questions and Likert scaled questions was distributed to the 16 pediatric otolaryngology providers in our group to reflect their experience with telehealth during the 1-month study period. RESULTS: In April, 2020 our outpatient clinic performed a total of 877 clinic visits compared to 2260 clinic visits in April 2019. A total of 769 (88%) were telehealth visits. Telemedicine with video comprised 523 (68%) and telephone only comprised 246 (32%). There were 0 telehealth visits in April 2019. Interpretive services were required in 9.3% (N = 211) clinic visits in April 2019 and 7.5% (N = 66) of clinic visits in April 2020.

It is unknown how this affected the deaf population, a sociolinguistic minority group that continues to face communication and healthcare barriers. The survey's objective was to describe the deaf participants' experiences with telehealth visits. METHODS A 28-item online survey, available in American Sign Language and English, was developed and disseminated between November 2020 and January 2021. Ninety-nine deaf participants responded. Descriptive statistics were performed to assess the participant's virtual health care use, experiences, and communication approaches. RESULTS Seventy-five percent of respondents used telehealth at least once in the past 12 months (n = 74; age = 37.6  14.5 years). Of those who used telehealth, nearly two-thirds experienced communication challenges (65.3%; n = 49). Half of the participants reported having to connect via a video relay service that employs interpreters who maintain general certification instead of a remote interpreter with specialized health care interpreting certifications for video visits with their health care providers (n = 37) and a third of participants reported needing to use their residual hearing to communicate with their providers (n = 25). CONCLUSION Standard protocols for health care systems and providers are needed to minimize the burden of access on deaf patients and ensure virtual visits are equitable.

In ovo technology, through which a tiny quantity of material is injected into the birds egg/embryo during incubation, offers a novel alternative for delivering bioactive compounds to an embryo before hatching. Recent experiments from various researchers showed the benefits of in ovo feeding technology on the chicken body weight, feed conversion ratio, and pectoral meat yield. Using early-life programming via the in ovo technique with different feed additives may be possible to avoid selected the metabolic disorders, poor immunity, and pathogen resistance. ABSTRACT: The chicken gut is the habitat to trillions of microorganisms that affect physiological functions and immune status through metabolic activities and host interaction. Gut microbiota research previously focused on inflammation; however, it is now clear that these microbial communities play an essential role in maintaining normal homeostatic conditions by regulating the immune system. In addition, the microbiota helps reduce and prevent pathogen colonization of the gut via the mechanism of competitive exclusion and the synthesis of bactericidal molecules. Under commercial conditions, newly hatched chicks have access to feed after 36C72 h of hatching due to the hatch window and routine hatchery practices. This delay adversely affects the potential inoculation of the healthy microbiota and impairs the development and maturation of muscle, the immune system, and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Modulating the gut microbiota has been proposed as a potential strategy for improving host health and productivity and avoiding undesirable effects on gut health and the immune system. Using early-life programming via in ovo stimulation with probiotics and prebiotics, it may be possible to avoid selected metabolic disorders, poor immunity, and pathogen resistance, which the broiler industry now faces due to commercial hatching and selection pressures imposed by an increasingly demanding market.","output":"Managing Gut Microbiota through In Ovo Nutrition Influences Early-Life Programming in Broiler Chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An exponential growth model was fitted to critical care admissions from multiple surveillance databases to determine likely COVID-19 case numbers and growth in the United Kingdom from 16 February - 23 March 2020, after which a national lockdown occurred.

First, based on the traditional SIR infectious disease model, we introduce a positive feedback mechanism associated with the vaccination rate, and consider the time delay from antibody production to antibody disappearance after vaccination. We establish an UVaV model for COVID-19 vaccination with a positive feedback mechanism and time-delay. Next, we verify the existence of the equilibrium of the formulated model and analyze its stability. Then, we analyze the existence of the Hopf bifurcation, and use the multiple time scales method to derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation, further determining the direction of the Hopf bifurcation and the stability of the periodic solution of the bifurcation. Finally, we collect the parameter data of some countries and regions to determine the reasonable ranges of multiple parameters to ensure the authenticity of simulation results. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the correctness of the theoretical results. We also give the critical time for controllable widespread antibody failure to provide a reference for strengthening vaccination time. Taking two groups of parameters as examples, the time of COVID-19 vaccine booster injection should be best controlled before 38.5 weeks and 35.3 weeks, respectively. In addition, study the impact of different expiration times on epidemic prevention and control effectiveness. We further explore the impact of changes in vaccination strategies on trends in epidemic prevention and control effectiveness. It could be concluded that, under the same epidemic vaccination strategy, the existence level of antibody is roughly the same, which is consistent with the reality.","output":"Dynamic Analysis of a COVID-19 Vaccination Model with a Positive Feedback Mechanism and Time-Delay"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) with preexisting diabetes and cardiovascular metabolic diseases have higher fatality rate.

In the present study, we seek to understand how indoor soundscape related to university students self-rated health in Bulgaria around the time that the country was under a state of emergency declaration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between 17 May and 10 June 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 323 students (median age 21 years; 31% male) from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Self-rated health (SRH) was measured with a single-item. Participants were asked how frequently they heard different types of sounds while at home and how pleasant they considered each of those sounds to be. Restorative quality of the home (the being away dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale) was measured with a single-item. A priori confounders and effect modifiers included sociodemographics, house-related characteristics, general sensitivity to environmental influences, and mental health. Our analysis strategy involved sequential exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multivariate linear and ordinal regressions, effect modification tests, and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: EFA supported grouping perceived sounds into three distinct factorsmechanical, human, and nature sounds. Regression analyses revealed that greater exposure to mechanical sounds was consistently associated with worse SRH, whereas no significant associations were found for human and nature sounds. In SEM, exposure to mechanical sounds related to lower restorative quality of the home, and then to poorer SRH, whereas nature sounds correlated with higher restorative quality, and in turn with better SRH. Conclusions: These findings suggest a role of positive indoor soundscape and restorative quality for promoting self-rated health in times of social distancing.","output":"University Students Self-Rated Health in Relation to Perceived Acoustic Environment during the COVID-19 Home Quarantine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Unfortunately, the first name and family names of all authors were incorrectly swapped in the original publication.

We aimed to quantify the prevalence of mask-related cutaneous side effects and the differences between CE and non-CE approved masks. METHODS: In this multicenter prospective observational study conducted from March 20, 2020 to May 12, 2020(during and after quarantine), patients attending emergency departments for a dermatological consult were clinically assessed and their masks were inspected to detect CE marks and UNI (Italian National Unification Entity) norms. Patients with history of facial dermatoses or under current treatment for facial dermatoses were excluded. RESULTS: We enrolled 412 patients (318 during quarantine and 94 after quarantine). CE-approved masks were observed 52.8% vs. 24.5%, whilst subsets of non-CE approved masks were 9.7% vs. 14.9% (Personal protective equipment (PPE)-masks), 16.4% vs. 12.8% (surgical masks [SM]), and 21.1% vs. 47.9%(non-PPE) and (non-SM masks), respectively during and after quarantine. Remarkably, non-CE-approved masks resulted in patients displaying a statistically significant higher incidence of facial dermatoses and irritant contact dermatitis compared to CE-approved masks, and these differences were mainly driven by non-PPE non-SM masks. Comparing quarantine and after quarantine periods, no statistically significant differences were found for CE-approved masks, whilst differences were detected in non-CE-approved masks regarding incidence of facial dermatoses (P<0.0001)and irritant contact dermatitis (P=0.0041). CONCLUSIONS: Masks are essential to prevent COVID-19 but at the same time higher awareness regarding mask specifications should be promoted in the general population. Non-PPE and non-SM masks should undergo more rigorous testing to prevent the occurrence of cutaneous side effects and future patients' lawsuit damages.","output":"Masks use and facial dermatitis during COVID-19 outbreak: is there a difference between CE and non-CE approved masks?

Fluid therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of shock and influences the outcomes directly. Excess or insufficient fluid administration is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Prediction of fluid responsiveness means that a hemodynamic variable is used to determine how likely a patient is to respond to fluid bolus with a significant increase in their cardiac output. Depending on the response to fluids, patients are either responders or non-responders. Clinicians often rely on static indices of preload, like central venous pressure and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, as a guide for fluid therapy. Unfortunately, whilst easy for use, these indices are of minimal value as predictors of fluid responsiveness. More recent research highlights hemodynamic variables related to cardiopulmonary interactions during mechanical ventilation. These dynamic indices, viz. stroke volume variation and pulse pressure variation, show a significantly better predictive value. To maximize the predictive value of dynamic indices, several conditions must be fulfilled. Another method for prediction of fluid responsiveness is represented by the functional hemodynamic tests: a heterogenous group of bedside tests for preload responsiveness. Fluid challenges remain popular, although repetitive use can be harmful. Hemodynamic tests, like passive leg raising or end-expiratory occlusion, modify the preload without fluid administration. Regardless of the test used, monitoring of cardiac output is needed to evaluate the heart's response to changes in preload.

This was typified by the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the critical knowledge and data gaps associated with novel Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19). We sought to create an adaptive, living data mart containing detailed clinical, epidemiologic, and outcome data from COVID-19 patients in our healthcare system. If successful, the approach could then be used for any future outbreak or disease. Methods: From 3/13/2020 onward, demographics, comorbidities, outpatient medications, along with 75 laboratory, 2 imaging, 19 therapeutic, and 4 outcome-related parameters, were manually extracted from the electronic medical record (EMR) of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. These parameters were entered on a registry featuring calculation, graphing tools, pivot tables, and a macro programming language. Initially, two internal medicine residents populated the database, then professional data ors populated the registry. Clinical parameters were developed with input from infectious diseases and critical care physicians and using a modified COVID-19 worksheet from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Registry contents were migrated to a browser-based, metadata-driven electronic data capture software platform. Eventually, we developed queries and used various business intelligence (BI) tools which enabled us to semi-automate data ingestion of 147 clinical and outcome parameters from the EMR, via a large U.S. hospital-based, service-level, all-payer database. Statistics were performed in R and Minitab. Results: From March 13, 2020 to May 17, 2021, 549,691 SARS-CoV-2 test results on 236,144 distinct patients, along with location, admission status, and other epidemiologic details are stored on the cloud-based BI platform. From March 2020 until May 2021, extraction of clinical-epidemiologic parameter had to be performed manually. Of those, 543 have had >/=75 parameters fully entered in the registry. Ten clinical characteristics were significantly associated with the need for hospital admission. Only one characteristic was associated with a need for ICU admission. Use of supplemental oxygen, vasopressors and outpatient statin were associated with increased mortality. Initially, 0.5hrs -1.5 hours per patient chart (approximately 450-575 person hours) were required to manually extract the parameters and populate the registry. As of May 17, 2021, semi-automated data ingestion from the U.S. hospital all-payer database, employing user-defined queries, was implemented. That process can ingest and populate the registry with 147 clinical, epidemiologic, and outcome parameters at a rate of 2 hours per 100 patient charts. Conclusion: A living COVID-19 registry represents a mechanism to facilitate optimal sharing of data between providers, consumers, health information networks, and health plans through technology-enabled, secure-access electronic health information. Our approach also involves a diversity of new roles in the field, such as using residents, staff, and the quality department, in addition to professional data extractors and the health informatics team. Initially, due to the overwhelming number of infections that continues to accelerate, and the labor/time intense nature of the project, only a small fraction of all patients with COVID-19 had all parameters entered in the registry. Therefore, this report also offers lessons learned and discusses sustainability issues, should others wish to establish a registry. It also highlights the registry's local and broader public health significance. Beginning in June 2021, whole-genome sequencing results such as lineages harboring important viral mutations, or variants of concern will be linked to the clinical meta-data.","output":"The Value of a Regional 'Living' Covid-19 Registry and the Challenges of Keeping It Alive"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"?sszefoglal.

SUMMARY INTRODUCTION COVID-19 pandemic imposed sudden increase in hospital admissions, thus medical systems needed to reorganize entire hospitals quite often. Quick and efficient training is of outmost importance. Virtual reality team training is a promising tool for newly organized hospital units' staff. OBJECTIVE Our goal was to present the usefulness and applicability of virtual simulation exercises for training of field hospital personnel and to evaluate the adaptability of these created and tested exercise packs for urgent staff training of COVID-19 hospitals. METHOD Three prototypes of virtual reality exercises were assessed through two test courses. XVR simulation software was used to create virtual environments. Evaluation of exercise applicability and utility was performed by anonymous questionnaires. Statistical data-processing was performed using contingency table and chi-square tests. RESULTS 76 trainees from eight countries participated in the two pilot courses. 63.9% of the participants stated that the method is suitable for conducting such exercises, but needs further development. Its technical use is \\"easy enough\\" to learn (59.7%) and provides an interactive (90.32%) and realistic (45.0%) working environment. DISCUSSION Virtual reality is applicable to train field hospital staffs for real missions. The created virtual exercise packages are easily adaptable, both in content and structure, to workshops dedicated for quick training of specific COVID-19 temporary medical facility's personnel. CONCLUSION Virtual reality is a promising educational tool that can complement the expensive and laborious field exercises, with comparable training efficiency. These virtual reality experiences may become real professional memories and create swiftly a secure and efficient professional milieu.

CASE REPORT A 17-year-old girl presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting and a 1-day history of diarrhea. She had a history of daily marijuana use and lived with her grandmother who was presumed to be positive for COVID-19, based on symptoms. Her admission laboratory results were unremarkable except for pyuria, which was suspicious for urinary tract infection. The patient's nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Owing to abdominal pain, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained, which was concerning for pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. A CT scan of the thorax confirmed the findings. A contrast-enhanced barium esophagogram was performed and was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for observation and supportive care.

METHODS: From 12 to 21 December 2020, we recruited 1720 healthcare workers from 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Bhutan. The self-administrated survey collected information on willingness to vaccinate, perception of COVID-19, vaccine concerns, COVID-19 risk profile, stigma, pro-socialness scale, and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: More than 95% of the healthcare workers surveyed were willing to vaccinate. These respondents were more likely to perceive the pandemic as severe, consider the vaccine safe, have less financial concerns, less stigmatization regarding the vaccine, higher pro-socialness mindset and trust in health authorities. A high perceived pandemic risk index, low vaccine harm index and high pro-socialness index were independent predictors in multivariable analysis.

Methods A retrospective review of the patients who underwent SPA laparoscopy (SPA Group) or laparotomy (Laparotomy Group) for suspected BOT was performed. Surgical outcomes, including the rates of iatrogenic spillage of tumor contents, and oncological outcomes, such as recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), were compared between the two groups. Correlation between intraoperative frozen section analysis and permanent pathology results was also assessed. Results A total of 178 patients underwent surgical treatment for suspected large BOT. Among them, 105 patients with a mean tumor diameter of 20.9  6.5 cm underwent SPA laparoscopy, and the other 73 patients, with a mean tumor diameter 20.2  5.9 cm, underwent laparotomy. The mean operation time did not differ between the two groups (99.1  41.9 min for SPA Group vs. 107.3  35.7 min for Laparotomy Group, p = 0.085). There was no difference in the occurrence of iatrogenic spillage of tumor contents between the groups either (11.4% in the SPA Group vs. 6.8% in the Laparotomy Group, p = 0.381). However, the postoperative complication rates were significantly higher in the Laparotomy Group compared with SPA Group (16.4% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.025). The surgical approach was not associated with the misdiagnosis rates of frozen section analysis (19% in the SPA Group vs. 26% in the Laparotomy Group, p = 0.484).

In this study, we found that CD147 expression was primarily increased in mouse and human atherosclerotic lesions that were rich in macrophages and could be upregulated by ox-LDL. High-throughput compound screening indicated that ox-LDL-induced CD147 upregulation in macrophages was achieved through PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling. Genetic deletion of macrophage CD147 protected against foam cell formation by impeding cholesterol uptake, probably through the scavenger receptor CD36. The opposite effect was observed in primary macrophages isolated from macrophage-specific CD147-overexpressing mice. Moreover, bioinformatics results indicated that CD147 suppression might exert an atheroprotective effect via various processes, such as cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes, LDL and plasma lipoprotein clearance, and decreased platelet aggregation and collagen degradation.

Hematoma growth, SD occurrence, and cortical blood flow changes were tracked. During early hemorrhage (0-4 h), 17 out of 38 mice developed SDs, which always originated from the hematoma. No SD was detected at late time points (8-52 h). Neither hematoma size, nor peri-hematoma perfusion were associated with SD occurrence. Further, arguing against ischemia as a trigger factor, normobaric hyperoxia did not inhibit SD occurrence. Instead, SDs always occurred during periods of rapid hematoma growth, which was two-fold faster immediately preceding an SD compared with the peak growth rates in animals that did not develop any SDs. Induced hypertension accelerated hematoma growth and resulted in a four-fold increase in SD occurrence compared with normotensive animals.

Therefore, we proposed developing an all-in-one surveillance system with face detection, recognition, and face tracking capabilities. The surveillance system integrated three modules: Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) face detector, VGGFace2 face recognition, and Discriminative Single-Shot Segmentation (D3S) tracker. We train new face mask data for face recognition and tracking. This system utilizes the Raspberry Pi camera and processes the frame on the cloud as a mobile sensor approach. The proposed method was successfully implemented and got competitive detection, recognition, and tracking results under an unconstrained surveillance camera. ? 2021.

The authors examined whether leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) shares genetic and environmental variances between spelling, essay writing, reading aloud, reading comprehension, and mathematics in early adolescence. Moreover, they investigated whether genetic polymorphisms associated with physical activity behavior affect these academic skills. METHODS: Participants were 12-year-old Finnish twins (n = 4356-4370 twins/academic skill, 49% girls). Academic skills were assessed by teachers, and LTPA was self-reported. Polygenic scores for physical activity behavior were constructed from the UK Biobank. Quantitative genetic modeling and linear regression models were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The trait correlations between LTPA and academic skills were significant but weak (r = .05-.08). The highest trait correlation was found between LTPA and mathematics. A significant genetic correlation was revealed between LTPA and essay writing (rA = .14). Regarding polygenic scores of physical activity, the highest correlations were found with reading comprehension, spelling, and essay writing, but these results only approached statistical significance (P values = .09-.15).

Perioperative outcome measures of each group were recorded, including operation duration, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative flatus pass time, postoperative complications, drainage duration, hospital cost and length of hospital stay. Surgeries were successfully achieved in 60 patients. The operative duration of group A was significantly shorter than that of group B. However, group B was significantly superior over Endo-GIA group in terms of the intraoperative blood loss, postoperative flatus pass time, drainage duration, length of hospital stay and total cost of hospital stays. No significant differences were observed in postoperative fever, ascites and hyperamylasemia between two groups. Both of these two approaches for LS are safe and feasible.

Until the summer of 2020, only one region, Daegu-Gyeongbuk, had a significant number of infections, traced to a religious sect. This allows us to estimate the causal effect of the outbreak on the labor market using difference-in-differences. We find that a one per thousand increase in infections caused a 2 to 3 percent drop in local employment in the early spring. We also find that employment losses caused by local outbreaks in the absence of lockdowns were (i) mainly due to reduced hiring by small establishments, (ii) concentrated in the accommodation/food, education, real estate, and transportation industries, and (iii) worst for economically vulnerable workers who are less educated, young, in low-wage occupations, and on temporary contracts, even controlling for industry effects. These patterns are similar to what we observed in the US and UK: The unequal effects of COVID-19 were the same with or without lockdowns.

Methods: Over a two-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state. Results: Thirty-five children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was <30% in one third; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). Thirty-one/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology.

In this study, the membrane compartments involved in the envelopment of ASF virus were investigated. A monoclonal antibody recognizing p73, the major structural protein of ASF virus, was generated to analyze the binding of p73 to membranes during the assembly of the virus. Approximately 50% of the intracellular pool of p73 associated with membranes as a peripheral membrane protein. Binding was rapid and complete within 15 min of synthesis. Subcellular membrane fractionation showed that newly synthesized p73 molecules cosedimented with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and remained associated with the ER during a 2-h chase. A similar distribution on gradients was recorded for p17, a structural membrane protein of ASF virus. The results suggested that the ER was involved in the assembly of ASF virus. A protease protection assay demonstrated a time-dependent envelopment of the membrane bound, but not cytosolic, pool of p73. Envelopment of p73 took place 1 h after binding to membranes and was completed 1 h before the first detection of p73 in virions secreted from cells. Envelopment was unaffected by brefeldin A and monensin, drugs that block membrane transport between the ER and Golgi.

The challenges associated with imaging infected patients have resulted, to date, in a paucity of metabolic imaging studies of patients with severe COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, it remains unclear if any abnormal metabolic events are taking place in patients who have recovered from COVID-19. PURPOSE: To use [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F] FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to measure metabolic activity in inflamed organs of patients convalescing post severe COVID-19 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was performed in seven convalescing patients who were recovering from severe COVID-19 infection in February 2020. Prior to [18F] FDG PET/CT, all patients had received two consecutive negative results of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Clinical intake including symptoms, treatment, laboratory test results, and follow-up was performed. The PET/CT images of COVID-19 patients were compared to a control group of patients that were matched for age and sex. RESULTS: Residual pulmonary lesions were present in all patients and maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), average standard uptake value (SUVavg), maximum CT intensity (CTmax), and average CT intensity (CTavg) were all significantly greater than in the control group (p < 0.01 for all). In addition, SUVmax and SUVavg were significantly greater in the mediastinal lymph node and liver, and SUVmax was significantly greater in the spleen, of COVID-19 patients compared with controls (p < 0.05 for all). For the spleen, SUVmax (r2 = 0.863, p = 0.003) and SUVavg (r2 = 0.797, p = 0.007) were significantly correlated with blood lymphocyte count, and which was below the normal range in five of the seven (71.4%) patients convalescing post severe COVID-19 infection.

BACKGROUND Patients with high PR on clopidogrel have a greater incidence of adverse ischemic events after stent implantation, whereas low PR may increase bleeding. Due to limited sample size, previous studies have not been able to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics that may confound the relationship of PR and outcomes. METHODS In the ADAPT-DES study, routine platelet function testing (VerifyNow) was performed following clopidogrel loading. To characterize the independent association between PR and clinical events, patients were stratified into quintiles of P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). RESULTS The PRU medians of the 5 quintiles were 57, 130, 187, 244, and 317 (most to least inhibited). There was a monotonic association between successively higher PRU quintiles and stent thrombosis, whereas for clinically relevant bleeding, the greatest risk occurred in the lowest PRU quintile, with similar risks across the 4 higher quintiles. These relationships remained significant in fully adjusted multivariable analyses (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for stent thrombosis in Q5 versus Q1: 2.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17 to 4.59; p = 0.02; adjusted HR for clinically relevant bleeding in Q5 versus Q1: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.77; p < 0.001). However, there were no significant independent associations between the level of PRU and mortality. CONCLUSIONS In this large observational study, increasing PRU was associated with a monotonic increase in stent thrombosis, whereas bleeding risk was confined to the lowest PRU quintile, suggesting an optimal therapeutic window of platelet inhibition at moderately inhibited PRU. However, there was no demonstrable threshold effect for PRU and mortality in adjusted analyses, perhaps due to the offsetting impact of bleeding and ischemia across the spectrum of platelet inhibition.

These reactions are sometimes termed cytokine storm. PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4i) have anti-inflammatory properties with approved indications in inflammatory skin and joint diseases as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, multiple animal models demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4i in respiratory models of viral and bacterial infection and also after chemically mediated lung injury. The rationale for PDE4i use in COVID-19 patients comes from the multimodal mechanism of action with cytokine, chemokine, and other key pathway inhibition all achieved with an excellent safety profile. We highlight how PDE4i could be an overlooked treatment from the rheumatologic and respiratory armamentarium, which has potential beneficial immune-modulation for treating severe COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storms. The proposed use of PDE4i is also supported by age-related immune changes in inflammation severity in PDE4i modifiable pathways in primate coronavirus disease. In conclusion, over-exuberant anti-viral immune responses in older patients with COVID-19 may pose a substantial risk to patient survival and mitigation against such hyper-inflammation with PDE4i, especially with anti-viral agents, is a strategy that need to be pursed, especially in older patients.","output":"Rationale for Evaluating PDE4 Inhibition for Mitigating against Severe Inflammation in COVID-19 Pneumonia and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"From the Introduction: Effective surveillance of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19 [coronavirus disease 2019] poses unique challenges Public health agencies have had to significantly increase their disease surveillance capacities to be able to rapidly identify new COVID-19 patients, follow up with their contacts, monitor disease trends over time, and identify hot spots of disease transmission, often with limited testing Despite this increase in COVID-19 surveillance capacities, gaps remain It's essential, therefore, to outline the main goals of COVID-19 surveillance and address key challenges to its effective implementation COVID-19 (Disease);Public health surveillance;Epidemiology","output":"COVID-19: The CIDRAP Viewpoint Part 5: SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19 Surveillance: A National Framework"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The effect of the curfew due to the pandemic of Covid-19 virus on the levels of air pollution in the historic center of Quito was evaluated with a focus on tropospheric ozone (O3) During the curfew period the daily O3 mean concentration increased by 96%, 109% and 95% in comparison to the concentrations for the same period in the years 2017, 2018 and 2019 This increase is mainly explained by considerable reduction in NOx emissions, thus there was little titration of ozone accumulated in the city environment due to its shallow boundary layer by NO, reaching its maximum concentration at midday Among studied pollutants that influence O3 formation (CO, NO2, PM2 5) during the curfew the contaminant that showed the greatest reduction in the mean concentration compared to three previous years was NO2, followed by CO and PM2 5 The daily O3 8-hour mean concentrations during the curfew both on weekdays and weekends were lower than the limit values These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of secondary pollutants such as O3 under strict measures of control of primary pollutant emissions ?

Plate experiment was used to detect the clone formation ability. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis rate. Transwell experiment was used to detect cell invasion ability. Dual luciferase reporter experiment detects the targeting relationship between circ-SFMBT2 and miR-7-5p, and between miR-7-5p and ADAM10. Transplanted tumor experiment in nude mice assessed the effect of knocking down circ-SFMBT2 on the growth of transplanted tumor. Immunohistochemical experiments were performed to detect the positive rates of ADAM10 and Ki67 proteins in transplanted tumor tissues. RESULTS: The expression levels of circ-SFMBT2 and ADAM10 were increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, while decreased the expression of miR-7-5p. circ-SFMBT2 was negatively correlated with miR-7-5p, while miR-7-5p was negatively correlated with ADAM10.

In the current study, we present a new forecasting model to estimate and forecast the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the upcoming ten days based on the previously confirmed cases recorded in China. The proposed model is an improved adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using an enhanced flower pollination algorithm (FPA) by using the salp swarm algorithm (SSA). In general, SSA is employed to improve FPA to avoid its drawbacks (i.e., getting trapped at the local optima). The main idea of the proposed model, called FPASSA-ANFIS, is to improve the performance of ANFIS by determining the parameters of ANFIS using FPASSA. The FPASSA-ANFIS model is evaluated using theWorld Health Organization (WHO) official data of the outbreak of the COVID-19 to forecast the confirmed cases of the upcoming ten days.

Although the humoral response to messenger RNA vaccines was shown to be impaired in KTR, there is a lack of data regarding the antibody response to inactivated vaccines. We investigated the antibody response to two consequent doses of the inactivated SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccine (CoronaVac; Sinovac Biotech, China). METHODS: A total of 118 patients from two centers were included. The levels of anti\\\\SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 immunoglobulin\\\\G antibodies against the nucleocapsid and spike antigens were determined with enzyme immunoassay (DIA.PRO; Milano, Italy) before the vaccine and one month after the second dose of the vaccine. Thirty\\\\three patients were excluded due to antibody positivity in the serum samples obtained before vaccination. RESULTS: Eighty\\\\five patients, 47 of whom were female, with a mean age of 46  12, were included in the statistical analysis. The maintenance immunosuppressive therapy comprised tacrolimus (88.2%), mycophenolate (63.6%), and low\\\\dose steroids (95.3%) in the majority of the patients. After a median of 31 days following the second dose of the vaccine, only 16 (18.8%) patients developed an antibody response. The median (IQR) antibody level was 52.5 IU/ml (21.5C96). Age (48 vs. 38, p = .005) and serum creatinine levels (1.14 vs. 0.91, p = .04) were higher in non\\\\responders and were also found to be independently associated with the antibody response (odds ratio (OR): 0.93, p = 0.012 and 0.15, p = 0.045, respectively) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: In this study, we found the antibody response to the inactivated vaccine to be considerably low (18.8%) in KTR. Increased age and impaired renal function were associated with worse antibody response. Based on the knowledge that mRNA vaccines yield better humoral responses, this special population might be considered for additional doses of mRNA vaccination.","output":"Antibody response to two doses of inactivated SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 vaccine (CoronaVac) in kidney transplant recipients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) is a single single-strand RNA genome approximately 26 - 32 kb in size Out of the seven coronaviruses, three HCoVs (Human CoVs) have been discovered that causes severe pneumonia such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and recently recognized SARS-CoV-2, which possesses varying degrees of lethality worldwide and happened to be bioterrorism in terms of the recent outbreak through human-to-human transmission from China to all over the world Epidemiological and Clinical study on SARS-COV-2 have recently been reported world-wide but lack of data on prognosis factors including effective medicine or vaccine are yet to be clinically approved to prevent this infectious disease Human pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 bind to their target cells through ACE2, which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels The difference in distribution, maturation, and functioning of viral receptors could be considered as a possible reason for the genetic heterogeneity of ACE2, and age and sex related difference in the incidence of the disease such as, the positive correlation with ACE2 expression and age including the severity of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 Since the ACE2 location in X chromosome, therefore, the males presumable might have more morbidity and mortality by SARS-CoV-2 than females due to sex-based immunological differences like greater observable circulating level of ACE2 in males or else it may be due to the patterns of life style variables such as prevalence of smoking among the males Additionally, the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 1 (ACE1) is characterized by a genetic insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in intron 16, which is associated with alterations in circulating and tissue concentrations of ACE, where the study reported as D allele is associated with a reduced expression of ACE2 Nevertheless, studies from different states of Indian population on ACE I/D gene polymorphism shows higher frequency of I allele which might explain the lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Indian population and consequently be subject matter of research of SARS-CoV-2 on epidemiological and public health issues [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Asian Journal of Medical Sciences is the property of Manipal Colleges of Medical Sciences and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"COVID 19: An Epidemiological and Host Genetics Appraisal"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has now affected the entire globe which was first surfaced in China in December 2019.

METHODS Ninety-three patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 admitted in Ezhou Central Hospital from February to April in 2020 were analyzed. Among them, 43 patients were selected from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of critical type of COVID-19, and 50 cases of common type were selected from the Department of Respiratory Medicine. The baseline data, blood routine test and biochemical indexes of the patients were collected on the first day of admission. NLRs of the patients were calculated, and COX survival analysis according to the NLR 4-category method was performed. The patients' outcomes were analyzed with receiver operating curves (ROCs). The patients were divided into two groups according to NLR cutoff value for comparison of the biochemical indexes. Based on the patients' outcomes, NLR cutoff value classification and clinical classification, multiple binary logistics regression was performed to screen the key variables and explore their significance in COVID-19. RESULTS The NLR four-category method was not applicable for prognostic evaluation of the patients. The cut-off value of NLR for predict the prognosis of COVID-19 was 11.26, with a sensitivity of 0.903 and a specificity of 0.839; the laboratory indicators of the patients with NLR < 11.26 were similar to those in patients of the common type; the indicators were also similar between patients with NLR11.26 and those with critical type COVID-19. NLR, WBC, NEUT, PCT, , BUN, TNI, BNP, and LDH had significant effects on the clinical classification and outcome of the patients (P < 0.05); Cr, Ca, PH, and Lac had greater impact on the outcome of the patients (P < 0.05), while Na, PCO2 had greater impact on the clinical classification of the patients (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS NLR can be used as an important reference for clinical classification, prognostic assessment, and biochemical abnormalities of COVID-19. Patients of critical type more frequently have bacterial infection with more serious inflammatory reactions, severer heart, lung and kidney damages, and much higher levels of  and LDH than those of the common type.

Aim: To assess how university students experienced the sudden shift to online teaching after closure of campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: Students in Public Health Nutrition answered questionnaires two and 12 weeks (N = 79: response rate 20.3% and 26.6%, respectively) after the lockdown in Norway on 12 March 2020 and participated in digital focus group interviews in May 2020 (mixed methods study). Findings and discussion: Two weeks into the lockdown, 75% of students reported that their life had become more difficult and 50% felt that learning outcomes would be harder to achieve due to the sudden shift to online education. Twelve weeks into the lockdown, the corresponding numbers were 57% and 71%, respectively. The most pressing concerns among students were a lack of social interaction, housing situations that were unfit for home office purposes, including insufficient data bandwidth, and an overall sense of reduced motivation and effort. The students collaborated well in digital groups but wanted smaller groups with students they knew rather than being randomly assigned to groups. Most students agreed that pre-recorded and streamed lectures, frequent virtual meetings and student response systems could improve learning outcomes in future digital courses. The preference for written home exams over online versions of previous on-campus exams was likely influenced by student's familiarity with the former. The dropout rate remained unchanged compared to previous years. Conclusion: The sudden shift to digital teaching was challenging for students, but it appears that they adapted quickly to the new situation. Although the concerns described by students in this study may only be representative for the period right after campus lockdown, the study provide the student perspective on a unique period of time in higher education.

To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the United States, we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated effects of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence of widespread sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the United States and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.","output":"Coast-to-Coast Spread of SARS-CoV-2 during the Early Epidemic in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, cancer centers must implement effective measures to protect patients and staff from infection with the novel coronavirus.

Herein, we present a geriatric case with an unusually elevated D-dimer level. CASE SUMMARY: An 82-year-old woman, admitted to the ward with a diagnosis of chronic heart failure, was noted to have a remarkably elevated D-dimer level, beyond the qualified range (> 100 mg/L), utilizing the Innovating D-dimer for Sysmex CS-5100 System?. However, no evidence, including clinical symptoms, radiographic evidence of thromboembolic disease, and parallel fibrinogen degradation product values, suggested that this patient was at high risk of thrombopenia. To confirm the discrepancy, a series of approaches including sample dilution, re-analysis via alternative methods, and sample treatment with blockage of specific heterophilic antibodies were performed. A remarkable disappearance of the elevated D-dimer values was observed in the samples after they were subjected to these approaches (4.49, 9.42, 9.06, and 12.58 mg/L, respectively). This confirmed the presence of heterophilic antibodies in this case. In addition, a reduction in cardiac output due to the presence of cardiac failure could also be responsible for the existence of a hypercoagulable state in this case. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the presence of heterophilic antibodies should be considered when an elevated D-dimer value is not in conformity with the clinical evidence, and a viral infection should be considered when interference by a heterophilic antibody exists.","output":"Clinical laboratory investigation of a patient with an extremely high D-dimer level: A case report"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"UNLABELLED WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY ADD?: Radiological imaging is heavily relied on for follow up after renal ablative therapy. We show that while this is largely reliable, there are quantifiable false negative and false positive findings. A non-involuting zone of ablation should be considered for multisite-directed core biopsies even in the absence of detectable enhancement. OBJECTIVE To evaluate our experience with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for renal masses and to report on clinical, radiological and post-RFA biopsy results. PATIENTS AND METHODS The study collected clinical, radiological and pathological data from 150 consecutive patients who were treated with RFA of a renal mass between 2002 and 2008 at a tertiary referral centre. Post-ablation biopsies were performed in patients with non-involuting lesions or suspicion of recurrence on imaging. Comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Renal malignancy was found in 72.1% of patients based on the initial diagnostic biopsy. Median tumour size was 2.6 cm, 22.7% of patients had a solitary kidney, and most were central tumours. The mean follow-up period was 40.1 month. There was no recurrence in 96.7% of the entire cohort. Cancer-specific survival for 106 patients with sporadic, localized, biopsy proven renal malignancy was 100% at 38.5 months. Biopsies were obtained in 43 patients for a median of 21 months after RFA. Among 38 patients who had biopsy for non-involuting, non-enhancing zones of ablation, three (7.9%) were positive. CONCLUSIONS Short-term cancer-specific survival after RFA remains excellent and most cases are successful based on a combination of imaging and post-ablation biopsies performed almost 2 years after treatment. There were four out of 150 (2.7%) patients who had recurrences with tissue confirmation; one of these patients was detected on imaging and three (2%) were radiologically occult.

Materials and methods: This study was conducted in Elazig Fethi sekin city hospital during January 2021 to March 2021. Medical history of male patients who were admitted to urology outpatient clinics were taken and physical examinations were performed. Morning serum fasting glucose, total testosterone and prolactine levels were measured. IIEF-5 questionnaire was filled by the patients. Two groups were formed as pED and control group. Both groups filled the CAS questionnaire and the results were compared statistically. Results: IIEF-5 scores were 15.867.53 and 24.260.82 in the pED group and the control group, respectively. The CAS scores were 7.532.02 and 0.400.62 in the pED group and in the control group, respectively. There was a significant difference between these findings. There was a significant negative correlation between IEF-5 scores and CAS scores. (p*=0.00) IIEF-5 scores were significantly lower in the pED group compared to the control group. (p*=0.00) CAS scores were significantly higher in the pED group compared to the control group.

Data were collected through visual oral examinations and a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, and logistic regressions were applied. In total, 322 participants with a mean (SD) age of 49.3 (13.5) years completed the study. Among them, 71.1% were male, 48.1% were aboriginal, and 88.2% were single. The prevalence of oral cancerous lesions was 2.4%, which was higher than the recorded prevalence in Canada (0.014C1.42: 10,000) and in Alberta (0.011C1.13: 10,000). The clinical examinations indicated that 176 (54.7%) participants had clinical inflammatory changes in their oral mucosa. There was a significant association between clinical inflammatory oral lesions and oral cancerous/precancerous lesions (p < 0.001). Simple logistic regression showed that the risk of the presence of oral cancerous/precancerous lesions was two times higher in participants living in a shelter or on the street than in those living alone (OR = 2.06; 95% CI: 1.15C3.82; p-value: 0.021).

Within 2 d after contact-exposed poults were removed from the presence of PEMS-infected poults and returned to their respective treatment rooms to infect experimental poults, the experimental poults began to huddle together and show signs of the disease. When separated from the huddle, body temperatures of exposure poults were depressed significantly. Body temperatures decreased progressively through 8 d after exposure with a maximum depression of 2 C and returned to a normal level at 18 d after PEMS exposure. Similar decreasing patterns in serum glucose, inorganic phosphorus, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine were observed, with maximum decreases in these serum constituents being found between 8 and 13 d after PEMS exposure. There were significant correlations among decreasing body temperatures, decreasing serum constituents, and mortality in the PEMS-exposed poults. Daily mortality rates associated with PEMS began at 6 d and peaked at 9 d after PEMS exposure. Mortality rates decreased from 9 to 15 d after experimental PEMS exposure.

We fit time series models to historical data and, from March 2020 to September 2021, quantified changes in encounters relative to baseline. RESULTS: The nationwide lockdown on 26 March 2020 led to sharp reductions in care-seeking behavior that persisted for 18 months after initial declines. For example, total admissions dropped 59.6% [95% confidence interval: 52.4, 66.8] during home confinement and were 33.2% [29, 37.4] below baseline in September 2021. We identified three waves of all-cause respiratory encounters consistent with COVID-19 activity. Intestinal infections and non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses experienced the most pronounced declines, with some diagnoses reduced 80%, even as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were relaxed. Non-respiratory hospitalizations, including injuries and acute illnesses (e.g., heart attack, stroke), were 20-60% below baseline throughout the pandemic and exhibited strong temporal associations with NPIs and mobility behavior. ED attendances exhibited similar trends to hospitalizations, while GP visits, particularly for chronic illnesses and HIV, were less impacted and have returned to pre-pandemic levels.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all children presenting to the Texas Childrens Hospital system with testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from March 10, 2020 through June 28, 2020.Demographics were recorded for all patients undergoing testing and clinical characteristics and outcomes were recorded for children with positive tests. RESULTS: Of 16,554 unique patients  21 years of age who were tested for SARS-CoV-2, 1215 (7.3%) patients tested positive. Infants under 1 year of age and patients aged 18-21 years had the highest percent of positive tests at 9.9% (230/2329) and 10.7% (79/739), respectively. Hispanic children accounted for 66% (802/1215) of positive tests, though they only represented 42.1% (6972/16554) of all children tested for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 1215 children with a positive test, 55.7% had fever, 40.9% had cough, 39.8% had congestion or rhinorrhea, 21.9% had gastrointestinal complaints, and 15.9% were asymptomatic. Only 97 (8%) patients were hospitalized (of which 68% were Hispanic). Most hospitalized patients had underlying medical conditions (62/97, 63.9%), including obesity. Thirty-one hospitalized patients (31/97, 32%) required respiratory support and nine patients (9/97, 9.3%) received SARS-CoV-2 antiviral therapy. Two patients died. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively high percentage of Hispanic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalized.

We investigated the self-reported prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviours and contributing and independent factors associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours among veterinarians in Norway. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, nationwide survey. PARTICIPANTS: 2596 veterinarians in Norway (response rate: 75%). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Paykels five-item questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 27% (n=682/2567) of veterinarians in Norway felt that life was not worth living during the last year, 5% (n=139/2562) had serious suicidal thoughts, and 0.2% (n=6/2537) had attempted suicide. Female veterinarians reported significantly higher prevalence of suicidal feelings and thoughts than males. For serious suicidal thoughts, women had nearly twice the prevalence as their male colleagues (6.2% (n=108/1754) vs 3.6% (n=28/766), (2): 6.5, p=0.011). Independent factors associated with serious suicidal thoughts were being single (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.13 to 2.72, p<0.05), negative life events (OR=1.43, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.68, p<0.001) and the presence of mental distress (OR 2.75, 95% CI 2.14 to 3.52, p<0.001). The veterinarians related their serious suicidal thoughts to work and personal problems, and a lesser degree to family, social and other problems. Nearly twice as many women (53%, n=57/108) as men (28%, n=7/25) reported work problems as the most important contributing factor to their serious suicidal thoughts ((2): 4.99, p=0.03). 4% (n=6/139) reported work problems as the only factor of importance. CONCLUSIONS: Veterinarians in Norway have relatively high prevalence of suicidal feelings and thoughts, including serious suicidal thoughts. In multivariable analyses, the individual factors were more important than work-related ones, while work problems were the most reported contributing factor to serious suicidal thoughts by the veterinarians themselves. The role of gender and specific work-related factors should be further investigated to better understand the complexity of suicidal behaviour among veterinarians.","output":"Prevalence and individual and work-related factors associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviours among veterinarians in Norway: a cross-sectional, nationwide survey-based study (the NORVET study)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The study examined the effect of celebrity attractiveness, celebrity trustworthiness, and celebrity cause fit on the attitude toward green cosmetics.

To date, no antiviral treatment or vaccine has been explicitly recommended for COVID-19. So, applying preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is the most critical intervention. Pregnant women are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia, because they are at immunosuppressive state and physiological adaptive change during pregnancy. As the same time the determinants of knowledge and practice to prevent COVID-19 among pregnant women, who constitute vulnerable groups, are yet to be evaluated. This study was therefore designed to assess knowledge and practice of preventive measures against corona virus disease and its associated factors among pregnant women in Debre Tabor Town. Methods: : A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among 422 pregnant women from May 25-June 15, 2020. Simple random sampling technique was employed. Data was collected by face to face interview using structured and pre-tested questionnaire. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 23. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was carried out and p-value < 0.05 at 95% CI were considered as statistically significant. Result: A total of 422 participants were included with response rate of 95.9%. The mean age was 27.15 (SD 4.719) years.

To limit the generated radiation, custom-made blocking tiles with different apertures were used. Effects of aperture shapes and positions, camera-target distances and temperature levels on the error were investigated. The study findings suggest that due to the SSE the measured temperatures are too low, especially at longer camera-target distances. The SSE error depends on the number of pixels available and included into the region of interest, for which the accurate measurement is about to be performed.

The mig gene is inducible in macrophages and in other cells in response to interferon (IFN)-gamma. We have transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with cDNA encoding human Mig and we have derived CHO cell lines from which we have purified recombinant human Mig (rHuMig). rHuMig induced the transient elevation of [Ca2+]i in human tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) and in cultured, activated human peripheral blood-derived lymphocytes. No responses were seen in human neutrophils, monocytes, or Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines. rHuMig was chemotactic for TIL by a modified Boyden chamber assay but rHuMig was not chemotactic for neutrophils or monocytes. The CHO cell lines, IFN-gamma-treated human peripheral-blood monocytes, and IFN-gamma-treated cells of the human monocytic cell line THP-1 all secreted multiple and identical HuMig species as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Using the CHO-derived rHuMig, we have shown that the species' heterogeneity is due to proteolytic cleavage at basic carboxy-terminal residues, and that the proteolysis occurs before and not after rHuMig secretion by the CHO cells. The major species of secreted rHuMig ranged from 78 to 103 amino acids in length, the latter corresponding to the full-length secreted protein predicted from the HuMig cDNA. Carboxy-terminal-truncated forms of rHuMig were of lower specific activity compared to full-length rHuMig in the calcium flux assay, and the truncated species did not block the activity of the full- length species.

Most crocodilians grow to be larger than other reptile species and, therefore, have significant space requirements. Like most animals requiring an aquatic environment, crocodilians need water that is clean and free of disease. Crocodilians have a true hard palate in the roof of the mouth that ends caudally in a soft palate. This soft palate has a ventral flap which is referred to as the velum palati. The respiratory system of crocodilians consists of well-developed lungs benefiting from a very effective inspiration aided by the intercostal muscles and the septum post hepaticum. Crocodilians have a four-chambered heart as opposed to the three-chambered heart found in other reptiles and amphibians. The temperature and humidity requirements for crocodilians in captivity vary with the species. An understanding of crocodilian biology and natural history is needed to try and duplicate their natural environment. An important consideration is the allowance of circadian variations in light cycle and temperatures to mimic their natural environment.

METHODS: A cohort of 18+ rheumatoid arthritis patients from DANBIO was linked to population-based health registries in Denmark (2006-2016). Adopting a prevalent new-user design, we matched bDMARD users to bDMARD na?ve patients using time-conditional propensity scores. The risk of incident osteoporotic fractures (including hip, vertebrae, humerus, and forearm) was estimated among the matched patients by Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: Out of 24,678 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 4265 bDMARD users were matched to the same number of bDMARD na?ve patients (mean age 56.2 years, 74% female). During follow-up, 229 osteoporotic fractures occurred among bDMARD users, and 205 fractures among bDMARD na?ve patients (incidence rates 12.1 and 13.0 per 1000 person years, respectively). The use of bDMARDs was not associated with a reduced risk of osteoporotic fractures among rheumatoid arthritis patients (hazard ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.78-1.20), compared with no biological treatment.

These patients are at an increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency given the known higher prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in those with dark skin from African/Afro-Caribbean/Asian/Middle Eastern backgrounds. In addition to this, Ireland is located in a northerly latitude and is at risk of suboptimal Vitamin D levels because of reduced sunlight exposure. Osteopenia and osteoporosis has been reported in up to 80% of SCD patients with other studies indicating a link between Vitamin D deficiency and chronic pain in SCD patients. We wanted to examine Vitamin D levels in our SCD population and establish what supplements our SCD patients were taking, comparing our findings to NICE and Sickle Cell Society and Public Health England (2019) guidelines.ObjectivesTo identify how many SCD patients in a tertiary unit are Vitamin D deficient and to identify the number of patients currently on a recommended dose of Vitamin D.MethodsUsing our database of registered SCD patients, all Vitamin D level results within the past year were reviewed. Members of the haematology team concurrently asked each patient or parent/carer what Vitamin D supplementation, if any, they took regularly when they attended the hospital for review or over telephone clinic across a 4 month period. The patients charts were then reviewed on a daily basis after clinic and during/after hospital attendances.Results93.43% (313/335) of SCD patients had a vitamin D level taken in the preceding 12 months. The average vitamin D level was 52.94 nmol/L (median=51nmol/L). 13% of patients (41/313) had a vitamin D level <25nmol/L (deemed deficient as per NICE guidelines).We reviewed 184 patients in-person/over the telephone in a 4 month period during the COVID pandemic and asked about their current supplementation. 49.45% (91/184) of patients reviewed reported taking 400 international units (IU) daily with 26% (48/184) taking >400IU daily. 12.5% (23/184) of these patients reviewed had a vitamin D level <25nmol/L. In those with a level <25nmol/L, 30.43% (7/23) were taking 400IU, 26% (6/23) were taking >400IU daily and 34.78% (8/23) were on no supplements at all. The average age was much higher at 16.86 years in this group compared to the overall average age of 12.34 years.ConclusionsIn our audit we established that 56.52% (13/23) patients reviewed in-person or over the telephone who were Vitamin D deficient as per the NICE definition (<25nmol/L), were taking at least 400IU of Vitamin D daily (the recommended dose for children at increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency). This highlights the need for further studies and clearer international guidance re. prevention of and management of Vitamin D deficiency in these high risk SCD patients. The Sickle Cell Society and Public Health England (2019) guidelines recommend that Vitamin D deficiency be identified and treated according to local guidelines in all SCD patients. Those identified as Vitamin D deficient during the audit process were prescribed a higher dose of Vitamin D where possible with regular input from our hospital pharmacy team. We continued our policy of aiming to check Vitamin D levels twice per year with increased frequency of checks for those who required high dose Vitamin D treatment. Given the above findings, a plan was placed to make a more concerted effort to continuously ask patients re. vitamin D supplements during clinic and hospital visits.","output":"Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in sickle cell disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein amino acid sequence extracted from 11,542 viral genomic sequences submitted to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) database through April 27, 2020. Consistent with prior reports, we found a major S protein mutation, D614 to G614, that was represented in 56% of all the analyzed sequences. All other mutations combined were less than 10%. After parsing the data geographically, we found most of the Chinese patient samples showed D614 (97%). By contrast, most patient samples in many European countries showed G614 (51 to 88%). In the United States, the genotypic distribution in California and Washington was similar to Asian countries, while the distribution in other US states was comparable to Europe. We observed a dramatic increase in the frequency of G614 over time in multiple regions, surpassing D614 when both were present, suggesting G614 S protein virus outcompetes D614 S protein virus. To gain insight into the consequences of the D614G mutation, homology modeling using a multi-template threading mechanism with ab initio structural refinement was performed for a region of the S protein (S591 to N710) spanning the D614G mutation and the S1 furin cleavage site. Molecular models of this region containing D614 or G614 revealed a major difference in secondary structure at the furin domain (RRARS, R682 to S686). The D614 model predicted a random coil structure in the furin domain whereas the G614 model predicted an alpha helix. Critical residues in the cleavage domain of G614 model were found to better align with the PDB structure of a furin inhibitor. Thus, homology modeling studies suggest a potential mechanism whereby the D614G mutation may confer a competitive advantage at the furin binding domain that may contribute to the rise of the D614G SARS-CoV-2 mutant.","output":"The SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein D614G Mutation Shows Increasing Dominance and May Confer a Structural Advantage to the Furin Cleavage Domain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 variants could seriously dampen the global effort to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

The BD-812/BD-836 pair could thus serve as an ideal antibody cocktail against the SARS-CoV-2 VOCs.","output":"Structures of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 neutralizing antibodies provide insights into cocktail design against concerning variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, most Canadian provinces have gone through four distinct phases of social distancing and enhanced testing. A transmission dynamics model fitted to the cumulative case time series data permits us to estimate the effectiveness of interventions implemented in terms of the contact rate, probability of transmission per contact, proportion of isolated contacts, and detection rate. This allows us to calculate the control reproduction number during different phases (which gradually decreased to less than one). From this, we derive the necessary conditions in terms of enhanced social distancing, personal protection, contact tracing, quarantine/isolation strength at each escalation phase for the disease control to avoid a rebound. From this, we quantify the conditions needed to prevent epidemic rebound during de-escalation by simply reversing the escalation process.","output":"De-escalation by reversing the escalation with a stronger synergistic package of contact tracing, quarantine, isolation and personal protection: Feasibility of preventing a covid-19 rebound in Ontario, Canada, as a case study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 highlights the urgent need to develop sensitive methods for diagnosis and prognosis. To achieve this, multidimensional detection of SARS-CoV-2 related parameters including virus loads, immune response, and inflammation factors is crucial. Herein, by using metal-tagged antibodies as reporting probes, we developed a multiplex metal-detection based assay (MMDA) method as a general multiplex assay strategy for biofluids. This strategy provides extremely high multiplexing capability (theoretically over 100) compared with other reported biofluid assay methods. As a proof-of-concept, MMDA was used for serologic profiling of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The MMDA exhibits significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. By integrating the high dimensional data exploration/visualization tool (tSNE) and machine learning algorithms with in-depth analysis of multiplex data, we classified COVID-19 patients into different subgroups based on their distinct antibody landscape. We unbiasedly identified anti-SARS-CoV-2-nucleocapsid IgG and IgA as the most potently induced types of antibodies for COVID-19 diagnosis, and anti-SARS-CoV-2-spike IgA as a biomarker for disease severity stratification. MMDA represents a more accurate method for the diagnosis and disease severity stratification of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as well as for biomarker discovery of other diseases.","output":"Multiplex metal-detection based assay (MMDA) for COVID-19 diagnosis and identification of disease severity biomarkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: to identify the factors associated with the use and reuse of masks among Brazilian individuals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: cross-sectional study conducted in the five Brazilian regions, among adult individuals, via an electronic form disseminated in social media, addressing general information and the use of masks. Bivariate analysis and binary logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the use and reuse of masks. RESULTS: 3,981 (100%) individuals participated in the study. In total, 95.5% (CI 95%: 94.8-96.1) reported using masks. Fabric masks were more frequently reported (72.7%; CI 95%: 71.3-74.1), followed by surgical masks (27.8%; CI 95%: 26.5-29.2). The percentage of reuse was 71.1% (CI 95%: 69.7-72.5). Most (55.8%; CI 95%: 51.7-60.0) of those exclusively wearing surgical masks reported its reuse. Being a woman and having had contact with individuals presenting respiratory symptoms increased the likelihood of wearing masks (p0.001). Additionally, being a woman decreased the likelihood of reusing surgical masks (p0.001). CONCLUSION: virtually all the participants reported the use of masks, most frequently fabric masks. The findings draw attention to a risky practice, that of reusing surgical and paper masks. Therefore, guidelines, public policies, and educational strategies are needed to promote the correct use of masks to control and prevent COVID-19.","output":"Factors associated with the use and reuse of face masks among Brazilian individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Retrospective multicentre cohort study of all endoscopic procedures performed between 4/27 and 6/15-2020.

Telemedicine is increasingly facilitating access to healthcare, in LMICs. This prospective cohort intervention study aims to investigate feasibility and acceptability of telerehabilitation to provide long-term follow-up of individuals with SCI and ABI, in Nepal, post-discharge from hospital. Methods: TERN was delivered by Spinal Injury Rehabilitation Centre, Nepal, in collaboration with University of Leeds, UK. A home visit connected participants to the Multidisciplinary Team (MDT), through a specialised video conference system. The MDT performed a comprehensive assessment before recommending personalised interventions. Outcome measures assessed functional independence in performing activities of daily living, health-related quality of life and emotional disturbances using Modified Barthel Index, EuroQoL-5D, and Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale, respectively. A subset of participants was interviewed, exploring acceptability of telerehabilitation. Findings: Between January and December 2020, 97 participants with SCI (n = 82) and ABI (n = 15) were enrolled. After receiving telerehabilitation, significant improvement to self-reported functional independence (p<.001) and quality of life were found, (p<.001). Self-reported severity of depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased (p<.001). Qualitative interviews (n = 18) revealed participants accepted telerehabilitation, they valued regular contact with professionals without costly, difficult travel. Interpretation: This is the first study to test telerehabilitation in Nepal. This approach can be safely delivered for long-term follow-up for individuals with SCI or ABI, overcoming geographical barriers to healthcare access.

Early reports indicate possible neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19, with symptoms ranging from mild to severe, highly variable prevalence rates, and uncertainty regarding causal or coincidental occurrence of symptoms. As neurological involvement of any systemic disease is frequently associated with adverse effects on morbidity and mortality, obtaining accurate and consistent global data on the extent to which COVID-19 may impact the nervous system is urgently needed. To address this need, investigators from the Neurocritical Care Society launched the Global Consortium Study of Neurological Dysfunction in COVID-19 (GCS-NeuroCOVID). The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium rapidly implemented a Tier 1, pragmatic study to establish phenotypes and prevalence of neurological manifestations of COVID-19. A key component of this global collaboration is development and application of common data elements (CDEs) and definitions to facilitate rigorous and systematic data collection across resource settings. Integration of these elements is critical to reduce heterogeneity of data and allow for future high-quality meta-analyses. The GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium specifically designed these elements to be feasible for clinician investigators during a global pandemic when healthcare systems are likely overwhelmed and resources for research may be limited. Elements include pediatric components and translated versions to facilitate collaboration and data capture in Latin America, one of the epicenters of this global outbreak. In this manuscript, we share the specific data elements, definitions, and rationale for the adult and pediatric CDEs for Tier 1 of the GCS-NeuroCOVID consortium, as well as the translated versions adapted for use in Latin America. Global efforts are underway to further harmonize CDEs with other large consortia studying neurological and general aspects of COVID-19 infections.

The trajectories of COVID-19 hospitalizations during this period are expected to differ across communities depending on their age distributions, vaccination coverage, cumulative incidence, and adoption of risk mitigating behaviors. Yet, existing predictive models of COVID-19 hospitalizations are almost exclusively focused on national- and state-level predictions. This leaves local policymakers in urgent need of tools that can provide early warnings about the possibility that COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise to levels that exceed local capacity. In this work, we develop simple decision rules to predict whether COVID-19 hospitalization will exceed the local hospitalization capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating strategies are implemented during this time. These decision rules use real-time data related to hospital occupancy and new hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, and when available, genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. We showed that these decision rules present reasonable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (all []80%) in predicting local surges in hospitalizations under numerous simulated scenarios, which capture substantial uncertainties over the future trajectories of COVID-19 during the winter and spring of 2022. Our proposed decision rules are simple, visual, and straightforward to use in practice by local decision makers without the need to perform numerical computations. Significance StatementIn many U.S. communities, the risk of exceeding local healthcare capacity during the winter and spring of 2022 remains substantial since COVID-19 hospitalizations may rise due to seasonal changes, low vaccination coverage, and the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, such as the omicron variant. Here, we provide simple and easy-to-communicate decision rules to predict whether local hospital occupancy is expected to exceed capacity within a 4- or 8-week period if no additional mitigating measures are implemented. These decision rules can serve as an alert system for local policymakers to respond proactively to mitigate future surges in the COVID-19 hospitalization and minimize risk of overwhelming local healthcare capacity.","output":"Simple decision rules to predict local surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations during the winter and spring of 2022"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Monoclonal antibodies are believed to be magic bullets and hold great potential for lots of biological process.

Methods Hyperbilirubinaemia, hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and splenic injuries were induced by pretreating albino rats with PHZ (40 mg/kg, p.o.) for two alternate days. Afterward, six out of the eight groups of rats (n = 5) used were treated with either ZAL or ZARB (30, 100 and 300 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for seven days. Na?ve control rats received saline without PHZ whereas negative control group received saline after PHZ. After one week of treatment, rats were sacrificed and blood collected for assessment of haematological and biochemical parameters. Liver, kidney and spleen sections were processed for histology and examined under light microscope. Results Data indicate that PHZ significantly (p < 0.05) increased total bilirubin, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and BUN/creatinine ratio whereas red blood cell count was significantly reduced. These anomalies were significantly reversed in rats treated with ZAL or ZARB. The therapeutic effect of the extracts was supported by photomicrographs of the liver, kidney, and spleen of rats which revealed recovery from PHZ-mediated pyknosis, glomerular degeneration and multiple splenic necrosis respectively.

In this sense, the countries have had difficulties in counting the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Errors in reporting results are a common factor, as well as the lack of interoperability between laboratories and governments. Approaches aimed at sending spreadsheets via email expose patients privacy and have increased the probability of errors due to retyping, which generates a delay in the notification of results. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and develop an interoperable platform to report polymerase chain reaction (PCR) SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government. METHODS: The methodology to design and develop the interoperable platform was comprised of six well-structured stages: (1) creation of a minimum data set for PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests, (2) modeling processes and end points where institutions interchange information, (3) standards and interoperability design, (4) software development, (5) software testing, and (6) software implementation. RESULTS: The interoperable Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) platform to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests from laboratories to the Chilean government was successfully implemented. The platform was designed, developed, tested, and implemented following a structured methodology. The platforms performance to 1000 requests resulted in a response time of 240 milliseconds, throughput of 28.3 requests per second, and process management time of 131 milliseconds. The security was assured through a private network exclusive to the Ministry of Health to ensure confidentiality and integrity. The authorization and authentication of laboratories were implemented with a JavaScript Object Notation Web Token. All the PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests were accessible through an application programming interface gateway with valid credentials and the right access control list. CONCLUSIONS: The platform was implemented and is currently being used by UC Christus Laboratory. The platform is secure. It was tested adequately for confidentiality, secure authorization, authentication, and message integrity. This platform simplifies the reporting of PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and reduces the time and probability of mistakes in counting positive cases. The interoperable solution with FHIR is working successfully and is open for the community, laboratories, and any institution that needs to report PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests.","output":"Interoperable Platform to Report Polymerase Chain Reaction SARS-CoV-2 Tests From Laboratories to the Chilean Government: Development and Implementation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 made universities switch rapidly to e-learning, which enabled continuous access to education. Thus, the evaluation of e-learning engagement is essential to ensure students are engaged in their studies just as it is in the conventional face-to-face classroom. The students are totally in control of their participation in the e-learning platform, and little is known about what instructors can do to facilitate their engagement in the platform during the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, the extant literature has reported that one of the challenges posed by e-learning is that many university students engage in off-task behaviors during lectures. Therefore, a systematic model for assessing university students e-learning engagement, learning persistence, and academic benefits was developed based on a thorough literature review. Data was collected from 274 students using e-learning platforms, and this study adopted the quantitative method of Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Modelling to validate the model empirically. A total of nine first-order constructs were used to measure e-learning engagement. They all explained 75% of the variance of e-learning engagement, while 42% and 66% explained the variance of learning persistence and academic benefits, respectively. All the hypotheses tested were positive, except for the relationship between learning persistence and academic benefits.

The current gold standard for etiological diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) analysis of respiratory tract specimens, but the test has a high false-negative rate due to both nasopharyngeal swab sampling error and viral burden. Hence diagnostic imaging has emerged as a fundamental component of current management of COVID-19 patients. Currently, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) is the main imaging tool for primary diagnosis and evaluation of disease severity in patients. Lung ultrasound (LUS) imaging has become a safe bedside imaging alternative that does no expose the patient to radiation, and minimizes the risk of contamination. Although the number of studies to date are limited, LUS findings have demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, comparable to those of chest CT scans.

Originating as hunter-gatherer societies, our ancient ancestors initially exploited anything that could be consumed or brought to bear. With the advent of the \\"first proto-farmers,\\" humans began manipulating their environments to maximize available resources. Urban centers propagated and flourished proximal to agricultural origins, where modern societies have been built primarily on an abundance of food. As societies \\"developed,\\" and continue to develop, an inevitable economic transition occurs from agriculture to industry/service predominance, culminating in a corresponding shift in land use. Developed countries have typically experienced maximal expansion of the agricultural frontier, where farmland is now steadily eroding by a proverbial flood of urban development. In contrast, in developing countries, this shift in economic development has not yet fully manifested and the agricultural footprint continues to expand at the expense of native habitats. Thus, the relative influence of \\"agriculture\\" on SSOs, in terms of land use, is primarily dependent on economic developmental status, which can be, at least in part, ameliorated via technology by increasing yield from existing land. Moreover, in addition to the land use challenge, there are multiple other factors affecting wildlife SSOs, including a figurative plague of invasive species, a literal plague of disease, a barrage of buildings, bumpers, grilles, and windshields to collide with, light pollution to confuse cues with, poachers to contend with, and even more complicated factors such as climate change. Being an easy target does not mean pesticides are the right target, and this fixation can potentially detract from public awareness regarding the primary drivers affecting SSOs as well as the opportunity to proactively address them. So, relatively speaking, how do these other factors compare to \\"pesticides\\" in terms of driving SSOs? Moreover, why is the popular media so fixated on the pesticide narrative? Based on the available evidence, this manuscript attempts to address these questions from a holistic and relative perspective within the context of land use change, economic development, population growth, and associated implications of global connectivity and commerce.","output":"Anthropogenic factors affecting wildlife species status outcomes: why the fixation on pesticides?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To determine the long-term effects of work loss on health during the COVID-19 pandemic, and whether any effects are persistent upon returning to work. Methods A prospective longitudinal cohort study of 2603 participants across Australia monitored changes in health and work during between March and December 2020, with participants completing surveys at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months later. Outcomes described psychological distress, and mental and physical health. Linear mixed regression models examined associations between changes in health and experiences of work loss, and return to work, over time. Results Losing work during the early stages of the pandemic was associated with long-term poorer mental health, which began to recover over time as some returned to work. Physical health deteriorated over time, greater for people not working at baseline. Being out of work was associated with poorer mental health, but better physical health. These effects were larger for people that had recently lost work than for people with sustained work loss, and retaining employment played a protective role. Generally, returning to work resulted in poorer physical health and improvements in mental health, although this depended on the broader context of changes in work. Conclusions Work cessation during the pandemic led to poor health outcomes and had long-lasting effects. Returning to work benefits mental health but may reduce physical activity in the short-term. We encourage the provision of accessible mental health supports and services immediately following loss of work, and for people with prolonged forms of work loss.","output":"Changes in work and health of Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of March 2021, COVID-19 has caused more than 123 million infections, and almost 3 million deaths worldwide.

The suggestion is based on the hypothesis that ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may favor the entry and diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus into the human cells. ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may increase the expression of ACE2 receptors, which are the sites of viral entry into the human organism. ACE2 receptors are ubiquitous, although they are extremely abundant on the cell surface of type 2 pneumocytes. Type 2 pneumocytes are small cylindrical alveolar cells located in close vicinity to pulmonary capillaries and responsible for the synthesis of alveolar surfactant, which is known to facilitate gas exchanges. The increased expression of ACE2 for effect of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs can be detected by increased production of angiotensin1-7 and mRNA related to ACE2. There is the fear that the increased expression of ACE2 induced by ACE-inhibitors and ARBs may ultimately facilitate the entry and diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, there is no clinical evidence to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, available data are conflicting and some counter-intuitive findings suggest that ARBs may be beneficial, not harmful. Indeed, studies conducted in different laboratories demonstrated that ACE2 receptors show a down-regulation (i.e. the opposite of what would happen with ACE-inhibitors and ARBs) for effect of their interaction with the virus. In animal studies, down-regulation of ACE2 has been found as prevalent in the pulmonary areas infected by virus, but not in the surrounding areas. In these studies, virus-induced ACE2 down-regulation would lead to a reduced formation of angiotensin1-7 (because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin1-7) with consequent accumulation of angiotensin II. The excess angiotensin II would favor pulmonary edema and inflammation, a phenomenon directly associated with angiotensin II levels, along with worsening in pulmonary function. Such detrimental effects have been blocked by ARBs in experimental models. In the light of the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the suggestion to discontinue ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in all patients with the aim of preventing or limiting the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 virus is not based on clinical evidence. Conversely, experimental studies suggest that ARBs might be useful in these patients to limit pulmonary damage through the inhibition of type 1 angiotensin II receptors. Controlled clinical studies in this area are eagerly awaited. This review discusses facts and theories on the potential impact of ACE-inhibitors and ARBs in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","output":"[ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus]."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acute inflammation process is explained by numerous hypotheses, including oxidative stress, enzyme stimulation, and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

LC-MS/MS was utilized to investigate the chemical composition of YGME, and 29 compounds were tentatively identified. In addition, the isolation of luteolin-7-O--d-glucoside, apigenin-7-O--d-glucoside, and kaempferol-3-O--l-rhamnoside was performed for the first time from the studied plant. Inflammation was induced by subcutaneous injection of 100 L of 1% carrageenan sodium. Rats were treated orally with YGME 100, 200 mg/kg, celecoxib (50 mg/kg), and saline, respectively, one hour before carrageenan injection. The average volume of paws edema and weight were measured at several time intervals. Levels of NO, GSH, TNF-, PGE-2, serum IL-1, IL-6 were measured. In additionally, COX-2 immunostaining and histopathological examination of paw tissue were performed. YGME displayed a potent anti-inflammatory influence by reducing paws edema, PGE-2, TNF-, NO production, serum IL-6, IL-1, and COX-2 immunostaining.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our sample consisted of 875 catarrhine primate specimens in NMNH collections, representing 13 genera collected in 39 countries from 1882 to 2004. Using archival and accession information we determined the approximate locations from which specimens were collected. We then plotted location coordinates onto publicly available anthrome maps created by Ellis et al. (Global Ecology and Biogeography, 2010, 19, 589), which delineate terrestrial biomes of human population density and land use worldwide since the 1700s. RESULTS: We found that among primates collected from their native ranges, 92% were from an environment that had some level of human impact, suggesting that the majority of presumed wild\\\\collected primate specimens lived in an environment influenced by humans during their lifetimes. DISCUSSION: The degree to which human\\\\modified environments may have impacted the lives of primates currently held in museum collections has been historically ignored, implicating unforeseen consequences for collection\\\\based research.

The present study sought to explore the relationship between TyG index and the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients implanted with drug-eluting stents (DESs). METHODS: A total of 1108 participants were recruited to the study and assigned to two groups based on occurrence of CIN. TyG index was calculated as ln [fasting triglycerides (mg/dL)  fasting blood glucose (mg/dL)/2]. Baseline characteristics and incidence of CIN were compared between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between TyG index and CIN. RESULTS: The results showed that 167 participants (15.1%) developed CIN. Subjects in the CIN group had a significantly higher TyG index compared with subjects in the non-CIN group (8.9  0.7 vs. 9.3  0.7, P<0.001). TyG index was significantly correlated with increased risk of CIN after adjusting for confounding factors irrespective of diabetes mellitus status and exhibited a J-shaped non-linear association. Subgroup analysis showed a significant gender difference in the relationship between TyG index and CIN. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the risk assessment performance of TyG index was superior compared with other single metabolic indexes. Addition of TyG index to the baseline model increased the area under the curve from 0.713 (0.672-0.754) to 0.742 (0.702-0.782) and caused a reclassification improvement of 0.120 (0.092-0.149). CONCLUSION: The findings from the present study show that a high TyG index is significantly and independently associated with incidence of CIN in NSTE-ACS patients firstly implanted with DESs. Routine preoperative assessment of TyG index can alleviate CIN and TyG index provides a potential target for intervention in prevention of CIN.","output":"Elevated TyG Index Predicts Incidence of Contrast-Induced Nephropathy: A Retrospective Cohort Study in NSTE-ACS Patients Implanted With DESs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 started in China's Hubei province at the end of 2019 has rapidly become a pandemic.

Methods: A statistical panel-model was applied to daily data for 165 countries from January 22 to July 31, 2020. Besides, two indicators are constructed for each country in the sample. The first of them measures social distancing, based on percentage of people circulating on transport stations, as a proportion of the circulation in a period before pandemic. The second indicator proposed estimates the current percentage of people immunized by BCG vaccine, based on the historical coverage and demographic factors. Results: : We estimate that a strict social distancing may be associated with a reduction of around 6 percentage points in the daily variation rate of cases per million of COVID-19. Besides, the effects of temperature and BCG immunization proved to be statistically significant at the usual levels, indicating that lower temperatures and a low (or a lack of) BCG immunization may be related to increases in the daily variation rate of cases (per million inhabitants) of COVID-19.

Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more egalitarian forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account.

Our goals are to (1) to observe the correlation between the strictness of social distancing policies and the spread of disease and (2) to determine the optimal adoption level of social distancing policies. The earliest instances of the virus were found in China, and the virus has reached the United States with devastating consequences. Other countries severely affected by the pandemic are Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom, Spain, India, Italy, and France. Although it is impossible to stop it, it is possible to slow down its spread to reduce its impact on the society and economy. Governments around the world have deployed various policies to reduce the virus spread in response to the pandemic. To assess the effectiveness of these policies, the system's dynamics of the society needs to be analyzed, which is generally not possible with mathematical linear equations or Monte Carlo methods because human society is a complex adaptive system with continuous feedback loops. Because of the challenges with the other methods, we chose agent-based methods to conduct our study. Moreover, recent agent-based modeling studies for the COVID-19 pandemic show significant promise in assisting decision-makers in managing the crisis by applying policies such as social distancing, disease testing, contact tracing, home isolation, emergency hospitalization, and travel prevention to reduce infection rates. Based on modeling studies conducted in Imperial College, increasing levels of interventions could slow the spread of disease and infection. We ran the model with six different percentages of social distancing while keeping the other parameters constant. The results show that social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19 significantly, in turn decreasing the spread of disease and infection rates when implemented at higher levels. We also validated these results by using the behavior space tool with ten experiments with varying social distancing levels. We conclude that applying and increasing social distancing policy levels leads to a significant reduction in infection spread and the number of deaths. Both experiments show that infection rates are reduced drastically when social distancing intervention is implemented between 80% to 100%.","output":"Quantifying the Effects of Social Distancing on the Spread of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is a rare autoimmune disorder that typically develops after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.

RESULTS: The SOD1 p.D12Y clinical manifestations ranged from a benign phenotype characterized by distal distribution of muscular weakness and long survival to classic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with poor prognosis. Two patients with the distal clinical phenotype showed MRI and muscle pathology alterations indicating a concurrent muscle involvement. In one of these patients significant myopathic changes were associated with rimmed vacuolar pathology. CONCLUSIONS: We expand the clinical spectrum of SOD1 p.D12Y variant, including predominant lower motor neuron forms with long survival and classic forms with aggressive course. Some patients may have concomitant distal myopathy without other explanations.

In this study, five full-length circular ssDNA genomes were recovered from bat faecal samples using inverse PCR with sequences designed based on circovirus-related sequences obtained from Solexa sequencing data derived from a random amplification method. These five sequences shared a similar genomic organization to circovirus or the recently proposed cyclovirus of the family Circoviridae. The newly obtained circovirus/cyclovirus-like genomes ranged from 1741 to 2177 bp, and each consisted of two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encoding putative replicase (Rep) and capsid (Cap) proteins, respectively. The potential stem-loop region was predicted in all five genomes, and three of them had the typical conserved nonanucleotide motif of cycloviruses. A set of primers targeting the conserved Rep region was designed and used to detect the prevalence of circovirus/cyclovirus sequences in individual bats. Among 199 samples tested, 47 were positive (23.6%) for the circovirus genome and two (1.0%) were positive for the cyclovirus genome. In total, 48 partial Rep sequences plus the five full-length genomes were obtained in this study.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing COVID-19 actively replicates in the throat, unlike SARS-CoV, and shows high pharyngeal viral shedding even in patients with mild symptoms of the disease. HCoV-229E is one of four coronaviruses causing the common cold. In this study, the efficacy of ColdZyme? (CZ-MD), a medical device mouth spray, was tested against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. The CZ-MD provides a protective glycerol barrier containing cod trypsin as an ancillary component. Combined, these ingredients can inactivate common cold viruses in the throat and mouth. The CZ-MD is believed to act on the viral surface proteins that would perturb their entry pathway into cells. The efficacy and safety of the CZ-MD have been demonstrated in clinical trials on the common cold. METHOD OF STUDY: The ability of the CZ-MD to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E was tested using an in vitro virucidal suspension test (ASTM E1052). RESULTS: CZ-MD inactivated SARS-CoV-2 by 98.3% and HCoV-229E by 99.9%. CONCLUSION: CZ-MD mouth spray can inactivate the respiratory coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro. Although the in vitro results presented cannot be directly translated into clinical efficacy, the study indicates that CZ-MD might offer a protective barrier against SARS-CoV-2 and a decreased risk of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E in vitro by ColdZyme? a medical device mouth spray against the common cold"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to the socio-economic consequences of the corona pandemic, the Euro","output":"The EU budget as an opportunity in the crisis: the EU Commission proposal for a new financial framework and a reconstruction fund"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Capsule retention reported rates range between 1% and 13%. This study aims to determine the incidence of, risk factors for, and clinical outcomes of capsule retention in a large heterogenous cohort of patients and define cross-sectional imaging findings predictive of capsule retention. METHODS A retrospective review of all capsule endoscopy (CE) examinations performed at our center from January 2002 to January 2013 was undertaken. Data on patient demographics, CE indication, findings, and details of management were analyzed. Radiologic images of patients with computed tomography scan performed 6 months before CE for patients with CE retention and for controls without CE retention but at high risk based on clinical computed tomography reports were examined by a gastrointestinal radiologist, blinded to history, and classified as worrisome based on the presence of stricture, partial obstruction, or small bowel (SB) anastomosis. RESULTS Seventeen CE retentions (0.3%) occurred in 15 patients. Obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (47%) was the most common indication. Outcomes included surgical intervention (n = 10), endoscopic retrieval (n = 2), passing of capsule after treatment of inflammation (n = 3), passage after conservative measures for SB obstruction (n = 1), and loss to follow-up (n = 1). Patients with CE retention were more likely to have SB anastomoses (88% versus 23%) and partial obstruction (63% versus 38%) than patients with high-risk features for capsule retention who passed the capsule. CONCLUSIONS In a tertiary care population without obstructive symptoms, capsule retention occurred in only 0.3% of cases.

Methods SUMMIT trial subjects (N=16,485) ages 40-80 years with COPD were randomly assigned 50%/50% to derivation (N=8181) and internal validation (N=8304). Three external COPD validations from Intermountain Healthcare included outpatients with cardiovascular risks (N=9251), outpatients without cardiovascular risks (N=8551), and inpatients (N=26,170). Cox regression evaluated 40 predictors of all-cause mortality. SUMMIT treatments including combined fluticasone furoate (FF) 100g/vilanterol 25g (VI) were not included in the score. Results Mortality predictors were FEV1, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, age, smoking pack-years, prior COPD hospitalizations, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabetes, anti-thrombotics, anti-arrhythmics, and xanthines. Combined in the Summit Score (derivation: c=0.668), quartile 4 vs 1 had HR=4.43 in SUMMIT validation (p<0.001, 95% CI=3.27, 6.01, c=0.662) and HR=8.15 in Intermountain cardiovascular risk COPD outpatients (p<0.001, 95% CI=5.86, 11.34, c=0.736), and strongly predicted mortality in the other Intermountain COPD populations.

The identification of virulence factors which determine disease susceptibility and severity in different cell types remains an essential challenge. The serine protease TMPRSS2 has been shown to be important for S protein priming and viral entry, however, little is known about its regulation. SPINT2 is a member of the family of Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors and has been shown to inhibit TMPRSS2. Here, we explored the existence of a co-regulation between SPINT2/TMPRSS2 and found a tightly regulated protease/inhibitor expression balance across tissues. We found that SPINT2 negatively correlates with SARS-CoV-2 expression in Calu-3 and Caco-2 cell lines and was down-regulated in secretory cells from COVID-19 patients. We validated our findings using Calu-3 cell lines and observed a strong increase in viral load after SPINT2 knockdown. Additionally, we evaluated the expression of SPINT2 in datasets from comorbid diseases using bulk and scRNA-seq data. We observed its down-regulation in colon, kidney and liver tumors as well as in alpha pancreatic islets cells from diabetes Type 2 patients, which could have implications for the observed comorbidities in COVID-19 patients suffering from chronic diseases.","output":"SPINT2 controls SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and is associated to disease severity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Urban green space is thought to contribute to citizen happiness by promoting physical and mental health.

After being infected by SARS-CoV-2, a specific humoral immune response may be rapidly induced in the host to restrain the viral infection via the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which are also useful for preventing reinfection [1, 2]. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immunity and alterations in immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) levels in humans during viral infection. In this perspective, we have summarized several characteristics of the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potentially critical role in vaccine development.

Since the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was reported as the causative agent of COVID-19 in December 2019, the subsequent spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 continues to considerably impact human health and life expectancy and endangers the global economy and socio-economic stability. The gold standard technique used to confirm early SARS-CoV-2 infection is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based viral nucleic acid testing.

However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension works.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Updated Guidelines for Evaluating Public Health Surveillance Systems and the Uganda National Technical Guidelines for Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response in four refugee settlements in UgandaBidibidi, Adjumani, Kiryandongo and Rhino Camp. Using semi-structured questionnaires, key informant and focus group discussion guides, we interviewed 53 health facility leaders, 12 key personnel and 224 village health team members from 53 health facilities and 112 villages and assessed key surveillance functions and attributes. RESULTS: All health facilities assessed had key surveillance staff; 60% were trained on Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response and most village health teams were trained on disease surveillance. Case detection was at 55%; facilities lacked standard case definitions and were using parallel Implementing Partner driven reporting systems. Recording was at 79% and reporting was at 81%. Data analysis and interpretation was at 49%. Confirmation of outbreaks and events was at 76%. Preparedness was at 72%. Response was at 34%. Feedback was at 82%.

The objectives were to use validated questionnaires to measure the severity of fatigue and compare this with normative data and thresholds for clinical relevance in other diseases; measure and describe the impact of postexertional malaise (PEM); and assess symptoms of dysfunctional breathing, self-reported physical activity, and health-related quality of life. METHODS This was an observational study with a cross-sectional survey design (data collection from February 2021 to April 2021). Eligible participants were adults experiencing persistent symptoms due to COVID-19 that did not predate the confirmed or suspected infection. Questionnaires included the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue Scale (FACIT-F) and the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire-Post-Exertional Malaise. RESULTS After data cleaning, 213 participants were included in the analysis. The total FACIT-F score was 18 (SD = 10) (where the score can range from 0 to 52 and a lower score indicates more severe fatigue), and 71.4% were experiencing chronic fatigue. Postexertional symptom exacerbation affected most participants, and 58.7% met the PEM scoring thresholds used in people living with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. CONCLUSION Long COVID is characterized by chronic fatigue that is clinically relevant and at least as severe as fatigue in several other clinical conditions. PEM is a significant challenge for this patient group. Because of the potential for setbacks and deteriorated function following overexertion, fatigue and postexertional symptom exacerbation must be monitored and reported in clinical practice and in studies involving interventions for people with long COVID. IMPACT Physical therapists working with people with long COVID should measure and validate the patient's experience. Postexertional symptom exacerbation must be considered, and rehabilitation needs to be carefully designed based on individual presentation. Beneficial interventions might first ensure symptom stabilization via pacing, a self-management strategy for the activity that helps minimize postexertional malaise.","output":"Chronic Fatigue and Postexertional Malaise in People Living with Long COVID: An Observational Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the first coronavirus described, has been a continuing problem in poultry for more than 70 years.

ReninCangiotensin system (RAS) is known to function in the development of PAH. Losartan, a specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is a well-known antihypertensive drug with a potential role in regulating angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a recently found regulator of RAS. To determine the effect of losartan on smoke-induced PAH and its possible mechanism, rats were daily exposed to cigarette smoke for 6 months in the absence and in the presence of losartan. Elevated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), thickened wall of pulmonary arteries with apparent medial hypertrophy along with increased angiotensin II (Ang II) and decreased ACE2 levels were observed in smoke-exposed-only rats. Losartan administration ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling, inhibited the smoke-induced RVSP and Ang II elevation and partially reversed the ACE2 decrease in rat lungs. In cultured primary pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from 3- and 6-month smoke-exposed rats, ACE2 levels were significantly lower than in those from the control rats. Moreover, PASMCs from 6-month exposed rats proliferated more rapidly than those from 3-month exposed or control rats, and cells grew even more rapidly in the presence of DX600, an ACE2 inhibitor. Consistent with the in vivo study, in vitro losartan pretreatment also inhibited cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced cell proliferation and ACE2 reduction in rat PASMCs. The results suggest that losartan may be therapeutically useful in the chronic smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling and PAH and ACE2 may be involved as part of its mechanism. Our study might provide insight into the development of new therapeutic interventions for PAH smokers.","output":"Losartan attenuates chronic cigarette smoke exposure-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats: Possible involvement of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic outpatient medicine has drastically been altered how it is delivered. This time period likely represents the largest volume of telehealth visits in the United States health care history. Telehealth presents unique challenges within each subspecialty, and pediatric otolaryngology is no different. This retrospective review was designed to evaluate our division of pediatric otolaryngology's experience with telehealth during the COVID19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All telehealth and face-to-face visits for the month of April 2020 completed by the Pediatric Otolaryngology Division were reviewed. A survey, utilizing both open-ended questions and Likert scaled questions was distributed to the 16 pediatric otolaryngology providers in our group to reflect their experience with telehealth during the 1-month study period. RESULTS: In April, 2020 our outpatient clinic performed a total of 877 clinic visits compared to 2260 clinic visits in April 2019. A total of 769 (88%) were telehealth visits. Telemedicine with video comprised 523 (68%) and telephone only comprised 246 (32%). There were 0 telehealth visits in April 2019. Interpretive services were required in 9.3% (N = 211) clinic visits in April 2019 and 7.5% (N = 66) of clinic visits in April 2020. The survey demonstrated a significant difference (P < .00002) in provider's anticipated telehealth experience (mean 3.94, 95% CI [3.0632, 4.8118] compared to their actual experience after the study period (mean 7.5, 95% CI [7.113, 7.887]. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low initial expectations for telehealth, the majority of our providers felt after 1 month of use that telehealth would continue to be a valuable platform post-pandemic clinical practice. Limited physical exam, particularly otoscopy, nasal endoscopy, and nasolaryngoscopy present challenges. However, with adequate information and preparation for the parents and for the physician some of the obstacles can be overcome.","output":"Pediatric Otolaryngology Telehealth in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic: Lessons Learned and Impact on the Future Management of Pediatric Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although the WTO has fulfilled several key tasks it was set up to do - providing periodic reviews of members' trade policies, resolving disputes, supporting negotiations - with the notable exceptions of the Trade Facilitation and Information Technology agreements, WTO members have not been able to negotiate new rules on \\"bread and butter\\" trade policies The importance of doing so was illustrated by the COVID-19 pandemic which saw widespread uncoordinated recourse to trade policy instruments This paper highlights four reforms that would bolster the effectiveness of the WTO as a forum for trade cooperation: (1) improving collection and reporting of information on trade-related policies;(2) supporting analysis-informed deliberation to establish a common understanding of the need and scope for cooperation in specific policy areas;(3) putting in place a stronger multilateral governance framework for plurilateral cooperation between groups of WTO members;and (4) reestablishing an effective dispute settlement system","output":"WTO Reform Priorities post-COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the German health system comprehensively. This study compared overall healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) in the first half of 2020 (COVID-19 lockdown time) with the utilization observed in previous years (2017-2019). Methods: The analysis was based on anonymized claims data of a German sickness fund (AOK PLUS), considering all individuals with at least one insurance day between 01/01/2017-30/06/2020. All hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and prescriptions were observed in the first half of each year. HCRU per 1,000 person-days (PTPD) observed in 2020 was compared with respective numbers of previous years. Results: We observed 3,322,504 insured persons (591,705,100 days) in the first half of 2020, with 0.68 hospitalizations PTPD (8.55% with at least one hospitalization). Hospitalization rates were considerably higher in the previous periods (2019/2018/2017: 0.79/0.80/0.82 inpatient stays PTPD;9.75%/9.95%/10.09% with at least one hospitalization). In the first half of 2020, 67.09% of the insured received at least one prescription of any medication with on average 1,936.87 TPD. These numbers were very similar in the pre-years (2019/2018/2017: 68.94%/70.12%/69.93% and 1,925.79/1,949.66/1,982.60 s P). Proportion of patients with prescriptions for antiinfectives particularly decreased (-14.07%;ATC-code J-). Regarding outpatient treatment, with an unchanged overall number of outpatient visits, utilization of laboratory services increased substantially, followed by visits related to COVID-19. Cancer screening visits occurred far less frequently than in previous years (0.90 PTPD in 2020 versus 1.03/1.02/1.01 PTPD in 2019/2018/2017). Conclusions: In the first half of 2020, number of hospitalizations decreased substantially. This might be explained by lockdown measures themselves (postponement of planned inpatient treatments, general underuse of health care or reduction of the so far existent overuse) but might also be due to a lower number of non-COVID infections which as also prescriptions of antiinfectives decreased in this time.","output":"POSA52 A Year-on-Year Comparison Overall German Healthcare Resource Utilization in COVID Versus Non-COVID Times: A German Claims Data Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer affecting Australian women, and the second highest cause of cancer death in Australian women. While the incidence of breast cancer is lower in Aboriginal women than non-Aboriginal women, the mortality rate for Aboriginal women is higher, with Aboriginal women 1.2 times more likely to die from the disease. In New South Wales, Aboriginal women are 69% more likely to die from their breast cancer than non-Aboriginal women. Co-design is a research method recognised to enhance collaboration between those doing the research and those impacted by the research; which when used with Aboriginal communities, ensures research and services are relevant, culturally competent and empowers communities as co-researchers. We report the development of a new protocol using co-design methods to improve breast cancer outcomes for Aboriginal women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Through a Community Mapping Project in 2018, we co-designed an iterative quantitative and qualitative study consisting of five phases. In Phase 1, we will establish a governance framework. In Phase 2, we will provide information to community members regarding the modified parts of the screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up processes and invite them to partake. In Phase 3, the research team will collect data on the outcomes of the modified processes and the outcomes for the women who have and have not participated. The data shall be analysed quantitatively and thematically in Phase 4 with Aboriginal community representatives and reported back to community. Lastly, in Phase 5, we evaluate the co-design process and adapt our protocol for use in partnership with other communities.

However, much less research is available on the sustainability of study outcomes. The purpose of this study was to assess the lasting benefits of INFORM (Improving Nursing Home Care Through Feedback On perfoRMance data) and associated factors 2.5 years after removal of study supports. INFORM was a complex, theory-based, three-arm, parallel cluster-randomized trial. In 2015C2016, we successfully implemented two theory-based feedback strategies (compared to a simple feedback approach) to increase nursing home (NH) care aides involvement in formal communications about resident care. METHODS: Sustainability analyses included 51 Western Canadian NHs that had been randomly allocated to a simple and two assisted feedback interventions in INFORM. We measured care aide involvement in formal interactions (e.g., resident rounds, family conferences) and other study outcomes at baseline (T1, 09/2014-05/2015), post-intervention (T2, 01/2017-12/2017), and long-term follow-up (T3, 06/2019C03/2020). Using repeated measures, hierarchical mixed models, adjusted for care aide, care unit, and facility variables, we assess sustainability and associated factors: organizational context (leadership, culture, evaluation) and fidelity of the original INFORM intervention. RESULTS: We analyzed data from 18 NHs (46 units, 529 care aides) in simple feedback, 19 NHs (60 units, 731 care aides) in basic assisted feedback, and 14 homes (41 units, 537 care aides) in enhanced assisted feedback. T2 (post-intervention) scores remained stable at T3 in the two enhanced feedback arms, indicating sustainability. In the simple feedback group, where scores were had remained lower than in the enhanced groups during the intervention, T3 scores rose to the level of the two enhanced feedback groups. Better culture ( = 0.099, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.005; 0.192), evaluation ( = 0.273, 95% CI 0.196; 0.351), and fidelity enactment ( = 0.290, 95% CI 0.196; 0.384) increased care aide involvement in formal interactions at T3. CONCLUSIONS: Theory-informed feedback provides long-lasting improvement in care aides involvement in formal communications about resident care. Greater intervention intensity neither implies greater effectiveness nor sustainability.

The objectives of this work were to assess the incidence of initially normal chest CT in a cohort of consecutive confirmed COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms and to compare their clinical characteristics and their outcome to matched patients with typical COVID-19 lesions at initial CT. METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd, all consecutive adult patients referred to the COVID-19 clinic of our Emergency Department were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and a normal initial chest CT after second reading was 1:1 matched based on sex, age and date of CT acquisition to a patient with positive RT-PCR and initial chest CT with typical COVID-19 lesions. Clinical data, laboratory results and outcomes (major being mechanical ventilation and/or death) were compared between both groups, using Wilcoxon signed-rank test, McNemar's chi-squared test and/or exact McNemar's test where appropriate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven chest CT out of 1091 (5.2%, 95% CI 4.0-6.7) in symptomatic patients with positive RT-PCR were normal, with a median onset of symptoms of 4.5 days (IQR [1.25-10.25]).

By thematically classifying the most common concussive clinical presentations into concussion subtypes (cognitive, ocular-motor, headache/migraine, vestibular, and anxiety/mood) and associated conditions (cervical strain and sleep disturbance), we derive useful definitions amenable to future targeted treatments. OBJECTIVE To use evidence-based methodology to characterize the 5 concussion subtypes and 2 associated conditions and report their prevalence in acute concussion patients as compared to baseline or controls within 3 d of injury. METHODS A multidisciplinary expert workgroup was established to define the most common concussion subtypes and their associated conditions and select clinical questions related to prevalence and recovery. A literature search was conducted from January 1, 1990 to November 1, 2017. Two experts abstracted study characteristics and results independently for each article selected for inclusion. A third expert adjudicated disagreements. Separate meta-analyses were conducted to do the following: 1) examine the prevalence of each subtype/associated condition in concussion patients using a proportion, 2) assess subtype/associated conditions in concussion compared to baseline/uninjured controls using a prevalence ratio, and 3) compare the differences in symptom scores between concussion subtypes and uninjured/baseline controls using a standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS The most prevalent concussion subtypes for pediatric and adult populations were headache/migraine (0.52; 95% CI = 0.37, 0.67) and cognitive (0.40; 95% CI = 0.25, 0.55), respectively. In pediatric patients, the prevalence of the vestibular subtype was also high (0.50; 95% CI = 0.40, 0.60). Adult patients were 4.4, 2.9, and 1.7 times more likely to demonstrate cognitive, vestibular, and anxiety/mood subtypes, respectively, as compared with their controls (P < .05). Children and adults with concussion showed significantly more cognitive symptoms than their respective controls (SMD = 0.66 and 0.24; P < .001). Furthermore, ocular-motor in adult patients (SMD = 0.72; P < .001) and vestibular symptoms in both pediatric and adult patients (SMD = 0.18 and 0.36; P < .05) were significantly worse in concussion patients than in controls. CONCLUSION Five concussion subtypes with varying prevalence within 3 d following injury are commonly seen clinically and identifiable upon systematic literature review. Sleep disturbance, a concussion-associated condition, is also common. There was insufficient information available for analysis of cervical strain. A comprehensive acute concussion assessment defines and characterizes the injury and, therefore, should incorporate evaluations of all 5 subtypes and associated conditions.","output":"Concussion Guidelines Step 2: Evidence for Subtype Classification."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) is a multiorgan disease with multiple faces and clinical features.

This review provides my perspective on the field during this period, integrating fundamental and applied developments and milestones. Our basic understanding of the brain-pituitary-gonadal axis led to overcoming the failure of farmed fish to ovulate and spawn in captivity, allowing us to close the fish life cycle and establish a predictable, year-round production of eggs. Dissecting the molecular and hormonal mechanisms associated with sex determination and differentiation drove technologies for producing better performing mono-sex and reproductively-sterile fish. The growing contingent of passionate fish biologists, together with the availability of innovative platforms such as transgenesis and gene editing, as well as new models such as the zebrafish and medaka, have generated many discoveries, also leading to new insights of reproductive biology in higher vertebrates including humans. Consequently, fish have now been widely accepted as vertebrate reproductive models. Perhaps the best testament of the progress in our discipline is demonstrated at the International Symposia on Reproductive Physiology of Fish (ISRPF), at which our scientific family has convened every four years since the grandfather of the field, the late Ronald Billard, organized the inaugural 1977 meeting in Paimpont, France. As the one person who has been fortunate enough to attend all of these meetings since their inception, I have witnessed first-hand the astounding evolution of our field as we capitalized on the molecular and biotechnological revolutions in the life sciences, which enabled us to provide a higher resolution of fish reproductive and endocrine processes, answer more questions, and dive into deeper comprehension.

Previous studies on this subject have mainly concerned the composition of the staff or have been normative rather than descriptive. Based on the existing literature, four aspects were expected to be of significant influence on the collaboration on oral health care practices: goals, leadership, the allocation of tasks and responsibilities and formalization. METHODS: The aim of this study was to describe a classification of collaboration between general dental practitioners and dental hygienists within oral health care practices in the Netherlands. Eighteen semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted in nine oral health care practices, which differed with regard to both practice characteristics and characteristics of the principal general dental practitioner. In all practices, the principal general dental practitioner and one dental hygienist were consulted. The interviews were conducted in the practices of the respondents and were held between October 2019 and July 2020. The interviews were analyzed through theoretical thematic analysis using Microsoft Word 2010 and Atlas.ti 8. Three researchers coded and analyzed three practices, and discussed their results. Based on their mutual conclusions, one researcher analysed all practices. The final results were reviewed and approved by the other two researchers. RESULTS: Different factors influencing the collaboration between general dental practitioners and dental hygienist in the Netherlands were found. The most important factors seemed to be leadership style and goals for collaboration. Leadership style varied from very directive to very supportive and seemed to be connected to the allocation of responsibilities. Goals for collaboration varied from predominantly patient-related to mostly practice-related. Formalization appeared to be more present in larger practices and practices that are affiliated to a dental chain.

The univariate and bivariate analysis employed to analyze descriptive statistics. The logistic regression model was applied to control confounders and determine potent predictors. Objective: This study assessed community mitigation status on covid-19 pandemic at four selected districts of southwest Ethiopia: a mixed design survey. Results: From the total of 624 participants interviewed, nearly half reported good mitigations toward fighting the covid-19 epidemic. This study suggested that nearly half (54.2%) of the participants had good knowledge about the newly emerged epidemic symptoms. Three out of five participants had good Knowledge of preventive practices (63.1%). Nearly four out of five (72.6%) participants were knowledgeable about 14 days incubation period. The odds of having good mitigation to prevent covid-19 among the participants who had single marital status were 55% lower than those married union (AOR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.86).

The data arise from a prospective study of 47 households (493 individuals) in rural Kenya, followed through a 6-month period of an RSV seasonal outbreak. Deep nasopharyngeal swabs were collected twice each week from all household members, irrespective of symptoms, and tested for RSV by multiplex PCR. The RSV G gene was sequenced.

The infection data were interval censored and assuming a random event time between observations, the average duration of virus shedding was 112 (95% confidence interval 101C123) days. The shedding durations were longer than previous estimates (39C74 days) based on immunofluorescence antigen detection or viral culture, and were shown to be strongly associated with age, severity of infection, and revealed potential interaction with other respiratory viruses.

The HCC generally develops in the liver of patients already suffering from chronic liver disease. There have been significant advances in both the curative and palliative treatment of HCC. Although liver resection is a curative treatment for HCC, its indication is often limited due to an impaired liver function reservoir. There is still a need to understand how to control liver regeneration after resection and find better cancer immunotherapy and anticancer drugs for advanced HCC. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) negatively regulate cytokine signaling related to cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune response; therefore, SOCS are thought to play an important role in HCC development and liver regeneration. ABSTRACT: Cytokines are secreted soluble glycoproteins that regulate cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins negatively regulate cytokine signaling and form a classical negative feedback loop in the signaling pathways. There are eight members of the SOCS family. The SOCS proteins are all comprised of a loosely conserved N-terminal domain, a central Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, and a highly conserved SOCS box at the C-terminus. The role of SOCS proteins has been implicated in the regulation of cytokines and growth factors in liver diseases. The SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins are involved in immune response and inhibit protective interferon signaling in viral hepatitis. A decreased expression of SOCS3 is associated with advanced stage and poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DNA methylations of SOCS1 and SOCS3 are found in HCC. Precise regulation of liver regeneration is influenced by stimulatory and inhibitory factors after partial hepatectomy (PH), in particular, SOCS2 and SOCS3 are induced at an early time point after PH. Evidence supporting the important role of SOCS signaling during liver regeneration also supports a role of SOCS signaling in HCC. Immuno-oncology drugs are now the first-line therapy for advanced HCC. The SOCS can be potential targets for HCC in terms of cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and immune response. In this literature review, we summarize recent findings of the SOCS family proteins related to HCC and liver diseases.","output":"Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling and Hepatocellular Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A patient with severe asthma on benralizumab therapy was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection.

Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in elite futsal players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-Recent world events (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) led to an unparalleled situation in sports. Players were forced to stay at home for a prolonged period and not allowed to use their team's training facilities or even exercise outdoors. The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in futsal players. Ten elite male players performed a 10-m sprint, horizontal and vertical jump, and body composition measurements before and after the quarantine (i.e., 70 days). Pre-post confinement differences in horizontal jump distance, countermovement jump variables, sprinting time, and body composition were analyzed by a paired sample t-test and effect sizes (ESs). A large and significant decline was observed in sprint ability (p = 0.004; ES = 1.31). Small and nonsignificant differences were found in horizontal jump performance (p = 0.243; ES = -0.39). Nonsignificant differences were observed in countermovement jump (CMJ) height (p = 0.076; ES = -0.63) but moderate-to-large significant declines were found in CMJ eccentric deceleration impulse, rate of force development, peak power, velocity, and landing peak force (p  0.05; ES = -0.52 - 1.23). Finally, trivial and nonsignificant differences were obtained on body composition parameters. In summary, sprint performance and specific CMJ kinetic variables were significantly affected by long-term reduced training, whereas vertical jump height and horizontal jump distance and body composition were not. Practitioners are advised to implement efficient sprint-oriented and eccentric-oriented training strategies to optimize return to competition after prolonged detraining periods.","output":"Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Neuromuscular Performance and Body Composition in Elite Futsal Players."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dialysis patients are extremely vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection with high rates of hospitalization and mortality rates estimated at 20-30%. In January of 2021, the University of Virginia Dialysis Program initiated a program wide vaccination campaign administering Pfizer BioNTech mRNA SARS-CoV-2 (BNT162b2) vaccine. To characterize the time-dependent decline in humoral immunity, we performed a prospective cohort study measuring serial monthly semi quantitative IgG antibody levels to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain in fully vaccinated in-center hemodialysis patients. Measurements were taken beginning at 2 months post full vaccination through 6 months after full vaccination. Early results showed similar seroconversion rates as prior studies with 88% obtaining positive antibody levels. Those with prior infection obtained the highest antibody levels. Over the ensuing months, patient antibody levels declined at an adjusted average rate of 31% per month. At the conclusion of the study, 40% of patients remaining in the cohort possessed either negative or borderline IgG antibody levels. Projecting future antibody levels based on the slopes of antibody level decay suggests 65% of the cohort will progress to borderline or negative antibody levels at 10 months post full vaccination. In summary, we studied long term vaccine response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in hemodialysis patients.

Coronaviruses have produced two pandemics and one epidemic in the last two decades. The current pandemic has created a worldwide catastrophe threatening the lives of over 15 million as of July 2020. Current research efforts have been focused on producing a vaccine or repurposing current drug compounds to develop a therapeutic. There is, however, a need to study the active site preferences of relevant targets, such as the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro), to determine ways to optimize these drug compounds. The ensemble docking and characterization work described in this article demonstrates the multifaceted features of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, molecular guidelines to improving binding affinity, and ultimately the optimization of drug candidates. A total of 220 compounds were docked into both the 5R7Z and 6LU7 SARS-CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures. Several key preferences for strong binding to the four subsites (S1, S1', S2, and S4) were identified, such as accessing hydrogen binding hotspots, hydrophobic patches, and utilization of primarily aliphatic instead of aromatic substituents. After optimization efforts using the design guidelines developed from the molecular docking studies, the average docking score of the parent compounds was improved by 6.59 -log10(Kd) in binding affinity which represents an increase of greater than six orders of magnitude. Using the optimization guidelines, the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor cinanserin was optimized resulting in an increase in binding affinity of 4.59 -log10(Kd) and increased protease inhibitor bioactivity. The results of molecular dynamic (MD) simulation of cinanserin-optimized compounds CM02, CM06, and CM07 revealed that CM02 and CM06 fit well into the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro [Protein Data Bank (PDB) accession number 6LU7] and formed strong and stable interactions with the key residues, Ser-144, His-163, and Glu-166. The enhanced binding affinity produced demonstrates the utility of the design guidelines described.

Demographics, hospital and ICU length of stay, duration of ECMO therapy, days on mechanical ventilation, fluid balance, need for decompressive laparotomy, amount of blood products, prognostic scores (CCI (Charlson Comorbidity Index), SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), RESP(Respiratory ECMO Survival Prediction), SAVE (Survival after Veno-Arterial ECMO)), and the total known length of survival were assessed. Results: A total of n = 495 patients underwent ECMO. Eight patients with acute pancreatitis received ECLS (seven veno-venous, one veno-arterial). Five (71%) required decompressive laparotomy as salvage therapy due to abdominal hypertension. Two patients with acute pancreatitis (25%) survived to hospital discharge. The overall median length of survival was 22 days. Survivors required less fluid in the first 72 h of ECMO support and showed lower values for all prognostic scores. Conclusion: ECLS can be performed as a rescue therapy in patients with pancreatitis and secondary ARDS, but nevertheless mortality remains still high.

Recently, N-terminal of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was a potentially independent risk factor for COVID-19 in-hospital death. The present study aimed to find new optimal cut points for NT-proBNP across censored survival failure time outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: This cohort study was conducted on 272 patients with COVID-19 whose initial records were recorded from March 2020 to July 2020. Demographic characteristics, clinical examinations, and laboratory measurements were collected at the beginning of the admission registered in the patient record system located in the hospital. We used the maximally selected rank statistics to determine the optimal cut points for NT-proBNP (the most significant split based on the standardized log-rank test). Survival time was defined as the days from hospital admission to discharge day. In this cohort study, two optimal cut points for NT-proBNP were 331 (pg/mL) and 11,126 (pg/mL) based on a survival model. The adjusted HR of NT-proBNP for in-hospital death was 3.41 (95% CI: 1.22C9.51, P = 0.02) for medium against low category, and 3.84 (95% CI: 1.30C11.57, P = 0.01) for high in comparison with low group. CONCLUSIONS: We reported a dramatically increased concentration of NT-proBNP among COVID-19 patients without heart failure in both severe and non-severe cases. Moreover, our study showed that a high level of NT-proBNP was highly associated with the prolonged survival time of patients with COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the relationship between CBS and outcomes after stent retriever thrombectomy in the interventional arm of the SWIFT PRIME trial. METHODS CBS was calculated for the endovascular arm (IV tissue plasminogen activator plus Solitaire stent retriever) of SWIFT PRIME using baseline CTA. The cohort of 69 patients was divided into three groups according to their CBS values: CBS 0-5 (n=14), CBS 6-7 (n=23), and CBS 8-9 (n=32). RESULTS The mean age of the 69 patients who formed the study cohort was 63.213.1 years, mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 16.84.5, and 55% of the patients were male. There was no difference in clinical characteristics among the three groups, except for the baseline Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (p=0.049). The site of proximal occlusion varied significantly among the three groups (p<0.001).

In X-irradiated CRFK cells, a dose-dependent increase in DSB-triggered senescence was detected according to morphological changes and using senescence-associated  galactosidase staining assay. Moreover, our data indicated that in CRFK cells, the major DDR pathway, which involves the phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser139, was normally activated by ATM kinases.

By the second half of 2020, when alcohol sales were partially allowed again (partial ban 2), trauma volume increased by 163-250%, thus returning to pre-COVID-19 levels. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates a clear trend of decreased trauma volume during periods of complete alcohol prohibition compared to non- and partial alcohol bans. This finding suggests that temporary alcohol bans can be used to decrease health facility traffic during national emergencies.","output":"Trauma trends during COVID-19 alcohol prohibition at a South African regional hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent emergence of the novel coronavirus (CoV) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a global threat to human health and economy.

One of the most important proteins of the virus is an enzyme, called 3CLpro or main protease, already identified as an important pharmacological target also in SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS) viruses. This protein triggers the production of a whole series of enzymes necessary for the virus to carry out its replicating and infectious activities. Therefore, it is crucial to gain a deeper understanding of 3CLpro structure and function in order to effectively target this enzyme. All-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to examine the different conformational behaviors of the monomeric and dimeric form of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro apo structure, as revealed by microsecond time scale MD simulations. Our results also shed light on the conformational dynamics of the loop regions at the entry of the catalytic site.

The aim of this multicentre study was to review the outcome of a Swedish cohort of children who underwent STEP. METHODS All children who had a STEP procedure at one of the four centres of paediatric surgery in Sweden between September 2005 and January 2013 were included in this observational cohort study. Demographic details, and data from the time of STEP and at follow-up were collected from the case records and analysed. RESULTS Twelve patients had a total of 16 STEP procedures; four children underwent a second STEP. The first STEP was performed at a median age of 58 (range 09-190) months. There was no death at a median follow-up of 372 (range 30-875) months and no child had small bowel transplantation. Seven of the 12 children were weaned from parenteral nutrition at a median of 195 (range 23-429) months after STEP. CONCLUSION STEP is a useful procedure for selected patients with short bowel syndrome and seems to facilitate weaning from parenteral nutrition.

Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate small towns are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of the disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita initially decrease with population size. However, during the long-term course of the pandemic, this urban advantage vanishes and large cities start to exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per capita after about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that these patterns may be related to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas.

Results: At the end of the first wave of the pandemic in France (11 May 2020), 2112 kidney transplant recipients and 487 candidates answered the survey. More candidates than recipients left their home during the lockdown, mainly for health care (80.1% vs. 69.4%; P<0.001). More candidates than recipients reported being exposed to Covid-19 patients (2.7% vs. 1.2%; P=0.006).

Current chemical-based methods to eliminate microglia in glial cell culture introduce various molecular and functional alterations to astrocytes. Here, we describe a novel two-step approach to achieve a complete elimination of microglia without affecting the biological properties of co-cultured astrocytes by temporal treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We verify TSA as a potent inducer for microglial-specific apoptotic cell death, which also causes comprehensive gene expression changes in astrocytes. However, withdrawal of TSA not only ensures no microglia repopulation, but also restores all the gene expression changes in terms of astrocyte functions, including neurotrophic factors, glutamate and potassium transporters, and reactive astrocyte subtypes. By contrast, withdrawal of PLX5622, the commonly used colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor neither prevents microglia repopulation nor restores the gene expression changes mentioned above. Using this method, we are able to discriminate differential roles of microglia and astrocytes in the induced expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon various pathological stimuli including the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This simple and efficient method can be customized for the understanding of microglia-astrocyte interaction and the development of epigenetic therapies that target over-activated microglia in neuroinflammation-related diseases.","output":"A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor-based approach to eliminate microglia and retain astrocyte properties in glial cell culture."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on those working in the UK?s creative economy, and particularly its entertainment sector.

Many glycosylated viruses subvert this immune surveillance function and exploit DC\\\\SIGN as a port of entry and for trans\\\\infection of target cells. The glycosylation pattern on HBV surface antigens (HBsAg) together with the tissue distribution of HBV would allow interaction between HBV and DC\\\\SIGN and its liver\\\\expressed homologue L\\\\SIGN. Therefore, a detailed study to investigate the binding of HBV to DC\\\\SIGN and L\\\\SIGN was performed. For HCV, both DC\\\\SIGN and L\\\\SIGN are known to bind envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2.

Exposure to live poultry was believed to be the major route of infection. There are limited data on how the general public changes their practices regarding live poultry exposure in response to the early outbreak of this novel influenza and the frequency of population exposure to live poultry in different areas of China. METHODOLOGY: This study investigated population exposures to live birds from various sources during the outbreak of H7N9 in Guangzhou city, China in 2013 and compared them with those observed during the 2006 influenza A(H5N1) outbreak. Adults were telephone-interviewed using two-stage sampling, stratified by three residential areas of Guangzhou: urban areas and two semi-rural areas in one of which (Zengcheng) A(H7N9) virus was detected in a chicken from wet markets. Logistic regression models were built to describe practices protecting against avian influenza, weighted by age and gender, and then compare these practices across residential areas in 2013 with those from a comparable 2006 survey. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 1196 respondents, 45% visited wet markets at least daily and 22.0% reported buying live birds from wet markets at least weekly in April-May, 2013, after the H7N9 epidemic was officially declared in late March 2013. Of those buying live birds, 32.3% reported touching birds when buying and 13.7% would slaughter the poultry at home. Although only 10.1% of the respondents reported raising backyard birds, 92.1% of those who did so had physical contact with the birds they raised. Zengcheng respondents were less likely to report buying live birds from wet markets, but more likely to buy from other sources when compared to urban respondents. Compared with the 2006 survey, the prevalence of buying live birds from wet markets, touching when buying and slaughtering birds at home had substantially declined in the 2013 survey. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Although population exposures to live poultry were substantially fewer in 2013 compared to 2006, wet markets and backyard poultry remained the two major sources of live bird exposures for the public in Guangzhou in 2013.

We compared official indicators to identify which vulnerabilities better determined the exposure risk to COVID-19 in both the most and least affected countries. To achieve this purpose, we collected indicators from the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank, and the Brazilian Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE).

However, there are uncertainties pertaining to the risks of post-bariatric severe hypoglycaemia (SH), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), end-stage kidney diseases (ESKDs) and all-cause mortality in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially among Asian populations. METHODS: A retrospective population-based cohort of 1702 obese T2DM patients who were free of CVD and ESKD were assembled based on the 2006-17 Hospital Authority database. One-to-five propensity-score matching was used to balance baseline covariates between patients in bariatric surgery and control groups. Incidence rates (IRs) of SH, CVD, Stage 4/5 chronic kidney diseases (CKD), ESKD and all-cause mortality events for two groups were calculated. Hazard ratios (HR) for SH, CVD and Stage 4/5 CKD events were assessed using Cox-proportional hazard models. Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured up to 60 months. RESULTS: Over a mean follow-up period of 32 months with 5725 person-years, cumulative incidences of mortality, CVD, Stage 4/5 CKD, ESKD and SH were 0, 0.036, 0.050, 0.017 and 0.020, respectively. The surgery group had a significant reduction in risk of CVD events (HR = 0.464, P = 0.015) and no occurrence of mortality events.

However, storing all the document embeddings within an index produces bulky indexes which are expensive to serve. Recently, BPR (Yamada et al., 2021) and JPQ (Zhan et al., 2021a) have been proposed which train the model to produce binary document vectors, which reduce the index 32x and more. The authors showed these binary embedding models significantly outperform more traditional index compression techniques like Product Quantization (PQ). Previous work evaluated these approaches just in-domain, i.e. the methods were evaluated on tasks for which training data is available. In practice, retrieval models are often used in an out-of-domain setting, where they have been trained on a publicly available dataset, like MS MARCO, but are then used for some custom dataset for which no training data is available. In this work, we show that binary embedding models like BPR and JPQ can perform significantly worse than baselines once there is a domain-shift involved. We propose a modification to the training procedure of BPR and JPQ and combine it with a corpus specific generative procedure which allow the adaptation of BPR and JPQ to any corpus without requiring labeled training data. Our domain-adapted strategy known as GPL is model agnostic, achieves an improvement by up-to 19.3 and 11.6 points in nDCG@10 across the BEIR benchmark in comparison to BPR and JPQ while maintaining its 32x memory efficiency.

Association of genetic polymorphisms in these two genes with 25-hyroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level has been reported in several studies. However, this association has been reported to be discrepant among populations from different ethnicities. Therefore, we aimed in this study to investigate association of the two major single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in GC (rs4588 and rs7014) and a SNP (rs12794714) in CYP2R1 in postmenopausal women in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study randomly selected 459 postmenopausal women (aged 50 years) of multiple ethnicities in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Blood samples were collected from all participating women for DNA extraction and for assessment of serum levels of total 25(OH)D, directly measured free 25(OH)D and other biochemical parameters. SNPs in selected vitD related genes (rs4588 in GC, c.1364G > T with transcript ID: NM_001204307.1 and rs7041 in GC, c.1353A > C with transcript ID NM_001204307.1 and rs12794714 in CYP2R1, c.177G > A with transcript ID NM_024514.4) were determined in DNA samples using Sanger DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Minor allele frequency for rs4588, rs7041 and rs12794714 were 0.25, 0.44 and 0.42 respectively. Genotypes of rs7041 showed significant difference in total 25(OH)D level but not in free 25(O)D level (P = 0.023). In comparison, genotypes of rs4588 and rs12794714 did not show any significant difference neither in total nor in free 25(OH)D level. Post hoc test revealed that total 25(OH)D was lower in the rs7041 TT allele compared to the GG allele (P = 0.022). Chi-square test showed that vitD status was associated with rs7041 genotypes (P = 0.035). In addition, rs7041 minor alleles were found to have an association with vitD deficiency with a statistical significant odds ratio (>1) of 2.24 and 3.51 with P = 0.006 and P = 0.007 for TG and GG genotypes respectively. CONCLUSION: The rs7041 SNP in GC was associated with total 25(OH)D level in postmenopausal women in Saudi Arabia, while rs4588 in GC and rs12794714 in CYP2R1 did not show association with total 25(OH)D. Further studies exploring additional variants in vitD related genes are needed to understand genetic factors underlying vitD deficiency in Saudi population.","output":"Association of SNPs in GC and CYP2R1 with total and directly measured free 25-hydroxyvitamin D in multi-ethnic postmenopausal women in Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 2020, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) Research Academy and the ESCAP Board launched the first of three scheduled surveys to evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) services in Europe and to assess the abilities of CAP centers to meet the new challenges brought on by the crisis. The survey was a self-report questionnaire, using a multistage process, which was sent to 168 heads of academic CAP services in 24 European countries. Eighty-two responses (56 complete) from 20 countries, representing the subjective judgement of heads of CAP centers, were received between mid-April and mid-May 2020. Most respondents judged the impact of the crisis on the mental health of their patients as medium (52%) or strong (33%). A large majority of CAP services reported no COVID-19 positive cases among their inpatients and most respondents declared no or limited sick leaves in their team due to COVID-19. Outpatient, daycare, and inpatient units experienced closures or reductions in the number of treated patients throughout Europe. In addition, a lower referral rate was observed in most countries. Respondents considered that they were well equipped to handle COVID-19 patients despite a lack of protective equipment. Telemedicine was adopted by almost every team despite its sparse use prior to the crisis. Overall, these first results were surprisingly homogeneous, showing a substantially reduced patient load and a moderate effect of the COVID-19 crisis on psychopathology. The effect on the organization of CAP services appears profound. COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of new technologies, including telepsychiatry.

The purpose of this study was to create and document persona development to deliver narrative-focused health education for parents on Twitter with the goal of increasing uptake of HPV vaccination among adolescents. Methods: Leveraging data from a mixed-method study conducted in the U.S. with a diverse population of parents with adolescents ages 9C14, we used both qualitative and quantitative data (e.g., the National Immunization SurveyTeen, focus groups, and social media) to create personas. These data sources were used to identify and develop key characteristics for personas to reflect a range of parents and their diverse understandings and experiences related to HPV vaccination. A parent advisory board provided insight and helped refine persona development. Results: Four personas emerged and were characterized as the (1) Informed Altruist, (2) Real Talker, (3) Information Gatherer, and (4) Supporter. Characteristics differed across personas and provided insights into targeted narrative strategies. Described attributes included demographics, psychographics, communication style, vaccine goals and aspirations, vaccine challenges and frustrations, and vaccine hesitancy. Discussion: This work demonstrates how multiple data sources can be used to create personas to deliver social media messages that can address the diverse preferences and needs of parents for HPV vaccine information.

We aimed to evaluate the change in AECOPD treatment frequency during the first 6 weeks of lockdown in the UK compared with 2019 and assess changes in self-reported behaviour and well-being. METHODS: In this observational study in Leicestershire, UK, patients with COPD under a secondary care clinic were recruited. Exacerbation frequency in the first 6 weeks of COVID lockdown was compared with the same period in 2019 using electronic health records. A telephone survey was used to assess changes in anxiety, inhaler adherence, physical activity, and behaviour during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods compared to normal. RESULTS: 160 participants were recruited (mean [sd] age 67.3 [8.1] years, 88 [55%] male, FEV1 34.3 [13] % predicted). 140 [88%] reported at least one AECOPD in the previous year. Significantly more community treated exacerbations were observed in 2020 compared with 2019 (126 versus 99, p=0.026). The increase was a result of multiple courses of treatment, with a similar proportion of patients receiving at least one course (34.4% versus 33.8%). During lockdown participants reported significantly increased anxiety, adherence to their preventative inhalers, and good adherence to shielding advice (all p<0.001). A significant reduction in self-reported physical activity and visitors was reported (both p<0.001). DISCUSSION: Treatment for AECOPD events increased during the first 6 weeks of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the UK compared to 2019.

The purpose of this study was to compare the level of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and, fear of COVID-19 between students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms and students without any suspected symptoms during the pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted online among Bangladeshi students from May to July 2020. Anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, PTSS, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, Patient Health Questionnaire, the Impact of Event Scale, and Fear of COVID-19 Scale, respectively. College and University students were the participants of the study. Results Among 3777 students, 1259 had suspected COVID-19 symptoms and 2518 had no suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Students who experienced suspected COVID-19 symptoms had higher prevalence (moderate to severe) of depressive symptoms (61.15% vs. 47.62%), anxiety symptoms (44.96% vs. 36.97%), and PTSS (48.3% vs. 39.75%) compared to those who had no such symptoms. The study identified having suspected COVID-19 symptoms as a significant associated factor for anxiety symptoms (1=1.39; 95% CI: 1.03-1.74), depressive symptoms (1=1.88; 95% CI: 1.43-2.32), PTSS (1=3.66; 95% CI: 2.66-4.65) and fear of COVID-19 (1=0.48; 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.94). Students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms thought more that they would be better off dead, or of hurting themselves (P<.01) and felt more afraid as if something awful might happen (P<.01) than their counterparts. Conclusion Mental health difficulties are more prevalent among students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms than the students without having such symptoms. This finding suggests that public health practitioners should deploy a rapid diagnostic system and consider psychological intervention in addition to clinical management for those who have COVID-19 like symptoms during the pandemic.","output":"Mental health difficulties in students with suspected COVID-19 symptoms and students without suspected COVID-19 symptoms: A cross-sectional comparative study during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus spike protein S is a large homo-trimeric protein embedded in the membrane of the virion particle. Protein S binds to angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2, ACE2, of the host cell, followed by proteolysis of the spike protein, drastic protein conformational change with exposure of the fusion peptide of the virus, and entry of the virion into the host cell. The structural elements that govern conformational plasticity of the spike protein are largely unknown. Here, we present a methodology that relies upon graph and centrality analyses, augmented by bioinformatics, to identify and characterize large H-bond clusters in protein structures. We apply this methodology to protein S ectodomain and find that, in the closed conformation, the three protomers of protein S bring the same contribution to an extensive central network of H-bonds, has a relatively large H-bond cluster at the receptor binding domain, and a cluster near a protease cleavage site. Markedly different H-bonding at these three clusters in open and pre-fusion conformations suggest dynamic H-bond clusters could facilitate structural plasticity and selection of a protein S protomer for binding to the host receptor, and proteolytic cleavage. From analyses of spike protein sequences we identify patches of histidine and carboxylate groups that could be involved in transient proton binding.","output":"A graph-based approach identifies dynamic H-bond communication networks in spike protein S of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cats are susceptible to natural infection with several strains of feline coronavirus that result in either effusive and noneffusive feline infectious peritonitis or enteritis.

The qRT-PCR assay and western blot were conducted to evaluate related factors expressions of Wnt signaling pathway in both bladder cancer 5637 cells and stem cells. Loss of function assays were carried out to detect the influence of endostatin on the proliferation, migration, cell proliferation and apoptosis of bladder cancer cells. We demonstrated that endostatin triggered the degradation of ?-catenin, a key mediator of Wnt signaling. The activation of the endostatin blocked ?-catenin function and inhibited cell growth and migration of bladder cancer. In order to verify that the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway was inhibited by endostain in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells, the Wnt/?-catenin signaling pathway-associated molecules, including DKK1, LRP5, TCF4, ?-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc, were evaluated in 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells. The western blotting results showed that expressions of these molecules were remarkably increased in the 5637 bladder cancer cells and stem cells compared to the control group.

We vaccinated mongrel dogs with the VR1012NH36 vaccine for prophylaxis and immunotherapy against a high dose Leishmania chagasi infection (7 x 108 infective amastigotes). The untreated controls developed more symptoms, higher parasite/lymphocyte ratio, smaller DTH reactions, lower proportions of NH36-specific CD4+ cells and sustained NH36-specific CD8+ cell counts than dogs of the prophylaxis group. In the immunotherapy treated group, enlarged DTH reactions, enhanced CD4+ and sustained CD8+ lymphocyte proportions were also detected, however, without reduction of symptoms or parasite/lymphocyte ratio, indicating that the vaccine was sufficiently potent to prevent but not to control the disease. Both treatments determined higher survival rates. Anti-FML antibodies increased in vaccinated and control dogs while anti-NH36 antibodies were only increased in vaccinees (p= 0.000). The parasite load of an untreated survivor control dog (638.05 parasites) felt outside the IC95% of that of vaccinated dogs (32.02, IC95% 9.45C64.59) suggesting that both vaccination treatments succeeded in reducing the Leishmania infective burden.

Select high expression genes for breast cancer and use bioinformatics methods to predict the biological function of FAM83A. Methods: Genes with significant differences in expression between breast tumors and normal breast tissue libraries were selected from CGAP's SAGE Digital Gene Expression Displayer (DGED) database. An unknown functional gene, FAM83A, which is highly expressed in breast cancer, was screened. We performed an analysis of the gene structure, subcellular localization, physicochemical properties of the encoding products, functional sites, protein structure, and functional domains. Results: Through SAGE DGED, a total of 185 genes with expression differences were found. The structure and function of FAM83A have ideal predictions, and it is generally determined that this gene encodes a nuclear protein with a nucleoprotein.

However, the pathways between frailty, postoperative complications, and mortality are poorly described. The authors hypothesized that the occurrence of postoperative complications would mediate a substantial proportion of the total effect of frailty on mortality after elective noncardiac surgery. METHODS Following protocol registration, the authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of intermediate- to high-risk elective noncardiac surgery patients (2016) using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program data. The authors conducted Bayesian mediation analysis of the relationship between preoperative frailty (exposure, using the Risk Analysis Index), serious complications (mediator), and 30-day mortality (outcome), comprehensively adjusting for confounders. The authors estimated the total effect of frailty on mortality (composed of the indirect effect mediated by complications and the remaining direct effect of frailty) and estimated the proportion of the frailty-mortality association mediated by complications. RESULTS The authors identified 205,051 patients; 1,474 (0.7%) died. Complications occurred in 20,211 (9.9%). A 2 SD increase in frailty score resulted in a total association with mortality equal to an odds ratio of 3.79 (95% credible interval, 2.48 to 5.64), resulting from a direct association (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% credible interval, 1.34 to 2.30) and an indirect association mediated by complications (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% credible interval, 1.58 to 2.96).

Cities need to remake themselves from pure consumption to more resilient and circular centers, finding inspiration in their cultural and natural heritage and the history that generated it. The City of Rijeka, Croatia, one of the partners in the CLIC project (an EU-funded Horizon 2020 research project entitled Circular models Leveraging Investments in Cultural heritage adaptive reuse), represents an exceptional example of how to manage the change from an industrial port city to a more sustainable and citizen-oriented living space, looking at the potentials of the cultural and historical layers as opportunities for the population. The City of Rijeka, aware of such potentials, applied successfully as a European Capital of Culture 2020 (ECoC 2020), while unlikely facing the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In Rijeka, thanks to the CLIC Heritage Innovative Partnership (HIP) program, the efforts to associate the circular economy and historic urban landscape benefit from an exceptional local awareness of the urban cultural and natural heritage, permitting the elaboration of the cultural corridor concept. By using the historical river of the city, the Rje?ina, as a connecting line of several heritage assets leading toward the Sea waterfront, the cultural corridor represents a space of culture creation based on continuity and proximity, where all citizens can securely reappropriate dismissed parts of the city, similar to the commons management practice. The cultural corridor has been imagined as a spatial implementation model that needs actions to be actuated. A set of actions was designed through the urban seeding process, tested in a workshop methodology, meant to address the HUL regeneration through an awareness-raising and cocreation approach by codesigning through situated learning, possible permanent or temporary actions, activities, assets to be replicated in the corridor and, per extension, in the entire city. This article will explain the way the cultural corridor concept and urban seeding were generated in the City of Rijeka, giving evidence of the motivations and the proposals made in parallel with the existing initiatives of the city and its cultural movements. ? 2021 by the authors.

This observational study recruited 27 patients with hemophilia and arthropathy. Knee, ankle and elbow joints were assessed. The frequency of clinical hemarthrosis, pain intensity, pressure pain threshold, and joint ROM were evaluated. (3) Results. Following lockdown, a significant deterioration of joint condition, perceived joint pain and range of motion was noted in all joints. There were no changes in the frequency of knee hemarthrosis, while the frequency of ankle hemarthrosis significantly reduced. However, the frequency of elbow hemarthrosis increased. Depending on the degree of hemophilia severity, there were changes in pressure pain threshold in the elbow and in pain intensity and range of motion of the ankle joint. According to the type of treatment, i.e., prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment, there were differences in the joint condition in elbows and the plantar flexion movement of the ankle. There were no differences in the knee joint based on the severity of the disease, the type of treatment or the development of inhibitors (4). Conclusions. Because of the COVID?19 lockdown, the musculoskeletal status of patients with hemophilia deteriorated. Joint condition, perceived pain, and range of motion were significantly affected.

Median time between the onset of symptoms and the infusion of plasma was 7 days (IQR 4C10). A similar group of 82 patients who received only standard treatment, during a period in which CP was not available, were selected as a control group. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 26.8% for controls and 14.6% for CP patients (P = 0.131) and ICU admission was 8.5% for controls and 4.9% for CP patients (P = 0.467). Mortality tended to be lower in the high-titer group (9.5%) than in the low-titer group (20%), and in patients transfused within the first 7 days of symptom onset (10%) than in patients transfused later (19.1%), although the differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.307 and P = 0.355 respectively).

In addition, these discussions typically focus on gender, often failing to consider how race, class, and other dimensions of identity influence the experiences of women in medicine. In this article, the authors argue that neoliberal feminism is the dominant strand of feminism in the discourse of women in medicine.

The authors suggest that the pandemic is an opportunity to pursue a more expansive vision of feminism in medicine. They propose intersectional feminism as a theoretical framework that can widen the understanding of what is possible: moving from individual actions resulting in incremental change to collective action that can transform systems. Intersectional feminism enables a push for structures, institutions, and practices that support all workers, including basic income, labor protections, public childcare, accessible health care, transportation justice, and migrant rights.

Direct sequence analysis of the pathogen, particularly at a population level, is generally thought to be too cumbersome, technically difficult, and expensive. We present here a novel application of mass spectrometry (MS)Cbased technology in characterizing viral sequence variations that overcomes these problems, and we apply it retrospectively to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The success rate of the MS-based analysis for detecting SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) sequence variations was determined to be 95% with 75 copies of viral RNA per reaction, which is sufficient to directly analyze both clinical and cultured samples. Analysis of 13 SARS-CoV isolates from the different stages of the Singapore outbreak identified nine sequence variations that could define the molecular relationship between them and pointed to a new, previously unidentified, primary route of introduction of SARS-CoV into the Singapore population. Our direct determination of viral sequence variation from a clinical sample also clarified an unresolved epidemiological link regarding the acquisition of SARS in a German patient. We were also able to detect heterogeneous viral sequences in primary lung tissues, suggesting a possible coevolution of quasispecies of virus within a single host. CONCLUSION: This study has further demonstrated the importance of improving clinical and epidemiological studies of pathogen transmission through the use of genetic analysis and has revealed the MS-based analysis to be a sensitive and accurate method for characterizing SARS-CoV genetic variations in clinical samples. We suggest that this approach should be used routinely during outbreaks of a wide variety of agents, in order to allow the most effective control.","output":"SARS Transmission Pattern in Singapore Reassessed by Viral Sequence Variation Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Knowledge, attitudes, perception, and preventative practices regarding coronavirus- 2019 (COVID-19) are crucial in its prevention and control. Several studies have noted that the majority of people in sub-Saharan African are noncompliant with proposed health and safety measures recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective country health departments. In most sub-Saharan African countries, noncompliance is attributable to ignorance and misinformation, thereby raising questions about peoples knowledge, attitudes, perception, and practices towards COVID-19 in these settings. This situation is particularly of concern for governments and public health experts. Thus, this scoping review is aimed at mapping evidence on the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and preventive practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). METHODS: Systematic searches of relevant articles were performed using databases such as the EBSCOhost, PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, the WHO library and grey literature. Arksey and OMalleys framework guided the study. The risk of bias for included primary studies was assessed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). NVIVO version 10 was used to analyse the data and a thematic content analysis was used to present the reviews narrative account. RESULTS: A total of 3037 eligible studies were identified after the database search. Only 28 studies met the inclusion criteria after full article screening and were included for data extraction. Studies included populations from the following SSA countries: Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan, and Sierra Leone. All the included studies showed evidence of knowledge related to COVID-19. Eleven studies showed that participants had a positive attitude towards COVID-19, and fifteen studies showed that participants had good practices towards COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the participants had adequate knowledge related to COVID-19. Despite adequate knowledge, the attitude was not always positive, thereby necessitating further education to convey the importance of forming a positive attitude and continuous preventive practice towards reducing contraction and transmission of COVID\\\\19.","output":"Knowledge, attitude, perception, and preventative practices towards COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article provides the findings of an exploratory, qualitative study on distance learning policies and practices from a purposeful sample of five California school districts and 25 district and school leaders with large numbers and/or larger percentages of current or former English Learners. To understand the extent to which leaders address English Learners/Emergent Bilinguals (EL/EM) needs during the pandemic, we posed the following research question: What are leaders local policies and practices in designing and implementing distance learning to promote equity for English Learners? We gathered three key district policy documents across three moments during the pandemic: (1) COVID-19 Operations Written Reports (Spring 2020), (2) School Reopening Plans (Summer 2020), and (3) Learning Continuity and Attendance Plans (Fall 2020). We also conducted interviews and triangulated data sources using grounded theory to analyze and understand how equity is framed and implemented. Data triangulation and iterative rounds of coding allowed us to identify three inter-related findings: (1) leading in the crisis of connectivity and bridging the digital divide;(2) maximizing diverse ELs learning experiences;and, (3) building from collaborative leadership cultures to collaborative virtual leadership cultures. Using these key findings, we conceptualized the framework for equity leadership for English Learners to address the needs of this underserved population.

However, a recent study revealed that that a long sequence of DNA that is inherited from our Neanderthal ancestors can be linked to severe COVID-19 infection and hospitalization. Substantial evidence now indicates that our genetic background may be involved in the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and the rapid progress of COVID-19 in some infected individuals. Although both morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 strongly depends on key factors such as age and co-existing health conditions, potential classes of human genomic variants possibly affect the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its progress. Despite Iran and Mongolia seem to share the same SARS-CoV-2 mutation cluster, the COVID-19 mortality rates in these two countries are drastically different. While the population in Iran is 25.8 times higher than that of Mongolia, the number of confirmed cases is 1170 times higher. Moreover, the death rate shows a drastic difference. Since Neanderthals interbred with modern humans in Middle East between 47,000 and 65,000 years ago before going extinct 40,000 years ago, some Iranians have much more Neanderthal DNA than other people. Although neither genetic background nor environmental factors alone can determine our risk of developing severe COVID-19, our genes clearly affect both the development and progression of infectious diseases including COVID-19. Given these considerations, we believe that these great differences, at least to some extent, can be due to the proportion of Neanderthal genes among the people of these two countries","output":"How Our Neanderthal Genes Affect the COVID-19 Mortality: Iran and Mongolia, Two Countries with the Same SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Cluster but Different Mortality Rates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to assess the extent and rate of vaginal tissue injury associated with the utilization of various monopolar electrosurgical power settings when laparoscopically transecting vaginal tissue. METHODS This is an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved prospective, paired, single-blinded study. Externalized porcine vagina was transected using monopolar energy at 30, 50, and 80 W in the cut mode with laparoscopic Endo Shears. The slides were prepared and stained with both hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome and were examined by board-certified veterinary pathologists blinded to the study. RESULTS There were 18 swine; each animal was tested on all 3 power settings (n = 54). Tissue injury was measured to a mean (SD) of 767 (519) m at 30 W, 690 (600) m at 50 W, and 556 (470) m at 80 W. When comparing the monopolar settings, the results were as follows: 30 versus 50 W (P = 0.33), 30 versus 80 W (P = 0.067), and 50 versus 80 W (P = 0.17). The mean (SD) time for complete transection was measured at each power setting (n = 18), with 35.8 (5.4) seconds for 30 W, 13.5 (5.5) seconds for 50 W, and 8.4 (5.1) seconds for 80 W (P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the mean (SD) rates of injury, with 20.8 (8.8) m/s at 30 W, 39.8 (11.8) m/s at 50 W, and 50.1 (19.2) m/s at 80 W (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Using various power settings of monopolar energy may not make a significant difference in swine vaginal tissue damage at the time of colpotomy. However, there was a significant difference in the times and rates at which tissue was transected when using higher powers. We recommend using the 50- or 80-W setting, as this will likely decrease surgical times without altering vaginal tissue damage.","output":"Laparoscopic colpotomy using monopolar electrocautery: does power really matter?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Michael Reid and co-authors introduce a Collection on the global health in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"How will COVID-19 transform global health post-pandemic?

Changes in Medicare laws have resulted in an increased use of oxygen cylinders and a reduction in the use of liquid oxygen devices. The aim of this survey was to assess the impact of perceived satisfaction with various oxygen delivery devices on perceived mobility and quality of life (QOL) of oxygen-dependent subjects with COPD. METHODS A survey was developed to measure perceived satisfaction with current portable oxygen delivery devices, perceived mobility, and perceived QOL. The survey was deployed via a link posted on the COPD Foundation's COPD360SOCIAL social media site for 5 weeks, which resulted in the recruitment of 529 participants, of which 417 were included in the data analysis. RESULTS Quantile regression analysis revealed that the median perceived device satisfaction score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (P < .001) compared with the portable oxygen cylinder and portable oxygen concentrator (POC) groups. The median perceived mobility score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (P < .001) compared with the portable oxygen cylinder group, but not the POC group. The median QOL score was significantly higher in the liquid oxygen device group (P < .001) compared with the POC and portable oxygen cylinder groups. Moreover, partial least-squares structural equation modeling regression analysis showed that perceived mobility is significantly affected by perceived satisfaction with the long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) device (adjusted R2 = 0.15, P < .001), and perceived QOL is significantly affected by both perceived satisfaction with the LTOT device and perceived mobility (adjusted R2 = 0.45, P < .001).

The objective of this study was to describe the association between neighborhood factors and number of COVID-19 cases. We hypothesized an association between disadvantaged neighborhoods and clusters of COVID-19 cases. METHODS We analyzed data on patients presenting to a large health care system in Boston during February 5-May 4, 2020. We used a bivariate local join-count procedure to determine colocation between census tracts with high rates of neighborhood demographic characteristics (eg, Hispanic race/ethnicity) and measures of disadvantage (eg, health insurance status) and COVID-19 cases. We used negative binomial models to assess independent associations between neighborhood factors and the incidence of COVID-19. RESULTS A total of 9898 COVID-19 patients were in the cohort. The overall crude incidence in the study area was 32 cases per 10 000 population, and the adjusted incidence per census tract ranged from 2 to 405 per 10 000 population. We found significant colocation of several neighborhood factors and the top quintile of cases: percentage of population that was Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, without health insurance, receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and living in poverty. Factors associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 included percentage of population that is Hispanic (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and percentage of households living in poverty (IRR = 1.25; 95% CI, 1.19-1.32).

This could be explained by a complex association of factors, such as the lower speed of womens professional growth within companies, their under-representation in management positions, and the unequal distribution of caregiving and housework between men and women. The rise of the gig economya market system that is based on hiring independent contractors and freelance workers as opposed to creating full-time contractshas brought researchers and policymakers into a discussion on the effects of online platforms and flexible work arrangements on labour market gender parity. In this study, we examine the case of the largest online English-language school in Eastern Europe, Skyeng. Data on 6,461,404 lessons given by 13,571 teachers demonstrate that women had fewer working hours than men in most age categories, but especially for ages 30C35. The workload deficit for the women could be partly attributed to the fact that they worked less often than the men did in the evenings (7C10 p.m.). We conclude that, despite the flexible work arrangements the gig economy has offered, the women taught fewer classes than the men (i.e., having fewer paid working hours), which in turn led to a gender pay gap. The rapid growth of the gig economy makes it important to monitor gender-gap dynamics as well as discuss potential mechanisms eliminating gender inequality in the labour market.","output":"Women in gig economy work less in the evenings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Asthmatic airways are stiffer than normal. We have shown that the cytoskeletal passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle (ASM) can be regulated by intracellular signaling pathways, especially those associated with Rho kinase (ROCK). We have also shown that an oscillatory strain reduces the passive stiffness of ASM and its ability to generate force. Here, we investigated the combined effect of inhibiting the ASM contraction with (2) agonist and decreasing the ASM cytoskeletal stiffness with ROCK inhibitor and/or force oscillation (FO) on the relaxation of contracted ASM. We hypothesize that the ASM relaxation can be synergistically enhanced by the combination of these interventions, because drug-induced softening of the cytoskeleton enhances the FO-induced relaxation and vice versa. Sheep tracheal strips were isotonically contracted to acetylcholine (3  10(?5) M). At the plateau of shortening, (2) agonist salbutamol (10(?7) M), ROCK inhibitor H1152 (10(?7) M), and FO (square wave, 1 Hz, amplitude 6% maximal active force) were applied either alone or in combination. After adjusting for nonspecific time-dependent variation, relengthening by individual interventions with low-dose salbutamol or H1152, or small amplitude FO was not significantly different from zero. However, significant relengthening was observed in all combination treatments. The relengthening was greater than the mathematical sum of relengthening caused by individual treatments thereby demonstrating synergistic relaxation. The ASM stiffness did not change with salbutamol or H1152 treatments, but was lower with FO in combination with H1152. The results suggest that the mechanopharmacological treatment can be an effective therapy for asthma.","output":"Mechanopharmacology and Synergistic Relaxation of Airway Smooth Muscle"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim To analyze the association between ROCK2 gene polymorphism/expression and susceptibility/prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods Peripheral venous blood from 204 hepatocellular carcinoma patients (HCC group), 242 chronic hepatitis B patients (CHB group), 215 liver cirrhosis patients (LC group) and 201 healthy volunteers (normal group) were collected. ROCK2 gene (including the rs9808232 locus) was amplified by PCR and the products were sequenced. Tumor tissues from patients with HCC and liver tissues from CHB, LC and normal groups were collected, and mRNA and protein expression of ROCK2 gene in liver tissues were tested by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence, respectively. Results Compared with the normal group, the mRNA and protein expression levels of ROCK2 in the HCC group increased significantly (P < 0.05), but there are no obvious increases in the CHB and LC groups (P > 0.05). ROCK2 gene rs9808232 polymorphism was associated with an increased susceptibility of HCC, and genotypes AC and CC may be risk factors for HCC (P < 0.001). There was a significant association between the ROCK2 gene rs9808232 polymorphism and the route of metastasis in HCC patients (P < 0.05). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the overall survival of patients with AC and CC genotypes of ROCK2 rs9808232 was much shorter than that of patients with AA genotype (median overall survival, 25.5 months vs 16.0 months; Log rank P = 0.006). The overall survival time of patients with high ROCK2 expression is much shorter than that of patients with low ROCK2 expression (median overall survival time, 15.0 months vs 20.5 months; Log rank P = 0.008). Compared with genotype AA, the ROCK2 protein levels of genotypes AC and CC were distinctly increased in the HCC group, especially genotype CC (P< 0.05).

METHODS Anesthetized pigs served as the educational platform for first-year anesthesiology residents to gain hands-on experience performing regional, thoracic, vascular, and difficult airway techniques. A 20-question test was administered pre- and post-lab to assess the effectiveness of our educational intervention. Participants evaluated the quality of the educational experience (1-poor to 5-excellent). RESULTS First-year anesthesiology residents participated (n=70, 2008-2012). Residents' pre-test scores measured 50.32.6% (range 20-80). Following lab participation, their test scores signi ficantly improved to a mean of 84.21.9% (range 45-100, p<0.0001). Participants increased their knowledge and skills (mean 4.960.02), considered the skills lab to be a worthwhile educational experience (mean 4.990.01), and agreed that the lab should be repeated in the future (mean 5.00).

Virus isolation (culture) from surface samples (n=7) was negative. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of viral RNA on non-touch surfaces is evidence of viral dissemination through air, but the lack of airborne viral particles in air samples suggests that they were not aerosolized in a significant manner during air sampling sessions. The air samples were collected 8 to 30 days after the residents symptom onset, which could indicate that viruses are aerosolized early in the infection process.

The median (IQR) duration of hospital stay was 10 (8-13) days and 6 (3.1%) patients died in hospital. The odds of moderate to severe disease were 3.8 for second wave, 1.9 for fever and 1.1 for raised C reactive protein (CRP). Conclusion: In our single-center study from northern India, adolescents admitted with COVID-19 had predominantly asymptomatic or mild disease. Admission during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, presence of fever and raised CRP were risk factors for moderate or severe disease.","output":"Adolescents Hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2: Analysis of Clinical Profile and Risk Factors for Severe Disease over a two-year period"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigated the mortality of septic shock patients visiting emergency departments (ED) before and after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic onset. We retrospectively reviewed medical records and National Emergency Department Information System data of septic shock patients who visited the ED of a tertiary medical center in South Korea from February 2019 to February 2021. Following the COVID-19 pandemic onset, revised institutional ED processes included a stringent isolation protocol for patients visiting the ED. The primary goal of this study was to determine the mortality rate of septic shock patients from before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Durations of vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay, and hospitalization were investigated. The mortality rates increased from 24.8% to 35.8%, before and after COVID-19-onset, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.079). No significant differences in other outcomes were found. Multivariable analysis revealed that the Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was the only risk factor for mortality (OR 1.07; 95% CI 1.04-1.10), whereas COVID-19 pandemic was not included in the final model.

The purpose of this study is to extract CXR labels from diagnostic reports based on natural language processing, train convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and evaluate the classification performance of CNN using CXR data from multiple centers METHODS: We collected the CXR images and corresponding radiology reports of 74,082 subjects as the training dataset. The linguistic entities and relationships from unstructured radiology reports were extracted by the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model, and a knowledge graph was constructed to represent the association between image labels of abnormal signs and the report text of CXR. Then, a 25-label classification system were built to train and test the CNN models with weakly supervised labeling. RESULTS: In three external test cohorts of 5,996 symptomatic patients, 2,130 screening examinees, and 1,804 community clinic patients, the mean AUC of identifying 25 abnormal signs by CNN reaches 0.866  0.110, 0.891  0.147, and 0.796  0.157, respectively. In symptomatic patients, CNN shows no significant difference with local radiologists in identifying 21 signs (p > 0.05), but is poorer for 4 signs (p < 0.05). In screening examinees, CNN shows no significant difference for 17 signs (p > 0.05), but is poorer at classifying nodules (p = 0.013).

Social isolation is known to have a significant psychological impact, potentially triggering alcohol misuse in adults. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown measures on alcohol consumption in adults in Bavaria. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled 2067 participants, with 1961 young adults (mean age 23.3  4.1) and 106 mature adults (mean age 66.7  9.7). Participants were asked to complete a standardized questionnaire, semi-quantitatively evaluating the alcohol drinking behaviour before and during the pandemic lockdown. RESULTS: After implementation of lockdown, the alteration of alcohol consumption was significantly different between young and mature adults (p < 0.001). Among young adults, 42% reported unchanged drinking behaviour compared to 76% in the mature adult group; 44% of young adults reported to drink less compared to only 7% of mature adults. An increase in alcohol consumption was only reported by 14% of young adults and 17% of mature adults. Interestingly, in the entire cohort, the change of alcohol intake was most pronounced among moderate drinkers (> 0 to < 5 drinks/week) in both age groups (p < 0.001). Ordinal logistic regression revealed female sex, low BMI and younger age to be associated with a decrease in number of self-reported drinks/week. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown significantly affected alcohol drinking behaviour. Further studies exploring long-term effects on potential alcohol misuse and the relevance on public health are warranted.

While studies of single host-virus systems indicate that host and environmental factors influence seasonal virus transmission dynamics, comparable insights for whole viral communities in multiple hosts are lacking. Leveraging non-invasive faecal samples from a long-term wild rodent study, we characterised viral communities of three common European rodent species (Apodemus sylvaticus, A. flavicollis, and M. glareolus) living in temperate woodland over a single year. Our findings indicate that a substantial fraction of the rodent virome is seasonally transient and associated with vertebrate or bacteria hosts. Further analyses of one of the most abundant virus families, Picornaviruses, show pronounced temporal changes in viral richness and diversity, which were associated with concurrent and up to 3-month lags in host density, ambient temperature, rainfall and humidity, suggesting complex feedbacks from the host and environmental factors on virus transmission and shedding in seasonal habitats.

Practically, anesthesia is only seen as too deep when evidence of burst-suppression is seen. We designed an experiment to help towards better assessment of individual anesthetic needs. First, to mark the Ce (effect-site concentration) of propofol at loss of response to calling name and gently shaking shoulders (LOR), we defined Ce-LOR. To mark the transient power increase in the alpha range (9-14 Hz), common to all patients, when propofol concentration gradually increases, we defined Ce-alpha as the highest recorded alpha power for Ce. We also defined Ce-OBS as the Ce of propofol at initial observation of burst-suppression. Then we tried to predict Ce-LOR and Ce-alpha from Ce-OBS, vice versa, and considered the significance of these parameters. METHODS We enrolled 26 female patients (age 33-65) who were undergoing scheduled mastectomy. During anesthesia, we recorded all raw EEG packets as well as EEG-derived parameters on a computer from BIS-XP? monitor. Propofol was infused using a TCI pump. Target concentration was adjusted so that Ce of propofol was gradually increased. RESULTS We obtained the following regression equation; Ce-alpha or Ce-OBS = Ce-LOR  0.87 + 1.06 + dummy  0.83 (for Ce-alpha dummy = 0, and for Ce-OBS = 1; adjusted r = 0.90, p < 2.2e-16) by ANCOVA.

This epilogue examines the scope of work presented in this special issue, the added value of the research presented herein, and how it can inform future research directions. Health disparities research can be conducted using two key approaches: 1) documenting between-group differences comparing ethnic/racial minorities groups and majority populations; or, 2) documenting within-group differences in a single racial or ethnic group. While characterization of between-group differences is useful to identify existing health disparities, it is essential to understand within-group diversity to fully address these inequities. Studies in this special issue identifying between- group differences focus on resiliency characteristics that could be present across all racial and ethnic groups. The studies examining within-group differences included in this special issue examine novel factors that influence resilience of protective health behaviors. Overall, this special issue examines several potential protective factors in the context of health promoting behaviors related to substance use using a wide range of research methodologies. While it is not exhaustive in its representation of all underserved populations experiencing health disparities and treatment inequities, this special issue includes a broad array of populations from various racial, ethnic, and national groups.

However, the effects and risks of anti-thrombotics for this indication are unknown. We therefore aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous aspirin, unfractionated heparin, both, or neither started during endovascular treatment in patients with ischaemic stroke. METHODS: We did an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial with a 2  3 factorial design in 15 centres in the Netherlands. We enrolled adult patients (ie, 18 years) with ischaemic stroke due to an intracranial large-vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation in whom endovascular treatment could be initiated within 6 h of symptom onset. Eligible patients had a score of 2 or more on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and a CT or MRI ruling out intracranial haemorrhage. Randomisation was done using a web-based procedure with permuted blocks and stratified by centre. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either periprocedural intravenous aspirin (300 mg bolus) or no aspirin, and randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive moderate-dose unfractionated heparin (5000 IU bolus followed by 1250 IU/h for 6 h), low-dose unfractionated heparin (5000 IU bolus followed by 500 IU/h for 6 h), or no unfractionated heparin. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was the main safety outcome. Analyses were based on intention to treat, and treatment effects were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) or common ORs, with adjustment for baseline prognostic factors. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, ISRCTN76741621. FINDINGS: Between Jan 22, 2018, and Jan 27, 2021, we randomly assigned 663 patients; of whom, 628 (95%) provided deferred consent or died before consent could be asked and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population. On Feb 4, 2021, after unblinding and analysis of the data, the trial steering committee permanently stopped patient recruitment and the trial was stopped for safety concerns. The risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage was higher in patients allocated to receive aspirin than in those not receiving aspirin (43 [14%] of 310 vs 23 [7%] of 318; adjusted OR 195 [95% CI 113-335]) as well as in patients allocated to receive unfractionated heparin than in those not receiving unfractionated heparin (44 [13%] of 332 vs 22 [7%] of 296; 198 [114-346]). Both aspirin (adjusted common OR 091 [95% CI 069-121]) and unfractionated heparin (081 [061-108]) led to a non-significant shift towards worse modified Rankin Scale scores. INTERPRETATION: Periprocedural intravenous aspirin and unfractionated heparin during endovascular stroke treatment are both associated with an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage without evidence for a beneficial effect on functional outcome.

However, little is known about the magnitude of these psychological effects on a population level and for vulnerable subgroups. METHODS: A representative sample (N = 2503; 50.2% female; mean age = 49.5) of the German population was assessed face-to-face during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 10-April 25, 2020). They were examined for differences in mental health (BSI-18) and relationship quality (PFB) in a pre-lockdown and lockdown subsamples. After testing and establishing the measurement models in confirmatory factor analyses, we added covariates as predictors of the factors to the regression model to investigate the impact of the lockdown measures. RESULTS: Overall, participants included after the introduction of lockdown measures reported significantly fewer mental health problems than participants included before the lockdown. Predictor analyses revealed that this effect was larger for participants of younger age and those with higher household income. There was no significant difference in relationship quality between pre-lockdown and lockdown. However, relationship quality improved for younger participants after the lockdown measures started, but deteriorated for older participants. CONCLUSIONS: The German population was found to be largely resilient to the immediate effects of lockdown on mental health and relationship quality. Older participants and those with lower socio-economic status might constitute risk groups during times of lockdown. Further studies in countries affected by more drastic lockdown measures and the long-term consequences of the pandemic are needed to inform decision makers about the psychological effects of lockdown.","output":"The immediate impact of lockdown measures on mental health and couples' relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic - results of a representative population survey in Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Based on reports of parasite resistance and on World Health Organization recommendation, chloroquine was replaced with the artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) as the first choice of drugs for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria. Disuse of chloroquine led to restoration of drug-sensitive parasite to some extent in certain countries. Ever since chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were touted as potential treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there has been a dramatic surge in demand for the drugs. Even in areas where chloroquine is proscribed, there has been an unexpected increase in demand and supply of the drug. This situation is quite worrying as the indiscriminate use of chloroquine may produce drug-resistant parasites which may impact negatively on the efficacy of amodiaquine due to cross-resistance. Amodiaquine is a partner drug in one of the ACTs and in some of the drugs used for intermittent preventive treatment. We herein discuss the consequences of the escalated use of chloroquine in the management of COVID-19 on chemotherapy or chemoprevention of malaria and offer an advice. We speculate that parasite strains resistant to chloroquine will escalate due to the increased and indiscriminate use of the drug and consequently lead to cross-resistance with amodiaquine which is present in some drug schemes aforementioned. Under the circumstance, the anticipated hope of reverting to the use of the resurrected chloroquine to manage malaria in future is likely to diminish.

At present, no safe and effective radiation protection measures have been approved for clinical use. Phycocyanin, a protein responsible for photosynthesis from Spirulina, has been shown to have a variety of biological activities and to be beneficial for a variety of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis. However, the preventive and protective effects of phycocyanin on radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis have not been studied. DESIGN: X-ray single dose irradiation was used on the chest of mice to prepare a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, from which the effect of phycocyanin on pulmonary histopathologic change, pulmonary fibrosis, the microbiota in lung and gut, LPS, TNF-, and IL-6 at different time after irradiation were evaluated. RESULTS: Phycocyanin alleviated the radiation-induced lung injury and reduced the level of inflammatory factors. Thorax irradiation led to the disorder in microbiota of the lung and gut. The variation trend of the diversity of the two tissues was opposite, but that of the microbiota composition was similar. The phycocyanin intervention regulated the composition of the lung and gut microbiota, transformed them into normal state, and reduced the level of LPS, which significantly reduced the abundance of inflammation-related bacteria, and increased the abundance of probiotics that produce short-chain fatty acids.

The mechanisms by which viruses are removed from the respiratory tract are indispensable for airway host defense. Mucociliary clearance is an airway defense mechanism that removes pathogens from the respiratory tract. The coordination and modulation of the ciliary beating of airway epithelial cells play key roles in maintaining effective mucociliary clearance. However, the impact of respiratory virus infection on ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance remains unclear. METHODS: Tracheal samples were taken from wild-type (WT) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-knockout (KO) mice. Transient organ culture of murine trachea was performed in the presence or absence of IAV, polyI:C, a synthetic TLR3 ligand, and/or reagents. Subsequently, cilia-driven flow and ciliary motility were analyzed. To evaluate cilia-driven flow, red fluorescent beads were loaded into culture media and movements of the beads onto the tracheal surface were observed using a fluorescence microscope. To evaluate ciliary motility, cilia tips were labeled with Indian ink diluted with culture medium. The motility of ink-labeled cilia tips was recorded by high-speed cameras. RESULTS: Short-term IAV infection significantly increased cilia-driven flow and ciliary beat frequency (CBF) compared with the control level in WT culture. Whereas IAV infection did not elicit any increases of cilia-driven flow and CBF in TLR3-KO culture, indicating that TLR3 was essential to elicit an increase of cilia-driven flow and CBF in response to IAV infection. TLR3 activation by polyI:C readily induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from the trachea and increases of cilia-driven flow and CBF in WT culture, but not in TLR3-KO culture. Moreover, blockade of purinergic P2 receptors (P2Rs) signaling using P2R antagonist, suramin, suppressed polyI:C-mediated increases of cilia-driven flow and CBF, indicating that TLR3-mediated ciliary activation depended on released extracellular ATP and the autocrine ATP-P2R loop. CONCLUSIONS: IAV infection readily increases ciliary activity and cilia-driven flow via TLR3 activation in the airway epithelium, thereby hastening mucociliary clearance and sweeping viruses from the airway as an initial host defense response. Mechanically, extracellular ATP release in response to TLR3 activation promotes ciliary activity through autocrine ATP-P2R loop.","output":"Influenza A virus enhances ciliary activity and mucociliary clearance via TLR3 in airway epithelium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Ist es eine Ironie des Schicksals, dass die Corona-Pandemie, die Ende 2019 auf dem Tiermarkt von Wuhan wohl ihren Anfang nahm, Chinas Aufstieg nun einen m?chtigen Schub verleiht?

Layer upon layer of new information has been repeatedly revising and reformulating our sense of touch. The uncondi-tional freedom of touch needs to be rendered accountable in this rift of time and space. The act of touching entails individual acknowledging the risk of reaching towards the unknown or the known. Tracing with a tactile sense of touch is to be tactful about how, where and what can such act of touching could reach, especially in the context of communicative technology. This article focuses on the possibil-ity of virtual sensibility by challenging ways to feel touched beyond the nostal-gic narratives that attempt to indict communicative technology with the loss of touch. To replenish and reinstate touch through tele-synaesthesia performance, I ask: how to elongate our somatosensensation and echo the embodied experience of touching through virtual connectivity? Tele-synaesthesia performance joints tele-matic and synaesthetic experience together to embody the incorporeality of touch through virtual connectivity. It embodies the injunction of physical contact and challenges what can and cannot be touched by suturing one sensuous modality to another. Inspired by Paul Sermon's artistic production of Telematic Quarantine (2020) and Pandemic Encounters (2020), that tele-presents the stories of self (isolation), I have created The Best Facial (2021): a series of one-to-one participatory tele-synaesthesia performances, where I became a virtual aesthetician and performed 'virtual facial care' on Zoom amid the second wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom.

Here, we report proof-of-concept studies for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines using the bacteriophage T4 virus-like particle (VLP) platform. Using the extracellular domain of influenza matrix protein 2 (M2e) as a readout, we demonstrate that up to ~1,281 M2e molecules can be assembled on a 120 x 86 nanometer phage capsid to generate M2e-T4 VLPs. These M2e-decorated nanoparticles, without any adjuvant, are highly immunogenic, stimulate robust humoral as well as cellular immune responses, and conferred complete protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. Potentially, additional conserved antigens could be incorporated into the M2e-T4 VLPs and mass-produced in E. coli in a short amount of time to deal with an emerging influenza pandemic.","output":"Bacteriophage T4 Vaccine Platform for Next-Generation Influenza Vaccine Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious and has claimed more than one million lives, besides causing hardship and disruptions. The Fleischner Society has recommended chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting cases with high risk for disease progression, for triaging suspected patients with moderate-to-severe illness, and to eliminate false negatives in areas with high pre-test probability or limited resources. Although CXR is less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. Literature search was performed using PubMed. RESULTS A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features is associated with worse disease outcome. Recognition of these features on CXR will improve accuracy and speed of diagnosing COVID-19 patients.","output":"Chest Radiograph (CXR) Manifestations of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) - A Mini-Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is the cause of pancreas disease and sleeping disease in farmed salmonid fish in Europe. The spread of these diseases has been difficult to control with biosecurity and current vaccination strategies, and increased understanding of the viral pathogenesis could be beneficial for the development of novel vaccine strategies. N-glycosylation of viral envelope proteins may be crucial for viral virulence and a possible target for its purposed attenuation. In this study, we mutated the N-glycosylation consensus motifs of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins of a SAV3 infectious clone using site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of the glycosylation motif in E1 gave a complete inactivation of the virus as no viral replication could be detected in cell culture and infectious particles could not be rescued. In contrast, infectious virus particles could be recovered from the SAV3 E2 mutants (E2319Q, E2319A), but not if they were accompanied by lack of N-glycosylation in E1. Compared to the non-mutated infectious clone, the SAV3-E2319Q and SAV3-E2319A recombinant viruses produced less cytopathic effects in cell culture and lower amounts of infectious viral particles. In conclusion, the substitution in the N-linked glycosylation site in E2 attenuated SAV3 in cell culture.

The paper first introduces provisions of the Novel Influenza Act and Infectious Diseases Acts provisions before and after the February 2021 amendments. The remarkable feature of the Japanese countermeasures was the focus on non-coercive measures. There is no compulsory scheme to ensure staying at home for general residents. Regarding the facility managers, the NIA provided for the public announcement of non-compliance of the recommendation to ensure effectiveness. The legal nature of such public announcements is disputed in Japanese administrative law. The February 2021 amendments added the possibility of issuing an order whose effectiveness was guaranteed by administrative fines. This paper analyzes the traditional emphasis of administrative guidance in Japan and proposes hypotheses as to why open non-compliance cases of facility managers are observed. Concerning patients, prior to the February 2021 amendment, the IDA provided for the problematic legal figures of recommendation and immediate execution. The Feb. 2021 amendment, which added administrative fines, made the legal figure more complex.

Our aim was to use the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a positive control to assess the ability to quantify behavioral changes in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) from smartphone data. METHODS: Eight participants used the Beiwe smartphone application, which passively measured their location during the COVID-19 outbreak. We used an interrupted time series to quantify the effect of the US state of emergency declaration on daily home time and daily distance traveled. RESULTS: After the state of emergency declaration, median daily home time increased from 19.4 (interquartile range [IQR], 15.4-22.0) hours to 23.7 (IQR, 22.2-24.0) hours and median distance traveled decreased from 42 (IQR, 13-83) km to 3.7 (IQR, 1.5-10.3) km. The participant with the lowest functional ability changed behavior earlier. This participant stayed at home more and traveled less than the participant with highest functional ability, both before and after the state of emergency. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence that smartphone-based digital phenotyping can quantify the behavior of people with ALS. Although participants spent large amounts of time at home at baseline, the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration reduced their mobility further. Given participants' high level of daily home time, it is possible that their exposure to COVID-19 could be less than that of the general population.","output":"Smartphone data during the COVID-19 pandemic can quantify behavioral changes in people with ALS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Avian influenza caused by avian influenza virus (AIV) has a negative impact on poultry production.

Flies were fed three virus concentrations of two AIV strains and then incubated at different temperatures for up to 24 h. The persistence of the two virus strains in the flies declined with increasing incubation temperatures and incubation periods. Similarly, increased virus uptake by the flies increased the persistence of virus. Persistence of infective AIV in flies differed significantly between the two virus strains.

METHOD: One hundred eight patients with cognitive impairment were contacted by video call to perform a telemedicine neurological evaluation. Information on patients and caregivers attending the televisit were recorded. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients connected with neurologist (successful televisit, 68.5%) and 34 patients were not able to perform televisit and were contacted by phone (failed televisit, 31.5%). No significant differences were observed among the two groups concerning age, gender, and education, but the prevalence of successful televisit was higher in the presence of younger caregivers: televisits performed in the presence of subjects of younger generation (sons and grandsons) had a successful rate higher (86% successful, 14% failed) than the group without younger generation caregiver (49% successful, 51% failed). This difference is mainly due to the ability of technological use among younger people. DISCUSSION: The most impacting factors on digital divide in our population are the social support networks and the experience with the technology: the presence of a digital native caregiver.

The volume of coronavirus tweets was far too great for one to find accurate or reliable information. Healthcare workers were flooded with noise which drowned the signal of valuable COVID-19 information. To combat the infodemic, physicians created healthcare-specific micro-communities to share scientific information with other providers. We analyzed the content of eight physician-created communities and categorized each message in one of five domains. We coded 1) an application programming interface to download tweets and their metadata in JavaScript Object Notation and 2) a reading algorithm using visual basic application in Excel to categorize the content. We superimposed the publication date of each tweet into a timeline of key pandemic events. Finally, we created NephTwitterArchive.com to help healthcare workers find COVID-19-related signal tweets when treating patients. We collected 21071 tweets from the eight hashtags studied. Only 9051 tweets were considered signal: tweets categorized into both a domain and subdomain. There was a trend towards fewer signal tweets as the pandemic progressed, with a daily median of 22% (IQR 0-42%). The most popular subdomain in Prevention was PPE (2448 signal tweets).

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) non-invasive ventilation can help patients with moderate symptoms to avoid the need for invasive ventilation in intensive care. However, existing CPAP systems can be complex (and thus expensive) or require high levels of oxygen, limiting their use in resource-stretched environments. Technical Development + Testing: The LeVe (Light) CPAP system was developed using principles of frugal innovation to produce a solution of low complexity and high resource efficiency. The LeVe system exploits the air flow dynamics of electric fan blowers which are inherently suited to delivery of positive pressure at appropriate flow rates for CPAP. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated that performance of the LeVe system was equivalent to other commercially available systems used to deliver CPAP, achieving a 10 cm H(2)O target pressure within 2.4% RMS error and 50C70% FiO(2) dependent with 10 L/min oxygen from a commercial concentrator. Pilot Evaluation: The LeVe CPAP system was tested to evaluate safety and acceptability in a group of ten healthy volunteers at Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. The study demonstrated that the system can be used safely without inducing hypoxia or hypercapnia and that its use was well-tolerated by users, with no adverse events reported. Conclusions: To provide respiratory support for the high patient numbers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers require resource efficient solutions. We have shown that this can be achieved through frugal engineering of a CPAP ventilation system, in a system which is safe for use and well-tolerated in healthy volunteers.

We identified use of services and appraisal of experiences of Switzerland-based OTs and midwives regarding the provision of HCD during the lockdown as it pertains to the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. 1. Hypothesis: Profession, age in years, and area of work have a significant and meaningful influence over whether HCD is provided. 2. Hypothesis: Profession, age in years, area of work, possibility of reimbursement by health insurance, and application used have a significant and meaningful influence on the experience of HCD. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, 5755 OTs and midwives were contacted to fill out an online questionnaire with 13 questions regarding demographic information, use of HCD, and experiences while providing the service. Eleven potential facilitators and barriers and areas where there was desire for support were identified. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 1269 health professionals (response rate 22.5%). 73.4% of responding OTs (n = 431) and midwives (n = 501) provided HCD during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Profession and area of work had a significant influence on whether HCD was provided. Age only had a significant influence on the use of videotelephony, SMS, and chat services. OTs experienced HCD significantly more positively than midwives (log odds = 1.3; p  .01). Video-telephony (log odds = 1.1; p  .01) and use of phone (log odds = 0.8; p = .01) were positive predictors for positive experience, while use of SMS (log odds = ? 0.33; p = .02) was a negative predictor.

Methods to achieve fairness in the machine learning literature typically build a single prediction model subject to some fairness criteria in a manner that encourages fair prediction performances for all groups. These approaches have two major limitations: i) fairness is often achieved by compromising accuracy for some groups;ii) the underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables may not be the same across groups. We propose a Joint Fairness Model (JFM) approach for binary outcomes that estimates group-specific classifiers using a joint modeling objective function that incorporates fairness criteria for prediction. We introduce an Accelerated Smoothing Proximal Gradient Algorithm to solve the convex objective function, and demonstrate the properties of the proposed JFM estimates. Next, we presented the key asymptotic properties for the JFM parameter estimates. We examined the efficacy of the JFM approach in achieving prediction performances and parities, in comparison with the Single Fairness Model, group-separate model, and group-ignorant model through extensive simulations.

SETTING: A large critical care department in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in London, United Kingdom. SUBJECTS: Staff working in critical care. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Participants completed a questionnaire and provided a serum sample for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody testing over a 3-day period in April 2020. We compared the timing of symptoms in staff to the coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions to critical care. We also identified factors associated with antibody detection. Of 625 staff, 384 (61.4%) reported previous symptoms and 124 (19.8%) had sent a swab for testing. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection had been confirmed in 37 of those swabbed (29.8%). Overall, 21% (131/625) had detectable severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 antibody, of whom 9.9% (13/131) had been asymptomatic. The peak onset of symptoms among staff occurred 2 weeks before the peak in coronavirus disease 2019 patient admissions. Staff who worked in multiple departments across the hospital were more likely to be seropositive. Staff with a symptomatic household contact were also more likely to be seropositive at 31.3%, compared with 16.2% in those without (p < 0.0001).

RESULTS: Of the 1,008 women included in the analysis, 73 (7.2%) women tested positive for COVID-19, of which 12 (16.4%) were symptomatic at the time of admission. The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was 34.2% among women who tested positive for COVID-19 and 22.9% women who tested negative for COVID-19 (p = 0.03). After adjusting for race, antenatal aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and body mass index >30, the risk of developing any hypertensive disorder of pregnancy was not statistically significant (odds ratio: 1.58 [0.91-2.76]). CONCLUSION: After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy in women who tested positive for COVID-19 compared with women who tested negative for COVID-19 was not significantly different. KEY POINTS:  There is an increased incidence of hypertensive disorders in women who test positive for COVID-19..  Characteristics of pregnant women with COVID-19 are similar to those with hypertensive disorders..  Liver function tests were similar between pregnant women with COVID-19 and women without COVID-19..","output":"Incidence of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in Women with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In mental health services, recovery constitutes a guiding principle that is endorsed in professional medical guidelines and has become central to mental health policies across the world.

OBJECTIVE We sought to investigate outcomes of different surgical approaches to abdominoperineal resection in patients with rectal cancer. DESIGN The nationwide inpatient sample database was used to examine the clinical data of patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective abdominoperineal resection between 2009 and 2012 in the United States. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to compare outcomes of different surgical approaches. SETTINGS A retrospective review according to the national inpatient sample database was designed. PATIENTS We included patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective abdominoperineal resection between 2009 and 2012. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes of different surgical approaches to abdominoperineal resection were investigated. RESULTS We sampled 18,359 patients with rectal cancer who underwent elective abdominoperineal resections. Of these, 69.5% had open surgery, 25.8% had laparoscopic surgery, and 4.7% had robotic surgery. The rate of robotic procedures increased >4-fold, from 2.1% to 8.1%, from 2009 to 2012. The conversion rate in robotic surgery was significantly lower compared with laparoscopic surgery (5.7% vs 13.4%; p < 0.01). After risk adjustment, patients who underwent laparoscopic and robotic approaches had lower morbidity risks compared with those who underwent the open approach (adjusted OR = 0.77 (95% CI, 0.65-0.92), 0.57 (95% CI, 0.40-0.80); p < 0. 01). There were no significant differences in the morbidity rate of patients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic approaches (adjusted OR = 0.79 (95% CI, 0.55-1.14); p = 0.21). However, patients who underwent the robotic approach had significantly higher total hospital charges compared with those who underwent the laparoscopic approach (mean difference, $24,890; p < 0.01). LIMITATIONS We could not adjust the results with some important factors, such as the tumor stage and BMI. CONCLUSIONS The use of robotic and laparoscopic approaches to abdominoperineal resection have increased between 2009 and 2012. Both minimally invasive approaches decrease morbidity rates of patients undergoing abdominoperineal resection. The robotic approach has a significantly lower conversion rate compared with the laparoscopic approach.

Viruses are prone to mutations leading to the rapid emergence of resistant strains upon treatment with direct antivirals. In contrast to the direct interference with pathogen components, host-directed therapies aim to target host factors that are essential for the pathogenic replication cycle or to improve the host defense mechanisms, thus circumventing resistance.

To this end, some authors ranked aircraft as if it were a country and compared the volume of carbon emissions generated by air travel to that generated by countries from other sources. Commercial air travel ranked seventh after Germany in terms of carbon emissions. This policy review, therefore, explored the impact of COVID-19 lockdown and travel restrictions on global warming. As a result of lockdown, there is a likelihood of a significant decrease in carbon emissions and global warming. Assuming the estimated global emissions remain constant annually, an estimated 9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions would be avoided by the end of 2020 provided that the lockdown continues. To accurately measure the value of reduced carbon dioxide emissions during the global lockdown, it is recommended that scientific studies be conducted to estimate the carbon emissions generated by the few aircraft granted waivers to transport essential commodities during the global lockdown and deduct it from the 9 gigatonnes.

METHODS: A multidisciplinary task force was convened by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) to provide guidance on the management of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 and hyperinflammation in COVID-19. The task force was composed of 9 pediatric rheumatologists, 2 adult rheumatologists, 2 pediatric cardiologists, 2 pediatric infectious disease specialists, and 1 pediatric critical care physician. Preliminary statements addressing clinical questions related to MIS-C and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 were developed based on evidence reports. Consensus was built through a modified Delphi process that involved 2 rounds of anonymous voting and 2 webinars. A 9-point scale was used to determine the appropriateness of each statement (median scores of 1-3 for inappropriate, 4-6 for uncertain, and 7-9 for appropriate), and consensus was rated as low, moderate, or high based on dispersion of the votes along the numeric scale. Approved guidance statements were those that were classified as appropriate with moderate or high levels of consensus, as prespecified prior to voting. RESULTS: The ACR task force approved a total of 128 guidance statements addressing the management of MIS-C and hyperinflammation in pediatric COVID-19.

Using an artificial peptide strategy, we designed a peptide with non-native protein sequence, AP3, which exhibited potent antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of HIV-1 strains, including those resistant to T20, and had remarkably longer in vivo half-life than T20. While the preexisting antibodies in HIV-infected patients significantly suppressed T20s antiviral activity, these antibodies neither recognized AP3, nor attenuated its anti-HIV-1 activity. Structurally different from T20, AP3 could fold into single-helix and interact with gp41 NHR. The two residues, Met and Thr, at the N-terminus of AP3 form a hook-like structure to stabilize interaction between AP3 and NHR helices.

Integrated agglomeration energy was determined to be a linear function of percent maximum horn amplitude and ultrasonication time, and integrated energy in turn influenced product physical properties, such as density and fracture strength, in highly significant linear relationships. Microscopic, computer tomographic, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses confirmed progressive compaction of and thermal stability changes in the flour matrix with increased processing energy. Specimens agglomerated at higher energy levels were furthermore demonstrated to have higher fracture strength than conventionally (pressure-only) compressed specimens despite similar densities, due to the robust interparticle bridging produced by agglomeration. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Ultrasonic agglomeration represents a potential improvement over standard compression in the manufacturing of meal-supplementing energy bars. Ultrasonic agglomeration effectively adheres particles together without incorporation of low-nutrient- density syrups and binders. Agglomerated and compacted products also have superior mechanical stability, which can improve texture and physical stability during product handling.","output":"Ultrasonic agglomeration of model flour systems: Process parameter-product physico-thermal property relationships"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1097/GOX.0000000000003946.].","output":"Erratum: Predictive Factors of Keloid Formation in Congenital Foot Syndactyly: Erratum."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the global COVID-19 pandemic, many people were physically separated from their romantic or sexual partners and added sexting to their sexual repertoire. Sexting involves the exchange of sensitive data and thus necessitates personal and interpersonal privacy management strategies such as information control and privacy boundary communication. This study investigates the psychological predictors of sexting-related privacy management. In an online survey with 494 young adults, we tested demographic psychological, and behavioral correlates of sexting-related privacy management. Negative binomial regressions revealed that age, gender, and asynchronous sexting frequency positively predicted sexting-related privacy management. COVID-19-related social isolation moderated the positive effect of asynchronous sexting frequency: Asynchronous sexting frequency had a positive effect on sexting-related privacy management only in individuals with low or mean COVID-19-related social isolation. For those who perceived high COVID-19-related social isolation, asynchronous sexting frequency had no positive effect. This suggests that in a context of social isolation, even frequent sexters are willing to sacrifice their privacy. Relationship status, privacy concerns, rejection sensitivity, and synchronous sexting frequency were not related to sexting-related privacy management. The results highlight the various effects of COVID-19-related social isolation.","output":"Sexting During Social Isolation: Predicting Sexting-Related Privacy Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an interconnecting, cascading tsunami of up-rootedness and change on many levels.

After demonstrating the effectiveness of SCPA over commonly used methods, we generate a scRNA-seq T cell dataset and characterize pathway activity over early cellular activation and between T cell populations. This revealed unexpected regulatory pathways in T cells, such as an intrinsic type I interferon system regulating T cell survival and a reliance on arachidonic acid metabolism throughout T cell activation. A systems level characterization of pathway activity in T cells across multiple human tissues also revealed alpha defensin expression as a hallmark of bone marrow derived T cells.

The extent of this phenomenon and its mechanisms are unclear.Methods and Results:This study prospectively included 50 consecutive STEMI patients admitted to our center for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the peak of the Italian COVID-19 outbreak. At admission, a COVID-19 test was positive in 24 patients (48%), negative in 26 (52%). The primary endpoint was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Upon admission, COVID-19 subjects had lower PO2/FiO2 (169 [100-425] vs. 390 [302-477], P<0.01), more need for oxygen support (62.5% vs. 26.9%, P=0.02) and a higher rate of myocardial dysfunction (ejection fraction <30% in 45.8% vs. 19.2%, P=0.04). All patients underwent emergency angiography. In 12.5% of COVID-19 patients, no culprit lesions were detected, thus PCI was performed in 87.5% and 100% of COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P=0.10). Despite a higher rate of obstinate thrombosis in the COVID-19 group (47.6% vs. 11.5%, P<0.01), the PCI result was similar (TIMI 2-3 in 90.5% vs. 100%, P=0.19). In-hospital mortality was 41.7% and 3.8% in COVID-19 positive and negative patients, respectively (P<0.01). Respiratory failure was the leading cause of death (80%) in the COVID-19 group, frequently associated with severe myocardial dysfunction.

Methods We analysed data from 2710 young adult participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We assessed the associations of socioeconomic position (SEP) and Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs, e.g. abuse, neglect, measures of family dysfunction) with changes to health-related behaviours (meals, snacks, exercise, sleep, alcohol and smoking/vaping), and to financial and employment status during the first UK lockdown between March-June 2020. Results Experiencing 4 or more ACEs was associated with reporting decreased sleep quantity during lockdown (OR 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07-2.18) and increased smoking and/or vaping (OR 1.85, 95% CI: 0.99-3.43); no other associations were seen between ACEs or SEP and health-related behaviour changes. Adverse financial and employment changes were more likely for people with low SEP and for people who had experienced multiple ACEs; e.g. people who had been in the 'never worked or long-term unemployed' or 'routine and manual occupation' categories pre-lockdown were almost 3 times more likely to have stopped working during lockdown compared with people who were in a higher managerial, administrative or professional occupation pre-lockdown (OR 2.83, 95% CI: 1.45-5.50 and OR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.63-4.42 respectively).

Fewer than half of pregnant smokers can quit on their own. Identifying safe and effective therapies to prevent tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and/or increase smoking cessation in pregnant women would have a substantial public health impact. Cigarette smoking is associated with a relative deficiency in circulating n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) levels. A recent analysis found that smokers taking n-3 LCPUFAs during pregnancy had a reduction in preterm labor risk when compared to non-smokers. Studies have shown that supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs may also reduce nicotine cravings and daily cigarette use. Thus, smokers may benefit from supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs by lowering the risk of preterm labor and/or increased smoking cessation. To address important remaining knowledge gaps, we propose the Investigating N-3 Fatty Acids to prevent Neonatal Tobacco related outcomeS (INFANTS). METHODS: The INFANTS study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will randomize 400 pregnant smokers to either supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs or placebo. Participants will be enrolled between 12 and 24 weeks gestation and followed until 6 weeks after delivery. We will recruit from clinical centers throughout Middle Tennessee. We will assess smoking behavior after 12 weeks of supplementation using self-report and validated biomarkers of tobacco exposure. We will measure response to supplementation using biological markers of n-3 LCPUFA status. Our primary endpoint will be preterm labor as reflected by gestational age at delivery. Our secondary endpoint will be change from baseline in cigarettes per day at 12 weeks. DISCUSSION: This study tests the hypothesis that smoking-induced n-3 LCPUFA deficiencies contribute to tobacco-related adverse pregnancy outcomes and that supplementation of n-3 LCPUFAs in pregnant smokers may prevent these complications. If our study demonstrates that supplemental n-3 LCPUFAs are effective at reducing the risk of tobacco-related adverse neonatal outcomes and/or reducing tobacco use during pregnancy, our results could have an immediate and major impact on pregnancy care and neonatal outcomes.

An online questionnaire survey of 1161 owners and managers of Chinese companies was conducted, and respondents were asked to score the priorities of their company over the pre, during and post COVID-19 periods. The research was carried out at the end of the first COVID-19 wave in China but during the period of lockdown in some parts of the country. It was found that there was a priority change regarding three dimensions of sustainable development and 13 aspects of CSR. While the social dimension of SD was prioritized during and post COVID-19, the environmental dimension was the only one deemed to be less important and less prioritized over the longer term after the pandemic. The top three short-term CSR priorities were having in place a workplace health and safety plan, engaging in philanthropic activities and protecting biodiversity, and the top three longer-term CSR priorities were job creation, protecting biodiversity and having in place a workplace health and safety plan.

The effector T cells act as the master player of adaptive immune response in eradicating the virus from the system. But during cancer and chronic viral infections, the fate of an effector T cell is altered, and the T cell may enters a state of exhaustion, which is marked by loss of effector function, depleted proliferative capacity and cytotoxic effect accomplished by an increased expression of numerous inhibitory receptors such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), lymphocyte-activation protein 3 (LAG-3), and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) on their surface.

Therefore, policymakers are facing a difficult duty in terms of implementing economically and socially sustainable and acceptable measures. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of NPIs implemented to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, eight NPI measures were analysed, and their effects on the number of cases were investigated for France, Spain, China, and South Korea. In the study, the treatment effect of these mechanisms on the daily increase rate of the total number of cases during a certain period was analysed by using logarithmic linear regression with a dummy variables model. The findings indicate that the measures are effective against the spread of the pandemic at different levels. The findings also suggest that the most effective measure in decreasing the number of cases is workplace closure.

The aim of this study was to determine the role of particular viral infections in asthma exacerbations in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed at Dr. Daneshvari Hospital Pediatric Emergency Department, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran between 2014 and 2015. A nasopharyngeal aspirate or swab was obtained from each patient during admission. All samples were maintained at 4 C until submission to the virology laboratory and were tested for respiratory viruses by nucleic acid testing. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients with asthma exacerbations were recruited for this study. Of the 60 samples collected from the patients with acute asthma exacerbations, rhinovirus was detected in 12 patients (20%), respiratory syncytial virus in 5 (8%), adenovirus in 5 (8%), and influenza virus in 1 (1.6%). Respiratory pathogens were not detected in 37 (61%) samples. All the samples investigated showed single viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, the most common viruses detected were rhinovirus followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus. RSV was more commonly associated with more severe attacks.

A relative reliability study in prospective samples of community dwellers and rehabilitation centre residents was undertaken in order to validate the translation. In terms of nocturia severity, these groups were considered to be representative of patients at both ends of the scale, and therefore suitable validation purposes. Patients and Methods The prospective descriptive study took place between 07 and 09/2020. Fifty residents in a rehabilitation centre and thirty-seven community dwellers were included in the study. All participants had more than one episode of nocturia per night. They were asked to complete the newly translated TANGO-Gr Questionnaire twice (test-retest procedure). TANGO-Gr includes three possible answers (\\"yes\\", \\"no\\", and \\"DK/NA\\") to facilitate increased validity. The study group evaluated the socio and demographic characteristics, the level of independence and the comprehensive frailty of all participants. Results Both groups satisfactorily completed questionnaire responses. The overall Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.753 (community-dwelling people: 0.776; rehabilitation centre residents: 0.531). A test-retest statistical analysis to determine reliability found an overall median Kappa of 0.88 (IQR: 0.79-0.94) in community dwellers and 0.91 (IQR: 0.84-1.00) in rehabilitation centre residents, thereby confirming an almost perfect respective agreement. Conclusion The validity of the newly translated TANGO-Gr Questionnaire was proven. It should be considered to be a reliable, self-administered screening tool suitable for clinical practice, and therefore invaluable for Greek-speaking people. The study also determined that certain environment-related variables may contribute to nocturia in rehabilitation centre populations, which is a finding which invites further study.","output":"Translation and Validation of the TANGO Nocturia Screening Tool into Greek."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"DNA methylation is of paramount importance for the evolution of human cancers.

Because most centers performing IAT use noncontrast CT (NCCT) imaging, it is critical to understand the impact of NCCT findings on treatment outcomes. This study aimed to compare functional independence and safety among patients undergoing intra-arterial treatment stratified by the extent of ischemic change on pretreatment NCCT. METHODS The study cohort was derived from multicenter trials of the Penumbra System. Inclusion criteria were anterior circulation proximal occlusion, evaluable pretreatment NCCT, and known time to reperfusion. Ischemic change was quantified using the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and stratified into 3 prespecified groups for comparison: 0 to 4 (most ischemic change) versus 5 to 7 versus 8 to 10 (least ischemic change). RESULTS A total of 249 patients were analyzed: 40 with ASPECTS 0 to 4, 83 with ASPECTS 5 to 7, and 126 with ASPECTS 8 to 10. For ASPECTS 0 to 4, 5 to 7, and 8 to 10, respectively, good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) rates were 5%, 38.6%, and 46% (P<0.0001), and mortality rates were 55%, 28.9%, and 19% (P=0.0001). The only significant pairwise differences were between ASPECTS 0 to 4 and other groups. Symptomatic hemorrhage was more common with lower ASPECTS (P=0.02). Shorter time to reperfusion was significantly associated with better outcomes among patients with ASPECTS 8 to 10 (P=0.01). A similar relationship was seen for ASPECTS 5 to 7 but was not statistically significant. No such relationship was seen for ASPECTS 0 to 4. CONCLUSIONS NCCT seems useful for excluding patients with the greatest burden of ischemic damage from futile intra-arterial treatment, which is unlikely to result in patient functional independence and increases the risk of hemorrhage.","output":"Impact of pretreatment noncontrast CT Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score on clinical outcome after intra-arterial stroke therapy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Increased life expectancy results in a rapid increase of nonagenarian patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO). We conducted this study to assess the efficacy and safety of endovascular thrombectomy (ET) in this age group with use of imaging-based selection. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical and imaging data from 2 different comprehensive stroke centers and compared the outcomes of ET versus intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone among eligible nonagenarians with LVO in anterior circulation and evidence of salvageable tissue on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). RESULTS A total of 617 patients of AIS had been treated with IVT or ET, including 23 eligible nonagenarians. Among these, 9 patients were treated with IVT alone (IVT group) and 14 patients received ET group. Notably, the symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were significantly lower after ET than after IVT (European-Australasian Acute Stroke Study II criteria, 0 vs. 33.3%; p = 0.047; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke criteria, 7.1 vs. 66.7%; p = 0.005). Moreover, although there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 groups on efficacy, ET tended to lead to greater early neurologic recovery at discharge (71.4 vs. 33.3%, p = 0.102) and improve functional outcome at 90 days (71.4 vs. 44.4%, p = 0.383), respectively. CONCLUSION By using MRI-based selection, ET in nonagenarians with AIS caused by LVO within anterior circulation was safe and may lead to improve early neurologic recovery and functional independence at 90 days, as compared with IVT alone.

This study is the first to investigate the association between the SARS-CoV-2 antibody sero-positivity and biochemically verified smoking status, to refine current estimates on this association. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and serum cotinine levels (a well-known marker of tobacco exposure) were assessed in a large sero-epidemiological survey conducted in the town of Troina (Sicily, Italy). A propensity score matching was carried out to reduce the effect of possible factors on SARS-CoV-2 infection risk among study participants. Of the 1785 subjects included in our study, one-third was classified as current smokers, based on serum cotinine levels. The overall proportion of subjects with positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 IgG was 5.4%. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity and previous COVID-19 diagnosis were reduced in smokers. This reduced prevalence persisted after adjusting for possible confounders (such as sex, age, previous infection, chronic conditions, and risk group) at regression analyses, and the point estimates based on the PS-matched models resulted consistent with those for the unmatched population.

While mechanical transmission is more likely to happen, biological transmission is possible via blood-sucking arthropods, but this requires a high grade of compatibility between the vector and the pathogen. If the biological and mechanical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by blood-sucking arthropods is excluded, a mechanical transmission by urban pests could take place.

The data was taken from World Health Organization (WHO) website for one hundred seventy-six (176) days, from March 5, 2020 through August 27, 2020. We identified the best models for the above mentioned approaches that are ARIMA (1,2,4) and 5-th Exponential Weighted Moving Average C ARIMA (2,2,3). Consequently, we recommended to use the 5-th Exponential Weighted Moving Average C ARIMA (2,2,3) model in order to forecast new values of the daily cumulative confirmed cases in Palestine. The forecast values are alarming, and giving the Palestinian government a good picture about the next number of COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases to review her activities and interventions and to provide some robust structures and measures to avoid these challenges.","output":"Modeling Palestinian COVID-19 Cumulative Confirmed Cases: A Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Digital technology can help scientists and governments to inform large auditoriums about COVID-19 and vaccination. Existing technological solutions for assessment of risk of COVID-19 are foreseen for individual use but not for use in scientific research. We aimed to develop a digital platform for communication between scientists and the general population and to use this digital platform for a pilot study on factors associated with the vaccination readiness. METHODS: We developed a digital platform, ensuring researchers an ability to create and manage study projects and to stratify participant cohorts in real-time. Platform provides an interface for participants to be engaged in the studies and receive personalized reports. We assessed demographic (9 items), COVID-19-related behavioral factors that increase a risk of infection (15 items) and a risk of severe disease (10 items), and a readiness for vaccination (10 items). Multiple logistic regression models adjusted for personal covariates, factors affecting the motivation to vaccinate, and risk of infection/severe disease were built to investigate their association with a vaccination readiness. RESULTS: The newly developed digital platform was equipped with a dynamic consent management, allowing participants to opt-out or/and receive invitations for follow-up studies. Data collection was performed between 2021.02.01 and 2021.03.10, and 467 participants were enrolled during this period. In fully adjusted multiple logistic regression models, factors associated with the vaccination readiness were anxiety (odds ratio, OR = 3.09 [95% confidence interval 1.88; 5.09]), trust in pharmaceutical companies (OR = 1.53 [1.03; 2.27]), and social responsibility (OR = 1.61 [1.16; 2.22]). CONCLUSIONS: The major factor that affects the vaccination readiness was anxiety. Lack of association with the risk of infection/severe disease indicates that people do not understand how the vaccine can help them to avoid the infection. KEY MESSAGES: Assessment of a large number of participants in a short time confirms the fact that people are motivated to collaborate using digital platforms. Applying a digital platform can help to create a data-driven dialogue on vaccination readiness, opening an evidence-based scientific discussion between state authorities and the population.","output":"COVID-19 vaccination readiness: use of digital technologies for data-driven decision making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID19 has stressed and stretched healthcare resources to the limit, thus the rational deployment of any resource should be necessary and of patient benefit. This retrospective audit aims to ascertain if a policy of two valid group and save tests prior to transurethral prostate surgery is necessary and if this resource can be redistributed safely during the ongoing pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic patient records for patients that underwent transurethral prostate surgery from June 2017 to June 2018. During a single admission for surgery it was identified how many pre-operative group and save tests, and if a post-operative blood transfusion patients underwent. RESULTS: 146 patients underwent transurethral prostate surgery between June 2017 to June 2018. 97 patients had two valid group and save tests prior to surgery. 49 patients did not have 2 valid group and save tests. 21 patients had expired tests, 20 had only one valid sample, and 8 had no group and save test at all. No patient underwent a blood transfusion during their admission for transurethral prostate surgery. CONCLUSION: This single centre study illustrates pre-operative group and save tests before transurethral prostate surgery are unnecessary as no patient required an associated blood transfusion during admission; and can safely be omitted. The clinical time and resource could be redirected elsewhere for greater patient benefit. 2855.00 of efficiency savings could be made foregoing unneeded group and save tests. A policy omitting pre-operative group and save before transurethral prostate surgery will be implemented under COVID19 pandemic conditions and re-audited in 6 months.","output":"P24 Audit reviewing viability of removing pre-operative Group and Save Tests prior to Transurethral Prostate Surgery during the COVID19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"World health organization (WHO) starts investigating the possibilities in Phyto-medicines after the outburst of SARS in 2002-2003 In the continuation of viral pandemics in December 2019, a novel corona virus came into existence The whole world is facing the severe condition due to outbreaks of the present virus More than two lakhs persons have lost their lives, livelihood and economy due to this COVID-19 virus In the present review authors are trying to establish the relationship between viral disease and herbal secondary metabolites and rituals smoke with special context to India Human beings are inhaling the ceremonial fumes from the primeval period Several plants have shown their antiviral properties against the COVID family viruses such as Ocimum tenuiflorum L Even every civilization has its strong folk remedial knowledge based on plants, animals and natural products The ritual vapours not only purify the environment but also increases the immunity of a person Other promising cure to break the spreading chain of this virus is lockdown When the whole world is in search of effective medicine for the catastrophic disease, the prospects of Ayurveda should be explored","output":"Indian rituals and herbal remedies: a hope against corona pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The increasing number of cases and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 created an urgent need for rapid, reliable testing procedures for SARS-CoV-2 in Emergency Departments (ED) in order to effectively manage hospital resources, allocate beds and prevent nosocomial spread of infection. The ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 assay is a simple, user-friendly, rapid molecular test run on an instrument with a small footprint enabling point-of-care diagnostics. Methods. In the first wave, outsourced RT-PCR testing regularly required 36-48 hours before results were available. This prospective study was conducted in the second wave (October 2020-April 2021) and evaluated the impact the implementation of the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test in the ED had on clinical care processes and patient pathways. 710 patients were recruited upon arrival at the ED which included those presenting clinical symptoms, asymptomatic individuals or persons fulfilling epidemiological criteria. The first anterior nasal swab was taken by trained nurses in the ambulance or a separate consultation room. The ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test was performed in the ED in strict compliance with the manufacturer's instructions and positive or suspected cases were additionally tested with RT_PCR (cobas SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR, Roche) following collection of a second nasopharyngeal NP specimen. Results. Swabs directly tested with the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test showed a diagnostic concordance of 98 % (sensitivity 99.59 %, specificity 94.55 %, PPV 97.6 %, NPV 99.05 %) compared to RT-PCR as reference. The 488 patients that tested positive with the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 had a Ct range in RT-PCR results between 7.94 to 37.42 (in 23.2 % > 30). Two false negative results (0.28%) were recorded from patients with Ct values > 30. 14 (1.69%) discordant results were reviewed case-by-case and usually associated with either very early or very advanced stages of infection. Furthermore, patients initially negative with the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test and admitted to the hospital were tested again on days 5 and 12: no patient became positive. Discussion. The ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test for detection of SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated excellent diagnostic agreement with RT-PCR under the above-mentioned patients pathways implemented during the second wave. The main advantage of the system was the provision of reliable results within a few minutes. This not only allowed immediate initiative of appropriate therapy and care for COVID-19 (patient benefit) but provided essential information on isolation and thus available beds. This drastically helped the overall finances of the department and additionally allowed more patients to be admitted including those requiring immediate attention; this was not possible during the first wave since beds were blocked waiting for diagnostic confirmation. Our findings also show that when interpreting the results, the clinical condition and epidemiological history of the patient must be taken into account, as with any test procedure. Overall, the ID NOW(TM) COVID-19 test for SARS-CoV-2 provided a rapid and reliable alternative to laboratory-based RT-PCR in the real clinical setting which became an acceptable part of the daily routine within the ED and demonstrated that early patient management can mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the hospital.","output":"Molecular point-of-care testing for SARS-CoV-2 using the ID NOW(TM) System in Emergency Department: Prospective Evaluation and Implementation in the Care Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Existing studies of chromatin conformation have primarily focused on potential enhancers interacting with gene promoters. By contrast, the interactivity of promoters per se, while equally critical to understanding transcriptional control, has been largely unexplored, particularly in a cell type-specific manner for blood lineage cell types. In this study, we leverage promoter capture Hi-C data across a compendium of blood lineage cell types to identify and characterize cell type-specific super-interactive promoters (SIPs). Notably, promoter-interacting regions (PIRs) of SIPs are more likely to overlap with cell type-specific ATAC-seq peaks and GWAS variants for relevant blood cell traits than PIRs of non-SIPs. Moreover, PIRs of cell-type-specific SIPs show enriched heritability of relevant blood cell trait (s), and are more enriched with GWAS variants associated with blood cell traits compared to PIRs of non-SIPs. Further, SIP genes tend to express at a higher level in the corresponding cell type. Importantly, SIP subnetworks incorporating cell-type-specific SIPs and ATAC-seq peaks help interpret GWAS variants. Examples include GWAS variants associated with platelet count near the megakaryocyte SIP gene EPHB3 and variants associated lymphocyte count near the native CD4 T-Cell SIP gene ETS1. Interestingly, around 25.7% ~ 39.6% blood cell traits GWAS variants residing in SIP PIR regions disrupt transcription factor binding motifs.

We describe an outbreak of 14 cases diagnosed in a 13-day period in the second quarter of 2021 in a hospital-based ESRD facility, and our coordinated use of epidemiology, viral genome sequencing, and infection control practices to quickly end the cycle of transmission. MethodsSymptomatic patients and staff members were diagnosed via RT-PCR tests. Facility-wide screening was conducted using rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen tests. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained from residual diagnostic PCR specimens. ResultsOf the 106 patients who received dialysis in the facility, 10 were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, as was one patient support person. Of three positive staff members, two were unvaccinated and had provided care for six and four of the affected patients, respectively. Sequencing demonstrated that all the cases in the cluster shared an identical B.1.1.7./Alpha substrain. Attack rates were greatest among unvaccinated patients and staff. Vaccine effectiveness was 88% among patients. ConclusionsPrompt recognition of an infection cluster and rapid intervention efforts successfully ended the outbreak.

Methods: A mathematical model considering age-structure, vaccine, antiviral treatment, and influx of the Omicron variant was developed. We estimated transmission rates among age groups using maximum likelihood estimation for the age-structured model. The impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions (in community and border), quantified by a parameter in the force of infection, and vaccination were examined through a multi-faceted analysis. A theory-based endemic equilibrium study was performed to find the manageable number of cases according to Omicron- and healthcare-related factors. Results: By fitting the model to the available data, the estimated values of ranged from 0.31 to 0.73, representing the intensity of nonpharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing level. If <0.55 and 300,000 booster shots were administered daily from February 3, 2022, the number of severe cases was forecasted to exceed the severe bed capacity. Moreover, the number of daily cases is reduced as the timing of screening measures is delayed. If screening measure was intensified as early as November 24, 2021 and the number of overseas entrant cases was contained to 1 case per 10 days, simulations showed that the daily incidence by February 3, 2022 could have been reduced by 87%. Furthermore, we found that the incidence number in mid-December 2021 exceeded the theory-driven manageable number of daily cases. Conclusion: Nonpharmaceutical interventions, vaccination, and antiviral therapy influence the spread of Omicron and number of severe cases in the Republic of Korea. Intensive and early screening measures during the emergence of a new variant is key in controlling the epidemic size. Using the endemic equilibrium of the model, a formula for the manageable daily cases depending on the severity rate and average length of hospital stay was derived so that the number of severe cases does not surpass the severe bed capacity.","output":"Multi-faceted analysis of COVID-19 epidemic in the Republic of Korea considering Omicron variant: Mathematical modeling-based study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During the 1980s and 1990s, there was a steep rise in disability benefit claims in Britain, especially among older male workers, and the debate centred on the relative generosity of these benefits as well as the effects of deindustrialization. Since that time, the disability benefit system has been subject to a series of reforms, all largely aimed at reducing the number of claims and targeting benefits more closely to those with the greatest health need. At the same time, the labour market has also evolved, and until the recent Covid-19 pandemic, it had a historically low level of unemployment, accompanied by falling real earnings. We use individual longitudinal data from 2010 to 2018 in a dynamic panel framework to explore the relative importance of health status, benefit generosity and local labour market conditions for disability benefit claims in the modern British labour market. We focus particularly on spatial variation in claims, and find that, in line with older evidence, while health status is clearly important, geographic variation in labour market conditions still influences the propensity to claim those disability benefits that are conditional on not working. ? 2021 The Authors.

METHODS: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study by telephone with 1159 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and 96 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who were discharged from the endocrinology department of a hospital from January 1, 2019, to January 24, 2020. According to their fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 2-h postprandial BG (2hPBG) values, the patients were divided into the well-controlled BG group and the poorly controlled BG group. The main evaluation indicators included sociodemographic variables, health risk variables and adherence to self-management behaviors. RESULTS: In total, 74.46% of the T2DM patients and 64.89% of the T1DM patients had poor glycemic control. T2DM patients with poor glycemic control were more likely to be older (odds ratio (OR): 1.017 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003-1.030]; P = 0.013), have fewer than 12 years of education (OR: 1.646 [95% CI 1.202-2.255]; P = 0.002), lack a BG meter at home (OR: 2.728 [95% CI 1.205-6.179]; P = 0.016), have a lower degree of medicationcompliance (OR: 1.627 [95% CI 1.076-2.460]; P = 0.021), and engage in less self-monitoring of BG (SMBG) per week (OR: 10.884 [95% CI 5.883-20.139]; P < 0.001). Fewer than 12 years of education (OR: 3.031 [95% CI 1.112-8.263]; P = 0.030) was a risk factor for glycemic control in T1DM.

The article seeks to understand the reasons for vaccination differences among high-income, liberal democracies. METHODS: The country cases were selected based on tiers of population-level vaccination uptake within six months after vaccines became broadly available (for high-income countries). We conducted a rapid review of primary data for each country case. Through a graphical and descriptive analysis, we evaluated common patterns as well as significant divergences in the vaccination rollout across countries and its relationship with COVID-19 health outcomes, government policy responses, resource constraints, and socio-political factors. This inductive analysis provides a sense of how resource constraints compare with current political contexts in each country case that may influence the public's response to a national vaccination strategy. RESULTS: Resources, socio-economic factors, and health outcomes related to COVID-19 do not ensure vaccination policy success as the case of the United States makes clear. Instead, trust in government and health systems appear to promise a higher vaccination uptake and maintained support for measures during a pandemic. Trust in government can be defined as the confidence citizens have that governmental actions will do what is right and perceived as fair. CONCLUSION: Denmark, the United States, and Canada are high-income liberal democracies with very different vaccine strategies and subsequently different vaccination outcomes across their populations. What appears to be critical to successful vaccination outcomes is high trust in government or health officials, along with the depoliticization of the COVID-19 pandemic amongst the country's political parties.","output":"Resources or Trust: What matters more in the vaccination strategies of high-income liberal democracies?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Symptoms of psychological distress and disorder have been widely reported in people under quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic; in addition to severe disruption of peoples daily activity and sleep patterns.

We studied the profile of antibody and cellular immunity in children aged 3-11 years in comparison with adults. Antibody profiles in children were strong with high titres against spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in children strongly boosted antibody responses against seasonal beta-coronaviruses, partly through cross-recognition of the S2 domain, indicating a broad humoral response that was not seen in adults. T cell responses against spike were also >2-fold higher in children compared to adults and displayed a strong Th1 cytokine profile. SARS-CoV-2 spike-reactive cellular responses were present in more than half the seronegative children, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive responses or sensitization against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, all children retained high antibody titres and cellular responses for more than 6 months after infection whilst relative antibody waning was seen in adults. Children thus distinctly generate robust, cross-reactive and sustained immune responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection with focussed specificity against spike protein. These observations demonstrate several novel features of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in children and may provide insights into relative clinical protection in this group.

However, the magnitude and determinants of MOV in the country are not known. Thus, this study seeks to assess the prevalence and determinants of MOV in the country. South Africa is sub-divided into nine administrative provinces. We used nationally representative data from the 2016 South African Demographic and Health Survey. We considered MOV to have occurred if a child aged 12-23 months old had not taken all scheduled basic vaccine doses despite having any of the following contacts with health services: delivery in a health facility; postnatal clinic visit; receipt of vitamin A; and any child-related treatment at a health facility. Multilevel logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with MOV. The national prevalence of MOV among children aged 12-23 months was 40.1%. Children whose mothers attended facility-based antenatal care were considerably less likely to experience MOV than those whose mothers did not attend antenatal care: odds ratio (OR) 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.88.

The GARCH results show that the pandemic negatively affected the SSE stock returns during the spread of the virus, and the conditional variance showed increased variation at the time. However, the increased volatility did not cause a market crash as Patel & Sarkar (1998) and Mishkin & White (2002) reported. The negative effect on stock returns and the increased volatility might be justified because well-diversified markets can alter the wealth effects on composite stock markets, and they can make a quick recovery after crises. When comparing the effects of the pandemic to those of the 2008 financial crisis on SSE returns, the results show higher risk values and much thicker tails of probability distribution during the pandemic. Both the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis negatively affected stock returns, but the effect on volatility was stronger during the pandemic. ? 2022 Asian Economic and Social Society.

To assess the incidence and rate of implant removal among orthopedic patients, its indications, and the effect of COVID-19 pandemic. Material & Method: A retrospective study was done during the period from October 2017 to October 2020 included all patients admitted for removal of orthopedic implants. Results: One-hundred eleven patients with a mean age of 28  10.9 years were included in this study. Most (83.8%) were males. The incidence rate of removal was 20.2%. The mean period between implant fixation and removal was 26  20 months. Lower limb fractures constituted 85.6% of cases with about half of them as foot and ankle fractures. The most frequently presented fractures were femur and tibia (33.3% and 21.6%, respectively), while the most frequently removed implants were plate and screws (43.2%). Only 8.9% of surgeries were indicated for removal, and only 4.5% of all patients suffered post-removal complications.

Our findings indicate that positive attitudes toward complying with physical distancing, stronger descriptive norms using ingroup members as referents, and weaker perceived behavioral control over the action of breaching social distancing predict stronger adherence. Besides, individuals who support right-wing parties, younger people, and males are more prone to noncompliance. We suggest designing interventions that foster positive attitudes toward social distancing and address the negative consequences that violating social distancing can cause to in-group members to persuade individuals to stay at home.

To effect change in the area of advanced literature searching skills, a pharmacy librarian joined with two Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experience (APPE) preceptors to design and implement a crash course on applied systematic searching skills for a cohort of four students. CASE PRESENTATION: Through the cognitive apprenticeship model, a Systematic Searching Crash Course (SSCC) was implemented among a cohort of four academic APPE students. Students developed search strategies using controlled vocabulary and free text, translated their searches into multiple databases, and used citation management software to build libraries of evidence. Additionally, the cohort blindly peer reviewed each other's search strategies, wrote literature reviews, and finally conducted a search together without input from the pharmacy librarian. CONCLUSIONS: Review of the pre-/post-course self-assessment taken by the cohort indicates the SSCC is a success in terms of improving student confidence in accessing and synthesizing primary literature. As the crash course is further refined and implemented, there may be more opportunity to embed the course into didactic curriculum and residency programs and to potentially reproduce it for other health science disciplines.","output":"Implementation of the cognitive apprenticeship model for enhancement of advanced searching skills in a pharmacy academia rotation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article addresses severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first identified in November of 2002 and continued to spread till 2003.

Our aim was to assess the antibody response to and safety of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines in ANC. METHODS: This longitudinal study included ANC patients vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 between March and August 2021. Side effects were assessed 2C10 days after each dose. Neurological status and anti-spike receptor binding domain antibody levels were evaluated before vaccination and 4 weeks after the second dose. Healthcare-workers served as controls for antibody levels. RESULTS: We included 300 ANC patients (median age 52, IQR 40C65), and 347 healthcare-workers (median age 45, IQR 34C54). mRNA-1273 vaccine was associated with an increased risk of both local (OR 2.52 95% CI 1.45C4.39, p = 0.001) and systemic reactions (OR 2.51% CI 1.49C4.23, p = 0.001). The incidence of relapse was not different before and after vaccine (Incidence rate ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.29C1.83). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were detected in 268 (89.9%) patients and in all controls (p < 0.0001). BNT162b2 vaccine (OR 8.84 95% CI 2.32C33.65, p = 0.001), anti-CD20 mAb (OR 0.004 95% CI 0.0007C0.026, p < 0.0001) and fingolimod (OR 0.036 95% CI 0.002C0.628, p = 0023) were associated with an increased risk of not developing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines were safe in a large group of ANC patients. Anti-CD20 and fingolimod treatment, as well as vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine, led to a reduced humoral response. These findings could inform vaccine policies in ANC patients undergoing immunotherapy.

Previous research has suggested that combining forecasts from multiple models into a single \\"ensemble\\" forecast can increase the robustness of forecasts. Here we evaluate the real-time application of an open, collaborative ensemble to forecast deaths attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S. Methods Beginning on April 13, 2020, we collected and combined one- to four-week ahead forecasts of cumulative deaths for U.S. jurisdictions in standardized, probabilistic formats to generate real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts. We evaluated the point prediction accuracy and calibration of these forecasts compared to reported deaths. Results Analysis of 2,512 ensemble forecasts made April 27 to July 20 with outcomes observed in the weeks ending May 23 through July 25, 2020 revealed precise short-term forecasts, with accuracy deteriorating at longer prediction horizons of up to four weeks. At all prediction horizons, the prediction intervals were well calibrated with 92-96% of observations falling within the rounded 95% prediction intervals. Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts issued in April-July 2020 provided robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in the United States. With the ongoing need for forecasts of impacts and resource needs for the COVID-19 response, the results underscore the importance of combining multiple probabilistic models and assessing forecast skill at different prediction horizons.

However, reports of hemolysis call for caution in using these pumps, especially in neonatology and in pediatric intensive care. Cavitation can be a cause of blood damage. The aim of our study was to obtain information about the cavitation conditions and to provide the safest operating range of centrifugal pumps. A series of tests were undertaken to determine the points at which pump performance decreases 3% and gas bubbles start to appear downstream of the pump. Two pumps were tested; pump R with a closed impeller and pump S with a semiopen impeller. The performance tests demonstrated that pump S has an optimal region narrower than pump R and it is shifted to the higher flows. When the pump performance started to decrease, the inlet pressure varies but close to -150 mmHg in the test with low gas content and higher than -100 mmHg in the tests with increased gas content. The same trend was observed at the points of development of massive gas emboli. Importantly, small packages of bubbles downstream of the pump were registered at relatively high inlet pressures. The gaseous cavitation in centrifugal pumps is a phenomenon that appears with decreasing inlet pump pressures. There are a few ways to increase inlet pump pressures: (1) positioning the pump as low as possible in relation to the patient; (2) selecting appropriate sized venous cannulas and their careful positioning; and (3) controlling patient's volume status.","output":"Is there a \\"safe\\" suction pressure in the venous line of extracorporeal circulation system?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The task of managing epidemic security during COVID-19 is considered.

It is unknown whether anticoagulation can prevent these complications and improve outcome. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to answer the question: What is the effect of (prophylactic and therapeutic dose) anticoagulation therapy in COVID-19 patients on cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications and clinical outcome? Relevant outcome measures were mortality (crucial), hospital admission, length of stay, thromboembolic complications (pulmonary embolism, stroke, transient ischaemic attack), need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury and use of renal replacement therapy. Medline and Embase databases were searched with relevant search terms until 17 July 2020. After systematic analysis, eight studies were included. Analysis was stratified for the start of anticoagulation before or during hospital admission. RESULTS: There was insufficient evidence that therapeutic anticoagulation could improve the outcome in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. None of the studies demonstrated improved mortality, except for one very small Italian study. Furthermore, none of the studies showed a positive effect of anticoagulation on other outcome measures in COVID-19, such as ICU admission, length of hospital stay, thromboembolic complications, need for mechanical ventilation, acute kidney failure or need for renal replacement therapy, except for two studies demonstrating an association between anticoagulation and a lower incidence of pulmonary embolism. However, the level of evidence of all studies varied from 'low' to 'very low', according to the GRADE methodology. CONCLUSION: Analysis of the literature showed that there was insufficient evidence to answer our objective on the effect of anticoagulation on outcome in COVID-19 patients, especially due to the low scientific quality of the described studies.

We sought to determine the frequency of neurologic deficits following treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas with and without pial artery supply. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-two consecutive patients who underwent treatment for intracranial dural arteriovenous fistulas at our hospital from 2008 to 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient data were examined for posttreatment neurologic deficits; patients with such deficits were evaluated for imaging evidence of cerebral infarction. Data were analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS Of 122 treated patients, 29 (23.8%) had dural arteriovenous fistulas with pial artery supply and 93 (76.2%) had dural arteriovenous fistulas without pial arterial supply. Of patients with pial artery supply, 4 (13.8%) had posttreatment neurologic deficits, compared with 2 patients (2.2%) without pial artery supply (P = .04). Imaging confirmed that 3 patients with pial artery supply (10.3%) had cerebral infarcts, compared with only 1 patient without pial artery supply (1.1%, P = .03). Increasing patient age was also positively associated with pial supply and treatment-related complications. CONCLUSIONS Patients with dural arteriovenous fistulas supplied by the pial arteries were more likely to experience posttreatment complications, including ischemic strokes, than patients with no pial artery supply. The approach to dural arteriovenous fistula treatment should be made on a case-by-case basis so that the risk of complications can be minimized.","output":"Pial Artery Supply as an Anatomic Risk Factor for Ischemic Stroke in the Treatment of Intracranial Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals use social network sites (SNSs) as an effective tool for communicating relevant information with others during the outbreak of infectious diseases.

Healthcare environments play an important role in the transmission of HAIs. The Probiotic Cleaning Hygiene System (PCHS) has been shown to decrease hospital surface pathogens up to 90% vs. conventional chemical cleaning (CCC). This study compares PCHS to CCC as to reduction of HAIs and their severity, related antibiotic resistances, and costs. Incidence rates of HAIs/antibiotic resistances were estimated from a previously conducted multicenter pre-post (6 months CCC + 6 months PCHS) intervention study, after applying the propensity score matching technique. A budget impact analysis compared the current scenario of use of CCC with future scenarios considering increasing utilization of PCHS, from 5% to 50% in the next five years, from a hospital perspective in Italy. The cumulative incidence of HAI was 4.6% and 2.4% (p < 0.0001) for CCC (N = 4160) and PCHS (N = 4160) (OR = 0.47, CI 95% 0.37C0.60), with severe HAIs of 1.57% vs. 1% and antibiotic resistances of 1.13% vs. 0.53%, respectively. Increased use of PCHS over CCC in Italian internal medicine/geriatrics and neurology departments in the next 5 years is expected to avert at least about 31,000 HAIs and 8500 antibiotic resistances, and save at least 14 million euros, of which 11.6 for the treatment of resistant HAIs.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of eravacycline compared with best previously available therapy in adults with difficult-to-treat resistant (DTR) A. baumannii pneumonia. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of adults hospitalized for pneumonia with DTR A. baumannii. Patients receiving eravacycline were compared with those receiving best previously available therapy. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included clinical cure at Day 14, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, microbiologic cure, and readmission within 90 days with a positive A. baumannii respiratory culture. RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were included, with 27 receiving eravacycline. Eravacycline was associated with higher 30-day mortality (33% vs 15%; P = 0.048), lower microbiologic cure (17% vs 59%; P = 0.004), and longer durations of mechanical ventilation (10.5 vs 6.5 days; P = 0.016).

I suggest the crisis provides the circumstances for greater active engagement with informal actors, by placing informal enterprises on a par with formal firms within industrial policy. I propose integration and registration, as opposed to formalisation, and the provision of state support without taxation.

Patients with known surgical disease at admission were excluded. Sub-analyses were performed with a consecutive group of COVID-19 patients admitted during the study period, who did not require surgical consultation. Results Ten out of 3089 COVID-19 positive patients (0.32%) required surgical consultation. Among those admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) incidence was 1.9%. Mortality was 40% in patients requiring immediate surgery and 20% in those suitable for conservative management. The overall median length of stay(LOS) of patients admitted to ICU was longer in those requiring surgical consultation compared with those who did not (51.5 vs 25 days,p=0.0042). Patients requiring surgical consultation and treatment for de-novo surgical disease had longer median ICU-LOS (31.5 vs 12 days, p=0.0004).

Older adults with underlying health conditions are at an especially high risk of developing life-threatening complications if infected. Most intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and non-ICU hospitalizations have been among patients with at least one underlying health condition. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a model to estimate the risk status of the patients of a nationwide pharmacy chain in the United States, and to identify the geographic distribution of patients who have the highest risk of severe COVID-19 complications. METHODS: A risk model was developed using a training test split approach to identify patients who are at high risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19. Adult patients (aged 18 years) were identified from the Walgreens pharmacy electronic data warehouse. Patients were considered eligible to contribute data to the model if they had at least one prescription filled at a Walgreens location between October 27, 2019, and March 25, 2020. Risk parameters included age, whether the patient is being treated for a serious or chronic condition, and urban density classification. Parameters were differentially weighted based on their association with severe complications, as reported in earlier cases. An at-risk rate per 1000 people was calculated at the county level, and ArcMap was used to depict the rate of patients at high risk for severe complications from COVID-19. Real-time COVID-19 cases captured by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) were layered in the risk map to show where cases exist relative to the high-risk populations. RESULTS: Of the 30,100,826 adults included in this study, the average age is 50 years, 15% have at least one specialty medication, and the average patient has 2 to 3 comorbidities. Nearly 28% of patients have the greatest risk score, and an additional 34.64% of patients are considered high-risk, with scores ranging from 8 to 10. Age accounts for 53% of a patients total risk, followed by the number of comorbidities (29%); inferred chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, or diabetes (15%); and urban density classification (5%). CONCLUSIONS: This risk model utilizes data from approximately 10% of the US population. Currently, this is the most comprehensive US model to estimate and depict the county-level prognosis of COVID-19 infection. This study shows that there are counties across the United States whose residents are at high risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19. Our county-level risk estimates may be used alongside other data sets to improve the accuracy of anticipated health care resource needs. The interactive map can also aid in proactive planning and preparations among employers that are deemed critical, such as pharmacies and grocery stores, to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within their facilities.","output":"Distribution of Patients at Risk for Complications Related to COVID-19 in the United States: Model Development Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle threshold values from 18,803 cases (2 March-4 October) in Madrid define three stages: (i) initial ten weeks with sustained reduction in viral load (Ct: 23.4-32.3), (ii) stability with low viral loads (Ct: 31.9-35.5) in the next nine weeks and (iii) sudden increase with progressive higher viral loads until reaching stability at high levels in the next twelve weeks, coinciding with an increased percentage of positive cases and reduced median age.

The study followed a prospective observational design, starting in July 2020 and lasting for one year. A total of 889 pregnant women were routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection in an outpatient setting at our clinic, using nasal swabs for PCR testing. A total of 76 women were diagnosed with COVID-19. The positive patients who accepted study enrollment were systematically analyzed by collecting weekly nasal, urine, fecal, and serum samples, including amniotic fluid, placenta, umbilical cord, and breast milk at hospital admission and postpartum. Mothers with COVID-19 were at a significantly higher risk of developing gestational hypertension and giving birth prematurely by c-section than the general pregnant population. Moreover, their mortality rates were substantially higher. Their newborns did not have negative outcomes, except for prematurity, and an insignificant number of newborns were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (5.4%). No amniotic fluid samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, and only 1.01% of PCR tests from breast milk were confirmed positive. Based on these results, we support the idea that SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant women do not expose their infants to an additional risk of infection via breastfeeding, close contact, or in-utero. Consequently, we do not support maternalCnewborn separation at delivery since they do not seem to be at an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","output":"Assessing SARS-CoV-2 Vertical Transmission and Neonatal Complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has swept the globe, with a domino effect on medical education and training. In this study, we surveyed Canadian radiology residents to understand the impact of the pandemic on their residency training, strategies utilized by the residency programs in mitigating those impacts, and factors important to residents in the selection of educational resources on COVID-19. METHODS: A 10-item questionnaire was distributed to 460 resident members of the Canadian Association of Radiologists. The survey was open for 2 weeks, with a reminder sent at half-way mark. RESULTS: We received 96 responses (response rate: 20.9%). The 4 highest affected domains of training were daytime case volumes (92.4%), daytime schedules (87.4%), internal and external assessments (86.5%), and vacation/travel (83.3%). Virtual teaching rounds (91.7%), change in schedules to allow staying home (78.1%), and virtual/phone readouts (72.9%) were the most utilized strategies by the Canadian radiology residency programs. Overall stress of exposure to the disease was moderate to low (86.5%). A minority of the residents were redeployed (6.2%), although most (68.8%) were on standby for redeployment.

The aim of the study was to define demographics, clinical, and therapeutic features of aSAH during the COVID-19 outbreak and compare these with a historical cohort. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort study, patients aged 18 years or older, who were diagnosed with aSAH at the participating centers in Lombardy from March 9 to May 10, 2020, were included (COVID-19 group). In order to minimize bias related to possible SAH seasonality, the control group was composed of patients diagnosed with aSAH from March 9 to May 10 of the three previous years, 2017C2018-2019 (pre-pandemic group). Twenty-three demographic, clinical, and therapeutic features were collected. Statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients during the COVID-19 period and 179 in the control group were enrolled at 14 centers. Only 4 patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The diagnostic delay was significantly increased (+ 68%) in the COVID-19 group vs. pre-pandemic (1.06 vs. 0.63 days, respectively, p-value = 0.030), while therapeutic delay did not differ significantly between the two periods (0.89 vs. 0.74 days, p-value = 0.183). Patients with poor outcome (GOS at discharge from 1 to 3) were higher during the COVID-19 period (54.2%) compared to pre-pandemic (40.2%, p = 0.044). In logistic regression analysis, in which outcome was the dichotomized Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), five variables showed p-values < 0.05: age at admission, WFNS grade, treatment (none), days in ICU, and ischemia. CONCLUSIONS: We documented a significantly increased diagnostic delay for subarachnoid hemorrhages during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy. However, despite the dramatic situation that the healthcare system was experiencing, the Lombardy regional reorganization model, which allowed centralization of neurosurgical emergencies such as SAHs, avoided a therapeutic delay and led to results overall comparable to the control period.","output":"Aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage during the COVID-19 outbreak in a Hub and Spoke system: observational multicenter cohort study in Lombardy, Italy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the importance of safe access to sufficient clean water in vulnerable communities, renewing interest in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs and related targets under Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6). The purpose of this study was to better understand the obstacles to water access in vulnerable communities and identify ways they might be addressed in five countries in the Mekong Region (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam). To this end, qualitative interviews with 50 government officials and development or health experts were complimented with a quantitative survey of the experiences and views of individuals in 15 vulnerable communities. There were several key findings. First, difficulties in accessing sufficient clean water for drinking and hygiene persist in certain vulnerable communities, including informal urban settlements, remote minority villages, and migrant worker camps. Second, limited rights, high prices, and remote locations were common obstacles to household access to improved water sources. Third, seasonal differences in the availability of clean water, alongside other disruptions to supply such as restrictions on movement in COVID-19 responses, drove households towards lower quality sources. Fourth, there are multiple threats to water quality from source to consumption that should be addressed by monitoring, treatment, and watershed protection. Fifth, stakeholder groups differ from each other and residents of vulnerable communities regarding the significance of water access, supply and quality difficulties, and how they should be addressed.

Cytokine profiles observed in COVID-19 patients have revealed increased levels of IL-1?, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; and increased NF-&#954;B pathway activity. Recent evidence has shown that the upregulation of the WNT/?-catenin pathway is associated with inflammation, resulting in a cytokine storm in ARDS (acute respire distress syndrome) and especially in COVID-19 patients. Several studies have shown that the WNT/?-catenin pathway interacts with PPAR?3 in an opposing interplay in numerous diseases. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted the interesting role of PPAR?3 agonists as modulators of inflammatory and immunomodulatory drugs through the targeting of the cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV2 infection presents a decrease in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) associated with the upregulation of the WNT/?-catenin pathway. SARS-Cov2 may invade human organs besides the lungs through the expression of ACE2. Evidence has highlighted the fact that PPAR?3 agonists can increase ACE2 expression, suggesting a possible role for PPAR?3 agonists in the treatment of COVID-19.

This study was conducted via web access, using data from April 24 to May 24, with 45,160 Brazilians (aged 18 or older), with a sample weighted by Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD) data. Change in sleep quality (outcome), monthly income, effect on family income, occupation/work, gender, age group, marital status, and change in domestic work (exposures) were reported. The percentages of onset or increase of sleep disorders and adjusted odds ratio were estimated.

Given that colon cancer is the third most common cancer and the second deadliest cancer in the world, its timely diagnosis and treatment are necessary to reduce costs and improve quality of life and patient survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A comprehensive search performed on June 2021 in various databases, including Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus. Keywords such as diagnosis, treatment, coronavirus disease-19, COVID-19, coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2, 2019-nCoV, coronavirus, 2019 novel, SARS-CoV-2 virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, COVID-19, COVID-19, coronavirus disease 19, SARS coronavirus 2, colorectal neoplasm, and colorectal cancer  was used individually or a combination of these words. All retrieved articles were entered into a database on EndNote X7. Then, studies were first selected by title and then by abstract, and at the end, full texts were investigated. RESULTS: Of the 850 studies, 43 were identified as eligible. According to studies, the diagnosis of colorectal cancer and the number of diagnostic procedures have decreased. Emergency visits due to obstruction or perforation of the large intestine or in advanced stages of cancer have increased, and a delay in the diagnosis of colorectal cancer has reported from 5.4 to 26%. Treatment of colorectal cancer has also decreased significantly or has been delayed, interrupted, or stopped. This reduction and delay have been observed in all treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and long-term radiation therapy; only cases of emergency surgery and short-term radiotherapy has increased. The waiting time for hospitalization and the length of hospital stay after surgery has been reported to be higher. Changes in patients treatment plans and complete to partial cessation of hospitals activitiesthat provided treatment serviceswere reported. CONCLUSION: According to the reduction in the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer due to the COVID-19 pandemic, compensating for the reduction and preventing the continuation of this declining trend, requires serious and effective interventions to prevent its subsequent consequences, including referrals of people with advanced stages and emergency conditions, increasing treatment costs and reducing the quality of life and patients survival.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment: a Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The involvement of autophagy and its dysfunction in asthma is still poorly documented. By using a murine model of chronic house dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation, we tested the expression of several autophagy markers in the lung and spleen of asthma-like animals. Compared to control mice, in HDM-sensitized and challenged mice, the expression of sequestosome-1/p62, a multifunctional adaptor protein that plays an important role in the autophagy machinery, was raised in the splenocytes. In contrast, its expression was decreased in the neutrophils recovered from the bronchoalveolar fluid, indicating that autophagy was independently regulated in these two compartments. In a strategy of drug repositioning, we treated allergen-sensitized mice with the therapeutic peptide P140 known to target chaperone-mediated autophagy. A single intravenous administration of P140 in these mice resulted in a significant reduction in airway resistance and elastance, and a reduction in the number of neutrophils and eosinophils present in the bronchoalveolar fluid. It corrected the autophagic alteration without showing any suppressive effect in the production of IgG1 and IgE.

We rely on a series of complementary research approaches, such as desk research, comparative statistical analysis, exploratory learning algorithm, and a deterministic panel regression framework. The analysis reveals that most EU countries were not prepared for the pandemic crisis as they lacked a financial security buffer. The growing fiscal pressure and lockdown restrictions additionally resulted in an increase in banks exposure to the government debt market and higher government debt securities exposure on their balance sheets. One of the novelties of the research is the adoption of the gap method in order to measure the changes between banking assets major items (government securities vs. loans) and uncovering the preference for holding a specific type of asset. Additional insight is brought by the clustering solution, which shows increased cross-country heterogeneity in terms of the sovereignCbanks relationship. Empirical research shows that banks involvement in the sovereign debt market is sensitive mainly to negative information related to pandemic occurrence and, to a lower extent, to positive information reflected by governments reactions and economic stimulus measures.

RESULTS: The study resulted in the extraction of six themes, which reflect the experiences of the study participants. The themes are: 1) lived time; 2) lived body; 3) lived relationship; 4) lived economical; 5) lived vocational and 6) lived spiritual. It was found that diabetes still causes participants to suffer from fear, depression and anxiety along with they hate to have modification in dietary pattern in which they cannot have sweets and sweet products. Although emotional support was provided by the family members and friends. Participants absence from work in their early diagnosis was due to both their health conditions and emotional embarrassment. There are evidences that diabetes has psychological damage to patients life and so they feel more anxious and fatigue. CONCLUSION: The study attempted to explore the lived in experiences of Diabetes Mellitus Patients and it was found that DM has affected all the dimensions of health especially in physical, psychological and economical dimensions. 1) In Physical dimension the patients were having common complaints of giddiness, weakness and headache which was leading them to certain problems. 2) In psychological dimension the patients were having more anxiety, fear regarding the disease and long term treatment along with depression. 3) In economical dimension some patients were having good family income so there were no issues related to expenses on diet and medication 4) In social dimension all the participants were having good relation with their everyone. 5) In vocational dimension all were having difficulty at work place to concentrate in their work but after starting the treatment their health was improved so later they continued their work properly. 6) In spiritual dimension only two participants were not having belief in God rest all were having faith in God and prayed daily.","output":"Understanding Patients Experiences Living with Diabetes Mellitus: A Qualitative Study, Gujarat, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses serious health and economic problems worldwide. One of the worst scenarios is the collapse of the medical care system due to nosocomial infections. SARS-CoV-2 quickly spreads in closed spaces, crowded areas, and close physical distances, which frequently occur in Japanese medical facilities. Although we are making efforts to avoid such situations, healthcare workers always face the risk of developing a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the workplace because of proximity. Thus, we need to battle SARS-CoV-2 using a unique strategy. We propose a novel strategy to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infections: measurement of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and using the power of immune survivors. We agree with using standard precautions and early isolation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to block the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we face difficulties carrying out these fundamental missions. Now, we focus on immune survivors. If healthcare workers acquired the neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV-2, they are considered immune survivors with a low risk of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2. These immune survivors can contribute to the care of patients with COVID-19 on the front line. Also, these immune survivors can function as an envelope by surrounding COVID-19 patients. As a result, immune survivors can eliminate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in medical facilities as well as in society. We understand that the concept of immune survivors needs further discussion. No information is available on how long or the titer of neutralizing antibody required for protection from infection. We have just started to measure antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers in our hospital. This project will provide further information in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Furthermore, as variant SARS-CoV-2 strains that circumvent antibody responses emerge, cross-protective vaccines provide substantial public health benefits. Vaxart is developing a shelf stable oral tablet vaccine that incorporates both the spike (S) and the more conserved nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Vaxarts vaccine platform uses a non-replicating adenovirus and a TLR3 agonist as an adjuvant. METHODS: In an open-label phase 1 clinical study, 35 healthy subjects received either a single low (1x10(10) IU; n=15) or high (5x10(10) IU; n=15) dose of the vaccine candidate VXA-CoV2-1 with a small cohort receiving 2 low doses. PBMCs were taken at pre- and 7 days post-vaccination and restimulated with S and N peptides from SARS-CoV-2 or the 4 human endemic coronaviruses (HCoV). Cells were stained for CD4/CD8/CD107a (surface) and IFN/TNF (intracellular). Subjects that received an intramuscular (i.m.) mRNA vaccine had PBMCs taken at the same timepoints and were compared in the same assay. RESULTS: The studys results indicate that the VXA-CoV2-1 tablet was well tolerated. The majority of subjects had an increase in S-specific anti-viral CD8(+) T cell responses. 19/26 (73%) subjects had a measurable CD8(+) T cell response on day 8 above baseline, on average 1.5-4.6%. In a comparator experiment with the 2 SARS-CoV-2 i.m. mRNA vaccines, VXA-CoV2-1 outperformed other vaccine candidates with a >3.5-fold increase in S specific antiviral CD8 T cell responses. T cell responses specific to the 4 endemic HCoV were increased by 0.6% in subjects given VXA-CoV2-1. CONCLUSION: Here we describe a room temperature stable tablet that induces SARS-CoV-2 S specific CD8 T cells of high magnitude after one dose in humans. Overall, the level of antiviral SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells, particularly IFNg-producing CD8s, induced following oral immunization with VXA-CoV2-1 are of higher magnitude than the mRNA vaccines currently in use against COVID-19. T cell responses against 4 endemic HCoV were also induced. Because T cells may be important in protecting against death and severe infection, these results suggest that VXA-CoV2-1 could be cross-protective against a wide array of emerging pandemic coronaviruses.

High seroprevalences of MERS-CoV antibodies and the high virus prevalence in Saudi Arabian dromedary camels indicate an endemicity of the virus in the Arabian Peninsula, which predates the 2012 human MERS index case. Saudi Arabian dromedary camels show significantly higher MERS-CoV carrier rates than dromedary camels imported from Africa.

We found that some countries (such as the USA, the UK and Canada) follow an exponential epidemic growth, while others (like Italy and several other European countries) show a power law like growth. Regardless of the best fitting law, many countries can be shown to follow a common trajectory that is similar to Italy (the epicentre at the time of analysis), but with varying degrees of delay. We found that countries with younger epidemics, i.e. countries where the epidemic started more recently, tend to exhibit more exponential like behaviour, while countries that were closer behind Italy tend to follow a power law growth. We hypothesize that there is a universal growth pattern of this infection that starts off as exponential and subsequently becomes more power law like. Although it cannot be excluded that this growth pattern is a consequence of social distancing measures, an alternative explanation is that it is an intrinsic epidemic growth law, dictated by a spatially distributed community structure, where the growth in individual highly mixed communities is exponential but the longer term, local geographical spread (in the absence of global mixing) results in a power law. This is supported by computer simulations of a metapopulation model that gives rise to predictions about the growth dynamics that are consistent with correlations found in the epidemiological data. Therefore, seeing a deviation from straight exponential growth may be a natural progression of the epidemic in each country. On the practical side, this indicates that (i) even in the absence of strict social distancing interventions, exponential growth is not an accurate predictor of longer term infection spread, and (ii) a deviation from exponential spread and a reduction of estimated doubling times do not necessarily indicate successful interventions, which are instead indicated by a transition to a reduced power or by a deviation from power law behaviour.","output":"Patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic spread around the world: exponential versus power laws"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter focuses on the importance of budgets in higher education and their role in advancing civic engagement on college campuses.

Interpretation of thyroid tests during illness, however, is hampered by changes occurring in the context of non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). In order to elucidate these findings, we studied thyroid function in carefully selected cohorts of COVID-19 positive and negative patients. DESIGN: Cohort observational study. METHODS: We measured TSH, FT4, T3 within 24hours of admission in 196 patients without thyroid disease and/or confounding medications. 102 patients were SARS-CoV-2 positive; 41 admitted in the ICU, 46 in the ward and 15 outpatients. Controls consisted of 94 SARS-CoV-2 negative patients; 39 in the ICU and 55 in the ward. We designated the thyroid hormone patterns as consistent with NTIS, thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism. RESULTS: A NTIS pattern was encountered in 60% of ICU and 36% of ward patients, with similar frequencies between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative patients (46.0% vs 46.8%, p=NS). A thyrotoxicosis pattern was observed in 14.6% SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients vs. 7.7% in ICU negative (p=NS) and, overall in 8.8% of SARS-CoV-2 positive vs. 7.4% of negative patients. In these patients thyroglobulin levels were similar to those with normal thyroid function or NTIS. The hypothyroidism pattern was rare. CONCLUSIONS: NTIS pattern is common and relates to the severity of disease rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. A thyrotoxicosis pattern is less frequently observed with similar frequency between patients with and without COVID-19. It is suggested that thyroid hormone monitoring in COVID-19 should not differ from other critically ill patients.","output":"Thyroid hormone alterations in critically and non-critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The rapid development of science and technology in the 21st Century demands students (both school and university) to hold sufficient skills, including critical thinking and problem solving, to compete globally.

Outbreak response measures also have immediate and long-term gendered effects. However, gender-based analysis of outbreaks and responses is limited by lack of data and little integration of feminist analysis within global health scholarship. Recognising these barriers, this paper applies a gender matrix methodology, grounded in feminist political economy approaches, to evaluate the gendered effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and response in four case studies: China, Hong Kong, Canada, and the UK. Through a rapid scoping of documentation of the gendered effects of the outbreak, it applies the matrix framework to analyse findings, identifying common themes across the case studies: financial discrimination, crisis in care, and unequal risks and secondary effects. Results point to transnational structural conditions which put women on the front lines of the pandemic at work and at home while denying them health, economic and personal security - effects that are exacerbated where racism and other forms of discrimination intersect with gender inequities. Given that women and people living at the intersections of multiple inequities are made additionally vulnerable by pandemic responses, intersectional feminist responses should be prioritised at the beginning of any crises.","output":"More than a public health crisis: A feminist political economic analysis of COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A novel strain of Coronavirus, identified as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), outbroke in December 2019 causing the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19).

Numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, travel restrictions, screening at borders, and quarantine of travellers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of international travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease transmission and screening-related outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research to 13 November 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across international borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the original review, we also considered evidence on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). In this version we decided to focus on COVID-19 evidence only. Primary outcome categories were (i) cases avoided, (ii) cases detected, and (iii) a shift in epidemic development. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and subsequently full texts. For studies included in the analysis, one review author extracted data and appraised the study. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of data. To assess the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed the certainty of evidence with GRADE, and several review authors discussed these GRADE judgements. MAIN RESULTS: Overall, we included 62 unique studies in the analysis; 49 were modelling studies and 13 were observational studies. Studies covered a variety of settings and levels of community transmission. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of stringency of the measures (including relaxation of restrictions), or a combination of measures. Concerns with the quality of modelling studies related to potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters, and an inadequate assessment of model uncertainty. Concerns with risk of bias in observational studies related to the selection of travellers and the reference test, and unclear reporting of certain methodological aspects. Below we outline the results for each intervention category by illustrating the findings from selected outcomes. Travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel (31 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided and shift in epidemic development. We found very low-certainty evidence for a reduction in COVID-19 cases in the community (13 studies) and cases exported or imported (9 studies). Most studies reported positive effects, with effect sizes varying widely; only a few studies showed no effect. There was very low-certainty evidence that cross-border travel controls can slow the spread of COVID-19. Most studies predicted positive effects, however, results from individual studies varied from a delay of less than one day to a delay of 85 days; very few studies predicted no effect of the measure. Screening at borders (13 modelling studies; 13 observational studies) Screening measures covered symptom/exposure-based screening or test-based screening (commonly specifying polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing), or both, before departure or upon or within a few days of arrival. Studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Studies generally predicted or observed some benefit from screening at borders, however these varied widely. For symptom/exposure-based screening, one modelling study reported that global implementation of screening measures would reduce the number of cases exported per day from another country by 82% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72% to 95%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted delays in epidemic development, although there was wide variation in the results between the studies (very low-certainty evidence). Four modelling studies predicted that the proportion of cases detected would range from 1% to 53% (very low-certainty evidence). Nine observational studies observed the detected proportion to range from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence), although all but one study observed this proportion to be less than 54%. For test-based screening, one modelling study provided very low-certainty evidence for the number of cases avoided. It reported that testing travellers reduced imported or exported cases as well as secondary cases. Five observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected varied from 58% to 90% (very low-certainty evidence). Quarantine (12 modelling studies) The studies assessed cases avoided, shift in epidemic development and cases detected. All studies suggested some benefit of quarantine, however the magnitude of the effect ranged from small to large across the different outcomes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Three modelling studies predicted that the reduction in the number of cases in the community ranged from 450 to over 64,000 fewer cases (very low-certainty evidence). The variation in effect was possibly related to the duration of quarantine and compliance. Quarantine and screening at borders (7 modelling studies; 4 observational studies) The studies assessed shift in epidemic development and cases detected. Most studies predicted positive effects for the combined measures with varying magnitudes (very low- to low-certainty evidence). Four observational studies observed that the proportion of cases detected for quarantine and screening at borders ranged from 68% to 92% (low-certainty evidence). The variation may depend on how the measures were combined, including the length of the quarantine period and days when the test was conducted in quarantine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: With much of the evidence derived from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing or stopping cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of 'real-world' evidence. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures and outcomes is very low and the true effects are likely to be substantially different from those reported here. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Symptom/exposure-based screening measures at borders on their own are likely not effective; PCR testing at borders as a screening measure likely detects more cases than symptom/exposure-based screening at borders, although if performed only upon arrival this will likely also miss a meaningful proportion of cases. Quarantine, based on a sufficiently long quarantine period and high compliance is likely to largely avoid further transmission from travellers. Combining quarantine with PCR testing at borders will likely improve effectiveness. Many studies suggest that effects depend on factors, such as levels of community transmission, travel volumes and duration, other public health measures in place, and the exact specification and timing of the measure. Future research should be better reported, employ a range of designs beyond modelling and assess potential benefits and harms of the travel-related control measures from a societal perspective.","output":"International travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background Behavioral interventions produce clinically significant weight reduction, with many participants regaining weight subsequently. Most interventions focus on an individual, but dietary and physical activity behaviors occur with, or are influenced by, domestic partners. According to interdependence theory, couples who approach behavior change as a problem to be tackled together versus independently are more likely to utilize communal coping processes to promote behavior change. We utilized interdependence theory to develop a partner-assisted intervention to increase long-term weight loss. Methods Community-dwelling individuals (index participants) cohabitating with a partner with 1) overweight and at least one obesity-related comorbidity or 2) obesity are randomized to participate in a standard weight management program alone or with their partner. The weight management program involves biweekly, in-person, group sessions focusing on weight loss for six months, followed by three group sessions and nine telephone calls focusing on weight loss maintenance for twelve months. In the partner-assisted arm, partners participate in half of the group sessions and telephone calls. Couples receive training in principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for couples, including sharing thoughts and feelings and joint problem solving, to increase communal coping. The primary outcome is participant weight loss at 24 months, with caloric intake and moderate-intensity physical activity as secondary outcomes. Partner weight and caloric intake will also be analyzed. Mediation analyses will examine the role of interdependence variables and social support.

Hence, to complement molecular diagnostic tests, serology tests emerged as a vital aspect of the overall response by confirming the presence of antibodies during the early stage of the infection.

METHODS A collaborative group was established in the emergency department to conduct a prospective study of the etiology of adult CAP. The etiologic agent was determined by a combination of microscopic, culture, serologic and antigen detection methods. Pneumococcal susceptibility testing was performed to determine the extent of penicillin resistance. RESULTS A total of 100 consecutive cases of mild to moderate adult CAP prior to the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic were enrolled. The etiologic agent was determined in 72% of cases. The 5 most common causative pathogens were S. pneumoniae (26%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (20%), Chlamydia pneumoniae (13%), Haemophilus influenzae (9%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5%). Atypical pathogens accounted for 40% of CAP. Bacteremic pneumonia was diagnosed in 6.2% of cases. Co-infections with 2 or more pathogens were found in 16% of the cases. Among the 20 isolates of S. pneumoniae, 85% (17/20) were susceptible to penicillin, 3 (15%) were intermediate, and none were resistant to penicillin.

Choppin, 1985, J. Cell Biol. 101:1578-1590) described the lipid composition of a series of mouse fibroblast cell lines which vary in susceptibility to the fusogenic effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Two alterations in lipid content were found to be directly correlated with resistance to PEG-induced cell fusion: increases in fatty acyl chain saturation, and the elevation of neutral glycerides, including an unusual ether-linked compound. In this study, we have probed the association between lipid composition and cell fusion through the use of fatty acid supplements to the cellular growth medium, and show that the fusibility of cells can be controlled by altering their acyl chain composition. The parental Clone 1D cells contain moderately unsaturated fatty acids with a ratio of saturates to polyunsaturates (S/P) approximately 1 and fuse virtually to completion following a standard PEG treatment. By contrast, the lipids of a highly fusion-resistant mutant cell line, F40, are highly saturated (S/P approximately 4). When the S/P ratio of Clone 1D cells was increased to approximate that normally found in F40 cells by growth in the presence of high concentrations of saturated fatty acids, they became highly resistant to PEG. Reduction of the S/P ratio of F40 cells by growth in cis-polyunsaturated fatty acids rendered them susceptible to fusion. Cell lines F8, F16, etc., which are normally intermediate between Clone 1D and F40 in both lipid composition and fusion response, can be altered in either direction (towards either increased or decreased susceptibility to fusion) by the addition of appropriate fatty acids to the growth medium. Although trans-unsaturated fatty acids have phase-transition temperatures roughly similar to saturated compounds, and might therefore be expected to affect membrane fluidity in a similar manner, trans-unsaturated fatty acids exerted the same effect as cis-unsaturates on the control of PEG-induced cell fusion. This observation suggests that the control of cell fusion by alteration of fatty acid content is not due to changes in membrane fluidity, and thus that the fatty acids are involved in some other way in the modulation of cell fusion.","output":"Biochemical studies on cell fusion.

The remaining populations are struggling with increased rate of infection due to beta and delta variants. Although this uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic did not leave even the immunized group because of immune escaping capacity of those new variants. Methods A total of 4718 nasopharygeal samples were collected from 1st March until 15th April, 2021, of which, 834 (18%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Randomly generated 135 positive cases were selected for telephone interview and 108 were available and provided consent. The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and disease severity among both immunized and unimmunized group was measured. A total of 63 spike protein sequence and 14 whole genome sequences were performed from both groups and phylogenetic reconstruction and mutation analysis were compared. Results A total of 40 respondents (37%, N=108) received single-dose and 2 (2%) received both doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine which significantly reduce dry cough, loss of appetite and difficulties in breathing compared to none.

DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: England and India. PARTICIPANTS: Individual data were obtained from the fourth round of the District Level Household Survey and Annual Health Survey in India, and aggregate data were obtained from the Health Survey for England and the Global Burden of Disease, Risk Factors and Injuries Studies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the modelled age-specific mortality in each country due to each COVID-19 mortality risk factor (diabetes, hypertension, obesity and respiratory illness, among others). The change in overall mortality and in the share of deaths under age 60 from the combination of risk factors was estimated in each country. RESULTS: Relative to England, Indians have higher rates of diabetes (10.6% vs 8.5%) and chronic respiratory disease (4.8% vs 2.5%), and lower rates of obesity (4.4% vs 27.9%), chronic heart disease (4.4% vs 5.9%) and cancer (0.3% vs 2.8%). Population COVID-19 mortality in India, relative to England, is most increased by uncontrolled diabetes (+5.67%) and chronic respiratory disease (+1.88%), and most reduced by obesity (-5.47%), cancer (-3.65%) and chronic heart disease (-1.20%). Comorbidities were associated with a 6.26% lower risk of mortality in India compared with England. Demographics and population health explain a third of the difference in share of deaths under age 60 between the two countries. CONCLUSIONS: Known COVID-19 health risk factors are not expected to have a large effect on mortality or its age distribution in India relative to England. The high share of COVID-19 deaths from people under age 60 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unexplained.

METHODS: Overall, 152 patients were enrolled in this study protocol. These were divided into 106 training/validation and 46 test datasets (untouched during training), respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the segmented lungs and infectious lesions separately from chest CT images. Clinical data, including patients history and demographics, laboratory tests and radiological scores were also collected. Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS: For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value < 0.01), consciousness level (q-value < 0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value < 0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC = 0.73, q-value < 0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC = 0.72, q-value = 0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC = 0.70) and HGLZE (AUC = 0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC = 0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC = 0.73) had the highest performance. In multivariate analysis, combining lung, lesion and clinical features was determined to provide the most accurate prognostic model (AUC = 0.95  0.029 (95%CI: 0.95C0.96), accuracy = 0.88  0.046 (95% CI: 0.88C0.89), sensitivity = 0.88  0.066 (95% CI = 0.87C0.9) and specificity = 0.89  0.07 (95% CI = 0.87C0.9)).

While still abroad, immigrants, refugees, and others who apply for admission to live permanently in the United States must undergo a medical examination. This examination identifies persons with class A or B conditions. Applicants with class A conditions are inadmissible. Infectious conditions that cause an applicant to be inadmissible include infectious tuberculosis (TB) disease (class A TB), infectious syphilis, gonorrhea, and infectious Hansens disease. Applicants with class B conditions are admissible but might require treatment or follow-up. Class B TB includes persons who completed successful treatment overseas for TB disease (class B0), those with signs or symptoms suggestive of TB but whose overseas laboratory tests and clinical examinations ruled out current infectious TB disease (class B1), those with a diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI) (class B2), and the close contacts of persons known to have TB disease (class B3). Voluntary public health interventions might also be offered during the overseas examination. After arriving in the United States, a follow-up TB examination is recommended for persons with class B TB. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes health information that was reported to CDCs Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system for refugees, immigrants, and eligible others who arrived in the United States during 2014C2019. Eligible others are persons who although not classified as refugees (e.g., certain parolees, special immigrant visa holders, and follow-to-join asylees) are eligible for the same services and benefits as refugees. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The EDN system has both surveillance and programmatic components. The surveillance component is a centralized database that collects 1) health-related data from the overseas medical examination for immigrants with class A or B conditions and for all refugees and eligible others and 2) TB-related data from the postarrival TB examination. The programmatic component is a reporting system that sends arrival notifications to state and local health agencies in the jurisdiction where newly arriving persons have reported intending to live and provides state and local health agencies and other authorized users with medical data from overseas examinations. RESULTS: During 2014C2019, approximately 3.5 million persons moved to the United States from abroad, including 3.2 million immigrants, 313,890 refugees, and 95,993 eligible others. Among these, the overseas examination identified 139,683 persons (3,903 per 100,000 persons examined) with class B TB, 54 with primary or secondary syphilis (30 per 100,000 persons tested), 761 with latent syphilis (415 per 100,000 persons tested), and, after laboratory testing for gonorrhea was added in 2016, a total of 131 with gonorrhea (374 per 100,000 persons tested). Refugees were offered additional, voluntary interventions, including vaccinations and presumptive treatment for parasites. By 2019, first- and second-dose coverage with measles-containing vaccine were 96% and 80%, respectively. In refugee populations for whom presumptive treatment is recommended, up to 96% of refugees, depending on the specific regimen, were offered and accepted treatment. For the 139,683 persons identified overseas with class B TB, EDN sent arrival notifications and overseas medical data to the appropriate state or local health agency to facilitate postarrival TB examinations. Among 101,119 persons identified overseas as having class B0 TB (6,586) or class B1 TB (94,533), a total of 67,432 (67%) had a complete postarrival examination reported to EDN. Among 35,814 children aged 2C14 years identified overseas with class B2 TB, 20,758 (58%) had a complete postarrival examination reported to EDN. (Adults are not routinely tested for immune reactivity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during the overseas medical examination.) Among those with a complete postarrival examination reported to EDN, the number with a diagnosis of culture-positive TB disease within the first year of arrival was 464 (688 cases per 100,000 persons examined) for those with class B0 or B1 TB and was 11 (53 cases per 100,000 persons examined) for children with class B2 TB. INTERPRETATION: During 2014C2019, the overseas medical examination system prevented importation of 6,586 cases of infectious TB, 815 cases of syphilis, and 131 cases of gonorrhea. When the examination is used to offer public health interventions, most refugees (up to 96%) accept the intervention. Postarrival follow-up examinations, which were completed for 88,190 persons and identified 475 cases of culture-positive TB, represent an important opportunity to further limit spread of TB disease in the United States by identifying and providing, if needed, preventive care for those with LTBI or treatment for those with disease. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Federal, state, and local health departments and agencies should continue to use EDN data to monitor, evaluate, and improve health-related programs and policies aimed at U.S.-bound or recently arrived immigrants, refugees, and eligible others. Additional public health interventions that could be offered during the overseas medical examination should be considered (e.g., treatment for LTBI). Finally, for persons with class B TB, measures should be taken to identify and remove barriers to completing postarrival examinations to reduce risk for TB disease and community transmission, along with measures to encourage reporting of completed examinations for better data-driven decision-making.","output":"Disease Surveillance Among U.S.-Bound Immigrants and Refugees  Electronic Disease Notification System, United States, 2014C2019"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study uses image analysis techniques for comparative analysis of the lung HRCT features and RT-PCR of 325 suspected patients to COVID-19 pneumonia.

MicroMAX will have a 1a? m  1a? m beam focus and a flux up to 1015a? photonsa? s-1 with main applications in serial crystallography, room-temperature structure determinations and time-resolved experiments.","output":"BioMAX - the first macromolecular crystallography beamline at MAX IV Laboratory"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health and global health practitioners need to develop global health diplomacy (GHD) skills to efficiently work within complex global health scenarios, such as the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Problem-based learning was used as a framework to create a scenario-based activity designed to develop GHD-related skills. The application and effectiveness of this scenario-based activity to develop GHD-related skills were assessed. A mixed-methods approach involving a self-administered survey and one focus group discussion was used. The survey collected baseline participant characteristics as well as understanding and improvements in GHD-related skills using a 5-point Likert scale. The focus group was audio-recorded and thematically analyzed using both inductive and deductive codes. Data integration was achieved by connecting and weaving. Method and investigator triangulation techniques were used. Participants self-reported significantly better postscenario-based activity responses when asked about their understanding of diplomacy, negotiation, communication, and how to address public health emergencies (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Most participants either agreed or strongly agreed that their GHD-related skills improved with participation in the scenario-based activity (diplomacy = 55.6%; negotiation = 66.5%; communication = 72.2%; addressing public health emergencies = 72.1%). Overall, qualitative data were consistent with results obtained using quantitative methods. The scenario-based activity was effective for improving the self-reported understanding of GHD-related skills. The scenario-based activity was also effective for developing the selected GHD-related skills (as self-reported). This scenario-based activity is likely to reduce cognitive load and avoid participant overload, thereby facilitating learning.

The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnaire-detected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P < .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women without asthma. The severity of cold symptoms was also increased in women with asthma (total cold score median, 8; interquartile range [5, 10] in women with asthma vs 6 [5, 8] in control subjects; P = .031). Among women with asthma, having a laboratory-confirmed viral infection was associated with poorer maternal health, with 60% of infections associated with uncontrolled asthma and a higher likelihood of preeclampsia. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women with asthma have more common colds during pregnancy than pregnant women without asthma. Colds during pregnancy were associated with adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes.

We explore the role of vaccines in control and eradication of a novel emerging pathogen. METHODS : We hypothetically simulate emergence of a novel wild poliovirus (nWPV) in 2020 assuming an immunologically na?ve population. Assuming different nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), we explore the impacts of vaccines resembling serotype-specific oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV), novel OPV (nOPV), or inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV). RESULTS : Vaccines most effectively change the trajectory of an emerging disease when disseminated early, rapidly, and widely in the background of ongoing strict NPIs, unless the NPIs successfully eradicate the emerging pathogen before it establishes endemic transmission. Without strict NPIs, vaccines primarily reduce the burden of disease in the remaining susceptible individuals and in new birth cohorts. Live virus vaccines that effectively compete with the nWPVs can reduce disease burdens more than other vaccines. When relaxation of existing NPIs occurs at the time of vaccine introduction, nWPV transmission can counterintuitively increase in the short term. CONCLUSIONS : Vaccines can increase the probability of disease eradication in the context of strict NPIs. However, successful eradication will depend on specific immunization strategies used and a global commitment to eradication.","output":"Hypothetical emergence of poliovirus in 2020: Part 2.

These gaps slowed recognition of airborne transmission of the disease, contributed to muddled public health policies and impeded clear messaging on how best to slow transmission of COVID-19. In particular, current recommendations have been based on four tenets: (i) respiratory disease transmission routes can be viewed mostly in a binary manner of droplets versus aerosols; (ii) this dichotomy depends on droplet size alone; (iii) the cut-off size between these routes of transmission is 5 m; and (iv) there is a dichotomy in the distance at which transmission by each route is relevant. Yet, a relationship between these assertions is not supported by current scientific knowledge. Here, we revisit the historical foundation of these notions, and how they became entangled from the 1800s to today, with a complex interplay among various fields of science and medicine. This journey into the past highlights potential solutions for better collaboration and integration of scientific results into practice for building a more resilient society with more sound, far-sighted and effective public health policies.","output":"How did we get here: what are droplets and aerosols and how far do they go?

Therefore, we aimed to assess the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) new variants of concern in the communities and investigate vaccine breakthrough cases on our laboratory (Ayass Bioscience LLC) confirmed detection of COVID-19 variants in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW), Texas. MethodsEpidemiologic study has been performed at our laboratory. We studied the viral whole-genome sequence and genotyping analysis on 166 symptomatic cases of COVID-19 which were randomly selected from nasal swab positive cases assessed from June 1st to August 30th, 2021, by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cycle threshold (CT) values. COVID-19 variants were identified to be dominated by B.1.617.2 (89.2%) and followed by AY.3 (1.8%), B.1.1.7 (4.8%), a combination of B.1.526.1 and B.1.617.2 (3%), B.1.621 (0.6%), and P.2 (0.6%). ResultThe CT values showed significant difference among the three age groups: <30 years, 31-60 years, and >60 years by one-way ANOVA (N1: F (2, 118) =4.96, p=0.009; N2: F (2, 118) =4.95, p=0.009). No significant difference was observed by symptom, status of immunization, or vaccine manufacturer. A two-way ANOVA was performed to examine the effect of gender and variant group (Delta and other variants) on the CT values. The analyses revealed a statistically significant interaction between the effect of gender and variant group (N1, F (1.117) = 3.906, p = 0.05; N2, F (1, 117) = 7.402, p = 0.008). ConclusionOur study shows that Delta, the dominant variant of COVID-19, is spreading in the communities, and vaccine breakthrough cases occurred in the majority of Delta variant (91%) followed by AY.3 (5%), B.1.1.7 (2%) and 2% of the double variant of B.1.526.1 and B.1.617.2. The incidence of the breakthrough cases was not linked to a specific manufacturer. The CT value is likely to associate with age.

OBJECTIVE: Standardizing fibrinolytic administration among interventional radiology (IR) physicians to improve patient outcomes in pediatric parapneumonic effusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduced a hospital-wide clinical pathway for parapneumonic effusion (1C2 mg tissue plasminogen activator [tPA] twice daily based on pleural US grade); we then collected prospective data for IR treatment May 2017 through February 2020. These data included demographics, co-morbidities, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission, pleural US grade, culture results, daily tPA dose average, twice-daily dose days, skipped dose days, pleural therapy days, need for chest CT/a second IR procedure/surgical drainage, and length of stay. We compared the prospective data to historical controls with IR treatment from January 2013 to April 2017. RESULTS: Sixty-three children and young adults were treated after clinical pathway implementation. IR referrals increased (P = 0.02) and included higher co-morbidities (P = 0.005) and more PICU patients (P = 0.05). Mean doses per day increased from 1.5 to 1.9 (P < 0.001), twice-daily dose days increased from 38% to 79% (P < 0.001) and median pleural therapy days decreased from 3.5 days to 2.5 days (P = 0.001). No IR patients needed surgical intervention. No statistical differences were observed for gender/age/weight, US grade, need for a second IR procedure or length of stay. US grade correlated with greater positive cultures, need for chest CT/second IR procedure, and pleural therapy days. CONCLUSION: Interventional radiology physician standardization improved on a clinical pathway for fibrinolysis of parapneumonic effusion.

The 2019C20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was named as Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by World Health Organization (WHO). It is well known that radiation can cause mutations in bacteria and viruses. Therefore, characterization of the radiation resistance and interaction properties of viruses provides the opportunity in terms of risk assessment and future aspects. In this study, 3 types of viruses (SARS-CoV-CAS Number 587886-51-9, Influenza-CAS Number 141368-69-6 and SARS-CoV-2 GlycoProtein 6VSB.) were modeled with the Monte Carlo simulation method (MCNPX version 2.6.0). The vital radiation attenuation properties such as linear attenuation coefficients, energy absorption buildup factors (EABF), exposure buildup factors (EBF), relative dose distributions (RDD) were examined using advanced simulation methods. Moreover, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is modelled from the structures in the Protein Data Bank. As a result of the study, we could say that the most radiation resistance was observed in SARS-CoV when compared with Influenza and Covid-19. It could be one of the reasons for SARS-CoVs resistance to mutation from its outbreak time. On the other hand, Covid-19 is more resistant to radiation than Influenza. Therefore it could be expected that Covid-19 would have the similar behaviors against ionizing radiation as Influenza has.","output":"Radiation resistance of novel SARS-CoV-2: A Monte Carlo investigation on characterization and determination of gamma-ray attenuation properties"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Flour, typically derived from wheat, rye, corn and rice is a pantry staple, providing structure to bread and baked goods.

Ingredient lists, Nutrition Information Panel, claims, and country of origin were collected. The median and range were calculated for energy, protein, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugars, dietary fibre and sodium. Overall, 130 products were collected, including 26 plain flour, 12 self-raising, 17 plain wholemeal, 4 wholemeal self-raising, 20 bread-making mixes (4 were whole grain), 20 other refined grain (including corn and rice flour), 17 gluten-free, 3 legume, 4 fruit/vegetable, 4 coconut and 3 other non-grain (e.g., hemp seed, cricket flour) products. Plain wheat flour dominated the category, while whole grain (wholemeal) made up 19% of products, yet they contained significantly more dietary fibre (p < 0.001) and protein (p < 0.001). Self-raising flours were significantly higher in sodium (p < 0.001) and gluten-free products were lower in protein and dietary fibre, making legume, buckwheat and quinoa flour a better choice.

These biomarkers are found in lower airway secretions that need to be liquefied prior to analysis. Traditional methods for sample liquefaction rely on reducing disulfide bonds, which may damage the structure of the biomarkers and hamper their immunodetection. Here, we propose an alternative enzymatic method that uses O2 bubbles generated by endogenous catalase enzymes in order to liquefy respiratory samples. The proposed method is more efficient for liquefying medium- and high-viscosity samples and does not fragment the antibodies. This prevents damage to antigen recognition domains and recognition sites for secondary antibodies that can decrease the signal of immunodetection techniques. The suitability of the enzymatic method for detecting antibodies in respiratory samples is demonstrated by detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM to viral N-protein with gold standard ELISA in bronchial aspirate specimens from a multicenter cohort of 44 COVID-19 patients. The enzymatic detection sharply increases the sensitivity toward IgG and IgM detection compared to the traditional approach based on liquefying samples with dithiothreitol. This improved performance could reveal new mechanisms of the early local immune response against respiratory infections that may have gone unnoticed with current sample treatment methods.","output":"Immunodetection of Lung IgG and IgM Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 via Enzymatic Liquefaction of Respiratory Samples from COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevance In order to prevent the spread of infection caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in the spring of 2020, a number of hospitals were re-profiled in St Petersburg toreceive patients with pulmonological pathology, including infectious etiology In the period from March 30 to April 30, 2194 patients were admitted to St Petersburg City Hospital 2, including 1211 (57%) with pneumonia of various etiologies, 508 (24%) patients with COVID-19 and 475 (22%) patients with other acute upper respiratory tract infections The aim of this study was to evaluate the structure of the results of prescribed studies to optimize the laboratory service and assess the laboratory and examined patients profiles Results structure assessment of a general blood tests showed the predominance of relative lymphocytopenia- in 51 9%;hemodilution in 57 9%;the average platelet volume was below the reference limits of 59 6% Leukocytosis was observed in 46 5% and neutrophilia in 53 7% Absolute monocytosiswas found in 45% Tests analysis of the biochemical analytes concentrations showed elevated levels of: C-reactive protein - in 74 8%;glucose - in 73 9%;troponin I - in 75 6%;lactate dehydrogenase - in 63 4%;procalcitonin -in 55%;gamma-glutamyltranspeptidases - in 52% Conclusion To optimize the laboratory service of the hospital, the quantity of goods was increased by no more than 10% in government contracts concluded with suppliers of laboratory reagents, which made it possible to purchase additional supplies to ensure uninterrupted laboratory examination of patients in the infectious hospital in the conditions of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19 ܧѧݧߧ  ֧ݧ ڧݧѧܧڧܧ ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ, ӧ٧ӧѧߧߧ ӧڧ SARS-CoV-2,  ѧߧܧ-֧֧ҧԧ ӧ֧ߧ 2020  ڧ٧ݧ ֧֧ڧݧڧӧѧߧڧ է ѧڧߧѧ էݧ ڧקާ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ݧާߧݧԧڧ֧ܧ ѧݧԧڧ֧,   ڧݧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧ ڧݧԧڧ  ӧ٧  ڧ ѧߧӧڧ ѧܧѧݧߧ ڧާڧ٧ѧڧ ݧѧҧѧߧԧ ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ  ݧӧڧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧԧ ѧڧߧѧ  ѧߧէ֧ާڧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ COVID-19 ֧ݧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ٧ڧ ܧ ֧٧ݧѧ ߧѧ٧ߧѧѧ֧ާ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ էݧ ڧާڧ٧ѧڧ ݧѧҧѧߧ ݧاҧ  ֧ߧܧ ݧѧҧѧߧԧ ڧݧ ҧݧ֧է֧ާԧ ܧߧڧߧԧ֧ߧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ֧٧ݧѧ ֧ߧܧ ܧ ֧٧ݧѧ ҧ֧ԧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ ܧӧ ܧѧ٧ѧݧ ֧ҧݧѧէѧߧڧ ߧڧ֧ݧߧ ݧڧާڧ֧ߧڧ -  51,9% ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ;ԧ֧ާէڧݧڧ  57,9% ѧߧѧݧڧ٧;֧էߧڧ ҧ֧ ާҧڧ ҧ ߧڧا ֧֧֧ߧߧ ֧է֧ݧ  59,6% ֧٧ݧѧ  ѧڧ֧ߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧԧ ѧڧߧѧ ѧҧݧէѧݧ ݧ֧ۧܧڧ  46,5%  ߧ֧ۧڧݧ֧  53,7% ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ҧݧߧ ާߧڧ ާ֧֧  45% ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ߧѧݧڧ ֧٧ݧѧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ܧߧ֧ߧѧڧ ҧڧڧާڧ֧ܧڧ ѧߧѧݧڧ ܧѧ٧ѧ ӧ֧ߧߧ ӧߧ: -֧ѧܧڧӧߧԧ ҧ֧ݧܧ -  74,8%;ԧݧܧ٧ -  73,9%;ߧڧߧ I -  75,6%;ݧѧܧѧէ֧ԧڧէԧ֧ߧѧ٧ -  63,4%;ܧѧݧڧߧڧߧ -  55%;ԧ٧ާާ-ԧݧѧާڧݧѧߧ֧ڧէѧ٧ -  52%  ҧ֧ԧ ܧݧڧ֧ӧ ӧ֧է֧ߧߧ ڧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ӧߧ ӧ֧ӧ֧ԧ ܧѧ٧ѧ֧ݧ ӧէ ӧݧ֧ߧ ӧ֧ݧڧ֧ߧߧѧ ֧ҧߧ ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧڧ էѧ٧է֧ݧ֧ߧڧ ҧݧߧڧ  ֧է֧ݧ֧ߧߧ ݧѧҧѧߧ ֧ѧ ݧ ڧާڧ٧ѧڧ ݧѧҧѧߧ ݧاҧ ѧڧߧѧ ӧ֧ݧڧ֧ߧ ܧݧڧ֧ӧ ѧէߧ ާѧ֧ڧѧݧ, ߧ ҧݧ֧ ֧ ߧ 10%,  ٧ѧܧݧ֧ߧߧ  ѧӧڧܧѧާ ݧѧҧѧߧ ֧ѧԧ֧ߧ ԧէѧӧ֧ߧߧ ܧߧѧܧѧ,  ٧ӧݧڧݧ ڧҧ֧ էݧߧڧ֧ݧߧ ܧݧڧ֧ӧ ѧէߧ ާѧ֧ڧѧݧ էݧ ҧ֧֧֧ߧڧ ҧ֧֧֧ҧۧߧԧ ݧѧҧѧߧԧ ҧݧ֧էӧѧߧڧ ѧڧ֧ߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧߧߧԧ ѧڧߧѧ  ݧӧڧ ߧӧ ܧߧѧӧڧߧ ڧߧ֧ܧڧ COVID-19","output":"Patients laboratory testing optimization in infectious hospital under the pandemia of the new coronavirus infection COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is one of the major etiologies responsible for the acute, highly contagious disease in the digestive tract of pigs, especially neonatal piglets.

Nucleoside analogues, such as Remdesivir and Favipiravir, can serve as the first-line broad-spectrum antiviral drugs by targeting the viral polymerases. However, the underlying mechanisms for the antiviral efficacies of these drugs are far from well understood. Here we reveal that Favipiravir, as a pyrazine derivative, could be incorporated into the viral RNA products by mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides. This drug thus inhibits viral replication mainly by inducing mutations in progeny RNAs, different from Remdesivir or other RNA-terminating nucleoside analogues that impair the elongation of RNA products. We further determined the cryo-EM structure of Favipiravir bound to the replicating polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 in the pre-catalytic state. This structure provides a missing snapshot for visualizing the catalysis dynamics of coronavirus polymerase, and reveals an unexpected base-pairing pattern between Favipiravir and pyrimidine residues which may explain its capacity for mimicking both adenine and guanine nucleotides.

Examining the relationship between fasting status, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with circulating BCAA levels may provide insights into their metabolic handling. METHODS We conducted cross-sectional analyses among 25,740 Women's Health Study participants (mean age 55 years). RESULTS In multivariable linear regression models, fasting was associated with lower plasma BCAAs vs. non-fasting in women without metabolic syndrome or T2D (% mean difference=-5.1%; 95% CI=-5.8, -4.5) and among women with metabolic syndrome only (-3.7%; -4.9, -2.6), pinteraction=0.002. However, there was no difference in BCAAs by fasting status among women with T2D (0.4%; -3.7, 4.7). CONCLUSIONS We observed higher BCAAs with worsening metabolic health status. Fasting is modestly associated with lower plasma BCAAs, except among women with T2D.

Viral lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) frequently causes adult hospitalization and is linked to antibiotic overuse. European studies suggest that the serum procalcitonin (PCT) level may be used to guide antibiotic therapy. We conducted a trial assessing the feasibility of using PCT algorithms with viral testing to guide antibiotic use in a US hospital. Methods. Three hundred patients hospitalized with nonpneumonic LRTI during October 2013CApril 2014 were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to receive standard care or PCT-guided care and viral PCR testing. The primary outcome was antibiotic exposure, and safety was assessed at 1 and 3 months. Results. Among the 151 patients in the intervention group, viruses were identified in 42% (63), and 83% (126) had PCT values of <0.25 g/mL. There were no significant differences in antibiotic use or adverse events between intervention patients and those in the nonintervention group. Subgroup analyses revealed fewer subjects with positive results of viral testing and low PCT values who were discharged receiving antibiotics (20% vs 45%; P = .002) and shorter antibiotic durations among algorithm-adherent intervention patients versus nonintervention patients (2.0 vs 4.0 days; P = .004).

Objective: To examine trends in positivity-ratios, tests and cases by state from mid-April-mid-July. Further, to examine whether positivity-ratio patters are associated with state political-affiliations. Methods: State-level publicly available data on Covid19 is used. Seven-day moving averages (MA7) of positivity-ratio are computed for April 21-July 15. States are assigned to four groups based on patterns of change in positivity-ratio: higher at end of study period than beginning (Group 1), initial decline but subsequent increase starting Memorial Day weekend (Group 2), initial decrease but an upturn in last 14 days (Group 3), and consistent downward trend (Group 4). Political-affiliation is categorized as <Republican-leaning> if President Trump won the state and the governor is Republican. Additionally, a proxy measure is used to indicate intensity of Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests in the state. Associations are tested using chi-square analysis. Results: Fourteen states are in Group 1, fifteen states in Group 2, fifteen states in Group 3, and six states and DC in Group 4. 78.57% of Group 1, 33.33% of Group 2, 40% of group 3, and none in Group 4 were Republican-leaning.

Phosphoproteomic experiments show that TRAF6 and its phosphorylation contribute to the remodeling of LPS- and autophagyinduced signaling networks, revealing an intricate link between inflammatory and metabolic processes that are frequently dysregulated in cancer. ABSTRACT: The ubiquitin E3 ligase TNF Receptor Associated Factor 6 (TRAF6) participates in a large number of different biological processes including innate immunity, differentiation and cell survival, raising the need to specify and shape the signaling output. Here, we identify a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent increase in TRAF6 association with the kinase IKK (inhibitor of NF-B kinase subunit ) and IKK-mediated TRAF6 phosphorylation at five residues. The reconstitution of TRAF6-deficient cells, with TRAF6 mutants representing phosphorylation-defective or phospho-mimetic TRAF6 variants, showed that the phospho-mimetic TRAF6 variant was largely protected from basal ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation, and also from autophagy-mediated decay in autolysosomes induced by metabolic perturbation. In addition, phosphorylation of TRAF6 and its E3 ligase function differentially shape basal and LPS-triggered signaling networks, as revealed by phosphoproteome analysis. Changes in LPS-triggered phosphorylation networks of cells that had experienced autophagy are partially dependent on TRAF6 and its phosphorylation status, suggesting an involvement of this E3 ligase in the interplay between metabolic and inflammatory circuits.","output":"TRAF6 Phosphorylation Prevents Its Autophagic Degradation and Re-Shapes LPS-Triggered Signaling Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, various symptoms that affect negatively the nutritional status have been reported It is essential to identify the clinical predictors, including nutritional profile and prognostic of the disease to enable the correct treatment The aim of this study is to investigate the nutritional profile and digestive symptoms (GIT) of COVID-19 patients in a private hospital in Brazil Methods: We enrolled adult patients (18 years) who were hospitalized with diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR [SRM1] for SARS-CoV-2 fom March to April, 2020 We analyzed the chronic comorbidities, GIT symptoms, nutritional status and use of probiotic and hypercaloric and/or hyperproteic nutritional supplementation of all patients Nutritional screening was accessed by Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 tool and the diagnosis of malnutrition by the global scale proposed by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition Results: Weincluded 110 patients with a mean age of 55 16 years The sample was composed of 66 (60%) men The most reported chronic conditions were hypertension (30%) and diabetes mellitus (21%) Within 24 hours after admission 6 4% patients were screened under nutritional risk of which only one was diagnosed as severe malnutrition At the last nutritional evaluation, the number of patients under nutritional risk increased to 14 6%, with one diagnosed as severe malnutrition and one as moderate We found that 60 9% of patients reported lack of appetite, 13 7% diarrhea and 4 6% vomit As for the nutritional supplementation and use of probiotic, 24 6% and 7 3% of the patients, respectively, tried this strategy Conclusion: We found that digestive symptoms and poor nutritional status are common in patients with COVID-19 Thereby, an early and accurate evaluation of nutritional status and the GIT symptoms in COVID-19 patients can be an important step to the correct clinical management Disclosure of Interest: None declared","output":"Nutritional profile and digestive symptoms of Covid-19 patients in a private hospital in Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly in the global population since its emergence in humans in late 2019. Replication of SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by transcription and replication of genomic length RNA and shorter subgenomic RNAs to produce virus proteins and ultimately progeny virions. Here we explore the pattern of both genome-length and subgenomic RNAs and positive and negative strand SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs using sensitive probe based PCR assays as well as Ampliseq panels designed to target subgenomic RNAs. Using these assays, we measured the ratios of genomic to subgenomic RNAs as well as the ratios of positive to negative strand RNAs in SARS-CoV-2 positive nasopharyngeal swab samples. We found that while subgenomic RNAs and negative strand RNA can be readily detected in swab samples taken up to 19 and 17 days post symptom onset respectively, and therefore their detection alone is not likely an indicator of active SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, the ratios of genomic-length to subgenomic RNA and also of positive to negative strand RNA were elevated in some swabs, particularly those collected around the onset of clinical symptoms or in an individual with decreasing PCR Cts in successive swab samples. We tentatively conclude that it may be possible to refine such molecular assays to help determine if active replication of virus is occurring and progeny virions likely present in a SARS-CoV-2 positive individual.

They defecate on each other, leading to the exchange of pathogenic and parasitic microorganisms, forcing interactions among species that should never happen. This is the ideal scenario for causing zoonoses and outbreaks of EIDs. We must start by stopping the illegal collection and sale of wild animals in markets.

Pulmonary function testing reveals an obstructive ventilatory defect that is typically not reversed by inhaled bronchodilator. Transbronchial biopsies are insufficiently sensitive to achieve diagnosis, and in most cases, clinical, physiological, and radiological data obviate the need for the increased risk associated with open lung biopsy. This diagnosis has been documented in a variety of exposures, including fumes from flavoring plants, smoke from burn pits, and environmental sulfur gas. Among lung transplant recipients, \\"bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome,\\" a disorder with clinical and histopathological similarity to OB, represents the leading cause of long-term allograft dysfunction and mortality. After hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chronic graft versus host disease of the lung manifests most frequently with similar clinical and pathological features. In all circumstances, immunologic and nonimmunologic mechanisms are thought to lead to airway epithelial dysfunction, which results in progressive airflow obstruction and debility. Augmentation of immunosuppression is occasionally effective in slowing or reversing the progression of disease though a significant number of patients will be nonresponders.

Protein modification by ISG15 (ISGylation) is known to inhibit the replication of many viruses. However, studies on the viral targets and viral strategies to regulate ISGylation-mediated antiviral responses are limited. In this study, we show that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication is inhibited by ISGylation, but the virus has evolved multiple countermeasures. HCMV-induced ISG15 expression was mitigated by IE1, a viral inhibitor of interferon signaling, however, ISGylation was still strongly upregulated during virus infection. RNA interference of UBE1L (E1), UbcH8 (E2), Herc5 (E3), and UBP43 (ISG15 protease) revealed that ISGylation inhibits HCMV growth by downregulating viral gene expression and virion release in a manner that is more prominent at low multiplicity of infection. A viral regulator pUL26 was found to interact with ISG15, UBE1L, and Herc5, and be ISGylated. ISGylation of pUL26 regulated its stability and inhibited its activities to suppress NF-B signaling and complement the growth of UL26-null mutant virus. Moreover, pUL26 reciprocally suppressed virus-induced ISGylation independent of its own ISGylation. Consistently, ISGylation was more pronounced in infections with the UL26-deleted mutant virus, whose growth was more sensitive to IFN treatment than that of the wild-type virus. Therefore, pUL26 is a viral ISG15 target that also counteracts ISGylation. Our results demonstrate that ISGylation inhibits HCMV growth at multiple steps and that HCMV has evolved countermeasures to suppress ISG15 transcription and protein ISGylation, highlighting the importance of the interplay between virus and ISGylation in productive viral infection.","output":"Consecutive Inhibition of ISG15 Expression and ISGylation by Cytomegalovirus Regulators"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Interferons are a major part of the anti-viral innate defense system. Successful pathogens, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), need to overcome these defenses to establish an infection. Early induction of interferons (IFNs) protects against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In line with this, SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by IFNs in vitro, and IFN-based therapies against COVID-19 are investigated in clinical trials. However, SARS-CoV-2 continues to adapt to the human population resulting in the emergence of variants characterized by increased transmission fitness and/or decreased sensitivity to preventive or therapeutic measures. It has been suggested that the efficient spread of these so-called \\"Variants of Concern\\" (VOCs) may also involve reduced sensitivity to IFNs. Here, we examined whether the four current VOCs (Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta) differ in replication efficiency or IFN sensitivity from an early isolate of SARS-CoV-2. All viruses replicated in a human lung cell line and in iPSC-derived alveolar type II cells (iAT2). The Delta variant showed accelerated replication kinetics and higher infectious virus production compared to the early 2020 isolate. Replication of all SARS-CoV-2 VOCs was reduced in the presence of exogenous type I, II and III IFNs. On average, the Alpha variant was the least susceptible to IFNs and the Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants show increased resistance against type III IFN. Although the Delta variant has outcompeted all other variants in humans it remained as sensitive to IFNs as an early 2020 SARS-CoV-2 isolate. This suggests that increased replication fitness rather than IFN resistance may be a reason for its dominance. Our results may help to understand changes in innate immune susceptibility of VOCs, and inform clinical trials exploring IFN-based COVID-19 therapies.","output":"The Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 maintains high sensitivity to interferons in human lung cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic underscored our healthcare system's unpreparedness to manage an unprecedented pandemic.

Infection of alveolar pneumocytes by SARS-CoV-2 requires virus binding to the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) monocarboxypeptidase. ACE2, present on the surface of many cell types, is known to be a regulator of blood pressure homeostasis through its ability to catalyze the proteolysis of Angiotensin II (Ang II) into Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)]. We therefore hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 could trigger variations of ACE2 expression and Ang II plasma concentration in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. We report here, that circulating blood cells from COVID-19 patients express less ACE2 mRNA than cells from healthy volunteers. At the level of circulating cells, this ACE2 gene dysregulation mainly affects the monocytes, which also show a lower expression of membrane ACE2 protein. Moreover, soluble ACE2 (sACE2) plasma concentrations are lower in prolonged viral shedders than in healthy controls, while the concentration of sACE2 returns to normal levels in short viral shedders. In the plasma of prolonged viral shedders, we also found higher concentrations of Ang II and angiotensin I (Ang I). On the other hand, the plasma levels of Ang-(1-7) remains almost stable in prolonged viral shedders but seems insufficient to prevent the adverse effects of Ang II accumulation. Altogether, these data evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 may affect the expression of blood pressure regulators with possible harmful consequences on COVID-19 outcome.","output":"Expression of ACE2, Soluble ACE2, Angiotensin I, Angiotensin II and Angiotensin-(1-7) Is Modulated in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Heart rhythm problems, more commonly known as heart arrhythmias, is the phenomenon in which heartbeats don't work properly due to electrical impulses. This causes the heart to irregularly, sometimes too slow, or too fast, depending on the condition. Fluttering and racing heart are the most common arrhythmia symptoms, which is most of the time harmless. Sometimes heart arrhythmias can even be life-threatening and may manifest several alarming signs and symptoms. This paper is about the acquisition and analysis of heart activity. Using the AD8232 module, the heart's electrical activity is captured using the principles of Electrocardiography (ECG). For the acoustic activity of the heart, a stethoscope and an electret microphone are used to convert the acoustic energy to electrical energy. The signal from each practice is passed through an ADC to translate the signal to a digital signal to allow further operation. Upon acquiring the data, it is then analyzed whether the subject has arrhythmia, murmur, or is normal using a Deep Learning algorithm. The said algorithm is provided using a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN). Remote communities where medical assistance is scarce will benefit from this research as it can be operated with no medical experience. The study was able to successfully acquire ECGs and PCGs and analyze the heart condition of the data source. The researchers successfully integrated preprocessing techniques to better analyze the gathered data from human subjects. Lastly, the tuned CNN model correctly classified human subjects based on 4 classes which are normal, abnormal, others, and noisy. The classification accuracy shows that 80% of the 20 subjects were correctly classified based on their current medical condition.

Methods: : This cross-sectional study highlights students knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward SARS-CoV-2 infection during the lockdown. The study was conducted at the Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University (IAU), Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Data was collected from 43 male preparatory students via an online self-structured questionnaire. Knowledge level was determined using mean scores, while chi-square and t-tests were performed to detect significant differences between groups. Results: : Males aged 17C20 displayed better knowledge regarding COVID-19 than other groups (t = 2.03, p = 0.049). Most participants recognized the typical symptoms and transmission routes;93% indicated they viewed social distancing as a crucial preventive measure. Following lockdown, a 1.7-fold increase in the number of participants who believed that mask-wearing was an effective preventive measure was observed;however, 37.2% did not trust this practice. There was a 2.2-fold increase in the number of participants who took part in awareness programs during lockdown. Students knowledge increased from 73.2% to 81.5% following the lockdown. Specifically, mean knowledge regarding the role of contaminated tools in disease transmission increased from 33.7% to 75.5%.

We conducted a survey in colorectal surgery units to assess the impact on colorectal cancer surgery waiting lists. METHOD: All personnel in charge of colorectal surgery units nationwide received a survey (from February to April, 2020) with eight questions divided into three sections-cessation date of colorectal cancer surgeries, number of patients waiting for treatment, and use of neoadjuvant therapy to postpone surgery. RESULTS: Sixty-seven units participated in the study, with 79.1% of units ceasing some type of activity (32.8% total and 46.3% partial cessation) and 20.9% continuing all surgical activity. In addition, 65% of units used or prolonged neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer patients and 40% of units performed at least five emergency colorectal cancer surgeries. It was estimated that at least one month of intense surgical activity will be required to catch up.

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). Findings Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66C97) and 24% (13C90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. Interpretation Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R 0 and the duration of infectiousness.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine key themes and topics of English-language COVID-19Crelated tweets posted by individuals and to explore the trends and variations in how the COVID-19Crelated tweets, key topics, and associated sentiments changed over a period of time from before to after the disease was declared a pandemic. METHODS: Building on the emergent stream of studies examining COVID-19Crelated tweets in English, we performed a temporal assessment covering the time period from January 1 to May 9, 2020, and examined variations in tweet topics and sentiment scores to uncover key trends. Combining data from two publicly available COVID-19 tweet data sets with those obtained in our own search, we compiled a data set of 13.9 million English-language COVID-19Crelated tweets posted by individuals. We use guided latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to infer themes and topics underlying the tweets, and we used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis to compute sentiment scores and examine weekly trends for 17 weeks. RESULTS: Topic modeling yielded 26 topics, which were grouped into 10 broader themes underlying the COVID-19Crelated tweets.

A sylvatic cycle of SARS-CoV-2 could present multiple opportunities for repeated spillback into human populations and other susceptible wildlife. Based on their taxonomy and natural history, two native North American wildlife species the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) and the raccoon (Procyon lotor) represent a high likelihood of susceptibility and ecological opportunity of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2. Eight skunks and raccoons were each intranasally inoculated with one of two doses of the virus (10(3) PFU and 10(5) PFU) and housed in pairs. To evaluate direct transmission, a na?ve animal was added to each inoculated pair 48 h post-inoculation. Four control animals of each species were handled like the experimental groups. At predetermined intervals, we collected nasal and rectal swabs to quantify virus shed via virus isolation and detect viral RNA via rRT-PCR and blood for serum neutralization. Lastly, animals were euthanized at staggered intervals to describe disease progression through histopathology and immunohistochemistry. No animals developed clinical disease. All intranasally inoculated animals seroconverted, suggesting both species are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The highest titers in skunks and raccoons were 1:128 and 1:64, respectively. Low quantities of virus were isolated from 2/8 inoculated skunks for up to day 5 post-inoculation, however no virus was isolated from inoculated raccoons or direct contacts of either species. Neither species had gross lesions, but recovering mild chronic pneumonia consistent with viral insult was recorded histologically in 5/8 inoculated skunks. Unlike another SARS-CoV-2 infection trial in these species, we detected neutralizing antibodies in inoculated raccoons; thus, future wildlife serologic surveillance results must be interpreted with caution. Due to the inability to isolate virus from raccoons, the lack of evidence of direct transmission between both species, and low amount of virus shed by skunks, it seems unlikely for SARS-CoV-2 to become established in raccoon and skunk populations and for virus to spillback into humans. Continued outbreaks in non-domestic species, wild and captive, highlight that additional research on the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife, especially musteloidea, and of conservation concern, is needed.","output":"Experimental Susceptibility of North American Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Striped Skunks (Mephitis mephitis) to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionThe psychological stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has a complex multifactorial nature.ObjectivesThe aim: to evaluate the level of stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Russian-speaking population with(-out) affective disorders in different cities of residence.MethodsThe data obtained from an online survey of 4803 Russian-speaking respondents (age over 18) from March 30 to May 18, 2020. The survey included social, demographic and the history of affective disorders data. The anxiety distress level was evaluated with the Psychological Stress Measure (PSM-25).ResultsIndividuals from sub-cohort of Russian cities with populations less than one million had higher stress levels (M=135.39) compared to Moscow (M=129.47;p=0.003) or St.-Petersburg (M=126.63;p<0.001). However, stress scores in respondents with a history of affective disorders correspond to the average stress level according to PSM-25. Respondents without affective disorders from St.-Petersburg reported lower stress levels (M=92.88) than respondents from Moscow (M=100.47;p<0.001) and Russian cities with less than one million population (M=98.4;p<0.001). Average stress scores from St.-Petersburg and other Russian cities show a low level of stress on PSM-25, which indicates psychological adaptation. Stress scores from Moscow have borderline values between low and medium levels.ConclusionsOur study showed that the city of residence and affective disorders status significantly affect stress levels in Russian population. These factors could be further used in individual psychological support strategies.","output":"Stress and affective disorders in COVID-19 pandemic: On-line survey of russian respondents in different cities of residence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This essay discusses the proliferation of discourses about the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting the challenges both to science and public policies that such an information overload present, having Collins' sociology of expertise as a theoretical framework.","output":"Trying to make sense out of chaos: science, politics and the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 is governed by complex social interactions that are challenging to model. Policy makers must take measures to control the spread of infection despite the unknowns that accompany a novel epidemic. The principles of artificial life govern the intricacies of social interaction through which diseases can spread. Agent-based models can capture these complexities for a subset of the population by defining the behavior of individual agents. While they can be computationally expensive for large populations, their outcomes are stochastic. Therefore, they can be used to test disease prevention policies, that can be difficult to simulate using deterministic approaches. We developed an agent-based model that is inspired by several interactive simulations on the internet for describing the COVID-19 pandemic. We define metrics to estimate the socio-economic cost of disease prevention policies on the population. We present a policy-making tool based on blackbox optimization and evolutionary computation that provides well-rounded intervention measures in terms of socio-economic cost and disease control. Several intervention measures are suggested by the algorithms with varying degrees of disease control and socio-economic cost. Policy makers can choose an intervention measure based on their preference. This research recommends combining computational intelligence principles and the use of mathematical algorithms for identifying the critical amount of intervention necessary to control infectious diseases and formulate intervention policies that minimize socio-economic cost.

PURPOSE: To estimate the proportion of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 who never develop symptoms. DATA SOURCES: Searches of Google News, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and PubMed using the keywords antibodies, asymptomatic, coronavirus, COVID-19, PCR, seroprevalence, and SARS-CoV-2. STUDY SELECTION: Observational, descriptive studies and reports of mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 that were either cross-sectional or longitudinal in design; were published through 17 November 2020; and involved SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid or antibody testing of a target population, regardless of current symptomatic status, over a defined period. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors collaboratively extracted data on the study design, type of testing performed, number of participants, criteria for determining symptomatic status, testing results, and setting. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty-one eligible studies and reports were identified, of which 43 used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs to detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and 18 used antibody testing to detect current or prior infection. In the 14 studies with longitudinal data that reported information on the evolution of symptomatic status, nearly three quarters of persons who tested positive but had no symptoms at the time of testing remained asymptomatic. The highest-quality evidence comes from nationwide, representative serosurveys of England (n = 365 104) and Spain (n = 61 075), which suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. LIMITATION: For PCR-based studies, data are limited to distinguish presymptomatic from asymptomatic infection. Heterogeneity precluded formal quantitative syntheses. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that at least one third of SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic. Longitudinal studies suggest that nearly three quarters of persons who receive a positive PCR test result but have no symptoms at the time of testing will remain asymptomatic. Control strategies for COVID-19 should be altered, taking into account the prevalence and transmission risk of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here we conceptualized the temporospatial evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by taking a series of cross-sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan to early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the early patients in Wuhan, Wuhan/WH04/2020 is supposed to be a more appropriate reference genome of SARS-CoV-2, instead of the first sequenced genome Wuhan-Hu-1. By scrutinizing the cases from the very early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations (i.e. M type) had become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.3%) of the pandemic one year later. By analyzing 4,013 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to interrogate the viral genomic composition dynamics of initial phase of global ignition over a timespan of 14-week. 11 major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were also identified. WE1 type, a descendant of M and predominantly witnessed in western Europe, consisted a half of all the cases (50.2%) at the time. The mutations of major genotypes at the same hierarchical level were mutually exclusive, which implying that various genotypes bearing the specific mutations were propagated during human-to-human transmission, not by accumulating hot-spot mutations during the replication of individual viral genomes. As the pandemic was unfolding, we also used the same approach to analyze 261,323 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e. including all the publicly available viral genomes) in order to recapitulate our findings over one-year timespan. By 25 December 2020, 95.3% of global cases were M type and 93.0% of M-type cases were WE1. In fact, at present all the four variants of concern (VOC) are the descendants of WE1 type. This study demonstrates the viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID-19, and help assess their accuracy and efficacy in real world at real time.","output":"Distinct mutations and lineages of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent one-year global expansion"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 pandemic has presented extreme challenges to developing countries across the world. Post-Soviet states are facing unique challenges due to their developing healthcare systems and unstable economy. The aim of this paper was to provide estimates for current development COVID-19 pandemic in the Post-Soviet states and forecast potential best and worst scenarios for spread of this deadly infection. Methods: The data on confirmed cases and deaths were extracted from official governmental sources for a period from beginning of outbreak dates for each country until April 18, 2020. A modified SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) modelling was used to plot the parameters of epidemic in 10 post-Soviet states and forecast the number of cases over a period of 10, 30 and 60 days. We also estimated the numbers of cases based on the optimal measures (best scenario) and suboptimal measures (worst scenarios) of potential spread of COVID-19 in these countries. Results: It was estimated that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached their peaks, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Uzbekistan are expected to reach their peaks in the coming week (April 29 - May 7, 2020), with comparatively low cases of COVID-19 and loss of lives in the best-case scenario. In contrast, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine would likely see the outbreaks with the largest number of COVID-19 cases amongst the studied Post-Soviet States in the worst scenario during the next 30 and 60 days. Geographical remoteness and small number of international travelers from the countries heavily affected by the pandemic could also have contributed to delay in the spread of COVID-19. Conclusion: Governmental response was shown to be as an important determining factor responsible for the development of COVID-19 epidemic in Post-Soviet states. The current protection rates should be maintained to reduce active cases during upcoming 30 and 60 days. The estimated possible scenarios based on the proposed model can potentially be used by healthcare professionals from each studied Post-Soviet States as well as others to improve plans to contain the current and future epidemic.","output":"COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN POST-SOVIET STATES: MODELING THE BEST AND WORST POSSIBLE SCENARIOS"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND This scoping review aimed to overview studies that used administrative data linkage in the context of child maltreatment to improve our understanding of the value that data linkage may confer for policy, practice, and research.

Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light an additional concern of wildlife markets as a major human-health challenge. We analyzed data from the largest longitudinal monitoring (1973-2018) of the most important urban wild-meat markets in Iquitos, Peru, to examine the trends in and impacts of these markets on people's livelihoods. Over the last 45 years, wild meat sales increased at a rate of 6.4 t/year (SD 2.17), paralleling urban population growth. Wild meat sales were highest in 2018 (442 t), contributing US$2.6 million (0.76%) to the regional gross domestic product. Five species of ungulates and rodents accounted for 88.5% of the amount of biomass traded. Vulnerable and Endangered species represented 7.0% and 0.4% of individuals sold, respectively. Despite growth in sales, the contribution of wild meat to overall urban diet was constant: 1-2%/year of total meat consumed. This result was due to greater availability and higher consumption of cheaper meats (e.g., in 2018, poultry was 45.8% cheaper and was the most consumed meat) coupled with the lack of economic incentives to harvest wild meat species in rural areas. Most wild meat was sold salted or smoked, reducing the likelihood of foodborne diseases. Community-based wildlife management plans and the continued trade bans on primates and threatened taxa may avoid biodiversity loss. Considering the recent COVID-19 pandemic, future management plans should include potential viral hosts and regulation and enforcement of hygiene practices in wild-meat markets.","output":"Wild meat trade over the last 45 years in the Peruvian Amazon"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: The objective of this bibliometric analysis and mapping review is to describe the characteristics and trends in published research on anxiety and perinatal depression across the perinatal period from emergence to end of 2020.

Existing theories propose that during motoric response-conflict, inappropriate motor activity is actively (and perhaps non-selectively) suppressed by an inhibitory fronto-basal ganglia mechanism. We here tested this theory across three experiments. First, using scalp-EEG, we found that both outright action-stopping and response-conflict during action-selection invoke low-frequency activity of a common fronto-central source, whose activity relates to trial-by-trial behavioral indices of inhibition in both tasks. Second, using simultaneous intracranial recordings from the basal ganglia and motor cortex, we found that response-conflict increases the influence of the subthalamic nucleus on M1-representations of incorrect response-tendencies. Finally, using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we found that during the same time period when conflict-related STN-to-M1 communication is increased, cortico-spinal excitability is broadly suppressed. Together, these findings demonstrate that fronto-basal ganglia networks buttress action-selection under response-conflict by rapidly and non-selectively net-inhibiting inappropriate motor tendencies.","output":"Non-selective inhibition of inappropriate motor-tendencies during response-conflict by a fronto-subthalamic mechanism."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, China reported a cluster of pneumonia patients infected by a new virus from the coronavirus family called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

The following parameters were assessed: demographic characteristics, nutritional status (using the Malnutrition Screening Tool), BMI, loss of appetite, weight loss, decreased food intake and mental health status (using the PHQ-9 to determine the severity of depression). Data collectors wore Personal Protective Equipment and spent a maximum of 15 minutes with each patient. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ministry of Health as well as patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 26. RESULTS: Patients (n = 515; 82% males) were included. They aged 31C50 years old (60%), married (85%), had low education level (85%), employed in non-governmental sectors (67%), and were non-Saudis (76%). Patients complained of loss of appetite (32%), weight loss (16%), and decreased food intake (19%). A significant number were at risk (13.6%) and 1.6% had high risk of malnutrition. Patients (4%) were underweight and 45% were overweight and/or obese. The mean BMI was 25.4 (SD = 5). They (23.4%) suffered from various degrees of depression. Mild depression was most prevalent (17%) followed by moderate depression (4.3%). Moderately severe and severe depression were common among 2.1%. One way ANOVA indicated that the severity of depression associated with the loss of appetite (P < 0.0005), decreased food intake (P < 0.0005), weight loss (P < 0.0005), and BMI (P < 0.0005). Linear Multiple Regression showed that the loss of appetite (B = 0.037, 95%CI = 0.011C0.352, P = 0.037), weight loss (B = 0.114, 95%CI = 0.000C0.228, P = 0.0049), and BMI (B = 0.031, 95%CI = 0.004C0.057, P = 0.023) affected patients' severity of depression.

We infer from our analysis that most infections in passengers started on 28 January and were completed by 6 February, except in those who shared a cabin with another infected passenger. The distribution of the infected cabins was random, and no spatial cluster of the infected can be identified. We infer that the ship's central air-conditioning system for passenger's cabins did not play a role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, i.e. airborne transmission did not occur between cabins during the outbreak, suggesting that the sufficient ventilation was provided. We also infer that the ship's cabin drainage system did not play a role.

However, travel to in-person workshops can be time-consuming and expensive. Thus, we developed a free online course to provide training in IYCF to health professionals globally; the course received overwhelmingly high numbers of registrations. Our aim was to conduct a program evaluation to assess course satisfaction, learning, and application using surveys administered postcourse and 9 months later. Response rates were 99% (n = 835) and 55% (n = 312), respectively. Among those who only partially completed the course, reasons for noncompletion were assessed (response rate 29%, n = 72). Data within a 1-year period were analyzed. Respondents worked in multiple settings and organizations worldwide. Nearly all (99%) reported postcourse that they learned a lot or some from all topics, and over 70% applied a lot of or some information 9 months later. In open-ended questions, respondents reported improved knowledge, skills, and competence to conduct their work; they also desired more similar training courses. Many who did not complete the course reported not enough time as the main reason (74%), and most (94%) wanted to continue it. The positive response to the course suggests there is an unmet need for CPD for health professionals in LMICs.

The spike proteins of B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 variants have several substitutions in the receptor binding domain (RBD), including L452R+E484Q, L452R+T478K, and K417N+L452R+T478K, respectively, that could potentially reduce effectiveness of therapeutic antibodies and current vaccines. Here we compared B.1.617 variants, and their single and double RBD substitutions for resistance to neutralization by convalescent sera, mRNA vaccine-elicited sera, and therapeutic neutralizing antibodies using a pseudovirus neutralization assay. Pseudoviruses with the B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2, and AY.1 spike showed a modest 1.5 to 4.4-fold reduction in neutralization titer by convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited sera. In comparison, similar modest reductions were also observed for pseudoviruses with C.37, P.1, R.1, and B.1.526 spikes, but seven- and sixteen-fold reduction for vaccine-elicited and convalescent sera, respectively, was seen for pseudoviruses with the B.1.351 spike. Four of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.2 pseudoviruses due to the L452R substitution, whereas six of twenty-three therapeutic neutralizing antibodies showed either complete or partial loss of neutralization against B.1.617.1 pseudoviruses due to either the E484Q or L452R substitution. Against AY.1 pseudoviruses, the L452R and K417N substitutions accounted for the loss of neutralization by four antibodies and one antibody, respectively, whereas one antibody lost potency that could not be fully accounted for by a single RBD substitution. The modest resistance of B.1.617 variants to vaccine-elicited sera suggest that current mRNA-based vaccines will likely remain effective in protecting against B.1.617 variants, but the therapeutic antibodies need to be carefully selected based on their resistance profiles. Finally, the spike proteins of B.1.617 variants are more efficiently cleaved due to the P681R substitution, and the spike of Delta variants exhibited greater sensitivity to soluble ACE2 neutralization, as well as fusogenic activity, which may contribute to enhanced spread of Delta variants.","output":"SARS-COV-2 Delta variant displays moderate resistance to neutralizing antibodies and spike protein properties of higher soluble ACE2 sensitivity, enhanced cleavage and fusogenic activity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Critically ill patients admitted in ICU because of COVID-19 infection display severe hypoxemic respiratory failure. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends oxygenation through high-flow nasal cannula over non-invasive ventilation.

The secondary outcomes were relevant changes in PaCO2 associated with clinical modifications and patient's feelings. DESIGN: We prospectively assessed 21 patients admitted in our mixed Intensive Care Unit of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc. MAIN RESULTS: While FiO2 was unchanged, we demonstrate a significant increase of PaO2 (from 59 ( 6), to 79 mmHg ( 16), p < 0.001), PaO2/FiO2 from 83 ( 22), to 111 ( 38), p < 0.001) and SaO2 (from 91% ( 1.5), to 94% ( 1.6), p < 0.001), while the patients were under the surgical mask. The SpO2 returned to pre-treatment values when the surgical mask was removed confirming the effect of the device rather than a spontaneous positive evolution.

We used Chi-square tests to compare respondent stress and facility level policies regarding eating/drinking and oral nutrition supplements (ONS) based on facility ownership type. Results We received 191 complete or partial survey responses. 63% of respondents stated that their center banned eating/drinking during dialysis due to COVID-19 masking policies. DaVita and non-profit facilities were significantly more likely to still allow eating/drinking during dialysis (31% and 29%, respectively) compared to Fresenius facilities (7%). A common theme in open-ended responses regarding nutrition care for COVID-19-positive patients was providing less care to these patients. A majority of respondents admitted to stress from working in healthcare during COVID-19. The majority of respondents indicated that patients were taking precautions such as having a family member or friend grocery shop for them (69%) or going to the store less often (60%). Just over a quarter of respondents indicated that affordability of food was a concern among patients. 72% reported that patients were cooking at home more often, 60% had observed an increase in serum phosphorus and 72% an increase in interdialytic weight gain. Conclusions Due to the increased risk of malnutrition and symptoms that can affect dietary intake in COVID-positive patients, and the economic conditions leading to increased rates of food insecurity, dietitians must be proactive in preventing and/or treating malnutrition through adequate protein and energy intake.

Methods: From March to June 2020, healthcare workers in a large, urban U.S. healthcare system were invited via hospital emails and departmental announcements to complete an online questionnaire (REDCap). Self-report measures assessed sociodemographic characteristics and job roles, health uncertainty, and emotional wellbeing variables (anxiety, depression, loneliness, self-compassion, and coping confidence). Health uncertainty levels were compared using t-tests and ANOVAs. Results: Healthcare workers (N=440) were on average 44.5 years of age, 88.9% female, and 84.5% non-Hispanic white.

Generally, the onset of allergies, including FA, begins in early childhood and may persist and/or develop through the life-course. Even though epidemiological studies have focused mainly on children, allergies can also occur for the first-time during adulthood. Within the prolongation of life, it is expected that allergies will be encountered more often even in older people. Recent findings suggest that an early exposure to diverse food antigens may promote the development of immune tolerance. Accordingly, diet diversity during the first year of life or even earlier may have a positive impact on the prevention of allergies. The anti-inflammatory properties of some dietary nutrients may positively contribute to a tolerogenic immune environment too. Diet diversity is associated with a more favorable microbiome, and increasing evidence suggests a promising role of gut microbiota manipulation in inducing immune tolerance. Unjustified avoidance of allergenic foods may expose to intakes of some nutrients below recommended levels through the life-course, even more in cases of self-diagnosis and treatment of presumed forms of food intolerance. Nutritional strategies including the early exposure to a variety of food antigens are a promising area of research for preventive purposes through the life-course possibly extending positive outcomes to older stages.

Among the gaps in research on the COVID-19 outbreak, there is a lack of sufficient infoveillance data. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to increase understanding of public awareness of COVID-19 pandemic trends and uncover meaningful themes of concern posted by Twitter users in the English language during the pandemic. METHODS: Data mining was conducted on Twitter to collect a total of 107,990 tweets related to COVID-19 between December 13 and March 9, 2020. The analyses included frequency of keywords, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to identify and explore discussion topics over time. A natural language processing approach and the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm were used to identify the most common tweet topics as well as to categorize clusters and identify themes based on the keyword analysis. RESULTS: The results indicate three main aspects of public awareness and concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. First, the trend of the spread and symptoms of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. Second, the results of the sentiment analysis showed that people have a negative outlook toward COVID-19. Third, based on topic modeling, the themes relating to COVID-19 and the outbreak were divided into three categories: the COVID-19 pandemic emergency, how to control COVID-19, and reports on COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Sentiment analysis and topic modeling can produce useful information about the trends in the discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic on social media as well as alternative perspectives to investigate the COVID-19 crisis, which has created considerable public awareness.

Developmental researchers who assess looking time (especially those who rely heavily on in-lab eye-tracking or live coding techniques) were forced to re-think their methods of data collection. While a variety of remote or online platforms are available for gathering behavioral data outside of the typical lab setting, few are specifically designed for collecting and processing looking time data in infants and young children. To address these challenges, our lab developed several novel approaches for continuing data collection and coding for a remotely administered audiovisual looking time protocol. First, we detail a comprehensive approach for successfully administering the Multisensory Attention Assessment Protocol (MAAP), developed by our lab to assess multisensory attention skills (MASks; duration of looking, speed of shifting/disengaging, accuracy of audiovisual matching). The MAAP is administered from a distance (remotely) by using Zoom, Gorilla Experiment Builder, an internet connection, and a home computer. This new data collection approach has the advantage that participants can be tested in their homes. We discuss challenges and successes in implementing our approach for remote testing and data collection during an ongoing longitudinal project. Second, we detail an approach for estimating gaze direction and duration collected remotely from webcam recordings using a post processing toolkit (OpenFace) and demonstrate its effectiveness and precision. However, because OpenFace derives gaze estimates without translating them to an external frame of reference (i.e., the participant's screen), we developed a machine learning (ML) approach to overcome this limitation. Thus, third, we trained a ML algorithm [(artificial neural network (ANN)] to classify gaze estimates from OpenFace with respect to areas of interest (AOI) on the participant's screen (i.e., left, right, and center). We then demonstrate reliability between this approach and traditional coding approaches (e.g., coding gaze live). The combination of OpenFace and ML will provide a method to automate the coding of looking time for data collected remotely. Finally, we outline a series of best practices for developmental researchers conducting remote data collection for looking time studies.","output":"Remote Data Collection During a Pandemic: A New Approach for Assessing and Coding Multisensory Attention Skills in Infants and Young Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Distance learning demand has increased and turned into an obligatory educational system during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

RESULTS Sixty-one patients (86%) demonstrated neurologic symptoms at hospital admission. Altered mental status was seen in 47 patients (66%) and represented the most common neurologic symptom. Seven patients (10%) were comatose at hospital admission and 5 (7%) presented with altered mental status without respiratory symptoms. Three patients had seizures and two had strokes. Hypertension (61%), cardiovascular disease (59%), and dementia (49%) were the most common comorbidities associated with death due to COVID-19 in our sample. CONCLUSIONS Neurologic symptoms, particularly altered mental status, are very common in COVID-19 patients with high risk of mortality.

The effects of lymphatic drainage dysfunction on periodontitis have not been well-studied. Here we show that lymphatic vessel endothelial receptor 1 (LYVE1)+ /podoplanin (PDPN)+ lymphatic vessels (LVs) are increased in the periodontal tissues, with accumulation close to the alveolar bone surface, in two murine periodontitis models: rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-associated periodontitis and ligature-induced periodontitis. Further, PDPN+ / alpha-smooth muscle actin (&#945;SMA)- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas PDPN+ / &#945;SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in the inflamed periodontal tissues. Both mouse models of periodontitis have delayed lymph flow in periodontal tissues, increased TRAP-positive osteoclasts, and significant alveolar bone loss. Importantly, the local administration of adeno-associated virus for vascular endothelial growth factor C, the major growth factor that promotes lymphangiogenesis, increases the area and number of PDPN+ / &#945;SMA+ collecting LVs, promotes local lymphatic drainage, and reduces alveolar bone loss in both models of periodontitis. Lastly, LYVE1+ / &#945;SMA- lymphatic capillaries are increased, whereas LYVE1+ / &#945;SMA+ collecting LVs are decreased significantly in gingival tissues of patients with chronic periodontitis compared with those of clinically healthy controls.

Reports exist regarding the potential benefits of undertaking mobile radiography through side room windows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact on image quality and exposure factors when undertaking such examinations. Methods A phantom based study was undertaken using a digital X-ray room. Control acquisitions, using a commercially available image quality test tool, were performed using standard mobile chest radiography acquisition factors. Image quality (physical and visual), incidence surface air kerma (ISAK), Exposure Index (EI) and Deviation Index (DI) were recorded. Image quality and radiation dose were further assessed for two additional (experimental) scenarios, where a side room window was located immediately adjacent to the exit port of the light beam diaphragm. The goal of experimental scenario one was to modify exposure factors to maintain the control ISAK. The goal of experimental scenario two was to modify exposure factors to maintain the control EI and DI. Dose and image quality data were compared between the three scenarios. Results To maintain the pre-window (control) ISAK (76 Gy), tube output needed a three-fold increase (90 kV/4 mAs versus 90 kV/11.25 mAs). To maintain EI/DI a more modest increase in tube output was required (90 kV/8 mAs/ISAK 54 Gy). Physical and visual assessments of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio were indifferent between the three scenarios. There was a slight statistically significant reduction in contrast-to-noise ratio when imaging through the glass window (2.3 versus 1.4 and 1.2; P=0.005). Conclusions Undertaking mobile X-ray examinations through side room windows is potentially feasible but does require an increase in tube output and is likely to be limited by minor reductions in image quality. Implications for practice Mobile examinations performed through side room windows should only be used in limited circumstances and future clinical evaluation of this technique is warranted.","output":"Modifications to mobile chest radiography technique during the COVID-19 pandemic C implications of X-raying through side room windows"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the world over the past two years (2020-2021). One of the key questions about its future trajectory is the protection from subsequent infections and disease conferred by a previous infection, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus belongs to the coronaviruses, a group of viruses the members of which are known for their ability to reinfect convalescent individuals. Bulgaria, with high rates of previous infections combined with low vaccination rates and an elderly population, presents a somewhat unique context to study this question. MethodsWe use detailed governmental data on registered COVID-19 cases to evaluate the incidence and outcomes of COVID-19 reinfections in Bulgaria in the period between March 2020 and early December 2021. ResultsFor the period analyzed, a total of 4,106 cases of individuals infected more than once were observed, including 31 cases of three infections and one of four infections. The number of reinfections increased dramatically during the Delta variant-driven wave of the pandemic towards the end of 2021. We observe a moderate reduction of severe outcomes (hospitalization and death) in reinfections relative to primary infections, and a more substantial reduction of severe outcomes in breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals.

Since hMSC-DP have been applied in numerous clinical studies, it is necessary to establish criteria to evaluate their potency for cell-based therapies. METHODS: We compared stem cell properties of hMSC-DP at passages 5, 10 and 20 under serum (SE) and serum-free (SF) culture conditions. Cell morphology, proliferation capacity, chromosomal stability, surface phenotypic profiles, differentiation and immunoregulation ability were evaluated. In addition, we assessed surface molecule that regulates hMSC-DP proliferation and immunomodulation. RESULTS: hMSC-DP exhibited a decrease in proliferation rate and differentiation potential, as well as a reduced expression of CD146 when cultured under continuous passage conditions. SF culture conditions failed to alter surface marker expression, chromosome stability or proliferation rate when compared to SE culture. SF-cultured hMSC-DP were able to differentiate into osteogenic, adipogenic and neural cells, and displayed the capacity to regulate immune responses. Notably, the expression level of CD146 showed a positive correlation with proliferation, differentiation, and immunomodulation, suggesting that CD146 can serve as a surface molecule to evaluate the potency of hMSC-DP. Mechanistically, we found that CD146 regulates proliferation and immunomodulation of hMSC-DP through the ERK/p-ERK pathway.

Brain tissue-resident memory T cells (bT(RM)) are recruited during central nervous system infection and promote pathogen control as well as noxious inflammation. Our prior studies in young mice showed optimal recruitment of CD8(+) bT(RM) during neuroinvasive Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) infection required miR-155, and was significantly inhibited by anti-miR-155 oligonucleotides. Since Lm is an important pathogen in the elderly, we hypothesized anti-miR-155 would also inhibit accumulation of CD8(+) bT(RM) in aged mice infected with Lm. METHODS: Young (2 mo) and aged (> 18 mo) male C57BL/6 mice were infected intra-peritoneally with wild-type Lm, or avirulent Lm mutants lacking the genes required for intracellular motility (actA) or phagosomal escape (hly), then were given antibiotics. Brain leukocytes and their intracellular cytokine production were quantified by flow cytometry >28d post-infection (p.i.). The role of miR-155 was tested by injecting mice with anti-miR-155 or control oligonucleotides along with antibiotics. RESULTS: Aged mice had significantly more homeostatic CD8(+) bT(RM) than did young mice, which did not increase after infection with wild-type Lm despite 50% mortality, whereas young mice suffered no mortality after a larger inoculum. For direct comparison of post-infectious neuroinflammation after the same inoculum, young and aged mice were infected with 10(7) CFU actA Lm. This mutant caused no mortality and significantly increased CD8(+) bT(RM) 28d p.i. in both groups, whereas bone marrow-derived myeloid cells, particularly neutrophils, increased only in aged mice. Notably, anti-miR-155 reduced accumulation of brain myeloid cells in aged mice after infection, whereas CD8(+) bT(RM) were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic infection with Lm actA is a novel model for studying infection-induced brain inflammation in aged mice without excessive mortality. CD8(+) bT(RM) increase in both young and aged mice after infection, whereas only in aged mice bone marrow-derived myeloid cells increase long-term. In aged mice, anti-miR-155 inhibits brain accumulation of myeloid cells, but not CD8(+) bT(RM). These results suggest young and aged mice differ in manifestations and mechanisms of infection-induced neuroinflammation and give insight for developing therapies to ameliorate brain inflammation following severe infection in the elderly.

Methods: A systematic literature search using appropriate medical subject heading (MeSH) terms was performed through Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, SCOPUS, OVID and Cochrane Library electronic databases. The main outcomes considered were mortality and safety of IVIG versus placebo/standard of care. This review was carried out in accordance with Cochrane methodology including the risk bias assessment and grading of the quality of evidence. Measures of treatment effect were mean differences (MD) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcome measures and risk ratio (RR) or MD for binary outcomes. Two reviewers independently extracted data from individual studies, and disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. Results: A total of 2401 COVID-19 patients from 10 studies (four randomized controlled trials (RCT) and six non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs)) were included in the analysis.

OBJECTIVE The goal of this work was to assess the possible inhibitory effect of ACE-II on ascorbic acid using an ex vivo approach based on the inhibition of diminazene-induced vasorelaxation. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present study, diminazene was used as a known specific inhibitor of ACE-II. Then, the vasorelaxant effect of ascorbic acid on diminazene-induced relaxation was examined using isolated aortic rings. All experiments of this study were evaluated on isolated aortic rings precontracted by epinephrine. RESULTS The results confirmed that diminazene-induced vasorelaxation in a dose-dependent manner. More interestingly, ascorbic acid inhibited diminazene-induced vasorelaxation in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION This investigation provides valuable experimental proof of the efficacy of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) on inhibiting ex vivo vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme II, which is known among the pharmacological targets of anti-Covid-19 drugs.","output":"Vitamin C inhibits Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme-2 in Isolated Rat Aortic Ring."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) face high morbidity and mortality. Palliative care consultation may benefit these patients and their families. Prior to the pandemic, our institution implemented a policy of automatic palliative care consultation for all patients on ECMO due to the high mortality, medical complexity, and psychosocial distress associated with these cases. OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to describe the role of the palliative care team for patients on ECMO for COVID-19 infection. The secondary objective was to describe the clinical outcomes for this cohort. DESIGN: Case series. SETTINGS/SUBJECTS: All patients age 18 or older infected by the novel coronavirus who required cannulation on ECMO from March through July of 2020, at an urban, academic medical center in the United States. Inter-disciplinary palliative care consultation occurred for all patients. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients (median age 43 years [range 28-64], mean body mass index 34.9 kg/m2 [SD 9.2], 65% Hispanic ethnicity) were cannulated on ECMO. Eleven patients died during the hospitalization (48%). Patients older than 50 years of age demonstrated a trend toward increased odds of death compared to those younger than 50 years of age (OR 9.1, P = 0.07). Patients received an average of 6.8 (SD 3.7) palliative clinical encounters across all disciplines. The actions provided by the palliative care team included psychosocial support and counseling, determination of surrogate decision maker (for 100% of patients), pain management (83%), and non-pain symptom management (83%). CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present one of the first studies describing the patient characteristics, outcomes, and palliative care actions for critically ill patients with COVID-19 on ECMO. Almost half of the patients in this cohort died during their hospitalization. Given the high morbidity and mortality of this condition, we recommend involvement of palliative care for patients/families with COVID-19 infection who are on ECMO. The impact of palliative care on patient and family outcomes, such as symptom control, satisfaction with communication, rates of anxiety, and grief experience merits further investigation.","output":"Palliative Care for Patients on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for COVID-19 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multicultural communities in Australia are recognised as a priority area for drowning prevention, but no evidence-based study has addressed their knowledge of beach safety. This study used an online survey tool to identify and examine risk factors relating to swimming ability, beach visitation characteristics and behaviour, and beach safety knowledge of the Australian Southern Asian community to assist in the development of future beach safety interventions. Data was obtained through 249 online and in-person surveys of people aged > 18 years. Most respondents reported poor swimming ability (80%), often swam in in the absence of lifeguards (77%), did not understand the rip current hazard (58%), but reported that they entered the water (76%) when visiting beaches. Close to one-quarter (28%) had not heard, or didnt know the purpose, of the red and yellow beach flags, which identify lifeguard supervised areas on Australian beaches. Length of time living in Australia is an important beach safety consideration for this community, with minimal differences in terms of gender and age. Those who have lived < 10 years in Australia visit beaches more frequently and are less likely to have participated in swimming lessons, be able to swim, heard of the flags or swim between them, understand rip currents, or have participated in a beach safety program. Very few (3%) respondents received beach safety information from within their own community. The importance of beach safety education and swimming lessons within the Southern Asian community should be prioritised for new and recent migrants to Australia.","output":"Identifying risk factors and implications for beach drowning prevention amongst an Australian multicultural community"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"After the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, it has influenced the health care practices around the world. Initial investigations indicate that patients with comorbidities are more fragile to this SARS-CoV-2 infection. They suggested postponing the routine treatment of cancer patients. However, few meta-analyses suggested evidences are not sufficient to hold the claim of the frailty of cancer patients to COVID-19, and they are not in favour of shelving the scheduled procedures. There are recent studies in which medical professionals, according to their competence, are referring to change the routine practices on how to manage the applicable therapeutic resources judiciously to combat this vital infection. This is a different study that reveals the cancer patients' viewpoint about how health care practices have been changed in their opinion during this pandemic year? Are they satisfied with their treatment or not? To serve the purpose, we gathered more than 60000 relevant tweets from Twitter to analyse the sentiment of cancer patients around the world. Our findings demonstrate that there is a surge in argument about cancer and its treatment after the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the tweets are reasonable (52.6%) compared to the negative ones (24.3). We developed polarity and subjectivity distribution to better recognise the positivity/negativity in the sentiment. Results reveal that the polarity range of positive tweets is within the range of 0 to 0.5. Which means the tendency in the tweets is not so much positive but surely not negative. It is a piece of modest statistical evidence in support of how natural language processing (NLP) can be accepted to better understand the patient's behaviour in real-time, and it may facilitate the medical professional to make better decision to organise the routine management of cancer patients.","output":"Whether the Health Care Practices For the Patients With Comorbidities Have Changed After the Outbreak of COVID-19;Big Data Public Sentiment Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To explore the role of chronic liver disease (CLD) in COVID-19.

This study was performed to examine the outcome of CAS with an open-cell stent and double-balloon protection for unstable plaques. METHODS A total of 184 CAS procedures in our institute between October 2010 and February 2018 were assessed. Ultrasonography findings of low-echo plaques, plaque ulceration, or both were defined as unstable plaques. A plaque-to-muscle ratio (PMR) of >1.8 on T1-weighted black blood imaging using spin-echo was also defined as an unstable plaque. Seventy-four unstable plaques on ultrasonography and 86 unstable plaques evaluated by PMR were included. Open-cell stents and double-balloon protection (proximal balloon protection during lesion crossing and distal balloon protection after lesion crossing) were used in all cases. RESULTS On ultrasonography, perioperative asymptomatic thromboembolization was significantly more frequent in the unstable plaque group (39/74, 52.7%) than in the stable plaque group (41/110, 37.3%, p=0.0384). Asymptomatic thromboembolization was also significantly more frequent in the PMR >1.8 group (44/86, 51.2%) than in the PMR <1.8 group (36/98, 36.7%, p=0.0489). However, symptomatic thromboembolization was rare (n=5, 2.7%), and all of these patients had minor stroke. During the 4-year follow-up, the risk of ipsilateral stroke was 0.28% and 0.27% per year in patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The outcomes of CAS with an open-cell stent and double-balloon protection are acceptable.

Currently, there is no definite injection point for the muscle. This study provides a suggestion for injection points for the serratus anterior muscle considering the intramuscular neural distribution using the whole-mount staining method. A modified Sihler method was applied to the serratus anterior muscles (15 specimens). The intramuscular arborization areas were identified in terms of the anterior (100%), middle (50%), and posterior axillary line (0%), and from the first to the ninth ribs. The intramuscular neural distribution for the serratus anterior muscle had the largest arborization patterns in the fifth to the ninth rib portion of between 50% and 70%, and the first to the fourth rib portion had between 20% and 40%. These intramuscular neural distribution-based injection sites are in relation to the external anatomical line for the frequently injected muscles to facilitate the efficiency of botulinum neurotoxin injections. Lastly, the intramuscular neural distribution of serratus anterior muscle should be considered in order to practice more accurately without the harmful side effects of trigger-point injections and botulinum neurotoxin injections.","output":"Intramuscular Neural Distribution of the Serratus Anterior Muscle: Regarding Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection for Treating Myofascial Pain Syndrome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Migration is a challenging life transition that may be a source of various problems related to well-being and mental health. However, the psychological adaptation of migrants may be potentially facilitated by social self-efficacy-the beliefs in one's ability to initiate and maintain interpersonal relationships. Previous research suggests that social self-efficacy is positively related to adjustment and negatively related to loneliness, depression, and psychological distress. Research also confirms that self-efficacy beliefs can be effectively enhanced using Internet-based interventions. These results served as a background for creating the New in Town, a self-help Internet-based intervention for internal migrants in Poland that aims at increasing social self-efficacy. Exercises in the intervention are based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and relate to sources of self-efficacy beliefs: mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal persuasions, and emotional and physiological states. Users complete increasingly challenging tasks that encourage them to interact with their environment. The aim of this trial was to investigate the efficacy of the New in Town intervention. Methods: The efficacy of the New in Town intervention will be tested in a two-arm randomized controlled trial with a waitlist control group. Social self-efficacy will be the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include loneliness, perceived social support, and satisfaction with life. Additionally, we will measure user experience among participants allocated to the experimental group. We aim to recruit a total of Na?=a?280 participants aged at least 18a?years who have changed their place of residence in the last 6a?months and have an Internet connection. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3-week post-test, and 8-week follow-up. Discussion: The trial will provide insights into the efficacy of Internet-based self-help interventions in increasing social self-efficacy. Given that the intervention works, New in Town could provide an easily accessible support option for internal migrants in Poland.

Although there were no seasonal differences in the IgG concentration of colostrum and calf serum, neonatal diarrhoea incidence was higher in calves which were born in winter than in calves which were born in summer (P < 0.01). Thus the high diarrhoea incidence in winter was not a consequence of an insufficient IgG transfer to the calves. The 60 calves of the second study were fed colostrum on the first day of life. From the second to the tenth day 28 experimental calves received milk and 0.5 l of surplus colostrum of the first and second milking twice a day, whereas 32 control calves received milk only twice a day. Two of the 28 experimental and 11 of the 32 control calves suffered from diarrhoea during the first ten days of life (P < 0.05).

This paper shares the experience of developing triage criteria and a mechanism for prioritizing intensive care unit resources in a middle-income country with the potential to be applied to other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) faced with a similar (if not more of a) challenge when responding to the global pandemic. To the best of our knowledge, this locally developed guideline would be among the first of its kind from an LMIC setting. In summary, the experience from the Thai protocol development highlights three important lessons. First, stakeholder consultation and public engagement are crucial steps to ensure the protocol reflects the priorities of society and to maintain public trust in the health system. Second, all bodies and actions proposed in the protocol must not conflict with existing laws to ensure smooth implementation and adherence by professionals. Last, all components of the protocol must be compatible with the local context including medical culture, physician-patient relationship, and religious and societal norms.","output":"Prioritizing critical-care resources in response to COVID-19: lessons from the development of Thailand's Triage protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: ACE and CPN serum activity correlated with disease severity in an earlier study of 45 hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

A thorough characterization of vaccine protection and its duration in time is needed to inform vaccination policies and enhance public trust. Methods We matched three national databases with exhaustive information on screening, vaccination and hospitalizations in France over the year 2021. We performed a two-step analysis to estimate vaccine effectiveness against severe forms of Covid-19 in people aged 50 years or over, combining: (i) a test-negative case-control design to assess vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections; and (ii) a survival analysis to assess the additional protection against severe outcomes (hospitalizations and inpatient deaths) in infected individuals. Results We found a high vaccine effectiveness in people aged 50 years or more, reaching 82% against symptomatic infections and 94% against severe outcomes, after a full vaccination scheme. Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infections strongly decreased over time, dropping to 53% after six months, but remained high against severe forms (90% after six months). The booster dose allowed restoring high protection levels. Vaccine protection and its evolution in time, showed little difference against the variants that circulated prior to December 2021 in France, including the Delta variant.

Interaction terms between SARS epidemic exposure and social participation or community environment were included to examine potential effects. RESULTS: We found that community SARS exposure was associated with greater AL for those who had no social participation. Among those who were in worse community environment, community SARS exposure was strongly related to elevated load in the cardiovascular system. However, for those had social participation and lived in better community environment, community SARS exposure manifested no association with AL years later.

As the prevalence of COVID-19 increases, radiological examination is becoming an essential diagnostic tool for identifying and managing the diseases progression. Therefore, we aimed to identify the chest imaging features and clinical characteristics of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. MATERIAL/METHODS: In this retrospective study, data of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected from 4 hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Their common clinical characteristics, as well as imaging features of chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) images, were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 297 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent chest imaging were investigated in this study. Of these patients, 77.9% were male and 22.2% were female. Their mean age was 48 years old. The most common clinical symptoms were fever (187 patients; 63%) and cough (174 patients; 58.6%). The predominant descriptive chest imaging findings were ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Locations of abnormalities were bilateral, mainly distributed peripherally, in the lower lung zones, and in the middle lung zones. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an understanding of the most common clinical and radiological features of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. The majority of COVID-19 patients in our study cohort had either stable or worse progression of lung lesions during follow-ups; thus, they presented moderate disease cases. Elderly males were more affected by COVID-19 than females, with fever and cough being the most common clinical symptoms.","output":"Chest Radiological Findings and Clinical Characteristics of Laboratory-Confirmed COVID-19 Patients from Saudi Arabia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Assessing Iraqi experience with the impact of substandard and falsified (S/F) medicines can help other countries deal comprehensively with the underlying causes of this multifactorial problem. The tools used in this study to assess strategies to prevent the use of S/F medications can be used in other developing countries. This study investigated the problem of S/F medications at three levels: the Ministry of Health (MOH), pharmaceutical company representatives, and community pharmacists. OBJECTIVES: Study objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of alerts about S/F medications issued by the national Iraqi Pharmacovigilance Center (IqPhvc) to community pharmacies and to explore the reasons and potential solutions for this problem from the perspective of both pharmaceutical companies and pharmacists. METHODS: This was an exploratory mixed-method study. The qualitative phase comprised seven 1-h semi-structured interviews and one focus group conducted via Zoom. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The findings of the qualitative phase were then used to develop the survey items. The quantitative phase included an electronic survey distributed among pharmacists via two professional Facebook groups between 23 April and 19 May 2020. The KruskalCWallis test was used to measure differences in pharmacists knowledge of and ability to detect S/F medications according to their years of experience in the private sector. RESULTS: Over the last 5 years (2016C2020), the IqPhvc received 183 reports about S/F medications from representatives of 25 international companies. Only 29 (15.8%) of the reports were about falsified medications; the majority were about substandard (parallel) medicines. We interviewed 12 pharmacists (11 male, 1 female) representing ten large international pharmaceutical companies. We also received surveys from 590 pharmacists, of whom 475 (80.9%) were women. Although 72% of the participants had not received any training in the identification of S/F medications, 59.4% of them easily identified S/F medications. Likewise, approximately three-quarters of the participating pharmacists recognized genuine registered medications through three means: medication price sticker, cost, and packaging features. Although 61% of the pharmacists followed-up alerts about S/F medications, only 25.6% were willing to report S/F medications. CONCLUSIONS: Most reports to the IqPhvc were about substandard medications. Participants of the two study phases agreed on several reasons for the problem of S/F medications, including their low prices, the unavailability of registered medications, the lengthy medicine registration process, and inadequate awareness of S/F medications among healthcare providers and the public. They also agreed that national alerts and price stickers are helpful in the identification of S/F medications. Community pharmacists can increase their efforts to report S/F medicines, but they need training, awareness, and tools. The study highlighted the need for a track-and-trace system to detect S/F medicines in the supply chain. In brief, the problem of S/F medication is multifaceted. Reducing it will require effective collaboration among different entities, including health officials, border agencies, healthcare providers, and registered pharmaceutical companies.","output":"The Epidemic of Substandard and Falsified Medications in Iraq: Evaluating the Effectiveness of National Pharmacovigilance Alerts to Community Pharmacies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter discusses the process and results of cultivation of viruses. Viruses can only replicate in living cells. For studies of the growth of viruses and for the production of virus components, it is, therefore, necessary to have access to cells cultivated in the laboratory. Cell cultures are also of dominating importance for the isolation of infectious agents in the diagnosis of virus infections. Cell cultures are established by the propagation of dispersed cells. In some cases, such cells may grow in suspension, but most often, they grow as a monolayer on the supporting material. Cultures established by cultivation of the cells that have been released from organ fragments are called primary cell cultures.

Several DL algorithms have been employed to facilitate vegetation forecasting research using Remotely Sensed (RS) data. Vegetation is an extremely important component of our global ecosystem and a necessary indicator of land cover dynamics and productivity. Vegetation phenology is influenced by lifecycle patterns, seasonality and weather conditions, leading to changes in their spectral reflectance. Various relevant information, such as vegetation indices (VIs), can be extracted from RS data for vegetation forecasting. Therefore, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is known as one of the most widely recognized indices for vegetation related studies. This paper reviews the related works on DL-based spatio-temporal vegetation forecasting using RS data over the period between 2015 and 2021. In this review, we present several DL-based studies and discuss DL algorithms and various sources of data that have been used in these studies. The purpose of this work is to highlight the open challenges such as spatio-temporal prediction issues, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, fusion data, hybrid approaches, deep transfer learning and large parameter requirements.

This literature review gathers evidence on the effectiveness of digital health interventions on physical, cognitive, behavioural and psychological outcomes, and Activities of Daily Living in people living with dementia and MCI. METHODS/DESIGN Searches, using nine databases, were run in November 2021. Two authors carried out study selection/appraisal using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Study characteristics were extracted through the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions data extraction form. Data on digital health interventions were extracted through the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist and guide. Intervention effectiveness was determined through effect sizes. Meta-analyses were performed to pool data on intervention effectiveness. RESULTS Twenty studies were included in the review, with a diverse range of interventions, modes of delivery, activities, duration, length, frequency, and intensity. Compared to controls, the interventions produced a moderate effect on cognitive abilities (SMD = 0.36; 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.76; I2 = 61%), and a negative moderate effect on basic ADLs (SMD = -0.40; 95% CI = -0.86 to 0.05; I2 = 69%). Stepping exergames generated the largest effect sizes on physical and cognitive abilities. Supervised training produced larger effect sizes than unsupervised interventions. CONCLUSION Supervised intervention delivery is linked to greatest benefits. A mix of remote and face-to-face delivery could maximise benefits and optimise costs.

Genome sequencing of the strains obtained from Iberian hares with myxomatosis showed these to be distinct from the classical ones that circulated in rabbits since the virus introduction in Europe, in 1952. The main genomic difference in this natural recombinant hare myxoma virus (ha-MYXV) is the presence of an additional 2.8 kb region disrupting the M009L gene and adding a set of genes homologous to the myxoma virus (MYXV) genes M060R, M061R, M064R, M065R and M066R originated in Poxviruses. After the emergence of this recombinant virus (ha-MYXV) in hares, in the summer of 2019, the ha-MYXV was not detected in rabbit surveys, suggesting an apparent species segregation with the MYXV classic strains persistently circulating in rabbits. Recently, a group of six unvaccinated European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus cuniculus) from a backyard rabbitry in South Portugal developed signs of myxomatosis (anorexia, dyspnoea, oedema of eyelids, head, ears, external genitals and anus, and skin myxomas in the base of the ears). Five of them died within 24-48 hr of symptom onset. Molecular analysis revealed that only the recombinant MYXV was present. This is the first documented report of a recombinant hare myxoma virus in farm rabbits associated with high mortality, which increases the concern for the future of both the Iberian hare and wild rabbits and questions the safety of the rabbit industry.

METHODS: This retrospective observational study evaluated ED flow and performance during the junior doctors' strike and compared it with the usual period in a single tertiary-care academic hospital. The outcome variables were defined as ED length of stay, crude mortality, and hospital mortality and adjusted for demographic and clinical parameters. The effect of the doctors' strike on hospital mortality adjusted for demographic and clinical variables was investigated using logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 1,121 and 1,496 patients visited the ED during the strike and control periods (both 17 days), respectively. The care usually provided by four or six physicians, including one specialist, was replaced with that by one or two specialists at any one time.

By using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the envelope (E) glycoprotein of MVE virus, we found that at least three epitopes were less accessible to their corresponding antibodies in the prM-containing MVE virus particles. Amino-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments of the E protein which were reactive with sequence-specific peptide antisera or MAb enabled us to estimate the site of the E protein interacting with the prM to be within amino acids 200 to 327. Since prM-containing viruses were up to 400-fold more resistant to a low pH environment, we conclude that the E-prM interaction might be necessary to protect the E protein from irreversible conformational changes caused by maturation into the acidic vesicles of the exocytic pathway.","output":"The Murray Valley encephalitis virus prM protein confers acid resistance to virus particles and alters the expression of epitopes within the R2 domain of E glycoprotein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a common, opportunistic pathogen which can cause severe disease, particularly in adults 65+. In Switzerland, vaccination is recommended for children under 5 and for adults with health predispositions; vaccination of healthy adults 65+ is not recommended. In 2020 we conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of vaccination records to evaluate pneumococcal vaccination coverage and factors affecting uptake among adults 18-85. We found that nationwide coverage was 4.5% without significant regional differences. Coverage was comparable between men and women and between those aged 18-39 (3.0%) and 40-64 (3.2%). Coverage was significantly higher among those 65-85 (9.6%). While 2.7% of individuals reporting no health predisposition were vaccinated, 14.8% with asthma or chronic pulmonary disease, 27.1% with immunosuppression, 12.9% with diabetes, 11.6% with heart, liver, or kidney disease, and 25.9% with >1 health risk were vaccinated. Adjusted odds of vaccination for all health predispositions except heart, liver, or kidney disease were significantly increased. Among unvaccinated individuals \\"not enough information about the topic\\" and \\"not suggested by a doctor/healthcare provider\\" were the major reasons for abstaining from vaccination. Respondents reporting a health predisposition were significantly less likely to report \\"not at increased risk due to chronic health conditions or age\\" as a reason for not being vaccinated (3.7% versus 29.1%) and were more likely to report willingness to be vaccinated in the future compared to those not-at-risk (54.2% versus 39.9%). Our results indicate that pneumococcal vaccination coverage in Switzerland is low among both individuals 65-85 and among those with predisposing health risks.

METHODS After critical appraisal of the literature, studies were selected with particular attention being paid to meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and large prospective cohort studies. For each item of the perioperative treatment pathway, available English literature was examined and reviewed. RESULTS Patients should be permitted to drink clear fluids up to 2 h before anaesthesia and surgery. Oral carbohydrate loading should be used routinely. All patients may have an individualized plan for fluid and haemodynamic management that matches the monitoring needs with patient and surgical risk. Minimizing the side effects of anaesthetics and analgesics using short-acting drugs with careful perioperative monitoring should be encouraged. Protective ventilation with alveolar recruitment maneuvers is required. Preventive use of a combination with 2-3 antiemetics in addition to propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) is most likely to reduce PONV. While the ideal analgesia regimen remains to be determined, it is clear that a multimodal opioid-sparing analgesic strategy has significant benefits. CONCLUSION Careful evaluation of single patient and planning of the anesthetic care are mandatory to join the ERAS philosophy. Optimal fluid management, use of short-acting drugs, prevention of PONV, protective ventilation, and multimodal analgesia are the cornerstones of the anaesthesia management within ERAS protocols.","output":"Essential elements of anaesthesia practice in ERAS programs."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus has spread across the world and infected millions of people, causing devastating damage to the public health and global economies.

Although the pediatric population makes up a lesser proportion of total COVID-19 patients than adults, the clinical status, age and comorbidities warrant identifying possible prognostic factors associated with disease severity in this group. The current study aimed to explore the incidence of thrombosis, overall outcome, and different hematological and coagulation markers in children with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a single-center prospective study of 43 patients (age < 14 years) with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis recruited from April to August 2020. Data for clinical presentation were collected and analyzed. The samples were tested for different hematological and coagulation markers. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (67.4%) were symptomatic at presentation, with fever being the most common symptom (n = 23, 53.5%), followed by respiratory (n = 5, 11.6%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 3, 7%). Co-morbid conditions were recorded in 26 (60.5%) patients, with malignancy being the commonest (n = 9, 20.9%). In this cohort of patients with age <14 years, hypertension, respiratory symptoms and ABO group-A were significantly associated with pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission during the course of treatment. Patients with elevated FVIII and fibrinogen levels at presentation were more likely to have an extended length of hospital stay (LOS) (PCvalue =0.036 and 0.032 respectively). No thrombotic event was observed in our cohort. D-dimer values were higher (above 0.5 g/mL) in 24 (55.8%) patients at admission. We found an association between high D-dimer and PICU admission and LOS. CONCLUSION: Although we did not observe thrombosis in our cohort, serial measurements of D-dimer and elevated FVIII bear a prognostic value in predicting the need for critical care in children with COVID-19.

Here, we explore the immediate genetic impact of the Ebola outbreak in the western lowland gorilla population. RESULTS: Associations with survivorship were evaluated by utilizing DNA obtained from fecal samples from 16 gorilla individuals declared missing after the outbreak (non-survivors) and 15 individuals observed before and after the epidemic (survivors). We used a target enrichment approach to capture the sequences of 123 genes previously associated with immunology and Ebola virus resistance and additionally analyzed the gut microbiome which could influence the survival after an infection. Our results indicate no changes in the population genetic diversity before and after the Ebola outbreak, and no significant differences in microbial community composition between survivors and non-survivors.

Analyses also revealed a significant severe-PTSD by age interaction on cortical measures with severe-PTSD individuals exhibiting accelerated cortical degeneration with increasing age. Interaction effects of comorbid military-related mTBI within the severe-PTSD group were also observed in several cortical regions. These results suggest that those exhibiting severe PTSD symptomatology have accelerated atrophy that is exacerbated with increasing age and history of mTBI.","output":"Accelerated longitudinal cortical atrophy in OEF/OIF/OND veterans with severe PTSD and the impact of comorbid TBI"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory borne pathogenic beta coronavirus that is the source of a worldwide pandemic and the cause of multiple pathologies in man.

Long-duration confinement studies have found effects on homeostatic biology and neurobehavioral functions, including reduced sleep durations. This study evaluated how confinement due to Covid-19 has impacted health and stress through changes in sleep. METHODS: The Anonymous Survey on Confinement during the COVID-19 Pandemic was available online to any individual 18 years of age through the Penn Medicine Clinical Research webpage on May 14, 2020 and the data presented are through October 24, 2020. The survey collected self-reported information on demographics, the amount and quality of sleep, as well as ratings of health and stress. To determine the impact of confinement on these domains, participants were asked to answer questions relative to pre-confinement levels. To test associations between sleep amounts and sleep quality on health and stress, generalized linear models were used and adjusted for age, sex, and race. RESULTS: N=228 participants (n=180 female [79.0%]) were on average 45.017.1 years of age. During confinement relative to pre-confinement, 41.7% of participants reported sleeping more, 37.3% reported sleeping the same amount, and 21.0% reported less sleep, while 14.0% reported better sleep quality, 47.4% the same, and 38.6% worse quality of sleep relative to pre-confinement. Ratings of worse health during confinement were associated with both reduced sleep amount (=0.695; P<0.0001) and worse sleep quality (=0.532; P=0.0002). Lower stress ratings were associated with increased sleep amount (=0.734; P=0.034), better sleep quality (=1.396; P=0.0002), better health ratings (=-0.079; P=0.0045). Conversely, worse sleep quality was associated with higher stress ratings (=-1.086; P=0.0007). CONCLUSION: The confinement resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the amount and quality of sleep and good sleep may help to reduce stress and maintain health. These findings highlight the need to further examine how long-term confinement influences human health and behavior and warrant examining what factors or life-style behaviors promote resilience to the negative effects of confinement.

Most are found incidentally and rupture in the nonpregnant patient has an approximate 25 to 36% mortality rate. Historically these have been managed with an open surgical approach for resection. METHODS We present the case of a 43-year-old man with a recent episode of bacterial endocarditis with an incidental finding of a large 6-cm splenic artery aneurysm. There was noted to be splenic vein occlusion and multiple splenic infarcts versus abscesses on preoperative imaging. There were concerns that this represented a mycotic aneurysm. He underwent laparoscopic en bloc splenic artery aneurysm resection with splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy with preoperative prophylactic balloon catheter placement. RESULTS His large splenic artery aneurysm was adjacent to the splenic hilum. Due to the splenic vein occlusion, there were large collateral vessels complicating the dissection. Additionally, the aneurysm had dense adhesions to the tail of the pancreas from a desmoplastic reaction. To safely remove the aneurysm, a distal pancreatectomy was included with resection of the spleen. The specimen was successfully removed intact using the laparoscopic approach. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged home on postoperative day 2. Final pathology revealed no evidence of bacterial etiology.

METHODS: A qualitative exploratory online survey was conducted from July-Sept 2020 among purposively chosen final year BDS students (n=150) of three dental colleges of Islamabad during COVID-19 lockdown phase. Semi-structured survey questions were validated and piloted before execution. Thematic analysis was performed, and consensus was built among all authors regarding findings, hence ensuring analytical triangulation. RESULTS: Response rate was 46% (69/150). Twenty sub-themes emerged under three domains of kinesics. Participants told that neutral expressions frequently used by teachers create boring learning environment and hesitation among students to ask questions. A smile of teacher imparts new degree of interest in the subject and gives freedom of expression to the students. On contrary, anger demotivate students, instills fear among them, make them anxious therefore, they are unable to understand lectures which ultimately leads to loss interest in the subject. Use of gestures by teachers creates enjoyable teaching-learning process but movements such as clearing throat or shaky legs produce constant split-second interruption. Moreover, standing posture of teachers bring interest and alertness among students. CONCLUSION: Nonverbal communication can have positive or negative impact on undergraduate medical education. Therefore, teachers may start lecture with a smile and anger should be avoided to produce friendly and healthy learning environment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted across Pakistan in June-July 2020. The study was approved by Ethical Committee, Armed Forces Institute of Dentistry, Rawalpindi (IRB form no.905/Trg-ABP 1K2). A qualitative questionnaire was developed and was shared via different social networks. The questionnaire was closed when 241 responses were received. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis was performed on demographic data. Chi-squared analysis was performed between demographic data and PPE-usage patterns among participants with or without de novo headaches. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare variables with the development of new-onset headaches. Chi-squared test was also performed between demographic data and other factors that may be causing new-onset headaches. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: A total of 241 healthcare workers participated, of which 68 participants (28.2%) reported de novo headaches since the start of the pandemic. Incidence of pre-existing headaches (odds ratio [OR] = 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-0.37; p = 0.049) was associated with new-onset headaches. Post hoc multivariable logistic regression analysis stated that incidence of pre-existing headaches (OR = 1.88; 95% CI: 0.94-3.78; p = 0.75) and age (OR = 2.21; 95% CI: 0.47-10.33; p = 0.36) was independently associated with new-onset PPE-induced headaches but was not statistically significant. Chi-squared analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between other factors (sleep deprivation, emotional stress, etc.) and department of activity, gender, and occupation (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers with previous history of pre-existing headaches were found to be more susceptible to PPE-induced headaches during COVID-19 pandemic.

We assessed the willingness and reasons for COVID-19 vaccine acceptance or hesitancy among PLWH in South Africa. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study consisting of telephone interviews with a randomly selected subset of participants enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study evaluating a decentralized antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery program in South Africa. Questions assessed willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine, concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccination, and overall vaccine confidence. Interviews were conducted between September 2020 and January 2021. We evaluated participant demographics, sources of COVID-19 information, stigma and medical mistrust, uptake of non-pharmaceutical interventions, and socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as potential covariates of willingness to accept vaccination. Results We completed interviews with 213 participants; 153 (72%) were female, median age 35y, and 100 (47%) had completed secondary school. Among the participants, 121 (57%) were willing to accept future vaccination, 46 (22%) were unsure, and 45 (21%) stated they did not intend to be vaccinated. Fear of side effects, reported by 42 (20%), was the most common concern about COVID-19 vaccination. Older age was associated with willingness to accept vaccination (aOR 1.75 for every 10-year increase in age, 95% CI 1.10-2.78, p=0.02), while higher medical mistrust related to COVID-19 (aOR 0.21, 95% CI 0.093-0.45, p<0.001) and use of social media for COVID-19 information (aOR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.84, p=0.02) were associated with lower willingness to accept vaccination. Conclusions In this cohort of PLWH in South Africa, over half were willing to accept COVID-19 vaccination, although a substantial proportion remained unsure or were not willing to be vaccinated. Public health messaging should emphasize the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccination and address misinformation and medical mistrust among PLWH.

The review presents literature data on the efficacy and safety of certain basic anti-inflammatory and genetically engineered drugs in patients with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine is not indicated for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection of any severity due to the lack of therapeutic benefits, the likelihood of a worse prognosis in more severe patients and the development of adverse reactions, especially when used concomitantly with azithromycin. The use of systemic glucocorticoids (GC) in patients with COVID-19 who require oxygen support leads to a decrease in mortality and an improvement in the prognosis of the disease. However, the optimal time of administration, dose and duration of HA administration remain the subject of further research. Despite the encouraging data, it is too early to draw final conclusions about the feasibility of using tocilizumab in COVID-19, since no randomized clinical trials have demonstrated a clear advantage of the drug in terms of reducing mortality.

The working conditions in this sector are very special: constant trips to work in groups, work group execution with little interpersonal distance, group travel, stays and accommodations away from home, meals in restaurants or work canteens, lunch in restaurants or work canteens, etc. Due to all of this, the contagion rate was very high during the pandemic months. Even today, it is still considered one of the most dangerous sectors for these purposes.

While TxA2 stimulates thromboxane prostanoid (TP) receptors, 11-dehydro-TxB2 is a full agonist of the DP2 (formerly known as the CRTh2) receptors for PGD2. Anecdotal experience of using ramatroban, a dual receptor antagonist of the TxA2/TP and PGD2/DP2 receptors demonstrated rapid symptomatic relief of acute respiratory distress and hypoxemia while avoiding hospitalization. AREAS COVERED: Evidence supporting a role for TxA2/TP receptors and PGD2/DP2 receptors in causing rapidly progressive lung injury associated with hypoxemia, a maladaptive immune response and thromboinflammation is discussed. An innovative perspective on dual antagonism of TxA2/TP and PGD2/DP2 receptor signaling as a therapeutic approach in COVID-19 is presented. The paper examines ramatroban, an anti-platelet, immunomodulator and antifibrotic agent for acute and long-haul COVID-19. EXPERT OPINION: Ramatroban, a dual blocker of TP and DP2 receptors, has demonstrated efficacy in animal models of respiratory dysfunction, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and sepsis, and preliminary evidence for rapid relief of dyspnea and hypoxemia in COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, the tolerance of human genomes to losing enhancers has not yet been evaluated. Here we present the catalog of LoF-tolerant enhancers using structural variants from whole-genome sequences. Using a conservative approach, we estimate that individual human genomes possess at least 28 LoF-tolerant enhancers on average. We assessed the properties of LoF-tolerant enhancers in a unified regulatory network constructed by integrating tissue-specific enhancers and gene-gene interactions. We find that LoF-tolerant enhancers tend to be more tissue-specific and regulate fewer and more dispensable genes relative to other enhancers. They are enriched in immune-related cells while enhancers with low LoF-tolerance are enriched in kidney and brain/neuronal stem cells. We developed a supervised learning approach to predict the LoF-tolerance of all enhancers, which achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 98%. We predict 3,519 more enhancers would be likely tolerant to LoF and 129 enhancers that would have low LoF-tolerance.

Differences in the electrostatic potentials of the spike protein RBD (electropositive/basic) and ACE2 receptor (electronegative/acidic) play a key role in both the rapprochement and the recognition of the coronavirus by the cell receptors. Accordingly, point mutations that result in an increase in electropositively charged residues, e.g., arginine and lysine, especially in the RBD of spike proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 variants, could contribute to their spreading capacity by favoring their recognition by the electronegatively charged ACE2 receptors. All SARS-CoV-2 variants that have been recognized as being highly transmissible, such as the kappa (), delta () and omicron (o) variants, which display an enhanced electropositive character in their RBDs associated with a higher number of lysine- or arginine-generating point mutations. Lysine and arginine residues also participate in the enhanced RBDCACE2 binding affinity of the omicron variant, by creating additional salt bridges with aspartic and glutamic acid residues from ACE2. However, the effects of lysine- and arginine-generating point mutations on infectivity is more contrasted, since the overall binding affinity of omicron RBD for ACE2 apparently results from some epistasis among the whole set of point mutations.","output":"How Do Point Mutations Enhancing the Basic Character of the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Affect Their Transmissibility and Infectivity Capacities?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bangladesh is one of the worlds most vulnerable countries for climate change.

Subjects admitted to the adult medicine ward of a tertiary referral hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh from 2008 to 2012 with a diagnosis of one of the six chosen climate-sensitive infectious diseases were enrolled in the study. Climate-related data were collected from the Bangladesh Meteorological Institute. Disease incidence was then analyzed against mean temperature, humidity and average rainfall for the Sylhet region. Statistical significance was determined using Mann-Whitney test, Chi-square test and ANOVA testing. 5033 patients were enrolled (58% male, 42% female, ratio 1.3:1). All six diseases showed highly significant (p = 0.01) rises in incidence between the study years 2008 (540 cases) and 2012 (1330 cases), compared with no significant rise in overall all-cause hospital admissions in the same period (p = 0.19). The highest number of malaria (135), diarrhea (266) and pneumonia (371) cases occurred during the rainy season. On the other hand, the maximum number of enteric fever (408), encephalitis (183) and meningitis (151) cases occurred during autumn, which follows the rainy season. A positive (P = 0.01) correlation was observed between increased temperature and the incidence of malaria, enteric fever and diarrhea, and a negative correlation with encephalitis, meningitis and pneumonia. Higher humidity correlated (P = 0.01) with a higher number of cases of malaria and diarrhea, but inversely correlated with meningitis and encephalitis. Higher incidences of encephalitis and meningitis occurred while there was low rainfall. Incidences of diarrhea, malaria and enteric fever, increased with rainfall, and then gradually decreased. The findings support a relationship between weather patterns and disease incidence, and provide essential baseline data for future large prospective studies.","output":"The association between temperature, rainfall and humidity with common climate-sensitive infectious diseases in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic and especially the lockdowns coming with it have been a disruptive event also for food consumption.

A high-performance liquid chromatography fingerprint of Xinjiaxiangruyin was used to provide an analytical method for quality control. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to measure messenger RNA expression of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-B) p65 in the TLR7 signaling pathway and virus replication in the lungs. Western blotting was used to measure the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-B p65 proteins. Flow cytometry was used to detect the proportion of Th17/T-regulatory cells. RESULTS: Xinjiaxiangruyin effectively alleviated lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice in hot and humid environments. Guizhimahuanggebantang significantly reduced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. The expression of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-B p65 mRNA in lung tissue of WT mice in the normal environment, GZMHGBT group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). In WT mice exposed to the hot and humid environment, the expression levels of TLR7, MyD88, and NF-B p65 mRNA in the XJXRY group were significantly different from those in the virus group.

Treatments include unlicensed swallowed fluticasone via a metered-dose inhaler, proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) and elimination diets, though clinico-histological remission is variable. Orodispersible budesonide (Jorveza) is the first licensed therapy for EoE and has recently been approved by NICE for induction treatment in the UK. This is an audit of the first six months experience of its use in our centre.MethodsPharmacy prescription records were used to identify patients who had been prescribed orodispersible budesonide between September 2020 and March 2021. Case note review was performed to document treatment history, baseline endoscopic and histological findings, clinical and endoscopic response, follow-up and adverse effects.Results27 patients were identified;78% were male, with a mean age of 45 years (range 23-74). 85% were symptomatic with dysphagia and 44% had a history of food bolus impaction. 93% of patients had failed medical therapy before starting orodispersible budesonide and 63% had failed an elimination diet. All patients had a baseline endoscopy prior to starting treatment, with a mode EREFS score of 3. The majority of patients (78%) were treated with a 6 week course and the remainder received 12 weeks, with 6 patients (22%) going on to a maintenance dose.94% of patients had a clinical review within 12 weeks of the original prescription.

High binding affinity between the viral spike protein and host cells hACE-2 receptor has been reported to enhance the viral infection. Thus, the disruption of this molecular interaction will lead to reduction in viral infectivity. This study, therefore, aimed to analyze the inhibitory potentials of two mucolytic drugs; Ambroxol hydrochlorides (AMB) and Bromhexine hydrochlorides (BHH), to serve as potent blockers of these molecular interactions and alters the binding affinity/efficiency between the proteins employing computational techniques. The study examined the effects of binding of each drug at the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and the exopeptidase site of hACE-2 on the binding affinity (G(bind)) and molecular interactions between the two proteins. Binding affinity revealed that the binding of the two drugs at the RBD-ACE-2 site does not alter the binding affinity and molecular interaction between the proteins. However, the binding of AMB (?56.931 kcal/mol) and BHH (?46.354 kcal/mol) at the exopeptidase site of hACE-2, significantly reduced the binding affinities between the proteins compared to the unbound, ACE-2-RBD complex (?64.856 kcal/mol). The result further showed the two compounds have good affinity at the hACE-2 site, inferring they might be potent inhibitors of hACE-2. Residue interaction networks analysis further revealed the binding of the two drugs at the exopeptidase site of hACE-2 reduced the number of interacting amino residues, subsequently leading to loss of interactions between the two proteins, with BHH showing better reduction in the molecular interaction and binding affinity than AMB. The result of the structural analyses additionally, revealed that the binding of the drugs considerably influences the dynamic of the complexes when compared to the unbound complex. The findings from this study suggest the binding of the two drugs at the exopeptidase site reduces the binding effectiveness of the proteins than their binding at the RBD site, and consequently might inhibit viral attachment and entry.","output":"Inhibitory mechanism of Ambroxol and Bromhexine Hydrochlorides as potent blockers of molecular interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human angiotensin-converting Enzyme-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is widely used in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disorders.

CONCLUSION The commercially available NIRS devices showed highly significant differences in local cerebral tissue oxygenation levels, to the extent that the industry cannot agree on uniform and reproducible standards. Therefore, NIRS should only be used for trend measurements in preterm infants.","output":"Comparison of four near-infrared spectroscopy devices shows that they are only suitable for monitoring cerebral oxygenation trends in preterm infants."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: mRNA vaccines are a novel method of eliciting immunity, and play a significant role in the global fight against COVID-19. Anaphylactic reactions are a widespread concern driving vaccine hesitancy due to the serious and potentially fatal nature of anaphylaxis. A quantitative estimation of the risk of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions deriving from mRNA vaccines is of a significant public health importance. Objective: To estimate the relative Reporting Odds Ratio of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions following mRNA vaccination vis-a-vis other vaccinations. Design: Reporting case-control study. Setting: Persons reporting adverse events following vaccination to VAERS whose reports were received between 01 January 2000 and 02 July 2021, inclusive. Patients: Each case of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction was matched with 2.7 unique controls on average, by gender and age rounded to the nearest integer. Measurements: Overall and stratified Reporting Odds Ratios (ROR) were calculated. Stratified contingency tables were tested for homogeneity using the Breslow-Day procedure, and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistics were calculated to test the hypothesis of a ROR of unity. Results: 2,665 cases of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions and 7,125 controls of non-anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reports were compared. The ROR of an anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction was 1.325 (95% CI: 1.212 - 1.448, p < 0.001). The matched set of cases and controls did not reveal inhomogeneity by gender or age band strata, suggesting that these factors have no impact on the likelihood to report an anaphylactic event as opposed to a non-anaphylactic event following mRNA vaccination. A slightly elevated ROR was observed with patients who reported a history of allergic reactions to NSAIDs and/or fluoroquinolone antibiotics. The precise meaning and relevance of this finding remains to be elucidated. Previous reactions to vaccines do not appear to correlate statistically significantly with a higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse effect after mRNA vaccination. Limitations: As a reporting study using data from VAERS, our analysis is subject to under- and overreporting, the extent of each of which is not known with any degree of precision. Since the Emergency Use Authorizations for both mRNA vaccines mandate reporting of all serious adverse events, reporting bias is likely in favour of non- mRNA vaccines, where such reporting is not mandatory in adults. Consequently, this analysis may exaggerate the ROR of anaphylactic and anaphylactoid events associated with mRNA vaccines, which may in reality be significantly lower. Conclusions: mRNA vaccination is not associated with a statistically significant higher risk of reporting an anaphylactic adverse event to VAERS. Anaphylaxis is a serious but very rare complication of all immunisations. No significant increase in reporting odds was found in any age group or gender, nor in most cases of previously known allergic adverse events in relation to vaccines. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence proving the safety and tolerability of mRNA vaccines.","output":"Anaphylactic events in mRNA vaccines: a reporting case-control study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community testing for HIV can reach previously untested populations but is rarely offered in workplaces. Targeting the construction sector could reach workers from high risk populations. METHODS: The RE-AIM framework was used to evaluate Test@Work, a workplace HIV testing intervention for construction workers implemented at 21 events (10 companies) in the UK. Test@Work had three components: 1) an online health toolkit to inform managers about health screening and HIV testing; 2) general health checks; and 3) opt-in HIV consultation and testing. Quantitative data were collected using registration and exit questionnaires with workers (n = 426) and pre/post-event questionnaires with managers (n = 15), with qualitative analysis of free text responses. RESULTS: Reach 426 individuals had health checks. Participants were broadly representative of the UK construction workforce, but with a higher proportion of permanent workers. Most workers reported being in good health but also believed their work had an adverse impact on their health. Effectiveness: 97% of health check participants opted to have a consultation about sexual health (n = 413) and 82% had an HIV test (n = 348), of whom 78% had not previously been tested. All HIV tests were non-reactive. HIV testing at work was considered acceptable by most participants. Participants reported learning new things about their health (74%), said they would make changes as a result (70%) and felt confident of success (median score 8/10). Adoption: Recruitment of companies was challenging and time consuming. Seven of the participating companies were very large, employing over 1000 workers, which is atypical of construction generally. Implementation: All events were completed as planned and were considered successful by all parties. Maintenance: All managers would arrange further events if they were offered them. Six managers incorporated sexual health awareness into their health programmes, but this was not possible for many as health agendas were set centrally by their organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Opt-in HIV testing, when embedded within a general health check, has high uptake and acceptability in the UK construction sector, and reaches individuals at risk for HIV who may not otherwise attend for testing. Cost-effectiveness of this approach is yet to be determined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292002.

This paper: (1) evaluates the idea that a single standard of \\"healthy\\" growth characterizes children under age 5, (2) discusses how variation from this standard is viewed in global health, in human biology and by parents, and (3) explores how views of \\"normal\\" growth shape biomedical and parental responses. METHODS: This paper reviews the anthropological, public health and clinical literature on the nature of child growth and the applicability of World Health Organization Multicenter Growth Reference Study growth standards across contexts. RESULTS: The considerable variability in child growth across contexts makes it unlikely that any one framework, with issues of sample selection and representativeness, can serve as the model of healthy growth. Global health, human biology and parents differ in the emphasis they place on heredity versus environmental context in understanding this variability, but human biologists and parents tend to view a wider range of growth as \\"normal.\\" Since both biomedicine and parents base their care decisions on their perceptions of normal, healthy growth, the comparative framework used has important implications for medical treatment and feeding practices. CONCLUSIONS: A more nuanced approach that incorporates the biology of growth and its association with health outcomes across contexts is critical to identify patterns of healthy growth and to avoid over-reliance on a single standard that may pathologize variability.","output":"What is normal, healthy growth?

Adenosine is released by myocardial, endothelial and immune cells during hypoxia, ischaemia or inflammation, each condition being present in coronary artery disease (CAD). While activation of A2AR improves coronary blood circulation and leads to anti-inflammatory effects, downregulation of A2AR has many deleterious effects during CAD. A decrease in the level and/or activity of A2AR leads to: i) lack of vasodilation, which decreases blood flow, leading to a decrease in myocardial oxygenation and tissue hypoxia; ii) an increase in the immune response, favouring inflammation; and iii) platelet aggregation, which therefore participates, in part, in the formation of a fibrin-platelet thrombus after the rupture or erosion of the plaque, leading to the occurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Inflammation contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, leading to myocardial ischaemia, which in turn leads to tissue hypoxia. Therefore, a vicious circle is created that maintains and aggravates CAD. In some cases, studying the adenosinergic profile can help assess the severity of CAD. In fact, inducible ischaemia in CAD patients, as assessed by exercise stress test or fractional flow reserve, is associated with the presence of a reserve of A2AR called spare receptors. The purpose of this review is to present emerging experimental evidence supporting the existence of this adaptive adenosinergic response to ischaemia or inflammation in CAD. We believe that we have achieved a breakthrough in the understanding and modeling of spare A2AR, based upon a new concept allowing for a new and non-invasive CAD management.","output":"Recent Advances in the Role of the Adenosinergic System in Coronary Artery Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"@#Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumoniacoronavirus disease 2019COVID- 19in 2019it has had a serious impact on the normal work and life of the people because of its strong infectivityhigh susceptibilitylong incubation period and diversified clinical manifestations.

For patients unsuitable for standard open surgery, hybrid repair with debranching of the supra-aortic arteries followed by thoracic endovascular grafting has been shown to be an effective solution. The aim of this study was to report the clinical outcomes of a single-institution experience using hybrid aortic arch repair. METHODS The cases of all consecutive patients submitted to hybrid aortic arch repair between January 2010 and June 2018 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The outcomes of the study were 30-day mortality, perioperative complications, 2-year survival, endoleak, and reintervention rates. RESULTS A total of 35 patients with a median age of 71 years (interquartile range, 62-77 years) were submitted to hybrid aortic arch repair, with a median follow-up of 26.9 months (interquartile range, 2.4-63.6 months). Ten procedures (28.6%) were performed urgently for contained rupture. The most common etiology was degenerative (n = 14 [40.0%]). The proximal landing zones according to the Ishimaru classification were zone 2 in 20 patients (57.1%), zone 1 in 12 patients (34.3%), and zone 0 in 3 patients (8.6%). Early endoleaks were observed in six patients (17.1%), equally distributed between type I and type II. Late endoleaks were identified in 4 of 24 patients (16.7%; type I, n = 2 [8.3%]; type II, n = 1 [4.2%]; and type III, n = 1 [4.2%]). Thirty-day mortality rate was 14.3% (n = 5) with an early death rate of 8.7% (2/23) in elective cases and 30.0% (3/10) in urgent cases (odds ratio [OR], 4.93; confidence interval [CI], 0.68-35.67; P = .128). Except in one patient, 30-day mortality was associated with landing zone 0 or zone 1 (26.7% vs 5.0%; OR, 6.91; CI, 0.68-69.86; P = .141). Three patients (8.6%) suffered a postoperative stroke, and no episodes of spinal cord ischemia were observed. Two-year survival rate was 67.8% (CI, 49.4%-80.8%). Survival rates were significantly lower with increasing age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.10; CI, 1.03-1.18; P = .004), urgent procedure (HR, 4.80; CI, 1.56-14.80; P = .003), zone 0 or zone 1 (HR, 6.34; CI, 1.73-23.18; P = .001), presence of arrhythmia (HR, 3.76; CI, 1.22-11.62; P = .013), and cerebrovascular disease (HR, 4.12; CI, 1.38-12.35; P = .006). A multivariate analysis identified age (HR, 1.11; P = .047) and zone 0 or zone 1 (HR, 4.93; P = .033) as the only predictors for overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS Hybrid aortic arch repair seems to be an alternative for higher risk patients not suitable for open repair, but selection of patients is crucial and may benefit from further refinement. In this study, worse outcomes were seen in older patients and those who required more proximal landing zones.","output":"Clinical outcomes of aortic arch hybrid repair in a real-world single-center experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an emerging contributor to national morbidity and mortality in Saudi Arabia. CVD risk prevention services are limited, particularly with an over-utilised public health sector and an under-utilised and under-resourced primary care sector. Globally, there is evidence that community pharmacists can play a key role in CVD prevention within primary care. However, the perspectives of policymakers and opinion leaders are critical to successful translation of evidence into practice. Thus, the aim was to engage policymakers and professional leaders in discussions about implementing high-quality CVD risk prevention services in community pharmacy. METHODS: Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. All transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS: A total of 23 participants (87% male) from government and non-government sectors were interviewed. Of these, almost 65% had pharmacy qualifications. Limited provision of CVD risks preventative services in primary care was acknowledged by most participants and building community pharmacists capacity to assist in preventive health services was viewed favourably as one way of improving the status quo. The data yielded four key themes: (1) future pharmacy CVD health service models; (2) demonstrable outcomes; (3) professional engagement and advocacy; and (4) implementability. CVD health services roles (health screening, primary and secondary prevention services), pragmatic factors and tiered models of care (minimal, medium, and comprehensive pharmacist involvement) were discussed. The need for humanistic, clinical, and cost effectiveness outcomes to be demonstrated and active involvement of professional bodies were deemed important for such services to be sustainable. Professional pharmacy governance to develop pharmacy careers and workforce, pharmacy curricular reform and ongoing education were posed as key success factors for novel pharmacy roles. Practice policies, standards, and guidelines were seen as required to adhere to stringent quality control for future pharmacy services provision. Participants implementation vision for such services included scalability, affordability, access, adoption and health system reform. Most discussions focused on the need for structural improvement with limited input regarding processes or outcomes required to establish such models. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants favoured pharmacy-based CVD risk prevention services, despite the variability in proposed service models. However, prior to developing such services, support structures at the health system and health professional level are needed as well as building public support and acceptability for pharmacy services.

Despite some controversial reports, the activation of AT2R generally antagonizes the effects of Ang II binding on AT1R. Studying AT2R signaling, function, and its specific ligands in cell culture or animal studies have confirmed its beneficial effects throughout the body.

Promoting the contributions of medical scientists should be a priority given the important roles they are performing in relation to COVID-19 and the demand for medical testing doubling their workloads (COVID-19 National Incident Room Surveillance Team, 2020). This study examines the impact of work on medical scientists and rostering in a context of uncertain work conditions, budget restraints and technological change that ultimately affect the quality of patient care. This study utilises the Job-Demands-Resources theoretical framework (JD-R) to examine the various job demands on medical scientists and the resources available to them. Design/methodology/approach Using a qualitative methodological approach, this study conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with managers and trade union officials and 9 focus groups with 53 medical scientists, making a total 76 participants from four large public hospitals. Findings Due to increasing demands for pathology services, this study demonstrates that a lack of job resources, staff shortages, poor rostering practices such as increased workloads that lead to absenteeism, often illegible handwritten changes to rosters and ineffectual management lead to detrimental consequences for medical scientists' job stress and well-being. Moreover, medical science work is hidden and not fully understood and often not respected by other clinicians, hospital management or the public. These factors have contributed to medical scientists' lack of control over their work and causes job stress and burnout. Despite this, medical scientists use their personal resources to buffer the effects of excessive workloads and deliver high quality of patient care. Originality/value Findings suggest that developing mechanisms to promote sustainable employment practices for medical scientists are critical for the escalating demands in pathology.","output":"Management practices impacting on the rostering of medical scientists in the Australian healthcare sector"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cepharanthine (CEP) is a naturally occurring alkaloid derived from Stephania cepharantha Hayata and demonstrated to have unique anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, immunomodulating, antiparasitic, and antiviral properties. Its therapeutic potential as an antiviral agent has never been more important than in combating COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. Cepharanthine suppresses nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#954;B) activation, lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide (NO) production, cytokine production, and expression of cyclooxygenase; all of which are crucial to viral replication and inflammatory response. Against SARS-CoV-2 and homologous viruses, CEP predominantly inhibits viral entry and replication at low doses; and was recently identified as the most potent coronavirus inhibitor among 2406 clinically approved drug repurposing candidates in a preclinical model. This review critically analyzes and consolidates available evidence establishing CEP's potential therapeutic importance as a drug of choice in managing COVID-19 cases.","output":"Cepharanthine: a review of the antiviral potential of a Japanese-approved alopecia drug in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of this review is to explore and discuss the concept of local food system resilience in light of the disruptions brought to those systems by the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. The discussion, which focuses on low and middle income countries, considers also the other shocks and stressors that generally affect local food systems and their actors in those countries (weather-related, economic, political or social disturbances). The review of existing (mainly grey or media-based) accounts on COVID-19 suggests that, with the exception of those who lost members of their family to the virus, as per June 2020 the main impact of the pandemic derives mainly from the lockdown and mobility restrictions imposed by national/local governments, and the consequence that the subsequent loss of income and purchasing power has on people's food security, in particular the poor. The paper then uses the most prominent advances made recently in the literature on household resilience in the context of food security and humanitarian crises to identify a series of lessons that can be used to improve our understanding of food system resilience and its link to food security in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and other shocks. Those lessons include principles about the measurement of food system resilience and suggestions about the types of interventions that could potentially strengthen the abilities of actors (including policy makers) to respond more appropriately to adverse events affecting food systems in the future.","output":"Resilience of local food systems and links to food security - A review of some important concepts in the context of COVID-19 and other shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Moir lattice in artificially stacked monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials effectively modulates the electronic structures of materials, which is widely highlighted. Formation of the electronic Moir superlattice promises the prospect of uniformity among different moir cells across the lattice, enabling a new platform for novel properties, such as unconventional superconductivity, and scalable quantum emitters. Recently, epitaxial growth of the monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is achieved on the sapphire substrate by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to realize scalable growth of highly-oriented monolayers. However, fabrication of the scalable Moir lattice remains challenging due to the lack of essential manipulation of the well-aligned monolayers for clean interface quality and precise twisting angle control. Here, scalable and highly-oriented monolayers of TMD are realized on the sapphire substrates by using the customized CVD process. Controlled growth of the epitaxial monolayers is achieved by promoting the rotation of the nuclei-like domains in the initial growth stage, enabling aligned domains for further grain growth in the steady-state stage. A full coverage and distribution of the highly-oriented domains are verified by second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy. By developing the method for clean monolayer manipulation, hetero-stacked bilayer (epi-WS2/epi-MoS2) is fabricated with the specific angular alignment of the two major oriented monolayers at the edge direction of 0/  60. On account of the optimization for scalable Moir lattice with a high-quality interface, the observation of interlayer exciton at low temperature illustrates the feasibility of scalable Moir superlattice based on the oriented monolayers.","output":"Scalable Moir Lattice with Oriented TMD Monolayers."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The world is facing a massive burden from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic Governments took the extraordinary step of locking down their own countries to curb the spread of the coronavirus After weeks of severe restrictions, countries have begun to relax their strict lockdown measures However, reopening will not be back to normal Simulation facilities (SF) are training spaces that enable health professionals and students to learn skills and procedures in a safe and protected environment Todays clinicians and students have an expectation that simulation laboratories are part of lifelong healthcare education There is great uncertainty about how COVID-19 will impact future training in SF In particular, the delivery of training activities will benefit of adequate safety measures implemented for all individuals involved This paper discusses how to safely reopen SF in the post-lockdown phase The paper outlines 10 focus points and provides operational tips and recommendations consistent with current international guidelines to reopen SF safely in the post-lockdown phase Considering a variety of national advices and regulations which describe initial measures for the reopening of workplaces as well as international public health recommendations, we provide points of reflection that can guide decision-makers and SF leaders on how to develop local approaches to specific challenges The tips have been laid out taking also into account two main factors: (a) the SF audience, mainly consisting of undergraduate and postgraduate healthcare professionals, who might face exposure to COVID-19 infection, and (b) for many simulation-based activities, such as teamwork training, adequate physical distancing cannot be maintained The planning of future activities will have to be based not only on safety but also on flexibility principles Sharing common methods consistent with national and international health guidelines, while taking into account the specific characteristics of the different contexts and centres, will ultimately foster dissemination of good practices This article seeks to further the conversation It is our hope that this manuscript will prompt research about the impact of such mitigation procedures and measures in different countries","output":"COVID-19 crisis, safe reopening of simulation centres and the new normal: food for thought"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most efficient diagnostic methods for rapid diagnosis of the widespread COVID-19. However, reading CT films brings a lot of concentration and time for doctors. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an automatic CT image diagnosis system to assist doctors in diagnosis. Previous studies devoted to COVID-19 in the past months focused mostly on discriminating COVID-19 infected patients from healthy persons and/or bacterial pneumonia patients, and have ignored typical viral pneumonia since it is hard to collect samples for viral pneumonia that is less frequent in adults. In addition, it is much more challenging to discriminate COVID-19 from typical viral pneumonia as COVID-19 is also a kind of virus. In this study, we have collected CT images of 262, 100, 219, and 78 persons for COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, typical viral pneumonia, and healthy controls, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study of quaternary classification to include also typical viral pneumonia. To effectively capture the subtle differences in CT images, we have constructed a new model by combining the ResNet50 backbone with SE blocks that was recently developed for fine image analysis.

PURPOSE: This living review aims to critically appraise available data about secondary attack rates from people with asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. DATA SOURCES: Medline, EMBASE, China Academic Journals full-text database (CNKI), and pre-print servers were searched from 30 December 2019 to 3 July 2020 using relevant MESH terms. Study selection Studies that report on contact tracing of index cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection in either English or Chinese were included. Data extraction Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality and risk of bias. We calculated the secondary attack rate as the number of contacts with SARS-CoV-2, divided by the number of contacts tested. Data synthesis Of 927 studies identified, 80 were included. Summary secondary attack rate estimates were 1% (95% CI: 0%-2%) with a prediction interval of 0-10% for asymptomatic index cases in 10 studies, 7% (95% CI: 3%-11%) with a prediction interval of 1- 40% for pre-symptomatic cases in 11 studies and 6% (95% CI: 5%-8%) with a prediction interval of 5- 38% for symptomatic index cases in 40 studies. The highest secondary attack rates were found in contacts who lived in the same household as the index case. Other activities associated with transmission were group activities such as sharing meals or playing board games with the index case, regardless of the disease status of the index case. LIMITATIONS: We excluded some studies because the index case or number of contacts were unclear.

We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED). DESIGN: A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. MEASURES: To evaluate the clinical impact, we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity scoreCmatched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics, length of hospital stay, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 676 patients were included, of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls, the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%, P = .007), neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%, P < .001), and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days, P < .001).

AIMS: The present study sought to examine the perceived impact of social lockdown on sexual fantasy and solitary sexual behavior among UK young adults in various living situations. METHODS: A convenience sample of 565 adults aged 18-32 and living in the UK completed anonymous, web-based, study-specific questionnaires between May 14 and 18, 2020, 7 weeks after social lockdown was initiated. Mixed-method analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The study presents qualitative and quantitative data. Criterion variables were measured dichotomously as increases (vs no change) in sexual fantasy and increases (vs no change) in pornography consumption. Predictor variables were living arrangement, relationship status, and postlockdown changes in masturbation and pornography consumption. RESULTS: Of all, 34.3% engaged in more sexual fantasizing during lockdown; women were more likely than men to report this increase. Living context and relationship status were predictors of increased fantasizing. Of all, 30.44% reported an increase in at least one solitary sexual practice. This increase was associated with an increase in sexual fantasizing and also with increased pornography consumption. Nineteen percent of participants reported an increase in pornography use, with men being more likely than women to report this increase. Participants mostly attributed their increases to boredom, increased free time, and replacing partnered sex. CONCLUSION: Shifts in sexual fantasizing and solitary sexual practices were predicted by living arrangements, relationship status, and gender. The present findings suggest that the assessment of sexual fantasy and solitary sexual activities may benefit patients presenting with pandemic-related stress. Although mostly exploratory, significant changes in sexual fantasy and solitary sexual practices were observed.

Our study aims to investigate its relevance in stroke patients. METHODS: We compared the peripheral immunological profile of stroke patients vs. healthy controls. Serum samples were functionally analyzed for their formation and clearance of Neutrophil-Extracellular-Traps. The composition of retrieved thrombi has been immunologically analyzed. RESULTS: Peripheral blood of stroke patients showed significantly elevated levels of DNAse-I (p < 0.001), LDG (p = 0.003), CD4 (p = 0.005) as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17 (p < 0.001), INF- (p < 0.001) and IL-22 (p < 0.001) compared to controls, reflecting a T(H)1/T(H)17 response. Increased counts of DNAse-I in sera (p = 0.045) and Neutrophil-Extracellular-Traps in thrombi (p = 0.032) have been observed in patients with onset time of symptoms longer than 4,5 h. Lower values of CD66b in thrombi were independently associated with greater improvement of NIHSS after mechanical thrombectomy (p = 0.045). Stroke-derived neutrophils show higher potential for Neutrophil-Extracellular-Traps formation after stimulation and worse resolution under DNAse-I treatment compared to neutrophils derived from healthy individuals.

We hypothesize that the transport of contagious COVID-19 patients is feasible and safe for patients and HEMS personnel. METHODS: In this retrospective, single-centre observational study, flight and monitor data were used to calculate the exposure time of the retrieval team to COVID-19 patients. All the crew members (n = 18) were instructed on the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE), dressing and undressing routine using buddy check supervision and cleaning procedures. All the team members were monitored for possible COVID-19 symptoms, as advised by our National Institute for Health and Environment. One month after completing the aeromedical transport all crew members were asked to donate a blood sample which was examined for the presence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: From March 24 to May 25, 2020 the HEMS team transported 67 ventilated critical care COVID-19 patients. The exposure time was 7451 min (124 h and 11 min). One HEMS member reported pneumonia 6 weeks before the start of the patient transport. He tested positive for IgG SARS-CoV-2 by serology testing. We speculate that he was infected before the start of the operation; irrefutable evidence is lacking to support this claim because we did not perform serology testing before this operation started.

This study aimed to determine how many Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries had national data on co-occurring IPV and violent discipline in the same household, how estimates compared and whether violent discipline was significantly associated with IPV. METHODS: A systematic search (following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines) was used to identify which LAC countries had eligible, national co-occurrence data. The most recent eligible dataset in each country was obtained and reanalysed for comparability. Standardised national estimates were produced for prevalence of violent discipline, physical and/or sexual IPV and co-occurrence among ever partnered women of reproductive age living with a child aged 1C14. Bivariate analyses and logistic regressions produced levels and odds ratios (ORs) of physical punishment and verbal aggression in households affected by IPV (past year and before past year) compared with never, adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: Nine countries had eligible datasets. Co-occurring physical punishment with past year IPV ranged from 1.7% (Nicaragua) to 17.5% (Bolivia); and with IPV ever from 6.0% (Nicaragua) to 21.2% (Haiti). In almost all countries, children in IPV affected households experienced significantly higher levels and ORs of physical punishment and verbal aggression, whether IPV occurred during or before the past year. Significant adjusted ORs of physical punishment ranged from 1.52 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.10) in Jamaica to 3.63 (95% CI 3.26 to 4.05) in Mexico for past year IPV; and from 1.50 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.83) in Nicaragua to 2.52 (95% CI 2.30 to 2.77) in Mexico for IPV before past year.

Fatigue during running causes changes in normal gait parameters and increases the risk of injury. To address this problem, wearable sensors have been proposed as an unobtrusive and portable system to measure changes in human movement as a result of fatigue. Recently, a category of wearable devices that has gained attention is flexible textile strain sensors because of their ability to be woven into garments to measure kinematics. This study uses flexible textile strain sensors to continuously monitor the kinematics during running and uses a machine learning approach to estimate the level of fatigue during running. Five female participants used the sensor-instrumented garment while running to a state of fatigue. In addition to the kinematic data from the flexible textile strain sensors, the perceived level of exertion was monitored for each participant as an indication of their actual fatigue level. A stacked random forest machine learning model was used to estimate the perceived exertion levels from the kinematic data. The machine learning algorithm obtained a root mean squared value of 0.06 and a coefficient of determination of 0.96 in participant-specific scenarios. This study highlights the potential of flexible textile strain sensors to objectively estimate the level of fatigue during running by detecting slight perturbations in lower extremity kinematics.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of publicly available survey data (2003-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey). SETTING: Representative sample of U.S. households. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling and married older adults (n=28,356). MEASUREMENT: Two-part models and recycled prediction techniques to estimate the incremental effects of having a spouse with ADRD on annual health care expenditures, while adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic characteristics, and health conditions. RESULTS: Spouses of older adults with ADRD were older, had worse perceived mental health, and had greater difficulties with activities of daily living, compared to older adults with cognitively normal spouses. Spouses of ADRD patients had significantly higher unadjusted total health care expenditures, however their adjusted incremental expenditure was not significantly greater. After controlling for demographics and health status, ADRD spouses had significantly higher home health care expenditures, but significantly lower outpatient expenditures. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that the higher health care expenditures in older adults with ADRD spouses can be attributed to the higher rate of comorbidities, rate of functional limitations, and mean age in this group.

The extraction of saccharide from biomass-based hydrolysate mixtures has become a trend due to low cost and abundant biomass reserves. Compared to conventional methods of fractionation and recovery of saccharides, nanofiltration (NF) has received considerable attention in recent decades because of its high selectivity and low energy consumption and environmental impact. In this review the advantages and challenges of NF based technology in the separation of saccharides are critically evaluated. Hybrid membrane processes, i.e., combining NF with ultrafiltration, can complement each other to provide an efficient approach for removal of unwanted solutes to obtain higher purity saccharides. However, use of NF membrane separation technology is limited due to irreversible membrane fouling that results in high capital and operating costs. Future development of NF membrane technology should therefore focus on improving material stability, antifouling ability and saccharide targeting selectivity, as well as on engineering aspects such as process optimisation and membrane module design.

What stimulates this recognition, which is vital for the success of checkpoint based therapy? A peptide derived from the protein p53 (residues 161C169 or p161) was reported to show this behavior. T cells recognizing this unmodified peptide could be further stimulated in vitro to create effective cancer killing CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes). We hypothesize that the underlying difference may arise from post-translational glycosylation of p161 in normal individuals, likely masking it against recognition by TCR. Defects in glycosylation in cancer cells may allow the presentation of the native peptide.

METHODS: All patients meeting diagnosis criteria for ARDS according to the Berlin Definition, with PCR positive SARS-CoV2 infection and prolonged mechanical ventilation, defined as &#8805;2 days, treated at our ARDS referral center between March and April 2020 were included in a retrospective registry analysis. Complications were detected by manual review of all patient data including respiratory data, imaging studies, and patient files. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients with severe COVID-19 pulmonary failure (Overall characteristics: median age: 61 years, female gender 6, median duration of MV 22 days) were analyzed. Eight patients (40%) developed severe barotrauma during MV (after median 18 days, range: 1-32) including pneumothorax (5/20), pneumomediastinum (5/20), pneumopericard (1/20), and extended subcutaneous emphysema (5/20).

Our research sheds quantitative light on the sociological impact of the pandemic, and enables us to identify key factors in the interplay between the deployment of non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain the spread of an infectious disease and a population's levels of social isolation.","output":"Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: a population study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing stressor that has resulted in millions of deaths and worsening of psychiatric health worldwide. However, we lack knowledge regarding the influence of specific behavioral and neural factors that may alleviate the impact of the pandemic on mental health. Thus, we assessed whether pre-pandemic resilient coping strategy engagement and frontolimbic circuitry influence depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. Methods: In 72 young adults (72.2% female, mean age 24 years), we assessed depression and anxiety symptoms (BDI and SCARED-A), resilient coping strategies (CD-RISC), and resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of frontolimbic circuitry using fMRI. We conducted general linear models to test preregistered hypotheses that 1) less resilient coping pre-pandemic and 2) weaker frontolimbic FC pre-pandemic would predict more severe symptoms during the pandemic;and 3) coping would interact with FC to predict symptoms during the pandemic. Results: Anxiety symptoms worsened during the pandemic as compared to pre-pandemic, while depression symptoms improved (ps<0.001). Less resilient coping predicted more severe depression symptoms during the pandemic (p=0.023). Weaker frontolimbic FC pre-pandemic predicted more severe obsessive-compulsive (p=0.015) and separation anxiety symptoms (p=0.040) during the pandemic. Resilient coping interacted with frontolimbic FC to predict depression (p<0.001), obsessive-compulsive (p=0.041), panic (p=0.017), and generalized anxiety (p=0.027) symptoms during the pandemic. Conclusions: Less coping strategy engagement and weaker frontolimbic FC may represent risk factors for poor psychiatric health during the pandemic. This research may inform efforts to ameliorate the adverse psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as subsequent global stressful events.

The aim of the study was to explore the lung recruitability, individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and prone position in COVID-19-associated severe ARDS. Methods: Twenty patients who met the inclusion criteria were studied retrospectively (PaO(2)/FiO(2) 68.0  10.3 mmHg). The patients were ventilated under volume-controlled mode with tidal volume of 6 mL/kg predicted body weight. The lung recruitability was assessed via the improvement of PaO(2), PaCO(2), and static respiratory system compliance (C(stat)) from low to high PEEP (5C15 cmH(2)O). Patients were considered recruitable if two out of three parameters improved. Subsequently, PEEP was titrated according to the best C(stat). The patients were turned to prone position for further 18C20 h. Results: For recruitability assessment, average value of PaO(2) was slightly improved at PEEP 15 cmH(2)O (68.0  10.3 vs. 69.7  7.9 mmHg, baseline vs. PEEP 15 cmH(2)O; p = 0.31).

Given the novelty and scale of the disease, information surrounding COVID-19 has been marked by considerable uncertainty and confusion. Although various factors have been associated with COVID-19 distress, little is known about the relations between levels of intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety symptoms and behaviors. This cross-sectional study sought to examine potential correlates and pathways between anxiety and precautionary behaviors with the two levels of IU: prospective and inhibitory. Individuals from NYC (N = 99) completed an online survey through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Findings revealed that fear of COVID-19 accounts for associations between prospective IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors, whereas precaution adherence accounts for associations between prospective IU and reduced anxiety symptoms and behaviors. In addition, precaution adherence accounts for associations between inhibitory IU and greater anxiety symptoms and behaviors. The results shed light on ways in which variations in IU may be associated with anxiety symptoms and behaviors in the context of COVID-19 and future pandemic scenarios.","output":"Uncertainty in the Time of Corona: Precautionary Adherence, Fear, and Anxiety in New York City During the COVID-19 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To shorten the time required to find effective new drugs, like antivirals, a key parameter to consider is membrane permeability, as a compound intended for an intracellular target with poor permeability will have low efficacy.

Methods: Between January 2014 and August 2020, 6 cases of traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis with defect deformities were treated by simultaneous treatment of near-arc bone transport by Ilizarov technique. The patients were all male; aged from 40 to 61 years (mean, 49.3 years). The disease duration was 2-72 months, with an average of 16.1 months. All patients were traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis, including 4 cases of falling from height, 1 case of traffic accident injury, and 1 case of crushing injury. The infection affected the talar-heel joint in 4 cases, and the talar-heel joint was fused or partially fused in 2 cases. After the external fixator was removed, the Maryland foot scoring system was used to evaluate the foot function, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) ankle-hindfoot function scoring system was used to evaluate the ankle-hindfoot function, and were compared with the preoperative scores. Results: All patients were followed up 1.5-26.0 months, with an average of 16.3 months. All incisions healed by first intention, no recurrence of infection occurred, and no surgical intervention such as second-stage bone grafting and fusion was performed. Five cases of calcaneal osteomyelitis with defect deformity underwent one-stage osteotomy and slipped, 1 case of the original bone mass after debridement after infection of calcaneal fractures slipped directly. The bone sliding time was 28-62 days, with an average of 38.7 days; the sliding distance was 3.1-5.2 cm, with an average of 3.6 cm. In 1 patient, due to the short follow-up time, the calcaneal slip bone had not healed, the external fixator had not been removed (not involved in clinical scoring), but the foot shape, reexamination of X-ray films and with frame walking were satisfactory. The time with external fixator was 6-8 months, with an average of 6.5 months in the other 5 cases. After removing the external fixator, the foot returned to three-point weight-bearing, and the longitudinal arch was recovered to varying degrees, and there was no obvious varus valgus. The Maryland score after removal of the external fixator was 80.84.7, which was significantly higher than that before operation (33.64.3) ( t=-35.782, P=0.000), 3 cases were excellent and 2 cases were good; the median AOFAS ankle-hindfoot score was 84, the interquartile range was (79, 86), which was significantly improved when compared with the preoperative score [the median score was 33.5, the interquartile range was (21.3, 37.5)] ( Z=-2.023, P=0.043), 4 cases were excellent and 1 case was good. Among them, pain, walking distance, getting rid of walking aids, going up and down stairs, deformity, etc. were significantly improved when compared with preoperative ones. Mobility such as subtalar and hock joints were poor or disappeared. Conclusion: Simultaneous treatment of traumatic calcaneal osteomyelitis and defect deformity with near-arc bone transport by Ilizarov technique can optimize the operation method, reduce the number of operations, and try to simulate the original shape of the calcaneus.

Recent data have identified new indications for VEGFi in EOC: repeated exposure to VEGFi in the first- and then second-line treatment has sustained clinical efficacy; combinations of VEGFi with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) have proven effective as first-line or second-line maintenance regimens. However, recent trial data have not shown improved outcomes with combinations of VEGFi and immune checkpoint inhibitors. There remains a critical need to optimise patient selection for these effective yet somewhat toxic and expensive treatments.

Understanding the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different geographical areas is essential to improve the prognosis of COVID-19 patients and slow the spread of the disease. AIM: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics and main therapeutic strategy for confirmed COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Liaoning Province, China. METHODS: Adult patients (n = 65) with confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled in this retrospective study from January 20 to February 29, 2020 in Liaoning Province, China. Pharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens were collected from the patients for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nucleic acid. Patient demographic information and clinical data were collected from the medical records. Based on the severity of COVID-19, the patients were divided into nonsevere and severe groups. All patients were followed until March 20, 2020. RESULTS: The mean age of 65 COVID-19 patients was 45.5  14.4 years, 56.9% were men, and 24.6% were severe cases.

Methods We compared specific antibody production against the S1 subunit and the RBD of the spike protein, the whole virion of SARS-CoV-2, and monitored neutralizing antibodies in sera and saliva of 104 BNT162b2 vaccinees and 57 individuals with natural SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Results Vaccinated individuals showed higher S1-IgG antibodies in comparison to COVID-19 patients, followed by a significant decrease 3 months later. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were poorly correlated with initial S1-IgG levels, indicating that these might largely be non-neutralizing. In contrast, RBD IgGAM was strongly correlated to nAbs, suggesting that RBD-IgGAM is a surrogate marker to estimate nAb concentrations after vaccination. The protective effect of vaccine- and infection-induced nAbs was found reduced towards B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 VOCs. NAb titers are significantly higher after third vaccination compared to second vaccination. In contrast to COVID-19 patients, no relevant levels of RBD specific antibodies were detected in saliva samples from vaccinees. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that BNT162b2 vaccinated individuals generate relevant neutralizing antibodies, which begin to decrease within three months after immunization and show lower neutralizing potential to VOCs as compared to the original Wuhan virus strain. A third booster vaccination provides a stronger nAb antibody response than the second vaccination. The systemic vaccine does not seem to elicit readily detectable mucosal immunity.","output":"Evaluation of the systemic and mucosal immune response induced by COVID-19 and the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine for SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 infections in childcare and school settings potentially bear occupational risks to educational staff. We analyzed data derived from voluntary, PCR-based screening of childcare educators and teachers attending five testing sites in Berlin, Germany, between June and December 2020. Within seven months, 17,491 tests were performed (4,458 educators, 13,033 teachers). Participants were largely female (72.9%), and median age was 41 years. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence was 1.2% (95%CI, 1.1-1.4%). Prevalence in educational staff largely resembled community incidence until the start of the second pandemic wave in mid-September 2020, when an unsteady prevalence plateau was reached. Then, infection prevalence in teachers (1.2% [95%CI, 0.8-1.8%]) did not significantly differ from the population prevalence (0.9% [0.6-1.4%]) but it was increased in educators (2.6% [1.6-4.0%]; aOR, 1.6 [1.3-2.0]). Irrespective of occupation, those that reported contact to a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case outside of work had increased risk of infection (aOR, 3.0 [95%CI, 1.5-5.5]). In a step-wise backwards selection, the best set of associated factors with SARS-CoV-2 infection involved age, occupation, and calendar week. These results are in line with findings that teachers do not bear an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while childcare educators do. Infection control and prevention measures need to be strengthened in child care settings to further reduce respective occupational hazards. At the same time, the private environment appears to be the main source of SARS-CoV-2 infection for educational staff.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 screening prevalence in educational staff in Berlin, Germany, June-December 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Background SARS-CoV-2 is a rapidly spreading coronavirus with a high incidence of severe upper respiratory infection that first presented in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Many factors have been identified as risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, with much attention being paid to body mass index (BMI), but little investigation has been done to investigate dysregulation of lipid profiles and diabetes, which are often comorbid in high BMI patients. Objective This study seeks to describe the impact of BMI, HDL, LDL, ApoA, ApoB, triglycerides, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), diabetes, alcohol and red wine intake on SARS-CoV-2 risk in UK Biobank (UKB) study participants. Methods We examined the effect of BMI, lipid profiles, diabetes and alcohol intake on the risk of testing positive for SARS-Cov-2 among 9,005 UKB participants tested for SARS-CoV-2 from March 16 through June 29, 2020. Logistic regression was performed on the target variables controlling for age, sex and ancestry. Results BMI, Type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05) while HDL and ApoA were associated with decreased risk (p < 0.001). Additionally, red wine intake was associated with reduced SARS-CoV-2 risk (p < 0.05). LDL, ApoB and triglyceride levels were not found to be significantly associated with increased risk. Conclusion Elevated HDL and ApoA levels and alcohol intake, specifically red wine intake, were associated with reduced risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, while type II diabetes and HbA1c were associated with increased risk. The effects of alcohol, type II diabetes and HbA1c levels may be indirect, mediated in part through regulation of HDL levels. In summary, our study corroborates the emerging picture that high HDL levels may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Baseline Cardiometabolic Profiles and SARS-CoV-2 Risk in the UK Biobank"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the World Health Organization launched the Immunization Agenda 2030: A Global Strategy to Leave No One Behind, which prioritizes high equitable immunization coverage at the national level and in all districts.

Todays pandemic initiates the integration of the ideas of scientists around the world to study and combat the aggressive pathogen COVID-19. Under current circumstances, we are losing informal communication as one of the essential aspects of scientific progress. This situation seriously changes the paradigm of the development of scientific thought, reducing communication to formal things. Scientific discoveries occur just when thought goes beyond the framework. Thus, the pandemic poses a comprehensive threat to society. To date, the uncontrolled situation of the pandemic is associated with a multifaceted behavioral factor of the virus. The virus acts differently on different continents of the planet and within the same geographical area, which makes its symptoms somewhat arbitrary. This pushes to an entirely new, information-wave level of understanding of the virus. The penetration of virions into the cell is the transfer of information, in this case, foreign to it and damaging. The interaction of the virtual signal with the information receiver is evident, and the virion itself is considered a virtual genetic signal, which becomes real only when received by a cell with an adequate code. The nature of the information contained in viruses is essential for determining the formation of diseases. These may be purely functional disorders, inflammatory (regardless of their location), or other processes. All of the above is determined based on the vibration frequencies of the virusCorganism system. Viruses, like other biological objects, are characterized by both systemic biological properties and purely physical ones. If we consider the human body from the standpoint of physical properties, there is no division between the bodys internal environment and the external one. There is a single environment engulfed in cyclic, oscillatory processes, the characteristics of which are the same everywhere: in a person, in the movement of planets, on the Sun, and in interplanetary space. Throughout evolutionary history, both the virus and the organism are formed based on mutual environmental fluctuations. The formation of a specific oscillatory system, based on general physical considerations, ends when the oscillations of all system components are coordinated with each other. Thus, having information about the vibration frequencies of viral fragments, we can artificially select such a protein, the vibration frequency of which corresponds to the rhythm of the virus fragment. Such a protein could bind to the virus, preventing it from infecting healthy cells.","output":"Resonance Interaction of the Protein Fragment of the Viral Capsid and the RNA Fragment in the Body Cell"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Secondary infections (SI) in COVID-19 have been documented from 3.6% to 72% in various studies with mortality ranging from 8.1% to 57.6%.

The study was undertaken for hospitalized adult patients during 1st June 2020 to 30th November 2020, with laboratory proven COVID-19 infection and secondary infection. RESULTS: Out of the total 2338 number of patients, only 265 (11.3%) patients were investigated for microbiological identification of SI. Male gender was predominant (76.8%) and the mean age was 53.7  17.8 years. Only 3.5% (82/2338) of patients were having microbiologically confirmed (bacterial or fungal) SI. The overall mortality was 50.9% (54/82) with a differential mortality of 88.8% (48/54) in high-priority areas and 21.4% (6/28) in low-priority areas.

The aim of this study is to evaluate how the SPHERE technology can measure aspects of Parkinsons disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a small-scale feasibility and acceptability study during which 12 pairs of participants (comprising a person with Parkinsons and a healthy control participant) will stay and live freely for 5 days in a home-like environment embedded with SPHERE technology including environmental, appliance monitoring, wrist-worn accelerometry and camera sensors. These data will be collected alongside clinical rating scales, participant diary entries and expert clinician annotations of colour video images. Machine learning will be used to look for a signal to discriminate between Parkinsons disease and control, and between Parkinsons disease symptoms on and off medications. Additional outcome measures including bradykinesia, activity level, sleep parameters and some activities of daily living will be explored.

Probe regions included full-length spike ectodomain as well as various subregions, and we also designed mutants to eliminate recognition of the ACE2 receptor. Yields of biotin-labeled probes from transient transfection ranged from ~0.5 mg/L for the complete ectodomain to >5 mg/L for several subregions. Probes were characterized for antigenicity and ACE2 recognition, and the structure of the spike ectodomain probe was determined by cryo-electron microscopy. We also characterized antibody-binding specificities and cell-sorting capabilities of the biotinylated probes. Altogether, structure-based design coupled to efficient purification and biotinylation processes can thus enable streamlined development of SARS-CoV-2 spike-ectodomain probes.

This study aimed to develop and validate a T2-weighted imaging (T2WI)-based radiomics model and explore independent risk factors (factors with statistical significance in both univariate and multivariate analyses) of middle or deep stromal invasion in early stage CC. METHODS: Between March 2017 and March 2021, a total of 234 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics IB1-IIA1 CC patients were enrolled and randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 188) and a validation cohort (n = 46). The radiomics features of each patient were extracted from preoperative sagittal T2WI, and key features were selected. After independent risk factors were identified, a combined model and nomogram incorporating radiomics signature and independent risk factors were developed. Diagnostic accuracy of radiologists was also evaluated. RESULTS: The maximal tumor diameter (MTD) on magnetic resonance imaging was identified as an independent risk factor. In the validation cohort, the radiomics model, MTD, and combined model showed areas under the curve of 0.879, 0.844, and 0.886.

Tensions in the supply of mitomycin have emerged in France since late 2019. The ANSM in agreement with the AFU proposed to use epirubicin, already available in other European countries in this indication. The objective of our study was to report the initial French experience with the use of epirubicin in adjuvant treatment of NMIBC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We undertook a French multicenter retrospective descriptive study to collect, from the centers of the members of the CC-AFU bladder, the clinico-pathological data of the patients, the indications, the modalities of use (dose, indication, circuit in the pharmacy) and the tolerance data of epirubicin. The impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on treatment interruptions was also identified. Of the 20 centers contacted, 5 (25%) had implemented the epirubicin administration protocol developed by the CC-AFU bladder subcommittee. A total of 61 patients were treated with endovesical instillations of epirubicin between November 2019 and November 2020 for NMIBC at a single dose of 50mg. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients (mean age 67 years, 64-77 years) were treated with epirubicin, of which 45 (73.8%) were male. The patients had intermediate-risk NMIBC in 88.5%, the rest had high-risk disease. Induction therapy without or with maintenance was planned for 48 (78.7%) and 13 patients (21.3%), respectively. The preparation and administration of epirubicin was similar to that of mitomycin: central pharmacy preparation for same-day dispensing with immediate outpatient instillation. Unlike mitomycin, urinary alkalinization was not required. Of the 498 total instillations scheduled, 345 were performed (69.3%). The COVID-19 epidemic significantly impacted epirubicin delivery: one patient could not start treatment (1.6%), 8 patients (13.1%) had to discontinue it permanently;the rest of the patients underwent delayed instillations (18%). Other causes of discontinuation included infectious complications (9.8%). No major toxicities were reported. CONCLUSION: The implementation of an adjuvant epirubicin treatment protocol presented a good feasibility with low toxicity, without modifying the organization of the patients' care pathway.

The new assay, the SAMBA (simple amplification-based assay) Flu duplex test, is a dipstick-based molecular assay developed to provide a simple, accurate, and cost-effective solution for the diagnosis of influenza A/B viruses intended for near-patient testing. The test presents an alternative format of influenza virus molecular testing that utilizes isothermal amplification and visual detection of nucleic acid on a test strip. The entire test procedure (extraction, amplification, and detection) is integrated into an enclosed semiautomated system. Analytically, the SAMBA Flu duplex test detects 95 and 85 copies of viral genomes for influenza A and B viruses, respectively, with no cross-reactivity observed against other common respiratory pathogens. The clinical performance was established by blind testing of 328 nasal/throat and nasopharyngeal swab specimens from the United Kingdom and Belgium and comparing the results with the quantitative reverse transcription-PCR method routinely used in two public health laboratories. The SAMBA Flu duplex test showed a clinical sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 97.9% for influenza virus A and 100% and 100% for influenza virus B. The test provides a new technology that could facilitate simple and timely identification of influenza virus infection, potentially resulting in more efficient control measures.","output":"Duplex Molecular Assay Intended for Point-of-Care Diagnosis of Influenza A/B Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Poultry is an attractive enterprise among urban smallholder farming households and is the most common livestock reared for home consumption and sale.

Soon after approval, severe allergic reactions to the mRNA\\\\based vaccines that resolved after treatment were reported. Regulatory agencies from the European Union, Unites States and the United Kingdom agree that vaccinations are contraindicated only when there is an allergy to one of the vaccine components or if there was a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. This position paper of the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) agrees with these recommendations and clarifies that there is no contraindication to administer these vaccines to allergic patients who do not have a history of an allergic reaction to any of the vaccine components. Importantly, as is the case for any medication, anaphylaxis may occur after vaccination in the absence of a history of allergic disease. Therefore, we provide a simplified algorithm of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of severe allergic reactions and a list of recommended medications and equipment for vaccine centres. We also describe potentially allergenic/immunogenic components of the approved vaccines and propose a workup to identify the responsible allergen. Close collaboration between academia, regulatory agencies and vaccine producers will facilitate approaches for patients at risks, such as incremental dosing of the second injection or desensitisation.

Especially elderly persons are more frequently and severely affected by infectious diseases and they display distinct features with respect to clinical presentation and treatment. Although vaccinations are considered a vital medical procedure for preventing morbidity and mortality caused by infectious diseases, the protective effect of vaccinations is abrogated in elderly persons. This is due to a decline in the functions of the immune system referred to as immunosenescence. The first part of this chapter will therefore summarize the status quo of the efficacy of vaccines in preventing morbidity and mortality caused by typical infectious diseases in the elderly, such as influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis. The second part will then elucidate the underlying age-related mechanisms which may contribute to the decreased efficacy of vaccines.

Prior work has demonstrated the positive impact of these groups. After face-to-face TCMLH groups were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, VHA facilities rapidly implemented virtual (video-based) TCMLH groups. OBJECTIVE: We sought to understand staff perspectives on the feasibility, challenges, and advantages of conducting TCMLH groups virtually. METHODS: We completed semi-structured telephone interviews with 35 staff members involved in the implementation of virtual TCMLH groups across 12 VHA facilities and conducted rapid qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts. RESULTS: Holding TCMLH groups virtually was viewed as feasible. Factors that promoted the implementation included use of standardized technology platforms amenable to delivery of group-based curriculum, availability of technical support, and adjustments in facilitator delivery style. The key drawbacks of the virtual format included difficulty maintaining engagement and barriers to relationship-building among participants. The perceived advantages of the virtual format included the positive influence of being in the home environment on Veterans reflection, motivation, and self-disclosure, the greater convenience and accessibility of the virtual format, and the virtual groups role as an antidote to isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Faced with the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, VHA pivoted by rapidly implementing virtual TCMLH groups. Staff members involved in implementation noted that delivering TCMLH virtually was feasible and highlighted both challenges and advantages of the virtual format. A virtual group-based program in which participants set and pursue personally meaningful goals related to health and well-being in a supportive environment of their peers is a promising innovation that can be replicated in other health systems.","output":"Lessons Learned From VHAs Rapid Implementation of Virtual Whole Health Peer-Led Groups During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Staff Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is currently delaying the process of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) eradication, since most of the chronic diseases are neglected. Thus, there is a need for alternative programs for HCV therapy implementation and disease monitoring. Our aim was to provide a multidisciplinary approach, so that HCV-infected patients from distant locations may benefit from HCV antivirals during the COVID-19 outbreak and within the lockdown period in Romania. Previously diagnosed HCV patients willing to participate in this telemedicine pilot study were included. Patient characteristics and medical adherence were assessed and compared to the year preceding the pandemic. We proposed a multidisciplinary approach by using a telemedicine program for HCV therapy monitoring. Patients also received a satisfaction questionnaire after delivering the sustained virologic response (SVR) result. A total of 41 patients agreed to participate in this study. The medication adherence was 100% for patients included in the telemedicine group, with a statistically significant difference from the medication adherence of the patients treated in 2019. The satisfaction item score was 4.92 out of 5 and our results (r = -0.94, p &lt; 0.0001) suggested that older patients embraced the telemedicine program less, but with the same success in terms of SVR (100%) and medication adherence (100%). Our pilot study offers the first example of a telemedicine program in Romania for HCV therapeutic management.

Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) initiated organized CRC screening in 2006 using annual mailed fecal immunochemi-cal test (FIT) screening and opportunistic colonoscopy, with high screening rates. Public health guidance related to the COVID-19 pandemic led to elective colonoscopies and mailed FIT outreach being paused in March 2020. This study evaluated the impact of the pandemic on CRC screening at KPNC. METHODS: For January-December 2019 and January-October 2020, we evaluated: the KPNC screening-eligible population aged 50-75;those up to date with screening due to colonoscopy;eligible for a FIT;mailed a FIT kit;completed a FIT;completed a follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT;completed a colonoscopy unrelated to a positive FIT;and up to date with screening by end of follow-up (i.e., 2019 and end of October 2020, respectively). RESULTS: There were 913,873 and 941,763 eligible members in 2019 and 2020;151,252 (16.6%) and 150,407 (16.0%) were up to date with screening due to prior colonoscopy, leaving 762,621 and 791,356 eligible for FIT, respectively. Compared to 2019, when FIT kits were mailed to 627,260 of 762,621 (82.3%) FIT-eligible members, FIT kits were mailed to 521,239 of 791,356 (65.9%) eligible members by the end of October 2020, with mailings ongoing. Declines in FIT mailings occurred in March-May 2020 but rebounded quickly thereafter (Fig 1a). FIT kits were returned by 504,152 of 762,621 (66.1%) members in 2019, and 365,972 of 791,356 (46.2%) members through October 2020, with lower returns in March-June 2020 (Fig 1b). In 2019, 11,119 of 15,402 (72.2%) FIT-positive patients received a follow-up colonoscopy by year end, and through October 2020, 6,856 of 10,922 (62.8%) received a follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT (Fig 1c). Another 14,420 of 762,621 (1.9%) and 9,902 of 791,356 (1.3%) members completed a colonoscopy during 2019 and 2020, respectively (Fig 2). By the end of 2019, 665,541 of 913,873 (72.8%) were up to date with screening, and through October 2020, 522,215 of 941,763 (55.5%) were up to date with screening (Fig 2). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in temporary delays in the mailing and return of FITs;and a reduction in colonoscopies performed, due, in part, to patient reluctance to respond to FIT outreach or complete follow-up colonoscopy during the pandemic. Also, fewer individuals were up to date with screening, although outreach continues through December 2020. The organized mailed FIT program allowed for the rapid resumption of outreach;however, follow-up is needed to assess the impact of screening delays on CRC outcomes and to identify ways to improve adherence with FIT screening, including colonoscopy follow-up after a positive FIT.(Figure presented) (Figure presented) (Figure presented) (Figure presented)","output":"Sa002 IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON A LARGE ORGANIZED COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM BASED ON FECAL IMMUNOCHEMICAL TESTING AND OPPORTUNISTIC COLONOSCOPY"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is a global threat associated to neurological disorders in adults and microcephaly in children born to infected mothers.

ZIKV-infected Vero CCL-81 cells were treated with samples at non-cytotoxic concentrations, determined by MTT and LDH assays. One third of the extracts elicited concentration-dependent anti-ZIKV effect, with viral loads reduction from 0.4 to 3.8 log units. The 12 active extracts were tested on ZIKV-infected SH-SY5Y cells and significant reductions of viral loads (in log units) were induced by Maytenus ilicifolia (4.5 log), Terminalia phaeocarpa (3.7 log), Maytenus rigida (1.7 log) and Echinodorus grandiflorus (1.7 log) extracts. CC 50 of these extracts in Vero cells were higher than in SH-SY5Y lineage.

However, unlike the measurement of photosynthetic parameters, such as the maximum carboxylation capacity, where standard methods (e.g., CO2 response or ACi curves) are widely accepted, a consensus method for empirically measuring parameters representing stomatal response has not yet emerged. Most models of stomatal response to environment represent stomatal conductance as being bounded by a lower intercept parameter (g0), and linearly scaled based on a multivariate term described by the stomatal slope parameter (g1). Here we employ the widely used Unified Stomatal Optimization model, to test whether g1 and g0 parameters are impacted by the choice of measurement method, either on an intact branch, or a cut branch segment stored in water. We measured paired stomatal response curves on intact and excised branches of a hybrid poplar clone (Populus deltoides Bartr. x Populus nigra L. OP367), measured twice over a diurnal period. We found that predawn branch excision did not significantly affect measured g0 and g1 when measured within 4 h of excision. Measurement in the afternoon resulted in significantly higher values of g1 and lower values of g0, with values changing by 55% and 56% respectively. Excision combined with afternoon measurement resulted in a marked effect on parameter estimates, with g1 increasing 89% from morning to afternoon and a 25% lower g1 for cut branches than those measured in situ. We also show that in hybrid poplar the differences in parameter estimates obtained from plants measured under different conditions can directly impact models of canopy function, reducing modeled transpiration by 18% over a simulated 12.5-hour period. While these results are only for a single isohydric woody species, our findings suggest that stomatal optimality parameters may not remain constant throughout the day.","output":"Late day measurement of excised branches results in uncertainty in the estimation of two stomatal parameters derived from response curves in Populus deltoides Bartr. x Populus nigra L."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Obtaining vascular access is one of the key procedures performed in patients in emergency settings. AIMS: The study was conducted as a meta-analysis and a systematic review and aimed to address the following question: which intravascular access method should be used in patients with COVID-19 when wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE)? METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized controlled trials that compared intravascular access methods used by operators wearing full level C PPE. We evaluated procedure duration and the success rate of intraosseous and peripheral intravenous accesses. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials were included in quantitative synthesis. The use of PPE during intravascular access procedures had an impact on procedure duration in the case of intraosseous access (mean difference [MD], 11.69; 95% CI, 6.47-16.92; P <0.001), as well as reduced the success rate of intraosseous access by 0.8% and intravenous access by 10.1%.

Because the tangent line between the outer plates of the anterior and posterior margin of the foramen magnum was not accurately located on the X-ray film, the angle formed by the line between the saddle dorsal slope and the center point of the anterior and posterior nodule with a clear display was selected as the measurement method of the angle between the atlanto-occipital joints. The results showed that the lateral cervical curvature of the VCS group was 0.43  0.51, and the lateral cervical curvature of the CSR group was 0.46  0.49, both of which were significantly lower than the normal value (1.2  0.5 cm).

In renal transplant recipients, some beneficial effect of an elective vascular access (VA) ligation was observed in patients with a high AVF flow. However, this strategy is not widely accepted and is in contradiction to the rule of vasculature preservation for possible future access. The aim of our study is to elucidate the vascular access function and VA perspective in the kidney transplantation (KTx) population. Materials and Methods: KTx patients with a stable graft function were recruited to participate in this single center observational study (NCT04478968). The measurement of VA flow and vessel mapping for future vascular access was performed by a color Doppler ultrasound. The study group included 99 (63%) males and 58 (37%) females; the median age was 57 (IQR 48C64) years. The median time from the transplantation to the baseline visit was 94 (IQR 61C149) months. Median serum creatinine concentration was 1.36 (IQR 1.13C1.67) mg/dl. Results: Functioning VA was found in 83 out of 157 (52.9%) patients. The sites were as follows: snuffbox in six (7.2%), wrist in 41 (49.4%), distal forearm in 18 (21.7%), middle or proximal forearm in eight (9.6%), upper-arm AV graft in one (1.2%), and upper-arm AVFs in nine (10.8%) patients, respectively. Blood flow ranged from 248 to 7,830 ml/min; the median was 1,134 ml/min. From the transplantation to the study visit, 66 (44.6%) patients experienced access loss. Spontaneous thrombosis was the most common, and it occurred in 60 (90.9%) patients. The surgical closure of VA was performed only in six (4%) patients of the study group with a functioning VA at the time of transplantation. Access loss occurred within the 1st year after KTx in 33 (50%) patients. Majority (50 out of 83, 60.2%) of the patients with an active VA had options to create a snuffbox or wrist AVF on the contralateral extremity. In a group of 74 patients without a functioning VA, the creation of a snuffbox or wrist AVF on the non-dominant and dominant extremity was possible in seven (9.2%) and 40 (52.6%) patients, respectively. In 10 (13.1%) patients, the possibilities were limited only to the upper-arm or proximal forearm VA on both sides. Access ligation was considered by 15 out of 83 (18.1%) patients with a patent VA. Conclusions: In the majority of the patients, vascular access blood flow was below the threshold of the negative cardiovascular effect of vascular access. Creation of a distal AVF is a protective measure to avoid a high flow and preserve the vessels for future access. The approach to VA should be individualized and adjusted to the patient's profile.","output":"Vascular Access Perspectives in Patients After Kidney Transplantation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To assess telehealth practice for headache visits in the United States.

The results show that the waste separation behaviors of urban residents are positively influenced by their cognition of waste pollution, ecological values, sense of social responsibility, perceived knowledge, and perceived utilities of waste separation. Moreover, the residents' waste separation intentions partially mediate the relationships between their cognition of waste pollution, ecological values, perceived utilities, and waste separation behaviors, which almost totally mediate the relationship between their sense of social responsibility and waste separation behaviors. In addition, it was shown that the cost of waste separation can weaken the effect of waste separation intention on behavior, while waste separation facilities, social norms, and the publicity for China's 14th National Games have the opposite effect.

The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae. This review highlights knowledge and information gaps on epidemiologic aspects as well as economic impacts of the various pathogens reported in swine in Africa, which calls for further studies.","output":"Status and gaps of research on respiratory disease pathogens of swine in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In their commentary, Zalla et al. argue that the approach taken by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) comparing the proportion of COVID-19 deaths by race/ethnicity to a weighted population distribution ignores how systemic racism structures the composition of places.

This study evaluated the effect of education and trainees perception of assessment on the clinical skills of postgraduate dental trainees in complicated tooth extraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted as a retrospective survey among postgraduate dental trainees learning complicated tooth extraction in Taipei and Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 2012 to 2019. Practical skills were assessed using DOPS by trainees and faculty members. Each clinical case included a complicated extraction of a permanent tooth. RESULTS: A total of 69 participants (26 men and 43 women, average age = 26.49 years, range = 24C34 years) were included in this study. Within the survey cohort, faculty assessments scored significantly higher than did trainees self-assessments in each complicated tooth extraction procedure, with no difference between both sexes. The higher-performing trainees tended to underrate their performance much more than did the lower-performing trainees. More than 40% of the trainees evaluated themselves as having poor capability in some invasive surgical procedures, even though their actual performance was not lower than that of those who evaluated themselves as having adequate or good capability. CONCLUSION: Self-assessment skills should be developed with more practice and experience. We hope that these findings can guide the planning of faculty development programs for clinical instructors, particularly the new cohort of faculty who will succeed the rapidly retiring boomer generation in the next 10 years.","output":"An 8-year retrospective survey of assessment in postgraduate dental training in complicated tooth extraction competency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Reliable methods to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 are essential to the successful management and containment of the virus.

The present study explored the personal experiences of CCRC residents during the lockdown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: in-depth interviews were conducted with 24 CCRC residents from 13 different CCRCs. Authors performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts, using constant comparisons and contrasts. RESULTS: three major themes were identified: (i) Us vs. them: Others are worse off. Older residents engaged in constant attempts to compare their situation to that of others. The overall message behind these downward comparisons was that the situation is not so bad, as others are in a worse predicament; (ii) Us vs. them: Power imbalance. This comparison emphasised the unbalanced power-relations between older adults and the staff and management in the setting and (iii) We have become prisoners of our own age. Interviewees described strong emotions of despair, depression and anger, which were intensified when the rest of society returned back to a new routine, whilst they were still under lockdown. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: the measures imposed on residents by managements of CCRCs during the lockdown, and the emotional responses of distress among some of the residents, revealed that CCRCs have components of total institutions, not normally evident. This underscores the hidden emotional costs of the lockdown among those whose autonomy was compromised.","output":"We have become prisoners of our own age: from a continuing care retirement community to a total institution in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article discusses the impact of staffing shortage on nurses' mental health, and outlines ways, including a successful rounder initiative, for nurse leaders and facilities to address nurses' stress and burnout. ? 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

The gene is expressed as a polyprotein that is processed into individual proteins, presumably by virus-encoded proteinases. ORF 1a has been predicted to encode proteins with similarity to viral and cellular proteinases, such as papain, and to the 3C proteinases of the picornaviruses (A. E. Gorbalenya, A. P. Donchenko, V.

We have cloned into a T7 transcription vector a cDNA fragment containing the putative 3C-like proteinase domain of MHV-A59, along with portions of the flanking hydrophobic domains. The construct was used to express a polypeptide in a combined in vitro transcription-translation system. Major polypeptides with molecular masses of 38 and 33 kDa were detected at early times, whereas polypeptides with molecular masses of 32 and 27 kDa were predominant after 30 to 45 min and appeared to be products of specific proteolysis of larger precursors. Mutations at the putative catalytic histidine and cysteine residues abolished the processing of the 27-kDa protein. Translation products of the pGpro construct were able to cleave the 27-kDa protein in trans from polypeptides expressed from the noncleaving histidine or cysteine mutants. The amino-terminal cleavage of the 27-kDa protein occurred at a glutamine-serine dipeptide as previously predicted.

METHODS: In this observational, longitudinal cohort study, all neurosurgical admissions that presented to our department between February 1 and April 15 during the COVID-19 pandemic and during the same time period in 2019 were identified and categorized according to the presence of a neuro-emergency, the route of admission, management, and the category of disease. Further, the clinical course of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) was investigated representatively for severe vascular and semi-urgent traumatic conditions that present with a wide variety of symptoms. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the percentage of neuro-emergencies among all neurosurgical admissions remained similar but a larger proportion presented through the emergency department than through the outpatient clinic or by referral (*p = 0.009). The total number of neuro-emergencies was significantly reduced (*p = 0.0007) across all types of disease, particularly in vascular (*p = 0.036) but also in spinal (*p = 0.007) and hydrocephalus (*p = 0.048) emergencies. Patients with spinal emergencies presented 48 h later (*p = 0.001) despite comparable symptom severity. For aSAH, the number of cases, aSAH grade, aneurysm localization, and treatment modality did not change but strikingly, elderly patients with cSDH presented less frequently, with more severe symptoms (*p = 0.046), and were less likely to reach favorable outcome (*p = 0.003) at discharge compared with previous years. CONCLUSIONS: Despite pandemic-related restrictive measures and reallocation of resources, patients with neuro-emergencies should be encouraged to present regardless of the severity of symptoms because deferred presentation may result in adverse outcome.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlights three dominant processes in managing complex and uncertain information: some individuals may suffer from information fatigue but there was no evidence of any impact on their behaviours; others seek and share information across many networks; and there were strikingly high levels of distrust leading to complex processes of meaning-making demanding critical health literacy skills.","output":"eHealth literacy during the COVID-19 pandemic: seeking, sharing, suspicion amongst older and younger UK populations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burnout has been viewed as a work-induced condition combining exhaustion, cynicism, and professional inefficacy.

METHODS: From September 2020 to March 2021, this prospectively study enrolled a total of 139 patients (average age, 58.6  12.7 years) included 33 males and 106 females, who underwent 5G-based telerobotic thyroid US examination by a tele-doctor at Shanghai Tenth Peoples Hospital and a conventional thyroid US examination at Chongming Second Peoples Hospital 84 km away. The clinical feasibility of 5G-based telerobotic US for thyroid examination were evaluated in terms of safety, duration, US image quality, diagnostic results, and questionnaire survey. RESULTS: 92.8% of patients had no examination-related complaints. The average duration of the 5G-based telerobotic US examination was similar as that of conventional US examination (5.57  2.20 min vs. 5.23  2.1 min, P = 0.164). The image quality of telerobotic US correlated well with that of conventional US (4.63  0.60 vs. 4.65  0.61, P = 0.102). There was no significant difference between two types of US examination methods for the diameter measurement of the thyroid, cervical lymph nodes, and thyroid nodules. Two lymphadenopathies and 20 diffuse thyroid diseases were detected in two types of US methods. 124 thyroid nodules were detected by telerobotic US and 127 thyroid nodules were detected by conventional US. Among them, 122 were the same thyroid nodules. In addition, there were good consistency in the US features (component, echogenicity, shape, and calcification) and ACR TI-RADS category of the same thyroid nodules between telerobotic and conventional US examinations (ICC = 0.788C0.863). 85.6% of patients accepted the telerobotic US, and 87.1% were willing to pay extra fee for the telerobotic US.

However, UCNP synthesis typically requires high temperatures in combination with either high pressure reaction vessels or an inert atmosphere. Here, we report synthesis of -phase NaYF(4):Yb,Er,Mn UCNPs via the considerably more convenient PVP40-mediated route; a strategy that requires modest temperatures and relatively short reaction time (160C, 2 h) in open air, with Mn(2+) co-doping serving to greatly enhance red emission. The optimal Mn(2+) co-doping level was found to be 35 mol %, which decreased the average maximum UCNP Feret diameter from 42  11 to 36  15 nm; reduced the crystal lattice parameter, a, from 5.52 to 5.45 ?; and greatly enhanced UCNP red/green emission ratio in EtOH by a factor of 5.6. The PVP40 coating enabled dispersal in water and organic solvents and can be exploited for further surface modification (e.g. silica shell formation).

OBJECTIVE: Understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on the front-line clinical team in the ICU environment, as well as reveal what proposals are being made to mitigate the clinical and psychological impacts that this group experiences. METHOD: A systematic review was made following the PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We included any type of study on health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with results about their mental health. We were, therefore, interested in quantitative studies examining the prevalence of problems and effects of interventions, as well as qualitative studies examining experiences. We had no restrictions related to study design, methodological quality or language. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies reported on the urgent need for interventions to prevent or reduce mental health problems caused by COVID-19 among health professionals in ICU. Eleven studies demonstrated possibilities for interventions involving organizational adjustments in the ICU, particularly linked to emotional conflicts in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The disproportion between the need for technological supplies of intensive care medicine and their scarcity promotes, among many factors, high rates of psychological distress. Anxiety, irritability, insomnia, fear and anguish were observed during the pandemic, probably related to extremely high workloads and the lack of personal protective equipment.","output":"Psychiatric disorders in health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review with meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Immune responses against multiple epitopes are required for the prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and the progression to phase I trials of candidates may be guided by comparative immunogenicity studies in non-human primates.

Several antihypertensives increase ACE2 expression or activity, leading to concern that this may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry and worsen COVID-19 disease. However, ACE2 is protective against lung injury while ANG II (which is catabolised by ACE2) is associated with lung injury both in mice and humans. We propose that medications which inhibit the RAS ACE-dependent pathway may be beneficial in treating COVID-19 and should be explored in animal models and clinical trials.

Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) are the most at risk population for mental health disorders yet their well-being is key to combating the pandemic. We explored the psychosocial wellbeing and job satisfaction of COVID-19 Frontline HCWs in Uganda. METHODS: This was a qualitative study done at Entebbe regional Referral hospital (ERRH) and Mulago National Referral hospital (MNRH) in September 2020. Data collection was through 3 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with 5 participants for each FGD. 2 FGDs were at MNRH and 1 at ERRH. Participants included;doctors, nurses, laboratory personnels, hygienists and a security personnel. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically using Nvivo version 12 software. RESULTS: Despite the challenges HCWs faced, they were motivated to work when they saw patients recover and go home safely. Participants felt the Pandemic was unprecedented and as a result no person or government was fully prepared. Big unexpected patient crowds caused limited and/ or inconsistent medical supplies. Additionally, Poor Procurement lines affected sufficiency of medical supplies and equipment such as medical gowns, drugs, PPE, alcohol, beds, and COVID-19 testing kits. There was knowledge gap among the HCWs regarding COVID-19 management. This put the staff in a Panic situation hence practicing trial and error treatment. Poor remuneration in terms of low or delayed Salary, lack or delay of risk allowance caused dissatisfaction among staff and were affected mentally given that they were involved in risky work yet their families were suffering economically.

Several other vaccines are at different stages of assessment by the European Medicines Agency. In addition to the elderly, oncology patients are a vulnerable population in which COVID-19 infection may be more severe. However, owing to the design of the initial studies, evidence on the safety and efficacy of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in these patients is scarce and recommendations are based on the opinion of associations, stakeholders, and experts via extrapolation of information and experience for other vaccines, especially influenza vaccines. Despite the limited evidence, the consensus is that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe and vaccination of oncology patients and their close relatives is recommended, although efficacy may be lower in patients with an impaired immune response and the need for additional booster doses is not yet clear. Recommendations include avoiding the use of vaccines based on viral vectors for patients with an impaired immune response, deferring vaccination for immunosuppressed patients or administering the vaccine before immunosuppression, and avoiding chemotherapy receipt between the two doses of a vaccine or on the same day that the vaccine is administered. These recommendations can be extrapolated to urology patients and although evidence is lacking, there should not be greater interference with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines from androgen deprivation therapy or intravesical bacillus Calmette-Gurin.

However, surgeons are subjected to hardworking conditions because of the poor ergonomic design of the instruments. In this article, a new ergonomic handle design is presented. This handle is designed using ergonomic principles, trying to provide both more intuitive manipulation of the instrument and a shape that reduces the high-pressure zones in the contact with the surgeon's hand. MATERIALS AND METHODS The ergonomic characteristics of the new handle were evaluated using objective and subjective studies. The experimental evaluation was performed using 28 volunteers by means of the comparison of the new handle with the ring-handle (RH) concept in an instrument available on the market. The volunteers' muscle activation and motions of the hand, wrist, and arm were studied while they performed different tasks. The data measured in the experiment include electromyography and goniometry values. RESULTS The results obtained from the subjective analysis reveal that most volunteers (64%) preferred the new prototype to the RH, reporting less pain and less difficulty to complete the tasks. The results from the objective study reveal that the hyperflexion of the wrist required for the manipulation of the instrument is strongly reduced.

Notably, in the countries dealing with massive casualties, clinicians have worked in new conditions characterized by a heavy workload and a high risk of being infected. The issue of clinician burnout during the pandemic has attracted considerable attention in health care research. Electronic health records (EHRs) provide health care workers with several features to meet a health system's clinical needs. OBJECTIVE: We aim to examine how the use of EHR features affects the burnout of clinicians working in hospitals that have special wards for confirmed COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Using an online survey, we collected data from 368 physicians, physician assistants, and nurses working in six hospitals that have implemented EHRs in the city of Tehran in Iran. We used logistic regression to assess the association between burnout and awareness of EHR features, EHR system usability, concerns about COVID-19, technology solutions, hospital technology interventions, hospital preparedness, and professional efficacy adjusted for demographic and practice characteristics. RESULTS: The primary outcome of our study was self-reported burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 368 respondents, 36% (n=134) reported having at least one symptom of burnout. Participants indicated that the leading cause of EHR-related stress is inadequate training for using technology (n=159, 43%), followed by having less face-to-face time with patients (n=140, 38%). Positive perceptions about the EHR's ease of use were associated with lower odds of burnout symptoms. More interventions, such as clear communication of regulations; transparency in policies, expectations, and goals regarding the use of technology in the clinical workflow; and hospital preparedness to cope with the challenges of the pandemic, were associated with lower odds of burnout. CONCLUSIONS: The use of EHR applications, hospital pandemic preparation programs, and transparent technology-related policies and procedures throughout the epidemic can be substantial mitigators of technology-based stress and clinician burnout. Hospitals will then be better positioned to devise or modify technology-related policies and procedures to support physicians' and nurses' well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training programs, transparency in communications of regulations, and developing a clear channel for informing clinicians of changes in policies may help reduce burnout symptoms among physicians and nurses during a pandemic. Providing easily accessible mentorship through teleconsultation and 24-hour available information technology support may also help to mitigate the odds of burnout.","output":"Using Electronic Health Records to Mitigate Workplace Burnout Among Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Field Study in Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Even prior to the COVID-19 crisis, one of the childrens most common screen activities was using the video-sharing platform YouTube, with many children preferring YouTube over television.

We found that ppGpp not only exerts control over the growth rate but also over cell division and thus the steady state cell size. In response to changes in ppGpp level, the added size already establishes its new constant value while the growth rate still adjusts, aided by accelerated or delayed divisions. Moreover, the magnitude of the added size and resulting steady-state birth size correlate consistently with the ppGpp level, rather than with the growth rate, which results in cells of different size that grow equally fast. Our findings suggest that ppGpp serves as a key regulator that coordinates cell size and growth control.","output":"ppGpp is a bacterial cell size regulator"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused mental stress in a number of ways: overstrain of the health care system, lockdown of the economy, restricted opportunities for interpersonal contact and excursions outside the home and workplace, and quarantine measures where necessary. In this article, we provide an overview of psychological distress in the current pandemic, identifying protective factors and risk factors. METHODS: The PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant publications (1 January 2019 - 16 April 2020). This study was registered in OSF Registries (osf.io/34j8g). Data on mental stress and resilience in Germany were obtained from three surveys carried out on more than 1000 participants each in the framework of the COSMO study (24 March, 31 March, and 21 April 2020). RESULTS: 18 studies from China and India, with a total of 79 664 participants, revealed increased stress in the general population, with manifestations of depression and anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and sleep disturbances. Stress was more marked among persons working in the health care sector. Risk factors for stress included patient contact, female sex, impaired health status, worry about family members and significant others, and poor sleep quality. Protective factors included being informed about the increasing number of persons who have recovered from COVID, social support, and a lower perceived infectious risk. The COSMO study, though based on an insufficiently representative population sample because of a low questionnaire return rate (<20%), revealed increased rates of despondency, loneliness, and hopelessness in the German population as compared to norm data, with no change in estimated resilience. CONCLUSION: Stress factors associated with the current pandemic probably increase stress by causing anxiety and depression. Once the protective factors and risk factors have been identified, these can be used to develop psychosocial interventions. The informativeness of the results reported here is limited by the wide variety of instruments used to acquire data and by the insufficiently representative nature of the population samples.","output":"Psychomorbidity, Resilience, and Exacerbating and Protective Factors During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"About 2800 girls from southwestern Kenyas Kuria community who recently underwent female genital mutilation (FGM) have been paraded through town centres in recent weeks, as local traditional leaders make the most of reduced police vigilance during the covid-19 pandemic Prison sentences Kenya is a regional leader in the fight against FGM, imposing prison sentences of up to three years since 2011 on people convicted of aiding in mutilation, possessing the cutting tools, or failing to report the practice [ ]nearly one in 10 Kenyan FGM victims underwent the most extreme form, which involves sewing the vaginal opening closed 1 FGM has been in full retreat in Kenya for three decades, but about 8% of todays girls are expected to undergo the practice A profile of female genital mutilation in Kenya 2020 https://data unicef org/resources/a-profile-of-female-genital-mutilation-in-kenya/#","output":"FGM: nearly 3000 girls are paraded in Kenya as pandemic hinders control efforts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"When minimizing the empirical risk in binary classification, it is a common practice to replace the zero-one loss with a surrogate loss to make the learning objective feasible to optimize. Examples of well-known surrogate losses for binary classification include the logistic loss, hinge loss, and sigmoid loss. It is known that the choice of a surrogate loss can highly influence the performance of the trained classifier and therefore it should be carefully chosen. Recently, surrogate losses that satisfy a certain symmetric condition (aka., symmetric losses) have demonstrated their usefulness in learning from corrupted labels. In this article, we provide an overview of symmetric losses and their applications. First, we review how a symmetric loss can yield robust classification from corrupted labels in balanced error rate (BER) minimization and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) maximization. Then, we demonstrate how the robust AUC maximization method can benefit natural language processing in the problem where we want to learn only from relevant keywords and unlabeled documents.

METHODS: Information consisted of the European Pacemaker Patient Card, data submitted to the cardiodispositivos.es online platform, the databases of participating centers, and supplier-reported data. RESULTS: A total of 14 662 procedures were registered from 102 hospitals, representing 39.2% of the estimated activity. The implantation rates of conventional and low-energy resynchronization pacemakers were 759 and 31 units per million population, respectively. In all, 520 leadless pacemakers were implanted, 70 with atrioventricular synchrony. The mean age at implantation was high (78.8 years), and the most frequent electrocardiographic change was atrioventricular block. There was a predominance of dual-chamber pacing mode but VVI/R single-chamber pacing was used in 19% of patients in sinus rhythm, depending on age and sex. Remote monitoring capability was present in 18.5% of implanted conventional pacemakers and 45.6% of low-energy resynchronization pacemakers, although registration in this system increased by 53% in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: In 2020, in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the number of implanted conventional pacemakers decreased by 8% and cardiac resynchronization therapy by 4.6%.

The recent spread of new variants with increased infectivity requires even more attention. Here, we document how shotgun proteomics can be useful for rapidly monitoring the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We evaluated the heterogeneity of purified SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained after culturing in the Vero E6 cell line. We found that cell culture induces significant changes that are translated at the protein level, such changes being detectable by tandem mass spectrometry. Production of viral particles requires careful quality control which can be easily performed by shotgun proteomics. Although considered relatively stable so far, the SARS-CoV-2 genome turns out to be prone to frequent variations. Therefore, the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 variants from patients reporting only the consensus genome after its amplification would deserve more attention and could benefit from more in-depth analysis of low level but crystal-clear signals, as well as complementary and rapid analysis by shotgun proteomics.","output":"Heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 virus produced in cell culture revealed by shotgun proteomics and supported by genome sequencing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An experiment was conducted in Mundo Novo Farm, in Brotas, SP.

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R(0)] of 15, 20, or 25) and assuming 75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R(0) value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (227%, 300%, 400%, and 500%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures. FINDINGS: For the baseline scenario, when R(0) was 15, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was 279 000 (IQR 245 000C320 000), corresponding to 74% (IQR 65C85) of the resident population of Singapore. The median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000C776 000) when R(0) was 20, corresponding to 193% (178C206) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000C1 249 000) when R(0) was 25, corresponding to 32% (309C331) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 993% (IQR 926C999) when R(0) was 15, by 930% (815C997) when R(0) was 20, and by 782% (590 ?944) when R(0) was 25. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 500%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R(0) of 15. INTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

In a pre-post design, we tested whether SNAP could improve externalizing behaviors, assessed by the parent-rated Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and also improve behavioral measures of impulsivity in children with high aggression and impulsivity. We then investigated whether any improvement in externalizing behavior or impulsivity was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) changes assessed using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). We also recruited typically developing youth who were assessed twice without undergoing the SNAP intervention. Methods: Ten children who were participating in SNAP treatment completed the entire study protocol. CBCL measures, behavioral measures of impulsivity, and sMRI scanning was conducted pre-SNAP and then 13 weeks later post-SNAP. Twelve healthy controls also completed the study; they were rated on the CBCL, performed the same behavioral measure of impulsivity, and underwent sMRI twice, separated by 13 weeks. They did not receive the SNAP intervention. Result: At baseline, SNAP participants had higher CBCL scores and performed worse on the impulsivity task compared with the healthy controls. At the second visit, SNAP participants still had higher scores on the CBCL compared with normally-developing controls, but their performance on the impulsivity task had improved to the point where their results were indistinguishable from the healthy controls. Structural magnetic resonance imaging in the SNAP participants further revealed that improvements in impulsivity were associated with GMV changes in the frontotemporal region. Conclusion: These results suggest that SNAP led to improvement in behavioral measures of impulsivity in a cohort of boys with high externalizing behavior. Improvement in impulsivity was also associated with increased GMV changes. The mechanism behind these brain changes is unknown but could relate to cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency management interventions, important components of SNAP, that target frontotemporal brain regions. Clinically, this study offers new evidence for the potential targeting of brain regions by non-invasive modalities, such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, to improve externalizing behavior and impulsivity.","output":"Psychosocial Intervention for Youth With High Externalizing Behaviors and Aggression Is Associated With Improvement in Impulsivity and Brain Gray Matter Volume Changes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dear Editor: Pernio-like acral lesions are a common dermatologic manifestation reported after SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) infection1,2 .

These plus-strand RNA viruses have T=3 icosahedral protein capsids with 90 pronounced protruding (P) domain dimers to which antibodies and cellular receptors bind. We previously demonstrated that bile binding to the capsid of mouse norovirus (MNV) causes several major conformational changes; the entire P domain rotates by 90 and contracts onto the shell, the P domain dimers rotate about each other, and the structural equilibrium of the epitopes at the top of the P domain shift towards the 'closed' conformation that favors receptor binding while blocking antibody binding. Here we demonstrate that MNV undergoes reversible conformational changes at pH 5.0 nearly identical to when bile binds. Notably, at low pH or when metals bind, a cluster of acidic resides in the G'H' loop interact, distort the G'H' loop, and this may drive C'D' loop movement towards the closed conformation. ELISA assays with infectious virus particles at low pH or in the presence of metals demonstrated that all tested antibodies do not bind to this contracted form, akin to what was observed with the MNV/bile complex. Therefore, low pH, cationic metals, and bile salts are physiological 'triggers' in the gut for P domain contraction and structural rearrangement that synergistically prime the virus for receptor binding while blocking antibody binding. Importance The protruding domains on the Calicivirus capsids are recognized by cell receptor(s) and antibodies. We demonstrated that mouse norovirus (MNV) P domains are highly mobile and bile causes contraction onto the shell surface while allosterically blocking antibody binding. We present the near atomic cryo-EM structures of infectious MNV at pH 5.0 and 7.5. Surprisingly, low pH is sufficient to cause the same conformational changes as when bile binds. A cluster of acidic residues on the G'H' loop was the most likely involved with the pH effects. These residues also bind divalent cations and had the same conformation as observed here at pH 5. Binding assays demonstrate that low pH and metals block antibody binding and therefore the G'H' loop might be driving the conformational changes. Therefore, low pH, cationic metals, and bile salts in the gut synergistically prime the virus for receptor binding while blocking antibody binding.","output":"Multiple signals in the gut contract the mouse norovirus capsid to block antibody binding while enhancing receptor affinity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Through the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020, the society has deeply realized the inevitability and necessity of building a community that shares the future of mankind.

The American and European guidelines leave decisions about antihypertensive treatment in frail, institutionalized patients up to the treating physician. We therefore systematically searched the literature for publications on the phamacotherapy of arterial hypertension in frail patients. METHODS The MEDLINE, Embase, and Central databases were systematically searched for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies, including observational studies, on the pharmacotherapy of arterial hypertension in elderly patients since the introduction of the concept of frailty, published over the period 1992-2017. RESULTS Out of 19 282 citations for randomized, controlled trials and 5659 for non-randomized trials and observational studies, four RCTs and three observational studies were included in the further analysis. The included RCTs showed a trend to- wards a benefit from pharmacotherapy of hypertension in frail patients with respect to mortality, cardiovascular disease, functional status, and quality of life. On the other hand, some of the observational studies indicated a lower rate of falls and lower mortality among patients who received no antihypertensive treatment. CONCLUSION In view of the conflicting findings of RCTs and non-randomized studies, the lower representation of frail subjects in RCTs, and the high risk of bias in non- randomized studies, the findings of the studies included in this review do not enable the formulation of any strictly evidence-based treatment recommendations. As a rule of thumb, the authors propose that a target systolic blood pressure of <150 mmHg should be aimed at in patients whose gait speed is less than 0.8 m/s, while a target range of 130-139 mmHg can be set for patients over age 80 who are no more than mildly frail.","output":"The Pharmacological Treatment of Arterial Hypertension in Frail, Older Patientsa Systematic Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We compare the performance of major decision tree-based ensemble machine learning models on the task of COVID-19 death probability prediction, conditional on three risk factors: age group, sex and underlying comorbidity or disease, using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s COVID-19 case surveillance dataset.

The data was collected from 700 participants of different age groups and religious backgrounds in Malaysia, and structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to analyse this data and test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that COVID-19 has a significantly positive impact on EA, SC and SR, and the generations and religiosity moderate the relationship between COVID-19 and its impact on sustainable behaviours. This study contributes to analyse the difference in the perception of EA, SC and SR among the people that eventually will stimulate the scientific reasoning among the governments, policymakers and scientists to develop a holistic framework to combat unprecedented event such as COVID-19 and ensure the authentication of sustainable environment and exceptional quality of life. The policymakers in Malaysia may use the findings of this study to inspect the social and environmental aspects of the people during the transformation events.","output":"COVID-19 and dynamics of environmental awareness, sustainable consumption and social responsibility in Malaysia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, a number of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) have been identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.

Mirroring the physical distancing mandate during the COVID-19 crisis, the show offers an opportunity to discern a set of interrelated human and nonhuman entanglements in contemporary technoculture that the outbreak has brought into sharper relief. This essay probes into the conditions of possibility for the popularity of THTH by placing an analytical focus on the role of Lana, a nonhuman sensor centrally featured in the show with a female voice typical of digital assistants. Lana, a cone-shaped device from 'Factory, China', is a surveillance robot embodying the operation of Netflix as part of the expanding regime of data colonialism, which extracts personal data for profit. Her nonhuman identity is evocative of China as at once a manufacturing locale for the material gadgets that make up the global digital economy and an authoritarian state that has deepened its censorship and surveillance practices during the COVID-19 outbreak. Instructing the contestants to care for their entrepreneurial selves while encroaching upon their autonomy, Lana invites us to rethink the common framing of China - a coveted market for Netflix - as the nonhuman Other of the liberal-democratic West. During a time when the nonhuman virus keeps humans apart while intensifying their reliance on nonhuman machines for communication, Lana promotes a kind of intimacy without proximity characteristic of the global infrastructures of connection. A symptomatic reading of THTH, which also conjures a vision of collectivity as a basis for surviving the pandemic, thus allows us to recognize the entanglement of the human and the nonhuman and to imagine new paths toward global social justice.","output":"Learning from Lana: Netflix's Too Hot to Handle, COVID-19, and the human-nonhuman entanglement in contemporary technoculture.

Method: This study consists of two parts. The first part consists of working with a leader of a house of worship to formulate a decision process based on the priorities of the organization and its physical size and population. The second part involves the modeling of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus spread within a physical space to provide the leadership of the house of worship an estimate of the outcomes of deciding on various courses of action. The model is a modification of a standard virus model developed for the NetLogo programming environment. Results: The team worked with a large local church in Pennsylvania to physically reopen a worship service. Based on the questionnaire data, the congregation did not prefer the strongest form of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mitigation (mask wearing and social distancing) but favored either mask required and no social distancing or masks optional and social distancing. The team simulated conditions representative of the church and found that social distancing is the key factor to mitigate spread. Conclusion: Given the preferences of the congregation, our simulation results suggested that one of the favored options would likely yield a large number of infections (>10% in a scenario with an asymptomatic carrier). This information was provided to the leadership to guide their decision-making for the coming months as poor weather will rule out outdoor worship as a viable option.","output":"Aiding decision makers to reopening of places of worship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Suicide behavior (SB) has been highly associated with the response to stress and the hypothalamicCpituitaryCadrenal (HPA) axis.

The virus employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into human cells. ACE2 is expressed on different organs, which is raising concern as to whether these organs can be infected by the virus or not. The testis appears to be an organ enriched with levels of ACE2, while the possible mechanisms of involvement of the male reproductive system by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully elucidated. The major focus of the present studies is on the short-term complications of the coronavirus and gains importance on studying the long-term effects, including the possible effects of the virus on the male reproductive system. The aim of this review was to provide new insights into different possible mechanisms of involvement of male gonads with SARS-CoV-2 including investigating the ACE2 axis in testis, hormonal alterations in patients with COVID-19, possible formation of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) and subsequently immunological infertility as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we suggest measuring the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) as a determiner of male fertility impairment in patients with COVID-19 along with other options such as sex-related hormones and semen analysis. Invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells can lead to sex hormonal alteration and impaired gonadal function. Once infected, changes in ACE2 signalling pathways followed by oxidative stress and inflammation could cause spermatogenesis failure, abnormal sperm motility, DNA fragmentation and male infertility.","output":"Potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 action on male gonadal function and fertility: Current status and future prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During 2019, approximately 34,800 new HIV infections occurred in the United States (1), and it is estimated that approximately 80% of HIV transmission occurs from persons who either do not know they have HIV infection or are not receiving regular care (2). Since 2006, CDC has recommended that persons who are disproportionately affected by HIV (including men who have sex with men [MSM]) should test for HIV at least annually (3,4). However, data from multiple sources indicate that these recommendations are not being fully implemented (5,6). TakeMeHome, a novel public-private partnership to deliver HIV self-testing kits to persons seeking HIV testing in the United States, was launched during March 2020 as home care options for testing became increasingly important during the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiation of the program coincided with the national COVID-19 Public Health Emergency declaration, issuance of stay-at-home orders, and other restrictions that led to disruption of traditional HIV testing services. During March 31, 2020-March 30, 2021, 17 state and local health departments participating in the program allowed residents of their jurisdictions to order test kits. Marketing for TakeMeHome focused on reaching gay, bisexual, and MSM through messages and embedded links in gay dating applications. Most participants in the program reported that they had either never tested for HIV (36%) or that they had last tested >1 year before receiving their self-test kit (56%). After receiving the self-test kit, >10% of respondents reported accessing additional prevention services. Health departments can increase options for HIV testing by distributing publicly funded self-test kits to persons without proximate access to clinic-based testing or who prefer to test at home.

Pediatric patients can rarely present with a severe complication identified as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).(1) After its recognition by the CDC and media reports of young adults with the same syndrome, a series of cases in adults (MIS-A) was published in late 2020.(2) CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old Hispanic male who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR six weeks prior presented to the emergency department with one week of sore throat, fever, non-bloody diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and mild confusion. On examination, the patient was febrile, had tender submandibular lymph nodes and redness on the oropharynx. Initial laboratory results showed systemic inflammation. COVID-19 RT-PCR test was negative, coronavirus IgG was positive, and chest radiograph was normal. On the third day, the patient's clinical status deteriorated despite antibiotic use with hypotension and hypoxemia requiring vasopressor support and ICU admission. An echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) of 35% with hypokinesia. Due to persistent shock state and elevated inflammatory markers after 36 hours, we started him on methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg daily. After 24 hours, clinical status and inflammatory markers improved significantly. A follow-up echocardiogram four weeks after discharge showed normalization of EF. DISCUSSION: Since the beginning of the pandemic, different countries reported cases of a hyperinflammatory process in children that had features similar to atypical Kawasaki disease.(3) A larger study described MIS-C in 99 patients under 21 years of age in New York.(4) The case definition MIS-C was established by the CDC. For a time, it was unknown if this syndrome was specific to children or whether it also occurred in adults. A MIS-A working case definition includes five criteria: severe illness requiring hospitalization in a person aged at least 21 years;a positive test result for current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection;severe dysfunction of one or more extrapulmonary organ systems;laboratory evidence of severe inflammation;and absence of severe respiratory illness.(2) Case definitions for MIS-C/A with degrees of diagnostic certainty have also been elaborated.(5) We are presenting a patient that meets clinical and laboratory criteria for MIS-A. His respiratory dysfunction occurred after admission when his inflammatory markers were already elevated. This case includes a temporal correlation after the initial peak of COVID-19 cases in Houston by 31 days. CONCLUSIONS: The number of cases of MIS-A is unclear. It is important to keep this condition in our differential in the context of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection for early identification and appropriate treatment to reduce further harm and mortality.

The results obtained showed that a majority of derivatives exhibited cytotoxic activities against these six human tumor cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the introduction of l-tryptophan to the C-3 position of DSG and the C-26 position of derivative 5 was the preferred option for these compounds to display significant cytotoxic activities. Among them, compound 7g exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the K562 cell line (IC50 = 4.41 M) and was 6.8-fold more potent than diosgenin (IC50 = 30.04 M). Further cellular mechanism studies in K562 cells elucidated that compound 7g triggered mitochondrial-related apoptosis by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which was associated with upregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bax, downregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and activation of the caspase cascade.

Family caregivers are often assumed to be willing and able to support patients with medications, yet little is known about the challenges they experience or how they cope with these. AIM: To explore patient and family caregivers views of managing medications when someone is seriously ill and dying at home. DESIGN: A qualitative design underpinned by a social constructionist perspective involving interviews with bereaved family caregivers, patients and current family caregivers. A thematic analysis was undertaken. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Two English counties. Data reported in this paper were generated across two data sets using: (1) Interviews with bereaved family caregivers (n = 21) of patients who had been cared for at home during the last 6 months of life. (2) Interviews (n = 43) included within longitudinal family focused case studies (n = 20) with patients and current family caregivers followed-up over 4 months.

Emotional and social support are essential to help people to get through personal crises such as bereavement. In this study we characterize the social support owners obtain from their dogs, provide evidence of how widespread this social support is amongst dog-owners, and show how social support from dogs can increase during a crisis (using the COVID-19 pandemic as an example). We collected data from a representative population-based sample of Spanish dog-owners and found that most respondents said that their dogs helped them to get through tough times. They got comfort from physical contact with their dogs, shared activities with them and treated them as confidants in a similar way to friends and family. These are all key aspects of social support, and dogs offer the advantage of being more available than human sources of support. It would be expected that the support that dogs provide would be increased during a time of personal crisis and when we looked at data collected from a convenience sample of Spanish dog-owners during the COVID-19 confinement that is what we found;during the confinement owners engaged in more shared activities with their dogs, hugged them more often and turned to them more as a source of companionship and comfort (p &lt; 0.0001 in all cases). However, although owners did confide more in their dogs (p &lt; 0.0001), the effect was not as great as for other aspects of social support. We suspect that this is because people were able to use telecommunications such as video conferencing to maintain their human confidant relationships. Our findings indicate that dogs can substitute for humans as sources of some kinds of social support when conventional sources are unavailable. Our conclusion is that where a dog is present in a household, it should be regarded as an important resource for social support. This should be considered when designing clinical interventions and when public health decisions are being made.","output":"The Value of Companion Dogs as a Source of Social Support for Their Owners: Findings From a Pre-pandemic Representative Sample and a Convenience Sample Obtained During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Across machine learning (ML) sub-disciplines, researchers make explicit mathematical assumptions in order to facilitate proof-writing.

METHODS: A total of 122 subjects with COVID-19 were included: 106 SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR-positive patients and 16 RT-PCR-negative patients with symptoms and chest computed tomography (CT) consistent with COVID-19. Ninety-six historical blood donation samples were used as controls. Demographic and clinical characteristics were retrieved from electronic records. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated, as were their 95% binomial confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.3. RESULTS: The sensitivity of the chromatographic immunoassay in all RT-PCR-positive patients, irrespective of the timing of symptom onset, was 85.8% (95% binomial CI 77.7% to 91.9%). This increased with time after symptom onset, and at >14 days was 94.9% (85.9% to 98.9%). The specificity was 100% (96.4% to 100%). 15/16 (94%) RT- PCR-negative cases tested positive. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension and diabetes mellitus and the most frequent symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea. All RT-PCR-negative patients had pneumonia. The most frequent thoracic CT findings were ground glass changes (na?=a?11, 68%), which were bilateral in 9 (56%) patients, and diffuse reticulonodular infiltrates (na?=a?5, 31%).

There is a prevalent obsession with humoral immunity as in vitro studies have indicated diminished effects of vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies. However, this need not clinically translate to vaccine resistance as immune response against all forms of present vaccine preparations is T dependent unlike that against native viral particles which can induce T independent immune responses. Thus, we focused on this major correlate of protection against infections, T cell response. Using bioinformatics tools, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein T cell epitopes and their diversity across Delta plus/B.1.617.2.1, Gamma/P.1 (variant of concern), B.1.1.429, Zeta/P.2 and Mink cluster 5/B.1.1.298 variants as well as Omicron/B.1.1.529 (variant of concern). We also compared HLA restriction profiles of the mutant epitopes with that of the native epitopes (from Wuhan_hu_1 strain, used in vaccine formulations). Our observations show ~90% conservation of CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes across Delta plus/B.1.617.2.1, Gamma/P.1 (variant of concern), B.1.1.429, Zeta/P.2 and Mink cluster 5/B.1.1.298. For the Omicron/B.1.1.529 variant, ~75% of CD4+ and ~ 87% CD8+ epitopes were conserved. Majority of the mutated CD4+ and CD8+ epitopes of this variant were predicted to retain the HLA restriction pattern as their native epitopes. The results of our bioinformatics analysis suggest largely conserved T cell responses across the studied variants, ability of T cells to tackle new SARS-CoV-2 variants and aid in protection from COVID-19 post vaccination. In conclusion, the results suggest that current vaccines may not be rendered completely ineffective against new variants.","output":"Mutations in spike protein T cell epitopes of SARS-COV-2 variants: Plausible influence on vaccine efficacy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To determine prevalence of acute encephalopathy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and to determine outcomes compared to those without acute encephalopathy. Background: Acute encephalopathy in the setting of any infection is associated with severity of the disease process. With this COVID-19 pandemic, we did not find any studies to associate the development of acute encephalopathy with outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Design/Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study where we examined clinical outcome parameters comprising 'need for critical care services', 'intubation' and '30-day mortality' among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without acute encephalopathy, before and after propensity-score matching. TriNetX, which is a large global COVID-19 database was used to obtain medical record data and their analytics function was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of 12,601 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 1092 (8.7%) developed acute encephalopathy. Patients in the acute encephalopathy group were older (67 vs. 61 years) and had higher prevalence of medical co-morbidities including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, COPD, chronic kidney and liver disease among others. Before and after propensity score matching for co-morbidities, patients with acute encephalopathy were more likely to need critical care services (35.6% vs. 16.9%, p < 0.0001), intubation (19.5% vs. 6.0%, p < 0.0001) and had a higher 30-day mortality (24.3% vs. 17.9%, p 0.0002).

We sought to identify changes in pediatric asthma-related healthcare utilization and levels of air pollution i.e. particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and gaseous chemicals (NO2, O3) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia. We hypothesized that declining utilization of asthma care and changed pollution levels during the early stages of the pandemic rebounded after the relaxation of COVID-19-related public health measures. Methods: For the time period Mar 17 to Dec 17 during the years 2015-2020, asthmarelated encounters and weekly summaries of respiratory viral testing data were extracted from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) electronic health records. Daily average estimates of PM2.5, PM10, O3, and NO2 for the same time period were obtained from AirData, an EPA resource that provides quality-assured summary air pollution measures collected from outdoor regulatory monitors across the United States. Patterns in encounter characteristics and viral testing in Philadelphia from Mar 17 to Dec 17, 2020, were compared to data from 2015-2019 as a historical reference. Encounter pattern results were summarized as percentage changes. Controlled interrupted time series regression models were created to identify statistically significant differences in pollution levels that differed in 2020 compared with historical time periods. Results: We present data on asthma encounters, viral testing, and air pollution from Mar 2020 through Dec 2020. Contrary to the early stages of the pandemic when in-person asthma encounters decreased by 87% (outpatient) and 84% (emergency + inpatient), asthma-related encounters rebounded with the relaxation of COVID-19-related public health measures. During the initial months of the pandemic, the daily average of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 levels decreased by 29.0% (2.17 g/m3), 18.2% (3.13 g/m3), and 44.1% (6.75 ppb), respectively, whereas ozone levels increased by 43.4% (10.08 ppb), changes that were not statistically significantly different compared to historical trends. Levels of all pollutants considered remained similar during subsequent 2020 months compared to the 2015-2019 reference period. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic in Philadelphia was accompanied by initial decreases in pediatric asthma healthcare activity. Concurrent with the relaxation of COVID-19-related public health measures, there was a subsequent increase in asthma healthcare activity. No substantial change in air pollution levels compared with historical patterns was observed during the time period considered, suggesting that other factors influenced changes in asthma trends during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Trends in philadelphia asthma encounters and pollution during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The measures adopted by governments around the world to control the spread of the COVID\\\\19 virus (e.g., social distancing) have propelled a rapid transition from face\\\\to\\\\face to online therapy.

This paper analyzes the effect of a European CPF in the reformed EU ETS using a Hotelling model of the EU ETS, amended by the market stability reserve (MSR), and the cancellation mechanism. Two CPF designs are compared: (1) a buyback program and (2) a top-up tax. The buyback program sets a minimum price for the allowances from the implementation year onwards. After the announcement, firms anticipate the CPF, which immediately increases the carbon price to the discounted CPF level. Therefore, firms emit less and bank more allowances, leading to more intake into the MSR, and more cancellation of allowances. The top-up tax imposes a tax on emissions, which enhances the market price of allowances to the CPF level from the implementation year onwards. Firms increase their short-run emissions in anticipation of the upcoming tax. Only after the implementation year firms start to lower their emissions. Thus, the effect on aggregate cancellation is ambiguous. Despite being equivalent in a static setting, the design choice for the CPF matters in a dynamic context, such as the EU ETS.","output":"A carbon price floor in the reformed EU ETS: Design matters!()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration COVID-19 as a pandemic, healthcare systems around the world have faced a huge challenge in managing patients with chronic diseases. Patients with migraine were specifically vulnerable to inadequate medical care. We aimed to investigate the real-world impact of COVID-19 pandemic on migraine patients, and to identify risk factors for poor outcome. METHODS: We administered an online, self-reported survey that included demographic, migraine-related, COVID-19-specific and overall psychosocial variables between July 15 and July 30, 2020. We recruited a sample of patients with migraine from headache clinic registry and via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Outcomes included demographic variables, change in migraine frequency and severity during the lockdown period, communication with treating physician, compliance to migraine treatment, difficulty in getting medications, medication overuse, symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, sleep and eating habits disturbance, screen time exposure, work during pandemic, use of traditional medicine, effect of Botox injection cancellation, and overall worries and concerns during pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1018 patients completed the survey. Of the respondents, 859 (84.3%) were females; 733 (71.9%) were aged 20 to 40 years, 630 (61.8%) were married, and 466 (45.7%) reported working during the pandemic. In comparison to pre-pandemic period, 607 respondents (59.6%) reported increase in migraine frequency, 163 (16%) reported decrease in frequency, and 105 (10.3%) transformed to chronic migraine. Severity was reported to increase by 653 (64.1%) respondents. The majority of respondents; 626 (61.5%) did not communicate with their neurologists, 477 (46.9%) reported compliance to treatment, and 597 (58.7%) reported overuse of analgesics. Botox injections cancellation had a negative impact on 150 respondents (66.1%) from those receiving it. Forty-one respondents (4%) were infected with COVID-19; 26 (63.4%) reported worsening of their headaches amid infection period.

We established ELISA-based immunoassays using locally produced antigens when New Zealand went into a nationwide lockdown and the supply chain of diagnostic reagents was a widely held domestic concern. The relationship between serum antibody binding measured by ELISA and neutralising capacity was investigated using a surrogate viral neutralisation test (sVNT). METHODS: A pre-pandemic sera panel (n = 113), including respiratory infections with symptom overlap with COVID-19, was used to establish assay specificity. Sera from PCR?confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients (n = 21), and PCR-negative patients with respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (n = 82) that presented to the two largest hospitals in Auckland during the lockdown period were included. A two-step IgG ELISA based on the receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike protein was adapted to determine seropositivity, and neutralising antibodies that block the RBD/hACE?2 interaction were quantified by sVNT. RESULTS: The calculated cut-off (>0.2) in the two-step ELISA maximised specificity by classifying all pre-pandemic samples as negative. Sera from all PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were classified as seropositive by ELISA 7 days after symptom onset. There was 100% concordance between the two-step ELISA and the sVNT with all 7+ day sera from PCR?confirmed COVID-19 patients also classified as positive with respect to neutralising antibodies. Of the symptomatic PCR-negative cohort, one individual with notable travel history was classified as positive by two-step ELISA and sVNT, demonstrating the value of serology in detecting prior infection. CONCLUSIONS: These serological assays were established and assessed at a time when human activity was severely restricted in New Zealand. This was achieved by generous sharing of reagents and technical expertise by the international scientific community, and highly collaborative efforts of scientists and clinicians across the country. The assays have immediate utility in supporting clinical diagnostics, understanding transmission in high-risk cohorts and underpinning longer?term exit strategies based on effective vaccines and therapeutics.","output":"Collaborative networks enable the rapid establishment of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 during nationwide lockdown in New Zealand"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nitrogen (N) fertilization is one of the main inputs to increase crop yield and food production.

In this scenario, the improvement of nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) will be an essential strategy for sustainable agriculture. Here, we compared two pairs of NUE-contrasting eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) genotypes, employing GC-MS and UPLC-qTOF-MS-based technologies to determine the differential profiles of primary and secondary metabolites in root and shoot tissues, under N starvation as well as at short- and long-term N-limiting resupply. Firstly, differences in the primary metabolism pathways of shoots related to alanine, aspartate and glutamate; starch, sucrose and glycine; serine and threonine; and in secondary metabolites biosynthesis were detected. An integrated analysis between differentially accumulated metabolites and expressed transcripts highlighted a key role of glycine accumulation and the related glyA transcript in the N-use-efficient genotypes to cope with N-limiting stress. Interestingly, a correlation between both sucrose synthase (SUS)- and fructokinase (scrK)-transcript abundances, as well as D-glucose and D-fructose accumulation, appeared useful to distinguish the N-use-efficient genotypes. Furthermore, increased levels of L-aspartate and L-asparagine in the N-use-efficient genotypes at short-term low-N exposure were detected. Granule-bound starch synthase (WAXY) and endoglucanase (E3.2.1.4) downregulation at long-term N stress was observed.

Also, we focused on several molecular insights that could explain why IBD patients appear to not have higher risks of infection and worse outcome in COVID-19 than the general population, in attempt to provide scientific support for safer decisions in IBD patient care. Methods. PubMed electronic database was interogated for relevant articles involving data about common molecular pathways and shared treatment strategies between SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, Neural Covidex, an artificial intelligence tool, was used to answer queries about pathogenic coronaviruses and possible IBD interactions using the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19).

The aim of this study was to survey junior high and high school students in China to better understand the psychological consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and stress, of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey using structural questionnaires was conducted from April 7, 2020, to April 24, 2020. Demographic information and general information related to the pandemic were collected. Psychological consequences were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale. Influencing factors were assessed by the Brief Resilience Scale and Coping Style Questionnaire. RESULTS: Our sample comprised 493 junior high school students (male = 239, mean age = 13.93 years) and 532 high school students (male = 289, mean age = 17.08 years). Resilience and positive coping were protective factors for the occurrence of depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms in junior high and high school students (p < .05). Positive coping was a protective factor for trauma-related distress in junior high school students (p < .05). Negative coping is a risk factor for depression, anxiety, stress symptoms, and trauma-related distress in junior high and high school students (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, more than one fifth of junior high and high school students' mental health was affected. Our findings suggested that resilience and positive coping lead to better psychological and mental health status among students.

No available data exist so far regarding safety, efficacy and toxicology of these vaccines when administered during pregnancy. Most of the Obstetrics and Gynecology societies suggested that pregnant could agree to be vaccinated, after a thorough counseling of risks and benefits with their gynecologists, thus leading to an autonomous decision. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the attitude to COVID-19 vaccination in pregnant and breastfeeding women in Italy. Study design: A survey was made at University of Naples Federico II and University of Rome Tor Vergata Ospedale Cristo Re on pregnant and breastfeeding women asking their perspectives on the available vaccines after reading the recommendations issued by our national Obstetrics, Gynecology and Neonatology societies. The questionnaire included 12 items finalized to evaluate general features of the women and 6 items specifically correlated to their attitudes towards the SARS-COV-2 vaccination. Chi square (2) or Fisher exact tests were used to compare group differences of categorical variables and Wilcoxon signed rank or Mann Whitney U test for continuous variables. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University of Naples Federico II (ref. no. 409/2020), and University of Rome Tor Vergata Ospedale Cristo Re (ref. #Ost4-2020). Results: Most of the included women did not agree to eventually receive SARS-COV-2 vaccine during pregnancy (40, 28.2% vs 102, 71.8%). Being pregnant was considered a determinant factor to refuse the vaccine prophylaxis (99, 69.7% vs 43, 30.3%; 2= 24.187, p<0.001), even if a very large percentage declared to be generally in favor of vaccines (128, 90.1% vs 14, 9.9%; 2= 6.091, p=0.014) and most of them confirmed they received or would receive other recommended vaccines during pregnancy (75, 52.8% vs 67, 47.2%; 2= 10.996, p=0.001). Conclusion: Urgent data are needed on safety, efficacy and toxicology of SARS-COV-2 vaccines during pregnancy to modify this trend and to help obstetricians during the counselling. Furthermore, pregnant women should be included in future vaccine development trials to not incur again in such uncertainty.","output":"Pregnant women perspectives on SARS-COV-2 vaccine Condensation: Most of Italian pregnant women would not agree to get the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, irrespective of having features of high risk themselves, or being high-risk pregnancies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Los estudios psicolgicos de las organizaciones, sobre el capital humano, han demostrado que este factor aumenta en la medida que se intensifican las demandas ambientales, pero es el rasgo intelectual el que adquiere mayor valor al ser considerado como el principal activo intangible de una organizacin.

We found that MERS-CoV infection induced pyroptosis and over-activation of complement in human macrophages. The hDPP4-Tg mice infected with MERS-CoV overexpressed caspase-1 in the spleen and showed high IL-1 levels in serum, suggesting that pyroptosis occurred after infection. However, when the C5a-C5aR1 axis was blocked by an anti-C5aR1 antibody (Ab), expression of caspase-1 and IL-1 fell. These data indicate that MERS-CoV infection induces overactivation of complement, which may contribute to pyroptosis and inflammation. Pyroptosis and inflammation were suppressed by inhibiting C5aR1.

While there have been several reviews published on COVID-19 and population health disparities generally-including some with attention to HIV-none has focused on sexual health (ie, STI care, female sexual health, sexual behaviour). We have conducted a scoping review focused on sexual health (excluding reproductive health (RH), intimate partner violence (IPV) and gender-based violence (GBV)) in the COVID-19 era, examining sexual behaviours and sexual health outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focused on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and COVID-19 was conducted on 15 September 2020. Multiple bibliographical databases were searched. Study selection conformed to Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Reviewers' Manual 2015 Methodology for JBI Scoping Reviews. We only included English-language original studies. RESULTS: We found that men who have sex with men may be moving back toward pre-pandemic levels of sexual activity, and that STI and HIV testing rates seem to have decreased. There was minimal focus on outcomes such as the economic impact on sexual health (excluding RH, IPV and GBV) and STI care, especially STI care of marginalised populations. In terms of population groups, there was limited focus on sex workers or on women, especially women's sexual behaviour and mental health. We noticed limited use of qualitative techniques. Very few studies were in low/middle-income countries (LMICs).

In order to manage and maintain stable productivity, it is important to establish policies for biosecurity. Infectious respiratory diseases are a major threat to poultry farming. Avian influenza and Newcastle disease have been reported in Myanmar, but no scientific information is available for other respiratory pathogens, such as mycoplasmas and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Identifying the genotypes and serotypes of IBVs is especially important to inform vaccination programs. In this study, we detected Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), M. synoviae (MS), and IBV in several poultry farms in Myanmar. RESULTS: Samples were collected from 20 farms in three major poultry farming areas in Myanmar, and MG, MS, and IBV were detected on two, four, and eight farms, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the observed MG and MS isolates were not identical to vaccine strains. Three different genotypes of IBV were detected, but none was an unknown variant. CONCLUSIONS: Mycoplasmas and IBV were detected on poultry farms in Myanmar.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published gastrointestinal symptoms and detection of virus in stool and also summarized data from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong. METHODS: We collected data from the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong (N = 59; diagnosis from February 2 through February 29, 2020),and searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and 3 Chinese databases through March 11, 2020, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We analyzed pooled data on the prevalence of overall and individual gastrointestinal symptoms (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort) using a random effects model. RESULTS: Among the 59 patients with COVID-19 in Hong Kong, 15 patients (25.4%) had gastrointestinal symptoms, and 9 patients (15.3%) had stool that tested positive for virus RNA. Stool viral RNA was detected in 38.5% and 8.7% among those with and without diarrhea, respectively (P = .02). The median fecal viral load was 5.1 log10 copies per milliliter in patients with diarrhea vs 3.9 log10 copies per milliliter in patients without diarrhea (P = .06). In a meta-analysis of 60 studies comprising 4243 patients, the pooled prevalence of all gastrointestinal symptoms was 17.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3-24.5); 11.8% of patients with nonsevere COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 4.1-29.1), and 17.1% of patients with severe COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms (95% CI, 6.9-36.7). In the meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of stool samples that were positive for virus RNA was 48.1% (95% CI, 38.3-57.9); of these samples, 70.3% of those collected after loss of virus from respiratory specimens tested positive for the virus (95% CI, 49.6-85.1). CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from the Hong Kong cohort of patients with COVID-19 and a meta-analysis of findings from publications, we found that 17.6% of patients with COVID-19 had gastrointestinal symptoms.

Data sources The authors used the population, intervention, control and outcomes (PICO) question format to perform a systematic online search in Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science. All the databases were explored with no time limit until April 2020. Study selection Randomised clinical trials were included in this systematic review. No inclusion or exclusion criteria are mentioned in this study and it is limited to bacterial contamination studies. Data extraction and synthesis The authors extracted the following information from the included studies: authors; article publication year; study design; sampling size and allocation of test and control groups; intervention details; type and description of periodontal prophylaxis procedures; and primary outcomes. They focused on statistically significant findings and the reduction of bacterial aerosol contamination between groups was measured by colony forming units (CFU) using means and percentages. The primary outcome was that bacterial count expressed as CFU on blood agar plates. If permissible, they calculated the mean CFU reduction in the included studies and reported them. The authors also assessed the studies' risk of bias using the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials. Results In total, 30 randomised controlled trials were included, 21 of which assessed the preprocedural rinsing and the remaining nine focused on other interventions. The bacterial incubation protocol differed among studies. The data collection sites differed among the studies in terms of the number of samples obtained, position, direction and distance from the subjects' mouths. There were no marked differences in the CFU reduction regarding the periodontal prophylaxis devices used and the location of aerosol sampling collection from these studies. Nearly half of the studies (52.4%, 11/21) collected the sample at or near the operator and dental assistant. Chlorhexidine (CHX) rinse was mostly tested (80.9%, 17/21) with various concentrations and volumes. Among studies comparing CHX with other agents (71.4%, 15/21), CHX was more effective for the better part of studies, with more than half of the studies (7/15) reporting over a 70% reduction in CFU when using CHX preprocedural mouth rinse. Conclusions Evidence corroborates the effectiveness of preprocedural mouth rinses, especially CHX, in reducing the bacterial contamination of aerosols in periodontal, non-surgical prophylaxis compared with mouth rinsing with water, or with no rinsing. Nevertheless, the low-quality of evidence and the high heterogeneity among the included studies warn that one should be cautious in generalising the findings of this study to other settings and contaminating agents, like viruses.

Early detection of severe cases of the disease remains a major challenge. Here, we performed clinical and laboratory profiling of COVID-19 to explore the early warning indicators of severe cases. Methods An analysis of the evolution during the hospitalization of clinical and laboratory findings from 78 confirmed COVID-19 patients and the associated risk factors. Results Of the 78 patients who were classified as un-severe at admission, 60 patients(stable group) were stable as mild cases until discharge, and the remaining 18 patients progressed to severe cases(exacerbated group) during hospitalization. Compared with stable patients, exacerbated patients exhibited older, higher BMI values and higher proportion of smokers. In the exacerbated patients, the median time from onset to deterioration was 7.5 days. Before the time point(days 0C7 from onset), we observed higher-levels of White blood cells(WBC), neutrophil, Neutrophi-Lymphocyte-Ratio(NLR), Lactose-dehydrogenase(LDH), D-dimer, and lower-levels of albumin in the exacerbated group, compared with the stable group. In the second week after the time point, the exacerbated patients displayed lower numbers of lymphocytes, CD3 + , and CD8 + T-cells, and higher-levels of C-reactive protein(CRP), erythrocyte-sedimentation-rate(ESR), Alanine-aminotransferase(ALT),Aspartate-aminotransferase(AST), and Interleukin-6. In the third week, the highest temperature and the proportion of febrile patients declined. All of the laboratory indicators gradually improved. Conclusions Advanced age and smoking history could be risk factors for COVID-19 progression.

Next, we characterize the in vivo function of a circRNA generated by the sulfateless gene (circSfl), which is consistently upregulated, particularly in the brain and muscle, of diverse long-lived insulin mutants. Strikingly, lifespan extension of insulin mutants is dependent on circSfl, and overexpression of circSfl alone is sufficient to extend the lifespan. Moreover, circSfl is translated into a protein that shares the N terminus and potentially some functions with the full-length Sfl protein encoded by the host gene.

RESULTS: Of 324 patients who presented with stroke, 65 (20%) were diagnosed with non-traumatic ICH: 8 had confirmed and 3 had highly suspected COVID-19. Nine (82%) had at least one associated risk factor for ICH. Three ICHs occurred during inpatient anticoagulation. More than half (6) suffered either deep or cerebellar hemorrhages; only 2 were lobar hemorrhages. Two of 8 patients with severe pneumonia survived. During the NYC COVID-19 peak period in April, ICH comprised the highest percentage of all strokes (40%), and then steadily decreased week-after-week (pa?=a?0.02). SBPV and NLR were moderately and weakly positively correlated to discharge modified Rankin Scale, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 associated ICH is often associated with at least one known ICH risk factor and severe pneumonia. There was a suggestive relative surge in ICH among all stroke types during the first peak of the NYC pandemic. It is important to be vigilant of ICH as a possible and important manifestation of COVID-19.","output":"Intracranial Hemorrhage in COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Effective auscultations are often hard to implement in isolation wards. To date, little is known about the characteristics of pulmonary auscultation in novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the features and clinical significance of pulmonary auscultation in COVID-19 pneumonia using an electronic stethoscope in isolation wards. METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational study was conducted among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at Wuhan Red-Cross Hospital during the period from January 27, 2020, to February 12, 2020. Standard auscultation with an electronic stethoscope was performed and electronic recordings of breath sounds were analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients with average age of 60.6 years were enrolled. The most common symptoms were cough (73.7%) during auscultation. Most cases had bilateral lesions (96.4%) such as multiple ground-glass opacities (69.1%) and fibrous stripes (21.8%). High-quality auscultation recordings (98.8%) were obtained, and coarse breath sounds, wheezes, coarse crackles, fine crackles, and Velcro crackles were identified. Most cases had normal breath sounds in upper lungs, but the proportions of abnormal breath sounds increased in the basal fields where Velcro crackles were more commonly identified at the posterior chest. The presence of fine and coarse crackles detected 33/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 84.6% and specificity 12.5%) and 8/9 patients with consolidation (sensitivity 88.9% and specificity 15.2%), while the presence of Velcro crackles identified 16/39 patients with ground-glass opacities (sensitivity 41% and specificity 81.3%). CONCLUSIONS: The abnormal breath sounds in COVID-19 pneumonia had some consistent distributive characteristics and to some extent correlated with the radiologic features. Such evidence suggests that electronic auscultation is useful to aid diagnosis and timely management of the disease. Further studies are indicated to validate the accuracy and potential clinical benefit of auscultation in detecting pulmonary abnormalities in COVID-19 infection.","output":"Characteristics of Pulmonary Auscultation in Patients with 2019 Novel Coronavirus in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 poses a particular threat to refugees in Africa.

Hence, other therapeutic options that will allow us to obtain a quick and safe antidepressant effect by modulating glutamatergic transmission are needed. Antagonists of mGlu2/3 receptors, which share some mechanisms of action with ketamine, may be good candidates to obtain this effect. Here, we show that the metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 induced a dose-dependent antidepressant-like effect in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in C57BL/6J mice after both single and subchronic (three-day) administration. Furthermore, a noneffective dose of LY341495 (0.3 mg/kg) given jointly with a noneffective dose of ketamine (3 mg/kg) reversed the CUMS-induced behavioral effects, indicating that coadministration of ketamine with an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist might allow its therapeutically effective dose to be lowered. Western blot results indicate that mTOR pathway activation might be involved in the mechanism of action of this drug combination. Moreover, the combined doses of both substances did not produce undesirable behavioral effects characteristic of a higher dose of ketamine (10 mg/kg) commonly used in rodent studies to induce antidepressant effects. Coadministration of low doses of ketamine and LY341495 did not induce the hyperactivity typical of NMDA channel blockers, did not disturb short-term memory in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, and did not disturb motor coordination in the rotarod test. Our research not only confirmed the earlier data on the rapid antidepressant effect of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists but also indicated that such compounds can safely lower the effective dose of ketamine.","output":"The group II mGlu receptor antagonist LY341495 induces a rapid antidepressant-like effect and enhances the effect of ketamine in the chronic unpredictable mild stress model of depression in C57BL/6J mice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION There is an enormous need for pain education among all health care professions before and after licensure. The study goal was to explore generic and chronic pain-specific factors that influenced uptake of a continuous education program for chronic pain, the Project Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) CHUM Douleur chronique. METHODS The study team conducted 20 semistructured virtual interviews among participants of the program. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and two analysts used a reflexive thematic analysis approach to generate study themes. RESULTS Five aspects facilitating engagement, continued participation, and uptake of the Project ECHO were identified: rapid access to reliable information, appraising one's knowledge, cultivating meaningful relationships, breaking the silos of learning and practice, and exponential possibilities of treatment orchestrations for a complex condition with no cure. Although participants' experiences of the program was positive overall, some obstacles to engagement and continued participation were identified: heterogeneity of participants' profiles, feelings of powerlessness and discouragement in the face of complex incurable pain conditions, challenges in applying recommendations, medical hierarchy, and missed opportunity for advocacy. DISCUSSION Many disease-specific and contextual factors contributed to an increased motivation to participate in the ECHO program. Some elements, such as the complexity of diagnosis and treatment, and the multidisciplinary requirements to manage cases were identified as elements motivating one's participation in the program but also acting as a barrier to knowledge uptake.

The mechanisms behind these host differences are still unclear. Here, we examined host response gene expression across infection status, viral load, age, and sex among shotgun RNA sequencing profiles of nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from 430 individuals with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and 54 negative controls. SARS-CoV-2 induced a strong antiviral response with up-regulation of antiviral factors such as OAS1-3 and IFIT1-3 and T helper type 1 (Th1) chemokines CXCL9/10/11, as well as a reduction in transcription of ribosomal proteins. SARS-CoV-2 culture in human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures replicated the in vivo antiviral host response 7 days post infection, with no induction of interferon-stimulated genes after 3 days. Patient-matched longitudinal specimens (mean elapsed time = 6.3 days) demonstrated reduction in interferon-induced transcription, recovery of transcription of ribosomal proteins, and initiation of wound healing and humoral immune responses. Expression of interferon-responsive genes, including ACE2, increased as a function of viral load, while transcripts for B cell-specific proteins and neutrophil chemokines were elevated in patients with lower viral load. Older individuals had reduced expression of the Th1 chemokines CXCL9/10/11 and their cognate receptor CXCR3, as well as CD8A and granzyme B, suggesting deficiencies in trafficking and/or function of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. Relative to females, males had reduced B cell-specific and NK cell-specific transcripts and an increase in inhibitors of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&#954;B) signaling, possibly inappropriately throttling antiviral responses. Collectively, our data demonstrate that host responses to SARS-CoV-2 are dependent on viral load and infection time course, with observed differences due to age and sex that may contribute to disease severity.","output":"In vivo antiviral host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 by viral load, sex, and age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lassa virus glycoprotein is synthesised as a precursor (preGP-C) into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum.

In this report, we investigated the effect of each N-glycan on proteolytic cleavage and cell surface transport by disrupting the consensus sequences of eleven potential N-glycan attachment sites individually. Five glycoprotein mutants with disrupted N-glycosylation sites were still proteolytically processed, whereas the remaining N-glycosylation sites are necessary for GP-C cleavage. Despite the lack of proteolytic processing, all cleavage-defective mutants were transported to the cell surface and remained completely endo H-sensitive.

Here, 112 active compounds were identified from Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza via network pharmacology approach. Ephedra-Glycyrrhiza pair enrichment analysis demonstrated that these compounds might participate in the cAMP, PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT and chemokine signaling pathways, which had a high correlation with respiratory, nervous, blood circulation and digestive system-related diseases.

Such a sizable computational cost hinders the broad applicability of smoothing splines.

In this paper, we investigate how lockdown affects loneliness in adolescents and potential protective factors. MethodsThis study examines 768 young people in Scotland age 12 to 17, who took part in TeenCovidLife surveys during and after the first national lockdown in 2020. Survey 1 ran from May to July 2020, during the first school closures period. Survey 2 ran from August to October 2020, after schools reopened for most pupils. Participants reported current loneliness and pre-pandemic loneliness. Participants also completed self-report measures of resilience and social support.ResultsLoneliness increased from pre-pandemic levels during lockdown and then decreased when restrictions eased. However, loneliness remained significantly higher post-lockdown compared to pre-pandemic. Predictors of loneliness were assessed with ordinal logistic regression. Greater resilience was associated with lower loneliness at all stages of lockdown, but older teens were more likely to be lonely post-lockdown. Greater peer support was associated with lower loneliness before lockdown. However, during lockdown, family support was associated with lower loneliness. After schools re-opened, participants with greater social support from school staff were 15% less likely to be lonely.ConclusionLoneliness was higher during lockdown than before lockdown. Moreover, loneliness remained higher after lockdown than before lockdown. However, resilience and social support in school may protect against this lingering loneliness.

Dry blood samples were used to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The questionnaires were analyzed to investigate demographic data and working conditions during the pandemic. Multivariable logistic mixed-effects models were applied. RESULTS: We observed 146 participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (5.2%) and 30 subjects with a borderline finding (1.1%). Seventy-four out of the 146 participants with SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies did not report a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (50.7%), while 27 participants without SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies reported a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (1.1%).

Models predicted 5-day risk of ICU admission with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.986 and 5-day risk of use of ventilation with an ROC-AUC of 0.995. The corresponding 5-day forecasting models predicted the needed ICU capacity with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.930 and use of ventilation with an R2 of 0.934. Performance was comparable but slightly reduced for 10-day forecasting models. Conclusions. Random Forest-based modelling can be used for accurate 5- and 10-day forecasting predictions of ICU resource requirements.","output":"Developing machine learning models for predicting intensive care unit resource use during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The purpose of this study was to utilize the Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the physical activity (PA) behaviors of college student athletes, including aerobic, muscle strengthening, and sport-specific conditioning PA.

Overall RD group comprises the retinitis pigmentosa, the age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the diabetic retinopathy (DR), and idiopathic epiretinal membrane formation. Endocrine, metabolic, and even lifestyles risk factors have been reported for these age-linked conditions that represent a public priority also in this COVID-19 emergency. Chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration characterize the disease evolution, with a consistent vitreoretinal interface impairment. As the vitreous chamber is significantly involved, the latest diagnostic technologies of imaging (retina) and biomarker detection (vitreous) have provided a huge input at both medical and surgical levels. Complement activation and immune cell recruitment/infiltration as well as detrimental intra/extracellular deposits occur in association with a reactive gliosis. The cell/tissue aging route shows a specific signal path and biomolecular profile characterized by the increased expression of several glial-derived mediators, including angiogenic/angiostatic, neurogenic, and stress-related factors (oxidative stress metabolites, inflammation, and even amyloid formation). The possibility to access vitreous chamber by collecting vitreous reflux during intravitreal injection or obtaining vitreous biopsy during a vitrectomy represents a step forward for an individualized therapy. As drug response and protein signature appear unique in each single patient, therapies should be individualized. This review addresses the current knowledge about biomarkers and pharmacological targets in these vitreoretinal diseases. As vitreous fluids might reflect the early stages of retinal sufferance and/or late stages of neurodegeneration, the possibility to modulate intravitreal levels of growth factors, in combination to anti-VEGF therapy, would open to a personalized therapy of retinal diseases.","output":"Biomarkers of Neurodegeneration and Precision Therapy in Retinal Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article reviews how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic, from late-January to early May, 2020, through the three-phase approach to learning: in-between learning, trial-and-error learning, and contingency learning.

We demonstrate for the first time that the low amounts of natural CyRPA antibodies exhibited functional parasite-neutralizing activity and that a CyRPA based vaccine formulation induces highly potent antibodies in rabbits. Importantly, the vaccine induced CyRPA antibodies exhibited a robust IC50 of 21.96 g/ml that is comparable to IC50 of antibodies against the leading blood stage vaccine candidate, RH5.

Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic through the real-time locating system (RTLS) and review of the electronic medical record (EMR) at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore. METHODS: Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers. The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review. Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.","output":"Use of a Real-Time Locating System for Contact Tracing of Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic at an Infectious Disease Center in Singapore: Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The objectives were: to measure the proportion of aspirated material used to make direct slides for rapid onsite evaluation (ROSE) at endobronchial (EBUS) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in suspected thoracic malignancy; and to correlate pass weights with ROSE category and needle size. METHOD: All EBUS and EUS cases for possible thoracic malignancy October 2018-May 2019 were included. All material from each pass was expelled into a Petri dish. One drop of material was placed on each of two slides; one used for ROSE, the other fixed and remaining material processed to cell block. Dish and slides were weighed before and after this procedure on a sensitive balance and weight of aspirate and slide material calculated. When ROSE identified malignancy, slide production ceased but target sampling for ancillary studies continued. RESULTS: ROSE accuracy was 96.8%. Mean percentage by target of aspirated material used to make direct slides for ROSE was 1.9% in malignant cases and 3.6% in non-malignant cases (P = .027 for difference).

Persistence of most frequently reported symptoms was assessed at 6 weeks and, among symptomatic patients, at 12 weeks from the onset of symptoms. Predictors of impaired general health over time were identified using an ordinal multilevel multivariate model. RESULTS: A total of 448 patients (55% men, median age 56 years) were enrolled. WHO-CPS showed mild, moderate and severe disease in 48%, 42% and 10% of patients at admission and mild disease in all patients at follow-up, respectively. BI and aSGRQ were normal in 96% and 93% patients before COVID-19 but only in 47% and 16% at COVID-19 diagnosis and in 87% and 65% at 6-week follow-up.

RESULTS Between 2002 and 2016, there was a decrease in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, which reached a statistical significance for girls. The prevalence of overweight, including obesity, was high (low-SEP=30.5%; high-SEP=20.5%) and a widening of socioeconomic inequalities was found. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children had more than 2 times the odds of having obesity than children from higher-SEP, even after adjusting for sex, physical activity and screen-time.

These simulations explicitly resolve the formation of proto-globular clusters (GCs) self-consistently, where 17-39% of stars form in bound clusters during starbursts. Using post-processing Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations of ionizing radiation, we compute f_esc from cluster stars and non-cluster stars formed during a starburst over ~100 Myr in each galaxy. We find that the averaged f_esc over the lifetime of a star particle follows a similar distribution for cluster stars and non-cluster stars. Clusters tend to have low f_esc in the first few Myrs, presumably because they form preferentially in more extreme environments with high optical depths; the f_esc increases later as feedback starts to disrupt the natal cloud. On the other hand, non-cluster stars formed between cluster complexes or in the compressed shell at the front of a superbubble can also have high f_esc. We find that cluster stars on average have comparable f_esc to non-cluster stars. This result is robust across several star formation models in our simulations.

The urgent demand for PPE induced interdisciplinary cooperation to overcome the shortages, and additive manufacturing proved to be ideal for the crisis situation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the possibilities of implementing additive manufacturing technologies in the interventional fabrication of protective face shields for medical staff. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An Ender 3 Pro 3D printer was used to print headbands and Cura 4.4 was chosen as the slicing software. Open source face shield designs were downloaded as standard tessellation language (STL) files and compared. Only models with scientific support were taken under consideration. RESULTS: The mean time for producing the headbands tested ranged from 59 min to almost 3 h, depending on the design. After setting up our low budget printer and choosing the Prusa RC 3 protective face shield as the main product, we were able to fabricate about 30 face shields per week at a cost of about ?1 each. During 4 weeks, 126 face shields were produced and delivered to various hospital wards, which substantially eased the shortages. CONCLUSIONS: Additive manufacturing enables immediate responses to needs in emergency situations, and allows for mass production of personal protective equipment in a short time due the rapid exchange of data among printer users.

In nine studies (N = 3,277), we examined whether discordant knowing-felt knowledge about something that one perceives as opposed by most others-underlies fanaticism. Across multifaceted approaches, experimentally manipulating participants' views to fall under this framework (e.g., \\"I am certain about X, but most other people think X is unknowable or wrong\\") heightened indicators of fanaticism, including aggression, determined ignorance, and wanting to join extreme groups in the service of these views. Additional analyses found that this effect occurs via threat-based mechanisms (Studies 1-7), can be intervened on to prevent fanaticism (Study 2), is conditional on the potency of opposition (Study 3), differs from effects on extremism (Study 4), and extends to mental representations of the self (Study 5). Generalizing these findings to real-world contexts, inducing participants with discordant knowledge about the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election and the morality of abortion heightened fanaticism regarding these topics (Studies 6 and 7).

A total of 520 rectal swab samples were collected from eight bat species in four geographic regions of southern China (Guangzhou, Yunfu, Huizhou, and Haikou city). Thirty-six (6.9%) samples from the following species tested positive for AdVs: Myotis ricketti, Miniopterus schreibersii, Scotophilus kuhlii, Taphozous melanopogon, Rhinolophus blythi, and Cynopterus sphinx. Eight novel AdVs were detected in 13.3% of the samples from C. sphinx. Of 328 fecal samples from patients with diarrhea, 16 (4.9%) were positive for classical human AdVs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that human AdVs shared low similarity (57.1-69.3%) with bat AdVs in deduced amino acid sequences of the AdV DPOL region. Thus, our study indicated that bat AdVs and human AdVs are species specific.

Similarly, viral infections can exert diverse selective pressures on populations of clonally related T cells. Technical limitations have nevertheless made it challenging to investigate the relationship between clonal selection and transcriptional phenotypes of virus-specific T cells. We therefore performed single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire and transcriptome sequencing of virus-specific CD8 T cells in murine models of acute, chronic and latent infection. We observed clear infection-specific populations corresponding to memory, effector, exhausted, and inflationary phenotypes. We further uncovered a mouse-specific and polyclonal T cell response, despite all T cells sharing specificity to a single viral epitope, which was accompanied by stereotypic TCR germline gene usage in all three infection types. Persistent antigen exposure during chronic and latent viral infections resulted in a higher proportion of clonally expanded T cells relative to acute infection. We furthermore observed a relationship between transcriptional heterogeneity and clonal expansion for all three infections, with highly expanded clones having distinct transcriptional phenotypes relative to less expanded clones. Together our work relates clonal selection to gene expression in the context of viral infection and further provides a dataset and accompanying software for the immunological community.","output":"Clonally Expanded Virus-Specific CD8 T Cells Acquire Diverse Transcriptional Phenotypes During Acute, Chronic, and Latent Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the fitness of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its mutational evolution is still a critical issue. We built a simplified computational model, called SpikePro, to predict the SARS-CoV-2 fitness from the amino acid sequence and structure of the spike protein. It contains three contributions: the inter-human transmissibility of the virus predicted from the stability of the spike protein, the infectivity computed in terms of the affinity of the spike protein for the ACE2 receptor, and the ability of the virus to escape from the human immune response based on the binding affinity of the spike protein for a set of neutralizing antibodies. Our model reproduces well the available experimental, epidemiological and clinical data on the impact of variants on the biophysical characteristics of the virus. For example, it is able to identify circulating viral strains that, by increasing their fitness, recently became dominant at the population level. SpikePro is a useful, freely available instrument which predicts rapidly and with good accuracy the dangerousness of new viral strains.

Surprisingly, participants are willing to pay more for the product when it has a white-toned label rather than a green-toned one. Follow-up path analysis, with Study 2 data, reveals that a white-toned label has both an indirect (through more favorable evaluations of the products environmental friendliness), as well as a direct impact on willingness to pay.

To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted. RESULTS: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Public Perceptions and Attitudes Toward COVID-19 Nonpharmaceutical Interventions Across Six Countries: A Topic Modeling Analysis of Twitter Data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The incorporation of nanofillers such as graphene into polymers has shown significant improvements in mechanical characteristics, thermal stability, and conductivity of resulting polymeric nanocomposites.

Besides the well-known autoimmune and inflammatory pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes, in many people, metabolic changes and inappropriate lifestyle favor a subtle chronic inflammatory state that contributes to development of insulin resistance and progressive loss of -cell function and mass, eventually resulting in metabolic syndrome or overt type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we review the anti-inflammatory effects of the extract of Hypericum perforatum L. (St. Johns wort, SJW) and its main active ingredients firstly in representative pathological situations on inflammatory basis and then in pancreatic  cells and in obese or diabetic animal models. The simultaneous and long-lasting inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways involved in pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced -cell dysfunction/death and insulin resistance make SJW particularly suitable for both preventive and therapeutic use in metabolic diseases. Hindrance of inflammatory cytokine signaling is likely dependent on the hyperforin content of SJW extract, but recent data reveal that hypericin can also exert relevant protective effects, mediated by activation of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/protein kinase cAMP-dependent (PKA)/adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, against high-fat-diet-induced metabolic abnormalities. Actually, the mechanisms of action of the two main components of SJW appear complementary, strengthening the efficacy of the plant extract. Careful quantitative analysis of SJW components and suitable dosage, with monitoring of possible drugCdrug interaction in a context of remarkable tolerability, are easily achievable pre-requisites for forthcoming clinical applications.","output":"Protective Role of St. Johns Wort and Its Components Hyperforin and Hypericin against Diabetes through Inhibition of Inflammatory Signaling: Evidence from In Vitro and In Vivo Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in the design and production of fabric face coverings.

The open/closed conformational transitions of the flap whereby capping the active site, are involved in the enzymatic activity of DPP4.

Although call centers can facilitate such communication, no published reports describing their outcomes exist. In advance of the expected COVID-19 outbreak in Israel, the Israel Center for Disease Control established a call center dedicated to queries from healthcare professionals. METHODS: The call center operated from February 5, 2020 (week 6) to May 14, 2020 (week 20). Data on calls received, including date and time, caller characteristics, questions and responses were recorded in a database designed for this purpose. The volume, sources and content of queries were analyzed. RESULTS: In 15 weeks of operation, the call center responded to 6623 calls. The daily number of calls ranged from 1 to 371 (mean 79.8, median 40), peaking on week 12, 2 weeks prior to a peak in new COVID-19 cases. Callers were predominantly physicians (62.4%), nurses (18.7%) and administrators (4.4%). Most worked in primary care clinics (74.2%) or hospitals (8.7%). Among physicians, 42.3% were family physicians or internists, and 10.0% were pediatricians. The issues most commonly addressed were home quarantine (21.6%), criteria for suspected cases (20.6%), and SARS-CoV2 testing (14.1%).

To do this, the antigenic sequence Asp-Leu-Pro-Pro-Asn-Ser-Asp-Val-Val-Asp, from a coronavirus, was inserted genetically in the permissive site around amino acid position 153 of the LamB protein (maltose and lambda phage receptor) of Escherichia coli. When the hybrid lamB gene is transcribed, the epitope becomes presented on the surface of the bacterial cells in a configuration available to specific antibodies. To validate this notion in nonenteric bacteria, the expression and correct processing of LamB were confirmed by coupling the lamB gene to the salicylate-responsive Psa1 promoter of the NAH7 (naphthalene degradation) plasmid in Pseudomonas putida. Subsequently, a hybrid lamB gene carrying the sequence of the coronavirus antigen was placed downstream of the m-toluate-responsive Pm promoter of the TOL (toluene degradation) plasmid. Exposure of the epitope on the Pseudomonas cell surface was monitored through fluorescence of whole cells treated with a monoclonal antibody against the heterologous antigen. Fluorescence emission was dependent on the presence of m-toluate in the medium, thus permitting detection of the Pm promoter switching on by simple optical inspection of individual cells, even in situations when these are a very minor component of a complex bacterial community.","output":"Nondisruptive detection of activity of catabolic promoters of Pseudomonas putida with an antigenic surface reporter system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The fast-advancing progress in the research of nanomedicine and microneedle applications in the past two decades has suggested that the combination of the two concepts could help to overcome some of the challenges we are facing in healthcare.

Nanoparticles as drug vesicles can protect their cargo and deliver it to the target site, while evading the body's defence mechanisms. Unfortunately, despite intense research on nanomedicine in the past 20 years, we still haven't answered some crucial questions, e.g. about their colloidal stability in solution and their optimal formulation, which makes the translation of this exciting technology from the lab bench to a viable product difficult. Dissolvable microneedles could be an effective way to maintain and stabilise nano-sized formulations, whilst enhancing the ability of nanoparticles to penetrate the stratum corneum barrier. Both concepts have been individually investigated fairly well and many analytical techniques for tracking the fate of nanomaterials with their precious cargo, both in vitro and in vivo, have been established. Yet, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive overview of the analytical tools encompassing the concepts of microneedles and nanoparticles with specific and successful examples is missing.

However, internet searches are a complex and dynamic process that can be fraught with subtleties and potential error. The mechanics of searching for and using electronic health (eHealth) information is ostensibly cognitively demanding; yet we know little about the role of neurocognitive abilities in this regard. Fifty-six young adults completed two naturalistic eHealth search tasks: fact-finding (eHealth Fact) and symptom-diagnosis (eHealth Search). Participants also completed neurocognitive tests of attention, psychomotor speed, learning/memory, and executive functions. Shorter eHealth symptom-diagnosis search time was related to better executive functions, while better eHealth symptom-diagnosis search accuracy was related to better episodic and prospective memory. In contrast, neither eHealth Fact search time nor its accuracy were related to any of the neurocognitive measures. Our findings suggest a differential relationship between neurocognitive abilities and eHealth search behaviors among young adults such that higher-order abilities may be implicated in eHealth searches requiring greater synthesis of information.

These rules are demonstrated by examples of quantitative analysis of many genomes from the human genome to the genomes of archaea and bacteria. The hyperbolic (harmonic) rules, speaking about the existence of algebraic invariants in full genomic sequences, are considered as candidates for the role of universal rules for the cooperative organization of genomes. The results concerns additionally the problem of the origin of life. The described phenomenological results were obtained as consequences of the previously published author's quantum-information model of long DNA sequences. The oligomer sums method was also applied to the analysis of long genes and viruses including the COVID-19 virus; this revealed, in characteristics of many of them, the phenomenon of such rhythmically repeating deviations from model hyperbolic sequences, which are associated with DNA triplets. In addition, an application of the oligomer sums method is shown to the analysis of amino acid sequences in long proteins like the protein Titin.

Anticoagulant treatments have demonstrated their efficacy in preventing VTE. However, when the bleeding risk is high, they are contraindicated, and mechanical devices are recommended. To date, mechanical prophylaxis has not been rigorously evaluated in any trials in ICU patients. METHODS In this multicenter, open-label, randomized trial with blinded evaluation of endpoints, we randomly assigned 407 patients with a high risk of bleeding to receive intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) associated with graduated compression stockings (GCS) or GCS alone for 6 days during their ICU stay. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a VTE between days 1 and 6, including nonfatal symptomatic documented VTE, or death due to a pulmonary embolism, or asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis detected by ultrasonography systematically performed on day 6. RESULTS The primary outcome was assessed in 363 patients (89.2%). By day 6, the incidence of the primary outcome was 5.6% (10 of 179 patients) in the IPC + GCS group and 9.2% (17 of 184 patients) in the GCS group (relative risk 0.60; 95% confidence interval 0.28-1.28; p = 0.19). Tolerance of IPC was poor in only 12 patients (6.0%). No intergroup difference in mortality rate was observed.

What is the impact of these changes on the bosses/teachers' and workers/students' experience? This article uses recent neuroscience research findings to explore how distance learning and smart working impact the following three pillars that reflect the organization of our brain and are at the core of school and office experiences: (a) the learning/work happens in a dedicated physical place; (b) the learning/work is carried out under the supervision of a boss/professor; and (c) the learning/work is distributed between team members/classmates. For each pillar, we discuss its link with the specific cognitive processes involved and the impact that technology has on their functioning. In particular, the use of videoconferencing affects the functioning of Global Positioning System neurons (neurons that code our navigation behavior), mirror neurons, self-attention networks, spindle cells, and interbrain neural oscillations. These effects have a significant impact on many identity and cognitive processes, including social and professional identity, leadership, intuition, mentoring, and creativity. In conclusion, just moving typical office and learning processes inside a videoconferencing platform, as happened in many contexts during the COVID-19 pandemic, can in the long term erode corporate cultures and school communities.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Rwanda in March 2020, presented new and unique challenges for infectious disease control. The objective of this paper is to characterize Rwanda's domestic response to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight effective strategies so that other countries, including high and middle-income countries, can learn from its innovative initiatives. Methods: Government publications describing Rwanda's healthcare capacity were first consulted to obtain the country's baseline context. Next, official government and healthcare system communications, including case counts, prevention and screening protocols, treatment facility practices, and behavioral guidelines for the public, were read thoroughly to understand the course of the pandemic in Rwanda and the specific measures in the response. Results: As of 31 December 2020, Rwanda has recorded 8,383 cumulative COVID-19 cases, 6,542 recoveries, and 92 deaths since the first case on 14 March 2020. The Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Centre, and the Epidemic and Surveillance Response division have collaborated on preparative measures since the pandemic began in January 2020. The formation of a Joint Task Force in early March led to the Coronavirus National Preparedness and Response Plan, an extensive six-month plan that established a national incident management system and detailed four phases of a comprehensive national response. Notable strategies have included disseminating public information through drones, robots for screening and inpatient care, and official communications through social media platforms to combat misinformation and mobilize a cohesive response from the population.

The increase of the CRP concentration as well as a certain threshold concentration of CRP are indicative of clinical deterioration to artificial ventilation. In COVID-19, virus-induced lung injury and the subsequent massive onset of inflammation often drives pulmonary fibrosis. Fibrosis of the lung usually proceeds as sequela to a severe course of COVID-19 and its consequences only show months later. CRP-mediated complement- and macrophage activation is suspected to be the main driver of pulmonary fibrosis and subsequent organ failure in COVID-19. Recently, CRP apheresis was introduced to selectively remove CRP from human blood plasma. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old, SARS-CoV-2 positive, male patient with the risk factor diabetes type 2 was referred with dyspnea, fever and fulminant increase of CRP. The patients lungs already showed a pattern enhancement as an early sign of incipient pneumonia. The oxygen saturation of the blood was  89%. CRP apheresis using the selective CRP adsorber (PentraSorb(?) CRP) was started immediately. CRP apheresis was performed via peripheral venous access on 4 successive days. CRP concentrations before CRP apheresis ranged from 47 to 133 mg/l. The removal of CRP was very effective with up to 79% depletion within one apheresis session and 1.2 to 2.14 plasma volumes were processed in each session. No apheresis-associated side effects were observed. It was at no point necessary to transfer the patient to the Intensive Care Unit or to intubate him due to respiratory failure. 10 days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, CRP levels stayed below 20 mg/l and the patient no longer exhibited fever. Fourteen days after the first positive SARS-CoV-2 test, the lungs showed no sign of pneumonia on X-ray. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on CRP apheresis in an early COVID-19 patient with fulminant CRP increase. Despite a poor prognosis due to his diabetes and biomarker profile, the patient was not ventilated, and the onset of pneumonia was reverted.","output":"Case Report: C-Reactive Protein Apheresis in a Patient With COVID-19 and Fulminant CRP Increase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present investigation informs a descriptive study of 1-(4-Hydroxyphenyl) -3-phenylprop-2-en-1-one compound, by using density functional theory at B3LYP method with 6-311G** basis set.

We used meta-analysis to pool the estimated prevalence of multimorbidity across studies, and used random-effects meta-regression and subgroup analysis to examine the association of heterogeneous prevalence estimates with study and measure characteristics. RESULTS 13 807 titles were screened, of which 193 met inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of multimorbidity was 42.4% (95% CI 38.9% to 46.0%) with high heterogeneity (I2 >99%). In adjusted meta-regression models, participant mean age and the number of conditions included in a measure accounted for 47.8% of heterogeneity in effect sizes. The estimated prevalence of multimorbidity was significantly higher in studies with older adults and those that included larger numbers of conditions. There was no significant difference in estimated prevalence between low-income or middle-income countries (36.8%) and high-income countries (44.3%), or between self-report (40.0%) and administrative/clinical databases (52.7%). CONCLUSIONS The pooled prevalence of multimorbidity was significantly higher in older populations and when studies included a larger number of baseline conditions. The findings suggest that, to improve study comparability and quality of reporting, future studies should use a common core conditions set for multimorbidity measurement and report multimorbidity prevalence stratified by sociodemographics.PROSPERO registration numberCRD42020172409.","output":"Variation in the estimated prevalence of multimorbidity: systematic review and meta-analysis of 193 international studies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The objective of this review is to provide background on common theories of grief, describe the impact of grief on older adults and to introduce various modalities that are currently used and/or being researched for treatment. The objective is also to condense information and identify what has been found beneficial versus what has been found lacking. A brief examination of overlap of other disorders is done. It also will suggest what further research is necessary on this subject, and highlight what research is being done during the COVID-19 Pandemic. FINDINGS: The latest research of grief primarily involves refining the definitions of grief. More concrete definitions of grief will help for better screening tools, and thus target interventions more appropriately. There is considerable need for applying it to the unique and real-world COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: Grief disorders are relatively common and the symptoms overlap other disorders. Since the treatments differ, identifying grief disorders is important, especially in the elderly who are more susceptible to grief disorders. Therapy improves grief better than medications, but medications will help with any co-occurring disorders. No clear superior therapy has been identified but research continues. The pandemic has highlighted the need to refine the definitions of grief disorders and to treat them effectively.","output":"Review of Grief Therapies for Older Adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article summarises the findings from a review of publications related to healthcare leadership that were published during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020.

Commercially available reagents, primarily targeted to human cells, were utilised to assess the phenotype and activation status of key immune cell types and cytokines in naive and infected animals. Single cell suspensions of blood, spleen, and lung were examined. Generally, the phenotype of cells was comparable between humans and marmosets, with approximately 63% of all lymphocytes in the blood of marmosets being T cells, 25% B-cells, and 12% NK cells. The percentage of neutrophils in marmoset blood were more similar to human values than mouse values.

Their commercial development is still hindered by noble platinum (Pt) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which not only determine the energy conversion efficiency and service life but also are closely related to the cost and broad application of fuel cells. Given the bright and enormous future of fuel cells, ORR catalysts should possess highly efficient performance yet meet the acceptable Pt costs for large-scale application. Extensive efforts are concentrated on the optimization of Pt-based nanostructures and upgradation of functional carriers to achieve the low-cost and high-activity Pt-based catalysts. By improving the Pt utilization and accessible surface, reducing Pt consumption and catalyst costs, accelerating mass exchange and electron transfer, alleviating the corrosion and agglomeration of carriers and Pt, accompanying with the assistance of robust yet effective functional supports, the service level and life of Pt-based electrocatalysts would be significantly improved and fuel cells could get into commercial market covering broader applications.In this Account, we focus on the recent development of Pt-based catalysts to figure out the problems associated with ORR catalysts in fuel cells. Recent development of Pt-based catalysts is discussed in different stages: (1) multiscale development of Pt-based nanostructures; (2) multielement regulation over Pt-based alloy composition; (3) upgradation of carbon and noncarbon support architectures; (4) development of integrated Pt-based catalysts for fuel cells. Finally, we propose some future issues (such as reaction mechanism, dynamic evolutions, and structure-activity relationship) for Pt-based catalysts, which mainly involve the preparation strategy of Pt-integrated catalysts (combination of Pt nanostructures with nanocarbons), performance evaluation (standard measurement protocols, laboratory-level rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements, application-level membrane electrode assembly (MEA) service test), advanced interpretation techniques (spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and in situ monitoring), and cutting-edge simulation/calculations and artificial intelligence (simulation, calculations, machine learning, big data screening). This Account calls for the comprehensive development of multiscale, multicomponent, and high-entropy Pt-based alloy nanostructures, and novel and stable carriers, which provide more available options for rational design of low-cost and high-performance Pt-integrated ORR catalysts.

We conducted a multicenter surveillance study to investigate recent trends in species distribution and antifungal susceptibility patterns among IC-associated Candida spp. in Beijing, China, from 2016 to 2017. Materials and Methods: A total of 1496 non-duplicate Candida isolates, recovered from blood and other sterile body fluids of IC patients, were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry combined with ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region sequencing. Broth microdilution-based susceptibility testing using six antifungal agents was also conducted. Results: Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species (49.9%), followed by Candida tropicalis (15.5%), Candida glabrata (14.7%) and Candida parapsilosis (14.2%). No significant differences in species distribution were observed when compared with a 2012-2013 dataset. Overall, the rates of susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole were high among C. albicans (98% and 97.2%, respectively) and C. parapsilosis species complex (91.1% and 92%, respectively) isolates but low among C. tropicalis (81.5% and 81.1%, respectively) isolates. In addition, the rate of azole resistance among C. tropicalis isolates increased significantly (1.8-fold, P<0.05) compared with that observed in 2012-2013, while micafungin resistance rates were <5% for all tested Candida species. Conclusion: Our results suggest that species distribution has remained stable among IC-associated Candida isolates in Beijing.

This study aimed to compare the clinical and radiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and endemic HCoVs infection in adult hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This study was performed at a university-affiliated tertiary hospital in the Republic of Korea, between January 1, 2015, and July 31, 2020.

The study was conducted between February 7 th and March 31 st 2020 in Union Hospital. Patients were randomly assigned to the pulmonary rehabilitation exercise group or the control group. Primary outcome was improvement of activity of daily living (ADL). Secondary outcome was changes of muscle strength assessed by manual muscle test (MMT) and arterial blood gas analysis. Length of hospital staying (LOS) and adverse events related to physical activity were also observed. Results: : A total of sixty patients were in analysis, and thirty patients were in PR group. Patients had a mean age of 54.4310.57 years. A statistically and clinically significant increase in ADL was observed in PR group (75.00 [66.25,90.00] to 100.00 [100.00,100.00], p<0.001).

With this target at an end, we aimed to assess global trends in the adoption of WHO PrEP recommendations into national guidelines and numbers of PrEP users, defined as people who received oral PrEP at least once in a given year, and to estimate future trajectories of PrEP use. METHODS: In this global summary and forecasting study, data on adoption of WHO PrEP recommendations and numbers of PrEP users were obtained through the Global AIDS Monitoring system and WHO regional offices. Trends in these indicators for 2016C19 by region and for 2019 by country were described, including by gender and priority populations where data were available. PrEP user numbers were forecasted until 2023 by selecting countries with at least 3 years of PrEP user data as example countries in each region to represent possible future PrEP user trajectories. PrEP user growth rates observed in example countries were applied to countries in corresponding regions under different scenarios, including a COVID-19 disruption scenario with static global PrEP use in 2020. FINDINGS: By the end of 2019, 120 (67%) of 180 countries with data had adopted the WHO PrEP recommendations into national guidelines (23 in 2019 and 30 in 2018). In 2019, there were about 626 000 PrEP users across 77 countries, including 260 000 (416%) in the region of the Americas and 213 000 (340%) in the African region; this is a 69% increase from about 370 000 PrEP users across 66 countries in 2018. Without COVID-19 disruptions, 09C11 million global PrEP users were projected by the end of 2020 and 24C53 million are projected by the end of 2023. If COVID-19 disruptions resulted in no PrEP user growth in 2020, the projected number of PrEP users in 2023 is 21C30 million. INTERPRETATION: Widespread adoption of WHO PrEP recommendations coincided with a global increase in PrEP use. Although the 2020 global PrEP target will be missed, strong future growth in PrEP use is possible. New PrEP products could expand the PrEP user base, and, with greater expansion of oral PrEP, further adoption of WHO PrEP recommendations, and simplified delivery, PrEP could contribute to ending AIDS by 2030.

So far, it has not been possible to decipher the rules that govern DNA sequence evolution due to the extreme complexity of the entire process. In our attempt to approach this issue we focus solely on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and deliberately disregard the role of natural selection. Hence, in this analysis, evolution refers to the accumulation of genetic alterations that originate from mutations and are transmitted through generations without being subjected to natural selection. We have developed a software tool that allows modelling of a DNA sequence as a one-dimensional cellular automaton (CA) with four states per cell which correspond to the four DNA bases, i.e. A, C, T and G. The four states are represented by numbers of the quaternary number system. Moreover, we have developed genetic algorithms (GAs) in order to determine the rules of CA evolution that simulate the DNA evolution process. Linear evolution rules were considered and square matrices were used to represent them. If DNA sequences of different evolution steps are available, our approach allows the determination of the underlying evolution rule(s). Conversely, once the evolution rules are deciphered, our tool may reconstruct the DNA sequence in any previous evolution step for which the exact sequence information was unknown. The developed tool may be used to test various parameters that could influence evolution. We describe a paradigm relying on the assumption that mutagenesis is governed by a near-neighbour-dependent mechanism. Based on the satisfactory performance of our system in the deliberately simplified example, we propose that our approach could offer a starting point for future attempts to understand the mechanisms that govern evolution.

Is it possible to transfer a trained crop type classification model to retrace the historical spatial distribution of crop types? Taking the Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in China as the study area, this study first designed a 10 m crop type classification framework based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for crop type mapping in the current season. Then, its interannual transferability to accurately retrace historical crop distributions was tested. The framework used Sentinel-1/2 data as the satellite data source, combined percentile, and monthly composite approaches to generate classification metrics and employed a random forest classifier with 300 trees for crop classification. Based on the proposed framework, this study first developed a 10 m crop type map of the HID for 2020 with an overall accuracy (OA) of 0.89 and then obtained a 10 m crop type map of the HID for 2019 with an OA of 0.92 by transferring the trained model for 2020 without crop reference samples. The results indicated that the designed framework could effectively identify HID crop types and have good transferability to obtain historical crop type data with acceptable accuracy. Our results found that SWIR1, Green, and Red Edge2 were the top three reflectance bands for crop classification. The land surface water index (LSWI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were the top three vegetation indices for crop classification. April to August was the most suitable time window for crop type classification in the HID. Sentinel-1 information played a positive role in the interannual transfer of the trained model, increasing the OA from 90.73% with Sentinel 2 alone to 91.58% with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 together.","output":"An Interannual Transfer Learning Approach for Crop Classification in the Hetao Irrigation District, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The first licensed polymerase inhibitor, baloxavir marboxil was recently approved for the treatment of influenza A and B viruses. Furthermore, there is growing interest in testing the antiviral activity of baloxavir marboxil against Coronavirus. Despite its critical clinical value, there is no information on the degradation products, pathways or kinetics of baloxavir marboxil under various stress conditions. In this study, a new HPLC-MS chromatographic method for accurately quantifying baloxavir marboxil in the presence of its degradation products was developed. A study of degradation kinetics revealed that acidic, thermal neutral, and photolytic degradation reactions have zero-order kinetics, whereas basic and oxidative degradation reactions have first-order kinetics. The structural characterization of baloxavir marboxil degradation products was performed by coupling the optimized HPLC method to the triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer. The proposed approach was validated according to the International Council for Harmonisation Q2 (R1) requirements for accuracy, precision, robustness, specificity, and linearity.

METHODS The PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched for published cases using the search items \\"COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelitis\\", \\"COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND myelopathy\\", and \\"COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 AND spinal cord\\". RESULTS Thirty-three isolated cases were included in the present review, of which 14 were aged 60 years and above (range: 3-70 years). Eighteen patients had lung abnormalities on chest imaging. Eight patients had developed either an areflexic paraparesis or quadriparesis. In 17 patients, neuroimaging demonstrated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, while 3 cases showed neuroimaging changes in the spinal cord as a part of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis syndrome. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations revealed inflammatory changes in 18 patients. However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the CSF was discovered in 2 patients. In 2 patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were demonstrated in the CSF. Following treatment, 13 patients were able to walk. CONCLUSIONS A variety of COVID-19-related spinal cord manifestations, such as acute transverse myelitis, acute necrotizing myelitis, SARS-CoV-2 myelitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, hypoxic myelopathy, MOG antibody-associated myelitis, spinal cord infarction, and spinal epidural abscess, have been reported.

Chinese herbs were used in its treatment. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the possible effectiveness and safety of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for SARS patients. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL 2012, Issue 3, MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 4, 2012), EMBASE (1990 to March 2012) and the Chinese Biomedical Literature (Issue 3, 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines versus Western medicines alone for patients diagnosed with SARS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors (XL, MZ) independently extracted trial data. We extracted dichotomous and continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous data, we used risk ratio (RR). For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD). We calculated overall results based on the random-effects model if heterogeneity existed between studies. If no heterogeneity was detected between the studies, we used the fixed-effect model. We used the Z score and the Chi(2) test with significance being set at P < 0.05 to test heterogeneity. No severe adverse events were reported. MAIN RESULTS We included 12 RCTs and one quasi-RCT. A total of 640 SARS patients and 12 Chinese herbs were identified. We did not find Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines decreased mortality versus Western medicines alone. Two herbs may improve symptoms. Five herbs may improve lung infiltrate absorption. Four herbs may decrease the dosage of corticosteroids. Three herbs may improve the quality of life of SARS patients. One herb may shorten the length of hospital stay. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines made no difference in decreasing mortality versus Western medicines alone. It is possible that Chinese herbs combined with Western medicines may improve symptoms, quality of life and absorption of pulmonary infiltration, and decrease the corticosteroid dosage for SARS patients. The evidence is weak because of the poor quality of the included trials.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case series, including patients under 18 years of age admitted to respiratory triage and hospitalized with COVID-19 infection in two hospital centers. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were documented. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For the analysis, patients were classified into three groups: no comorbidities, immunocompromised, and with chronic disease. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients with COVID-19 were identified: 40 (74.1%) were admitted through respiratory triage. Of these, 28 (70%) were hospitalized, and 14 (25.9%) were already in the hospital. In addition, 26 (48.1%) presented comorbidities. A mild clinical course was observed in 14 cases (53.7%). The mean age was 6 years, with an interquartile range from 11 months to 13 years. The male sex was more frequent, representing 59.3%. Fever was the most common symptom in 74% of the patients. Lymphopenia was observed in 28.6%, and 69.3% had elevated C-reactive protein. Ground glass injuries were documented in 30.9% of COVID-19 cases; 11.1% of the patients required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Fever was the main symptom, and mild infection was the principal presentation.

It is important for the management at such destinations to prepare for, and respond to, health- and life-threatening infectious diseases, to mitigate any negative impact on local economy and society. Mosquito-borne infections, such as dengue, are rapidly spreading globally, including in Bali, Indonesia. However, travellers tend to be unaware of the health threats resulting from mosquito bites. Increased dengue incidence amongst travellers could also result in exposure of the local people to the infection. Traversing the disciplines of Travel Medicine, Entomology and Business Administration, we carried out a study comprising fieldwork and literature analyses, to address the proposed empowerment of hotels to disseminate information on dengue prevention and control to international travellers. The fieldwork included an outreach workshop and questionnaire, conducted by partnering the local health authorities and hotel association. Additionally, we carried out site visits to several hotels. The questionnaire revealed that only 67% of the participating hotel personnel know that dengue is mosquito-borne. Eighty-three percent of the facilities reported mosquito nuisance problems, and fogging was the most utilised control measure of choice. Our analyses indicate that there is a role for the hotel sector in promoting anti-dengue awareness and activities in Bali. Such an initiative could assist Bali to work towards the good health and well-being for the sustainable development goals.

This may lead to confusion and delays in the enablement of multicentre research projects. This study explores the effect of differing processes for Ethics and Governance in the establishment of the CovidSurg-Cancer study during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous, structured web-based questionnaire was designed using the Research Electronic Data Capture application (REDCap) platform to capture consultant surgeons, fellows, and trainees experience in the ethics application process. 'CovidSurg-Cancer' was an international multicentre collaborative study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the outcomes of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The ethics process to set up this observational study was used as to explore the differing processes applied across Australia. RESULTS: The CovidSurg-Cancer study was successfully set up in 14 hospitals. Four hospitals approved the study directly as an audit. Of the remaining sites, 10 ethics applications underwent Human Research Ethics Committee review following which two (14%) were subsequently approved as an audit activity and eight hospitals (57%) were given formal ethical approval with waiver of consent. Ethics application acceptance from another Australian Human Research Ethics Committee was provided with six applications; however, only three were reciprocated without the requirement for further agreements. A third of (30%) respondents suggested that the details of the application pathway, process and documentation were unclear.

METHODS: We examined 323 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Massachusetts General Hospital between March 11 and June 28, 2020 who received enteral nutrition. Systematic chart review determined prevalence, clinical characteristics, and hospital outcomes (ICU complications, length of stay, and mortality) of feeding intolerance. RESULTS: Feeding intolerance developed in 56% of the patients and most commonly manifested as large gastric residual volumes (83.9%), abdominal distension (67.2%), and vomiting (63.9%). Length of intubation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.08), &#8805;1 GI symptom on presentation (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.97), and severe obesity (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13-0.66) were independently associated with development of feeding intolerance. Compared to feed-tolerant patients, patients with incident feeding intolerance were significantly more likely to suffer cardiac, renal, hepatic, and hematologic complications during their hospitalization. Feeding intolerance was similarly associated with poor outcomes including longer ICU stay (median [IQR] 21.5 [14-30] vs. 15 [9-22] days, P < 0.001), overall hospitalization time (median [IQR] 30.5 [19-42] vs. 24 [15-35], P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (33.9% vs. 16.1%, P < 0.001).

Results from dose-responses, kinetics, and temperature-block experiments suggest that EV uptake is a low yield process (~1% spontaneous rate at 1 h). Further characterization of this limited EV uptake, through fractionation of membranes and cytosol, revealed cytosolic release (~30% of the uptaken EVs) in acceptor cells. This release is inhibited by bafilomycin A1 and overexpression of IFITM proteins, which prevent virus entry and fusion.

In the setting of the current pandemic, questions regarding the acceptability of exemptions have resurfaced, as schools and local governments struggle with how to safely return children to school. Anticipating that school attendance will be facilitated by the development of a vaccine, school systems will face decisions about whether to mandate vaccination and whether to permit exemptions. The American Academy of Pediatrics promulgates policy favoring the elimination of nonmedical exemptions generally in schools. This discussion considers whether schools should eliminate nonmedical exemptions to vaccination as proposed in the American Academy of Pediatrics policy, ultimately concluding that broad elimination of exemptions is not justified and advocating a more nuanced approach that encourages school attendance while promoting vaccination and broader public health goals.","output":"In the Wake of a Pandemic: Revisiting School Approaches to Nonmedical Exemptions to Mandatory Vaccination in the US"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background. The COVID-19 pandemic attributable to the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2) has had a significant and continuing impact across all areas of healthcare including stroke. Individuals post-stroke are at high risk for infection, disease severity, and mortality after COVID-19 infection. Exercise stroke rehabilitation programs remain critical for individuals recovering from stroke to mitigate risk factors and morbidity associated with the potential long-term consequences of COVID-19. There is currently no exercise rehabilitation guidance for people post-stroke with a history of COVID-19 infection. Purpose. To (1) review the multi-system pathophysiology of COVID-19 related to stroke and exercise; (2) discuss the multi-system benefits of exercise for individuals post-stroke with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection; and (3) provide clinical considerations related to COVID-19 for exercise during stroke rehabilitation. This article is intended for healthcare professionals involved in the implementation of exercise rehabilitation for individuals post-stroke who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection and non-infected individuals who want to receive safe exercise rehabilitation. Results. Our clinical considerations integrate pre-COVID-19 stroke (n = 2) and COVID-19 exercise guidelines for non-stroke populations (athletic [n = 6], pulmonary [n = 1], cardiac [n = 2]), COVID-19 pathophysiology literature, considerations of stroke rehabilitation practices, and exercise physiology principles. A clinical decision-making tool for COVID-19 screening and eligibility for stroke exercise rehabilitation is provided, along with key subjective and physiological measures to guide exercise prescription.

METHODS: We draw on online panel surveys of over 1000 respondents each in the USA, Hong Kong and Japan, using broadly representative quota sample selections. Results are tested by ordinal logistic regression for the two ordinal dependent variables and logistic regression for phone app use. RESULTS: Confidence in public health scientists predicts use of phone tracking applications, social distancing, and mask use, albeit statistically insignificant for tracer phone application use in Hong Kong. Trust in government predicts the use of a phone tracking application. Counterintuitively, trust in government is negatively and significantly associated with mask use and social distancing in Hong Kong and Japan. Women are more likely to wear masks and practice social distancing. Government employees are more likely to use a phone tracking application, but less likely to mask and social distance. Voting and civic participation are positively associated with trust in government and confidence in public health scientists, in all three countries. There are interesting variations across all three countries on other antecedents and controls.

RESULTS: This study included 392 participants: 231 patients with normal fasting blood sugar (FBG), 101 patients with pre-diabetes and 60 patients with type 2 diabetes. The FINDRISC, British, and Australian risk scores were strongly inter-correlated and weakly correlated with other systems risk scores. Moreover, they correlated moderately and significantly with FBS. In contrast, other systems risk scores were associated weekly with FBS. Based on receiving operating characteristics (ROC) analysis and multivariate logistic regression, the FINDRISC risk score was superior to other risk scores to predict high FBS and identify pre-diabetes and diabetes.

The FS problem is often ill-posed due to significant correlations among features, which may lead to several different feature subsets with comparable scores in terms of classification performance. However, not all these subsets are equivalent from a domain-oriented point of view due to known relationships among features and their different acquisition costs in production to deploy the trained classifier. In this paper, we consider the potential benefits of including the domain experts preferences in the FS task, thus integrating both objective elements (e.g., classification accuracy) and subjective (often not quantifiable) considerations in the selection process. This goes in the direction of increasing the interpretability and the trustworthiness of the machine learning model, which is an often desired property in many application domains such as in medicine. The proposed method consists of an iterative procedure. At each iteration, the expert is asked to express a human preference on pairs of classifiers, each one trained from a different subset of features. The expressed preferences are used algorithmically to update a suitable surrogate function that mimics the latent subjective experts objective function, and then to propose a new classifier for testing and comparison. The proposed method has been tested on academic and experimental FS problems, and notably, on a COVID19 patients record. The preliminary experimental results are promising, in that a parsimonious and accurate solution is obtained after a relatively short number of iterations.","output":"Active preference-based optimization for human-in-the-loop feature selection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION The electron transport chain is closely related to cellular respiration and has been implicated in various human diseases.

Consequently, COVID-19 has become an important factor influencing adolescents' mental health. The purpose of this study is to explore the intervention effect of the integration model on the negative emotions of adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adolescents were randomly selected from five middle schools in Zhejiang Province of China from May 2020 to July 2020. First, the Self-rating Anxiety Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and Psychological Well-Being Scale were used for measurement. Then, 72 patients with moderate and severe anxiety symptoms were chosen as the research objects, and the intervention and comparison time was determined to be eight weeks. The subjects were randomly divided into the experiment group (35 members) and the control group (34 members). The integration model was employed on the experiment group. RESULTS: Grade, physical condition, and sleep time are important factors influencing the anxiety level of adolescents during the COVID-19 period, and the anxiety risk of adolescents is higher during their third year of junior high school. After the intervention, the SAS score of the experiment group is lower than that of the control group, and the decrease in the SAS score is higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). Moreover, the positive emotion score of the experiment group is higher than that of the control group, and the negative emotion score of the former is lower than that of the latter. The variances in the positive and negative emotion scores are higher in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01). The variance in the overall well-being index is also greater in the experiment group than in the control group (P<0.01).

METHODS: : Between April and May 2020, 1640 French-speaking adults participating in an online cohort were classified according to their attitudes towards vaccination as: hesitant, anti-vaccination, and pro-vaccination. Descriptive statistics, univariate multinomial regression models and multivariate analyses were compiled and carried out. RESULTS: : At the time of inclusion, compared to pro-vaccination participants, hesitant participants were more frequently females (p=0.044), not annually vaccinated against flu (p=0.026), less optimistic about the discovery of a treatment against Covid-19 in a few months (p<0.001), less ready to undergo this treatment (p<0.001), presenting less trust in the ability of public health authorities to control the pandemic (p=0.036) and reporting lower scores on knowledge-related scales (p values from <0.001 to 0.002). Univariate analyses confirmed these results with odds ratios ranging from 1.51 [1.05-2.17] to 2.19 [1.56-3.07]. In the multivariate models, the remaining variables associated with hesitant compared to pro-vaccination attitudes were discovery of a treatment against Covid-19 in a few months (OR=2.57 [1.73-3.81]), being ready to undergo this treatment (OR=7.07 [4.89-10.22]), digital vaccine literacy (OR=1.70 [1.14-2.54]) and general health literacy (OR=1.49 [1.03-2.15]). DISCUSSION: : In a continuum of relative acceptance of Covid-19-related vaccines, hesitant individuals were situated in between the behaviours and characteristics of pro-vaccination and anti-vaccination groups. While their characteristics were in line with the literature, this study was the first to report data on health literacy, digital vaccine literacy and capacity to detect fake news associated with vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSIONS: : While failing to identify straightforward predictors, findings suggest that continued education and communication campaigns focused on improving vaccine literacy, particularly among women younger than 35 years, could heighten the proportion of persons accepting vaccination.","output":"{fr}Who is hesitant about Covid-19 vaccines ?

However, their long-term persistence has not to be investigated despite pivotal role of dyslipidemia in several comorbidities excessively noted in sepsis survivors (stroke, cardiomyopathy). Methods: A total of 9,861 individuals hospitalized for a singular episode of sepsis between 2009 and 2019 were identified from electronic medical records. Lab measurements of total cholesterol (Tchol), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-c), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides (TG), lipoprotein(a) [Lp (a)], apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and C-reactive protein (CRP). The data were examined as baseline values before sepsis, during hospitalization, and <3 months, 3C6 months, 6C12 months, 1C2 years, and more than 2 years from initial sepsis. Results: Significant reductions in HDL-c (HDL(baseline) = 44.06 vs. HDL(sepsis) = 28.2; U = ?37.79, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.22) and LDL-c serum levels were observed during and up to three months post sepsis, with females much less affected. In contrast, male subjects had derangement in HDL present for up to two years after a singular septic episode. Total cholesterol levels were slightly yet significantly elevated for up to two years after sepsis. TG were elevated up to one year [TG(baseline) = 128.26 vs. TG(sepsis) = 170.27, t(8255) = ?21.33, p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 0.49] and normalized.

Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein was elevated for up to five years after sepsis resolution (H [6;1685] = 502.2; p < 0.0001). Discussion: Lipid abnormalities persisted long after the initial septic insult suggesting potential role in accelerating atherosclerosis and other abnormalities. In addition, sepsis seems to blunt statin effectiveness. Additionally, a significant and unexplained drop in statin use was seen in post-septic period.

To take advantage of this, many hypoxia-mimicking scaffolds have been prepared, yet the oxygen access state of implanted artificial small-diameter vascular grafts (SDVGs) has not been investigated. Therefore, the oxygen access state of electrospun PCL grafts implanted into rat abdominal arteries was assessed. The regions proximal to the lumen and abluminal surfaces of the graft walls were normoxic and only the interior of the graft walls was hypoxic. In light of this differential oxygen access state of the implanted grafts and the critical role of vascular regeneration on SDVG implantation success, we investigated whether modification of SDVGs with HIF-1 stabilizer dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) could achieve hypoxia-mimicking responses resulting in improving vascular regeneration throughout the entirety of the graft wall. Therefore, DMOG-loaded PCL grafts were fabricated by electrospinning, to support the sustained release of DMOG over two weeks. In vitro experiments indicated that DMOG-loaded PCL mats had significant biological advantages, including: promotion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration and production of pro-angiogenic factors; and the stimulation of M2 macrophage polarization, which in-turn promoted macrophage regulation of HUVECs migration and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contractile phenotype. These beneficial effects were downstream of HIF-1 stabilization in HUVECs and macrophages in normoxic conditions. Our results indicated that DMOG-loaded PCL grafts improved endothelialization, contractile SMCs regeneration, vascularization and modulated the inflammatory reaction of grafts in abdominal artery replacement models, thus promoting vascular regeneration.","output":"The effect of hypoxia-mimicking responses on improving the regeneration of artificial vascular grafts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The World Health Organizations age-friendly city initiative emerged as a response to the intersecting global trends of population ageing and urbanisation.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on 23rd March 2020, Northern Ireland was placed into lockdown' with the majority of the population advised to stay at home. The objective of this paper is to identify what effect the lockdown restrictions had on the workload of the Major Trauma Service at the Royal Victoria Hospital. METHOD: Patients were identified at the orthopaedic trauma meetings and from direct referral to the Major Trauma Service (MTS). Patients admitted and seen by the MTS from 23/03/20, the day lockdown was announced, to 29/05/20, when restrictions were partially lifted, were included in the analysis. Admissions data from this time period was then compared to admissions data from the same period in 2019 (23/03/19 - 29/05/19). RESULTS: When comparing pre-lockdown and lockdown groups there was an overall decrease of 26% in admissions to the MTS (n=57 vs n=42). Road Traffic Accidents were reduced by 53% (n=31 vs n=15) and falls from >2m were reduced by 29% (n=21 vs n=15). CONCLUSION: Overall the number of admissions to the major trauma service was reduced during the lockdown period. A significant proportion of the reduction may be a result of social restrictions that reduced volume of traffic on Northern Irelands roads.

Mice were infected with an antibody escape variant which produces a nonlethal encephalomyelitis and compared to a clonal virus population which produces a fulminant fatal encephalomyelitis. Infection with both viruses induced the accumulation of mRNAs associated with Th1- and Th2-type cytokines, including IFN-, IL-4, and IL-10. Peak mRNA accumulations were coincident with the clearance of virus and there was no obvious differences between lethally and nonlethally infected mice. TNF- mRNA was induced more rapidly in lethally infected mice compared to mice undergoing a nonfatal encephalomyelitis. Rapid transient increases in the mRNAs encoding IL-12, iNOS, IL-1, IL-1, and IL-6 occurred following infection. Nonlethal infections were associated with increased IL-12, IL-1, and earlier expression of IL-6, while lethal infections were associated with increased iNOS and IL-1 mRNA. These data suggest a rapid but differential response within the central nervous system cells to infection by different JHMV variants. However, neither the accumulation nor kinetics of induction provide evidence to distinguish lethal infections from nonlethal infections leading to a persistent infection. Accumulation of both Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the central nervous system of JHMV-infected mice is consistent with the participation of both cytokines and cell immune effectors during resolution of acute viral-induced encephalomyelitis.","output":"Kinetics of Cytokine mRNA Expression in the Central Nervous System Following Lethal and Nonlethal Coronavirus-Induced Acute Encephalomyelitis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A series of case studies, derived from Holocene palaeoenvironmental investigations, archaeology, and history, are used to analyze ancient natural hazards and their impact on societies The evolution of societies is inscribed in geomorphology, as a close relationship exists between the landscape and humans Four factors underpin disasters: time, space, type of society, and type of event In some cases, disasters apparently caused civilization to collapse, but, in other cases, they have spawned innovations and led to more resilient societies In the face of landscape change, our modern society should not be lured by technology and globalization, as these could become more sources of vulnerability than of prevention and mitigation Changes always have a cost Civilizations have always had difficulties coping with the element of surprise in a hazard;this will remain uncontrollable If a natural hazard occurs in a restricted area of the planet, its impact may be felt worldwide due to our current great interconnectedness","output":"Natural Hazards, Landscapes and Civilizations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The surge of new claims for unemployment insurance (UI) following the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly depleting states' UI trust fund reserves By early July, the trust funds of three of the four largest states (California, New York, and Texas) were already insolvent, requiring them to borrow to cover benefits We first describe the condition of the states' trust funds before the start of the pandemic-related recession and examine how the states' different methods of financing UI were related to those conditions States that indexed their UI payroll tax base to state average wages had reserves roughly twice those of states that did not index We then analyze the dynamics of UI trust funds using vector autoregression Our main finding is that, following a shock to benefit payments and the consequent drop in UI reserves, states' reserves recover at different rates depending on their method of experience rating tax rates and whether they index their tax base The trust funds of states using the most common type of UI financing - reserve-ratio experience rating and a fixed tax base - tend to require more than a decade to recover, whereas the trust funds of states using the benefit-ratio method tend to recover within five years whether or not they index Federal legislation passed in March in response to the pandemic has implications for financing UI that we discuss in light of our findings","output":"Experience Rating and the Dynamics of Financing Unemployment Insurance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Proteins are the molecular machines of living systems.

Resolving conflicts with conspecifics over valuable resources is an essential task for animals, and this takes an unusual form in mantis shrimp due to their powerful raptorial appendages. Decades of field and laboratory research have provided key insights into the natural agonistic interactions of diverse mantis shrimp species, including how they use their raptorial weapons against one another in telson sparring matches over cavities. These insights provided the foundation for functional morphologists, biomechanists, and engineers to work through different levels of organization: from the kinematics of how the appendages move, to the elastic mechanisms that power the strike, and down to the structure, composition, and material properties that transmit and protect against high-impact forces. Completing this narrative are studies on the defensive telson and how this structure is biomechanically matched to the weapon and the role it plays in ritualized fighting. The biomechanical understanding of the weapon and defense in mantis shrimp has, in turn, enabled a better understanding of whether mantis shrimp assess one another during contests and encouraged questions of evolutionary drivers on both the arsenal and behavior. Altogether, the body of research focused on mantis shrimp has presented perhaps the most comprehensive understanding of fighting, weapons, and defenses among crustaceans, from morphology and biomechanics to behavior and evolution. While this multi-level analysis of ritualized fighting in mantis shrimp is comprehensive, we implore the need to include additional levels of analysis to obtain a truly holistic understanding of this and other crustacean agonistic interactions. Specifically, both molting and environmental conditions are often missing from the narrative, yet they greatly affect crustacean weapons, defenses, and behavior. Applying this approach more broadly would generate a similarly profound understanding of how crustaceans carry out a variety of important tasks in diverse habitats.","output":"From telson to attack in mantis shrimp: bridging biomechanics and behavior in crustacean contests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Routinely collected electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to enhance randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by facilitating recruitment and follow-up. Despite this, current EHR use is minimal in UK RCTs, in part due to ongoing concerns about the utility (reliability, completeness, accuracy) and accessibility of the data. The aim of this manuscript is to document the process, timelines and challenges of the application process to help improve the service both for the applicants and data holders. METHODS: This is a qualitative paper providing a descriptive narrative from one UK clinical trials unit (MRC CTU at UCL) on the experience of two trial teams application process to access data from three large English national datasets: National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) and NHS Digital to establish themes for discussion. The underpinning reason for applying for the data was to compare EHRs with data collected through case report forms in two RCTs, Add-Aspirin (ISRCTN 74358648) and PATCH (ISRCTN 70406718). RESULTS: The Add-Aspirin trial, which had a pre-planned embedded sub-study to assess EHR, received data from NCRAS 13 months after the first application. In the PATCH trial, the decision to request data was made whilst the trial was recruiting. The study received data after 8 months from NICOR and 15 months for NHS Digital following final application submission. This concluded in May 2020. Prior to application submission, significant time and effort was needed particularly in relation to the PATCH trial where negotiations over consent and data linkage took many years. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that data access can be a prolonged and complex process. This is compounded if multiple data sources are required for the same project. This needs to be factored in when planning to use EHR within RCTs and is best considered prior to conception of the trial. Data holders and researchers are endeavouring to simplify and streamline the application process so that the potential of EHR can be realised for clinical trials.","output":"Accessing routinely collected health data to improve clinical trials: recent experience of access"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pollutant behavior in and around a naturally ventilated building requires to be investigated quantitatively as the growing concern on air quality within the built environment.

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF(6)) was employed as a tracer gas in the wind tunnel tests. Two natural ventilation modes, single-sided ventilation and cross ventilation were considered. The conditions under prevailing wind direction with different source locations on the windward side were compared. The pressure coefficients on all of the building fa?ades and tracer gas concentration distributions were monitored and analysed. The experimental results elucidated that contaminant released from windward units could spread vertically and horizontally to other units on the source fa?ade and downstream units. The source location was a significant influence factor on the pollutant concentration in various units. In the single-sided ventilated building, the infected risks of leeward units were even higher than those in some windward units. In the cross ventilated building, the vertical transmission could be suppressed and the horizontal transmission was reinforced.

The mandibular second premolar was extracted due to standard orthodontic therapy and placed in a dental manikin, to simulate typical treatment conditions. The particle counter was used to measure the aerosol particles (0.3C10.0 m) at three different sites: dental manikin and operators and assistants mouth area. The study results showed that caries treatment and dental crown removal with a high-speed handpiece and the use of the SE generated the highest aerosol quantity at each measured site. All three tested Er:YAG lasers significantly reduced the number of aerosol particles during caries treatment and ceramic crown debonding compared the conventional handpieces, p < 0.05. Furthermore, the Er:YAG lasers generated less aerosol during orthodontic bracket debonding and root canal irrigation in contrast to the initial aerosol quantity measured in the dental office. The use of the Er:YAG lasers during dental treatments significantly generates less aerosol in the dental office setting, which reduces the risk of transmission of viruses or bacteria.","output":"The Effect of Er:YAG Lasers on the Reduction of Aerosol Formation for Dental Workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infection that causes disease outbreaks among farm animals, resulting in significant economic losses particularly in the cattle industry, has the potential to become zoonotic miRNAs, which are short non-coding segments of RNA that inhibits the expression of their target genes, have been identified as potential biomarkers and drug targets, though this potential in BCoV remains largely unknown We hypothesize that certain miRNAs could simultaneously target multiple genes, are significantly conserved across many species, thereby demonstrating the potential to serve as diagnostic or therapeutic tools for bovine coronavirus infection To this end, we utilized different existing and publicly available computational tools to conduct system analysis predicting important miRNAs that could affect BCoV pathogenesis Eleven genes including CEBPD, IRF1, TLR9, SRC, and RHOA, significantly indicated in immune-related pathways, were identified to be associated with BCoV, and implicated in other coronaviruses Of the 70 miRNAs predicted to target the identified genes, four concomitant miRNAs (bta-miR-11975, bta-miR-11976, bta-miR-22-3p, and bta-miR-2325c) were found Examining the gene interaction network suggests IL-6, IRF1, and TP53 as key drivers Phylogenetic analysis revealed that miR-22 was completely conserved across all 14 species it was searched against, suggesting a shared and important functional role Functional annotation and associated pathways of target genes, such as positive regulation of cytokine production, IL-6 signaling pathway, and regulation of leukocyte differentiation, indicate the miRNAs are major participants in multiple aspects of both innate and adaptive immune response Examination of variants evinced a potentially deleterious SNP in bta-miR-22-3p and an advantageous SNP in bta-miR-2325c Conclusively, this study provides new insight into miRNAs regulating genes responding to BCoV infection, with bta-miR-22-3p particularly indicated as a potential drug target or diagnostic marker for bovine coronavirus","output":"Integrative Network Analysis of Predicted miRNA-Targets Regulating Expression of Immune Response Genes in Bovine Coronavirus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus crisis exposes disparities in access to care for vulnerable populations, particularly with respect to telemedicine.

Our objective is to estimate the maternal mortality ratio in 1 year and analyze the clinical course of pregnant women hospitalized due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective surveillance study of the national maternal mortality was performed from February 2020CFebruary 2021 in Mexico related to COVID-19 cases in pregnant women, including their outcomes. Comparisons were made between patients who died and those who survived to identify prognostic factors and underlying health conditions distribution. RESULTS: Maternal Mortality Ratio increased by 56.8% in the studied period, confirmed COVID-19 was the cause of 22.93% of cases. Additionally, unconfirmed cases represented 4.5% of all maternal deaths. Among hospitalized pregnant women with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome consistent with COVID-19, smoking and cardiovascular diseases were more common among patients who faced a fatal outcome. They were also more common in the age group of < 19 or > 38. In addition, pneumonia was associated with asthma and immune impairment, while diabetes and increased BMI increased the odds for death (Odds Ratio 2.30 and 1.70, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal Mortality Ratio in Mexico increased over 60% in 1 year during the pandemic; COVID-19 was linked to 25.4% of maternal deaths in the studied period. Lethality among pregnant women with a diagnosis of COVID-19 was 2.8%, and while asthma and immune impairment increased propensity for developing pneumonia, obesity and diabetes increased the odds for in-hospital death.

Methods: In line with recent recommendations, a third dose of either heterologous ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) or homologous BNT162b2 (BioNTech) was administered to 25 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without humoral response after 2 doses of BNT162b2, followed by analysis of serological responses and vaccine-specific B- and T-cell immunity. Results: 9/25 (36%) KTR under standard immunosuppressive treatment seroconverted until day 27 after the third vaccination, while one patient developed severe COVID-19 infection immediately after vaccination. Cellular analysis seven days after the third dose showed significantly elevated frequencies of viral spike protein receptor binding domain specific B cells in humoral responders as compared to non-responders. Likewise, portions of spike-reactive CD4+ T helper cells were significantly elevated in seroconverting patients. Furthermore, overall frequencies of IL-2+, IL-4+ and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells significantly increased after the third dose, whereas memory/effector differentiation remained unaffected. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a fraction of transplant recipients benefits from triple vaccination, where seroconversion is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes of cellular immunity.

Currently, there is clinical equipoise concerning the added benefit of intravenous alteplase administration (IVT) prior to EVT. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of omitting IVT before EVT in patients with AIS caused by an anterior circulation LVO. METHODS MR CLEAN-NO IV is a multicenter randomized open-label clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment (PROBE design). Patients  18 years of age with a pre-stroke mRS < 3 with an LVO confirmed on CT angiography/MR angiography eligible for both IVT and EVT are randomized to receive either IVT (0.9 mg/kg) followed by EVT, or direct EVT in a 1:1 ratio. The primary objective is to assess superiority of direct EVT. Secondarily, non-inferiority of direct EVT compared to IVT before EVT will be explored. The primary outcome is the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days. Ordinal regression with adjustment for prognostic variables will be used to estimate treatment effect. Secondary outcomes include reperfusion graded with the eTICI scale after EVT and stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) at 24 h. Safety outcomes include intracranial hemorrhages scored according to the Heidelberg criteria. A total of 540 patients will be included. DISCUSSION IVT prior to EVT might facilitate early reperfusion before EVT or improved reperfusion rates during EVT. Conversely, among other potential adverse effects, the increased risk of bleeding could nullify the beneficial effects of IVT.

For over 10 years, the National AIDS Program (NAP) has offered HIV voluntary counselling and testing through a partnership with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). In 2018, implementation of HIV self-tests (HIVST) was introduced, and this self-care intervention has been further scaled up during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This paper (1) describes the effectiveness of implementing HIVST in Lebanon, and (2) discusses how the success of HIVST implementation has been reflected during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The NAP conducted a series of workshops (July-November 2018) to introduce HIVST services for healthcare workers working at different NGOs. The workshops highlighted that HIVST would be distributed for free, that it would be confidential and voluntary, and that participants were encouraged to notify the NGOs of their results, which would be kept strictly confidential. NGOs collected data anonymously and confidentially from beneficiaries (age, consistency of condom use and HIV testing history), who were asked to call back with the results of their HIVST. At the NAP, data were combined, aggregated and analysed. RESULTS: In 2019, the NGOs distributed 1103/1380 (79.9%) HIVST kits to their beneficiaries. The NGOs collected feedback on 111 kit results, of which two were HIV-positive. Feedback about HIVST results from beneficiaries was low (111/1103) due to noncompliance of beneficiaries and the lack of human and financial resources in the NGOs. From January through May 2020, a total of 625/780 HIVST kits (80.1%) were distributed. This period was divided into pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19. The follow-up with the beneficiaries during COVID-19 was much improved because of the absence of on-site activities, shifting more efforts towards HIVST (449/625). There have been no reports of social harm related to HIVST. CONCLUSION: HIVST implementation in Lebanon serves as an example of introducing a self-care intervention as part of a community-led effort. In order to maintain HIVST services at the same improved level, reorganization of care is needed within each NGO following the adaptation process due to COVID-19, along with continuous monitoring and evaluation of HIVST reported data.","output":"Community-led HIV self-testing for men who have sex with men in Lebanon: lessons learned and impact of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Underestimation of the number of cases during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a constant concern worldwide. Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA using realtime reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most common method to confirm a case. However, these tests have suboptimal sensitivity. Objective: The objective of the study was to estimate the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths in Mexico, accounting for the probabilities of false-negative tests. Methods: We used publicly available, national databases of all SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at public laboratories in Mexico between February 27 and October 31, 2020. We used the estimated probabilities of false-negative tests based on the day of clinical sample collection after symptom initiation calculated previously. With the resulting model, we estimated the corrected daily number of cases, ICU admissions, and deaths. Results: Among 2,024,822 people tested in Mexico between February 27 and October 31 with an available result, we estimated 1,248,583 (95% confidence interval 1,094,850-1,572,818) cases, compared to 902,343 cases reported with positive tests. ICU admissions and deaths were 15% and 8% higher than reported, respectively.

Animal experiments have shown marked adhesions to the intraperitoneal mesh (IPM), the clinical consequences being unclear. This study aimed to describe the extension of adhesions to the mesh, 5-7 years after LVHR, using two validated non-invasive radiologic methods. METHODS Real-time transabdominal ultrasonography (TAU) and cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was applied to 30 patients with prior LVHR and implantation of IPM (Intramesh W3, Cousin Biotech, France). The visceral slide was measured in nine predefined abdominal segments. Values <or=1 cm were defined as an area with adhesion. RESULTS The mean time between LVHR and TAU/cine MRI was 67 months (range, 58-80 months). We found adhesion to the mesh in 90% of the patients using TAU and 100% of the patients using cine MRI. In the latter, 65% were between the bowel and IPM. CONCLUSIONS LVHR is known to reduce recurrences and postoperative complications, while improving patient outcome. The intraperitoneal placement of the mesh has been shown to induce adhesions; the amount and extension in the clinical setting is unclear. The present study showed a marked proportion of adhesions to the mesh with an average surgery to scan time of 5.6 years, despite an anti-adhesive barrier on the visceral surface of the mesh. Together with existing data, this result increases the concern related to the long-term consequences of an IPM.

In October 2020, we conducted a mailed questionnaire survey on a random sample of functionally independent community-dwelling older adults in a semi-urban area of Japan. Based on the depression status between March and October 2020, participants were classified into four groups: consistently non-depressed, depression onset, recovering from depression, and remained depressed. Participants were assessed for providing care for their family members or not. Caregiver participants were also assessed on their caregiving role (primary or secondary), the severity of their care-recipients needs, and an increased caregiver burden. Data from 957 older adults were analyzed. The participants mean age (SD) was 80.8 (4.8) years, and 53.5% were female. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that family caregiving was associated with depression onset (OR=3.17 [95%CI=1.57-6.40], p=0.001) and remaining depressed (2.53 [1.36-4.71], p=0.004). Particularly, primary caregivers, those providing care for family members with severer care need-levels, and those with an increased caregiver burden had a higher risk of depression onset and remaining depressed. Family caregivers could have severe mental health conditions during the pandemic. Developing a support system is essential to protect their mental health.","output":"Family Caregiving and Depression among Older Adults in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The treatment of periprosthetic hip infections is usually cost intensive, so it is generally not cost effective for hospitals. In chronic infections, a two-stage procedure is often indicated, which can be done as a fast-track procedure with a short prosthetic-free interim interval (2C4 weeks) or as a slow-track procedure with a long prosthetic-free interim interval (over 4 weeks). AIM: The aim of this study was to elucidate the revenue situation of both forms of treatment in the aG-DRG-System 2020, taking into account revenue-relevant influencing factors. METHODS: For fast-track and slow-track procedures with two-stage revision and detection of a staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), treatment cases were simulated using a grouper software (3M KODIP Suite) based on the diagnoses (ICD-10-GM) and procedures (OPS) and then grouped into DRGs. Revenue-relevant parameters, such as length of stay and secondary diagnoses (SD), were taken into account. In addition, two real treatment cases with fast-track and slow-track procedures were compared to each other. RESULTS: The total revenues for the slow-track procedure with a length of stay of 25 days (without SD) were 27,551  and for a length of stay of 42 days (with SD) even 40,699 , compared to 23,965  with the fast-track procedure with a length of stay of 25 days (without SD) and 27,283  for a length of stay of 42 days (with SD). The real treatment cases also showed a big difference in the total revenues of 12,244  in favor of the slow-track procedure. DISCUSSION: Even in the aG-DRG-System 2020, the two-stage revision procedure with a long interim interval seems to be more interesting from a financial point of view and the hospital perspective compared to the fast-track procedure, especially with multimorbid patients. This creates a financial barrier to the treatment of such patients with a short interim interval.","output":"Vergleich der DRG-Erl?se zwischen Fast- und Slow-Track-Verfahren beim zweizeitigen Prothesenwechsel bei periprothetischen Hftinfektionen im aG-DRG-System 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The innate immune system is an immediate defense against infectious pathogens by the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators.

There is limited evidence about the effect of this change in behavior on women's health. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment and complications of women presenting with a tubal Ectopic Pregnancy (EP). STUDY DESIGN: This is a single centre retrospective cohort study. We compared the clinical presentation, treatment modalities and complications of all women presenting in our institution with a tubal EP during the COVID-19 pandemic between 15 March and 15 June 2020, with women who were treated in our institution with the same diagnosis in the corresponding period for the years 2018-2019. RESULTS: The study group included 19 cases of EP (N = 19) that were treated between the 15 March 2020 and 15 June 2020. The control group included 30 cases of EP (N = 30) that were admitted to in the corresponding period during 2018 and 2019.

Transmission of this parasite is still poorly understood despite the design of infection experiments to improve our knowledge of the disease, with estimates for critical epidemiological parameters, such as the probability of human-to-pig infection after exposure to eggs, still lacking. In this paper, a systematic review was carried out and eight pig infection experiments were analyzed to describe the probability of developing cysts. These experiments included different pathways of inoculation: with ingestion of proglottids, eggs, and beetles that ingested eggs, and direct injection of activated oncospheres into the carotid artery. In these experiments, different infective doses were used, and the numbers of viable and degenerated cysts in the body and brain of each pig were registered. Five alternative dose-response models (exponential, logistic, log-logistic, and exact and approximate beta-Poisson) were assessed for their accuracy in describing the observed probabilities of cyst development as a function of the inoculation dose. Dose-response models were developed separately for the presence of three types of cysts (any, viable only, and cysts in the brain) and considered for each of the four inoculation methods (\\"Proglottids\\", \\"Eggs\\", \\"Beetles\\" and \\"Carotid\\"). The exact beta-Poisson model best fit the data for the three types of cysts and all relevant exposure pathways. However, observations for some exposure pathways were too scarce to reliably define a dose-response curve with any model. A wide enough range of doses and sufficient sample sizes was only found for the \\"Eggs\\" pathway and a merged \\"Oral\\" pathway combining the \\"Proglottids\\", \\"Eggs\\" and \\"Beetles\\" pathways.

While this approach can be valuable, the models and the associated predictions are difficult to validate. In this study, we measured the in situ F-V properties of the maximally activated kangaroo rat plantarflexor group and used two different assumptions and associated models to estimate the properties of the individual plantarflexors.

The second model (Mdl2) assumed that the F-V properties of the fibers within each muscle were identical, but due to differences in muscle architecture, the muscles' contributions to the group properties changed with isotonic load. We compared the two model predictions to independent estimates of the muscles' contributions based upon sonomicrometry (SONO) measurements of muscle lengths.

It takes into account specifics of a workplace, mask efficiency, and daily routines of employees, but does not require specific inter-agent rules for simulations. Likewise, it does not require knowledge of microscopic disease related parameters. Instead, the risk of infection is aggregated into the probability of infection, which depends on the duration and distance of every contact. The probability of infection at the end of a workday is found using rigorous probabilistic rules. Unlike previous models, this approach requires only a few reference data points for calibration, which are more easily collected via empirical studies.

In April 2020, the COVID-19 social restrictions in the United States led to a decline in electricity demand from the commercial and industrial sectors. In this study, we estimate the changes in the emissions of CO2 and NOx from the U.S. power sector due to three factors: 1) weather, 2) the fuel-mix change in the past five years, and 3) the COVID-19 social restrictions. We use a multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model to separate the impacts of outdoor temperature and type-of-day from the COVID-19 on power generation, and the daily operation status of 3013 power units to account for the fuel-mix change. We find that electricity demand changes due to COVID occurred mostly from March to June 2020, with electricity demand generally returning to 2015C2019 levels starting in July 2020. We find the U.S. power sector CO2 emissions, reported by EPA, dropped by 29.8 MTCO2 (?26%) in April 2020, relative to the average April emissions between 2015 and 2019. Of that reduction, we attribute declines of 18.3  4.0 MTCO2 (?18  4%) to the COVID-19 lockdowns, declines of 13.7  4.2 MTCO2 (?12  4%) to a fuel-mix change, and increases of 2.3  1.1 MTCO2 (+2  1%) due to weather variability compared to the five prior years. For the same month, the power sector NOx emissions dropped by 27.6 thousand metric tons (?42%) in April 2020, relative to the past five-year monthly average.

We show that the utricle is highly sensitive to particle motion stimuli produced by an underwater speaker positioned in the horizontal plane. Utricular potentials were recorded across a broad range of frequencies with lowest particle acceleration (dB re: 1 ms-2) thresholds occurring at 105 Hz (lowest frequency tested; mean threshold=-32 dB re: 1 ms-2) and highest thresholds at 605 to 1005 Hz (mean threshold range=-5 to -4 dB re: 1 ms-2). The high gain and broadband frequency sensitivity of the utricle suggests that it likely serves a primary auditory function and is well suited to detect conspecific vocalizations including broadband agonistic signals and the multiharmonic advertisement calls produce by reproductive type I males.","output":"Auditory evoked potentials of utricular hair cells in the plainfin midshipman, Porichthys notatus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The poor permeability of new drug candidates across intestinal epithelial membranes complicates their development in oral form. This study investigated the potential of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) to improve the intestinal permeation and absorption of low-permeable low-molecular-weight (low-MW) drugs. METHODS: The in vitro epithelial permeation of six different drugs (metformin, risedronate, zanamivir, methotrexate [MTX], tacrolimus, and vincristine [VCR]) across Caco-2 cell monolayers was examined in the presence and absence of L- or D-penetratin, and the correlation between permeation enhancement efficiency and the properties of tested drugs was analyzed. In addition, a rat closed ileal loop absorption study was conducted to determine the in vivo effects of penetratin. RESULTS: MTX and VCR efficiently permeated Caco-2 monolayers in the presence of L- and D-penetratin, suggesting that CPPs enhanced the epithelial permeation of drugs with relatively high molecular weight and resultant limited intrinsic permeability. The in vivo rat closed ileal loop absorption study revealed the stimulatory effect of L- and D-penetratin on the intestinal absorption of MTX and VCR.

Of 437 Americans and their travel companions on the ship, 114 (26%) tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: We interviewed 229 American passengers and crew after disembarkation following a ship-based quarantine to identify risk factors for infection and characterize transmission onboard the ship. RESULTS: The attack rate for passengers in single-person cabins or without infected cabinmates was 18% (58/329), compared with 63% (27/43) for those sharing a cabin with an asymptomatic infected cabinmate, and 81% (25/31) for those with a symptomatic infected cabinmate. Whole genome sequences from specimens from passengers who shared cabins clustered together. Of 66 SARS-CoV-2-positive American travelers with complete symptom information, 14 (21%) were asymptomatic while on the ship. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive Americans, 10 (9%) required intensive care, of whom 7 were &#8805;70 years. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on cruise ships. High rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in cabinmates of individuals with asymptomatic infections suggest that triage by symptom status in shared quarters is insufficient to halt transmission. A high rate of intensive care unit admission among older individuals complicates the prospect of future cruise travel during the pandemic, given typical cruise passenger demographics.

The study examined an unrealistic optimism of Israeli college students in assessing the health, security, and economic risks during the pandemic, and the contributions of these perceived risks to the prediction of psychological coping responses, such as well-being, and coping suppressing response of anxiety, expressed during this pandemic. Using social networks, a questionnaire was disseminated to students during the third lockdown that was implemented in Israel because of the pandemic. Depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived threats, resilience, well-being, hope, and morale were measured using a structured quantitative questionnaire. First, we hypothesized that the three perceived risks would be inversely rated, so perceived health risk would be rated lowest, and perceived economic risk would be rated highest. The second and third hypotheses claimed that psychological coping responses articulated along this pandemic would be predicted by all these perceived risks, as well as the observance of pandemic precaution rules. The fourth hypothesis suggested that the three investigated perceived risks will positively and significantly correlate with each other.

This case describes a child who developed an aorto-esophageal fistula 25 days after initial battery ingestion and survived due to prompt placement of an aortic stent via minimally invasive surgery, avoiding an open procedure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-year-old female presented acutely with a mid-esophageal button battery impaction witnessed by her parents. Presenting symptoms included chest pain and emesis. Button battery location and size were confirmed on X-ray. She underwent removal with flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and rigid esophagoscopy. She was admitted to the hospital and received conservative medical management, with serial cross-sectional imaging via chest MRIs to assess the evolution of her injury according to available national guidelines, and was discharged after 12 days of close inpatient monitoring. Despite these measures the patient represented 25 days post-ingestion with hematemesis from a new aorto-esophageal fistula, requiring emergent cardiac catheterization with successful, life-saving aortic stent placement. She remained admitted for an additional 12 days of monitoring as her diet was advanced slowly post-catheterization. Since this second hospitalization she continues to do well, with outpatient follow-up by multiple subspecialists.

We check the validity of this comparison in terms of accuracy and definitions and suggest expanding its scope to include expanded financial data of the 2 Medicare systems. STUDY DESIGN: Using annual Medicare Boards of Trustees and National Health Expenditure Accounts data from CMS and health insurers' financial statement data, we compare the level and percentage of the administrative expenses of the Medicare systems and show incompatible and not reconcilable definitions of administrative expenses. We expand our analysis to income, benefits, gains and losses, and loss ratios of the programs. METHODS: Our methodology is a careful comparison of categories of expenses between public and private insurers using official data sources. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative. RESULTS: We validate the low administrative expenses of Medicare parts A, B, and D (1.35% of benefits in 2018) compared with Medicare Part C (10.86% of benefits without loss adjustment expenses [LAE] and 14.84% with LAE for 2018). Expanding the focus, the income and benefits per beneficiary grew faster and larger in Medicare parts A, B, and D than in Medicare Part C-a reversal of earlier trends. The public Medicare program suffered losses in 11 years during 2002-2018, whereas private insurers' Medicare remained solvent with about an 85% loss ratio.

Digital PLFs (dPLF) allows for easier, more rapid data collection and exchange between stakeholders, making international contact tracing more effective and efficient. In response to COVID-19, EU HEALTHY GATEWAYS developed a common European Union digital Passenger Locator Form System (EUdPLF) for all transport sectors (aircrafts, cruise ships/ferries and ground transport). METHODS: A working group was established consisting of 9 EUMS, EASA, EMSA, ECDC, IATA, ERA, CLIA EUROPE. A minimum mandatory dataset was developed. Personal data protection procedures and security measures were implemented. Interconnection of EUdPLF with the EASA exchange platform allowing exchange of data between MS with national dPLF and MS using the EUdPLF was completed. Pilot testing was conducted with four MS for the air and ferry sector. RESULTS: The EUdPLF system developed consists of a multilingual website being the first point of information for users and the EUdPLF app which is the web app for completion of the dPLF. One dPLF is completed per family/group, a QR code is generated and dPLF is sent to the passenger's email. Pilot testing generated 1013 PLFs submissions and 1450 passenger registrations. Feedback received was positive and used to improve user experience. To date, Italy is officially using the EUdPLF for all arriving passengers for all modes of transport. France, Slovenia, Lithuania and Austria are finalising practicalities before official use and testing of the system is ongoing with other MS. CONCLUSIONS: EUdPLF provides multilingual, user-friendly, secure and GDPR compliant single entry point and database for the collection of PLFs, flexible to be customised to the MS needs and to be connected to external systems e.g. check-in system of transport operators, vaccination/testing/certificate information systems of each MS.","output":"European Union Digital Passenger Locator Form System (EUdPLF) development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disrupts established daily routines, it underlines the role that families play in redefining social order and reorganizing people's economic and social lives In this paper, we investigate methods that Chinese and South Korean families have adopted to cope with the rapid changes brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic We emphasize families' responses to sudden changes in three domains: education and home schooling, economic downturn and unemployment, and mental health challenges By integrating online education and remote working into a new form of family life and sharing economic and emotional risks among members, families shape social order during a period of unprecedented uncertainty We highlight the fact that family members experience intensified work-family or school-family conflicts Disadvantaged families are the most severely affected, as they are at high risk of job loss and lack proper protections The absence of institutional protections and interventions has created further economic and emotional hardships for these vulnerable families Informal and nonregular workers require more stable labor market conditions for the well-being of their families Future research may include a systematic data collection and analysis of disadvantaged families, as this would offer a better understanding of the challenges and untenable choices that families face during times of crisis","output":"Burdens, Resilience, and Mutual Support: A Comparative Study of Families in China and South Korea Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The widespread availability of large amounts of genomic data on the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has created an opportunity for researchers to analyze the disease at a level of detail unlike any virus before it.

Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach to cluster spike protein sequences in order to study the behavior of different known variants that are increasing at very high rate throughout the world. We use a k-mers based approach to first generate a fixed-length feature vector representation for the spike sequences. We then show that with the appropriate feature selection, we can efficiently and effectively cluster the spike sequences based on the different variants.

SARS-CoV2 expresses high affinity to human ACE2 receptors, including within the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with COVID-19 exhibit a wide spectrum of GI symptoms including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and abnormal liver function tests. Pathogenesis behind gastrointestinal symptoms caused by SARS-CoV2 has been postulated to be multifactorial including disruption of the intestinal mechanical barrier integrity, alteration of the gut microbiome and systemic inflammatory response to the virus. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been found in stool samples of infected patients for a significantly longer period than in nasopharyngeal samples, though the implication of this finding is unclear at this time. Liver injury in patients with COVID-19 is usually mild, stemming from immune-mediated damage, drug induced hepatotoxicity, or ischemia from sepsis. Patients with pre-existing liver disease may be at a higher risk for hospitalization and mortality. Given the high degree of infectivity of this disease, healthcare providers will need to remain watchful for resurgence of this virus. Strict protocols should be implemented regarding hand hygiene, isolation, personal protective equipment, and appropriate disposal of waste. It is also imperative to identify patients with gastrointestinal symptoms at an early stage as these patients may have a prolonged course between symptom onset and viral clearance.","output":"Gastrointestinal pathophysiology of SARS-CoV2 C a literature review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Covid-19 clinical expression is pleiomorphic, severity is related to age and comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension, and pathophysiology involves aberrant immune activation and lymphopenia. We wondered if the myeloid compartment was affected during Covid-19 and if monocytes and macrophages could be infected by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages from Covid-19 patients and controls were infected with SARS-CoV-2, and extensively investigated with immunofluorescence, viral RNA extraction and quantification, total RNA extraction followed by reverse transcription and q-PCR using specific primers, supernatant cytokines (IL-10, TNF-, IL-1, IFN-, TGF-1 and IL-6), flow cytometry. The effect of M1- versus M2-type or no polarization prior to infection was assessed. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected monocytes and MDMs but their infection is abortive. Infection was associated with immunoregulatory cytokines secretion and the induction of a macrophagic specific transcriptional program characterized by the upregulation of M2-type molecules.

Our prior work showed that ICU-ward transfers vary widely across sites. Previously, we used Human-Centered Design-an iterative, collaborative process for user-focused solutions-to develop a prototype structured ICU-ward transfer communication tool for clinicians at three academic Internal Medicine residency programs. We describe here an iterative approach to rapid prototyping and updating of this novel tool for integration into the electronic health record (EHR), based on structured focus groups using Design Thinking methodology. METHODS: In spring 2020, we conducted voluntary focus groups of PGY-2 and PGY-3 Internal Medicine Residents to co-create new iterations of an ICUward transfer tool created through prior focus groups. Each site conducted 2 focus groups with 4-10 participants per session. All focus groups were conducted via videoconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We used participant feedback to iteratively modify the ICU-ward transfer tool towards an ideal state. With participants' consent, we recorded and anonymously transcribed the focus group discussions conducted over the Zoom platform. We performed qualitative inquiry on transcripts for coding and thematic content analysis. Coding was performed independently by two coders (LS, BG) using both a theory-driven (deductive) and data-driven (inductive) approach;disparate coding was reconciled via in-depth discussion between coders. RESULTS: Focus groups identified several main themes around the role, content, and workflows related to an ideal ICU-wards handoff tool: (1) how the tool can best serve the needs of ICU and wards teams;(2) that the ICU-ward handoff process must balance thoroughness and usability;and (3) that design and implementation must consider user experience and training in best practices. Under these themes, participants identified specific attributes of an ideal handoff tool (Table 1), which coalesced around 3 main goals: (1) to synthesize key details and communicate the ICU team's thought process (summarized in Table 1A);(2) to integrate the new tool into the EHR within a customizable note template that minimizes click burden and redundancy (1B);and (3) to serve as a standardized outline to reduce errors of omission in written and verbal handoffs processes (1C). CONCLUSIONS: Participants valued organization of handoff information, EHR integration and user experience, and standardization and adaptability of workflows when modifying a framework based on prior resident user input to create a more user-friendly ICU-ward transfer tool using a Design Thinking Methodology.","output":"Design thinking to create user-centered icu-ward handoffs at three academic hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: With their former role as cash cows under threat owing to COVID-19, Australian business schools are fighting not only to maintain their status but also their survival. This study aims to look at how the sector might best approach these challenges. Design/methodology/approach: The study reviews the recent literature on business and management education in Australia and compares that with emerging trends and policy directions. Findings: This analysis of current and emerging trends suggests that business education needs to find alternative arguments for legitimacy, and that business schools in public universities can no longer be regarded automatically as the keepers of knowledge. Research limitations/implications: The study contends that public resources would be better channelled towards fit-for-purpose business and management education, with this being administered by an array of entities, some of which would include private providers, publicCprivate partnerships or public entities other than business schools. Practical implications: The study articulates the current and emerging challenges faced by decision and policy makers in the field of public business education and contends that the largely homogeneous business education provided by public universities in Australia is not always in the public interest. Social implications: The value of business education provided by public institutions is becoming increasingly contested, with many stakeholders, including employers, questioning the utility of contemporary business education.

The objectives were to investigate 1) the production of adiponectin by human lung explants, 2) the expression of the adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 by human lung macrophages (LMs), and 3) the impact of recombinant human adiponectin and a small-molecule APN receptor agonist (AdipoRon) on LMs activation. Material and methods: Human parenchyma explants and LMs were isolated from patients operated for carcinoma. The LMs were cultured with recombinant adiponectin or AdipoRon and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (10 ng ml(?1)), poly (I:C) (10 g ml(?1)) or interleukin (IL)-4 (10 ng ml(?1)) for 24 h. Cytokines or adiponectin, released by explants or LMs, were measured using ELISAs. The mRNA levels of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were determined using real-time quantitative PCR. AdipoRs expression was also assessed with confocal microscopy. Results: Adiponectin was released by lung explants at a level negatively correlated with the donors body mass index. AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 were both expressed in LMs. Adiponectin (3C30 g ml(?1)) and AdipoRon (25C50 M) markedly inhibited the LPS- and poly (I:C)-induced release of Tumor Necrosis Factor-, IL-6 and chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL8, CXCL10) and the IL-4-induced release of chemokines (CCL13, CCL17, CCL22) in a concentration-dependent manner. Recombinant adiponectin produced in mammalian cells (lacking low molecular weight isoforms) had no effects on LMs. Conclusion and implications: The low-molecular-weight isoforms of adiponectin and AdipoRon have an anti-inflammatory activity in the lung environment.

Based on the previous studies, there are similarities between the spike antigens of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. It is expected that these similarities (structural and affinity to the receptor of ACE2) can lead to the same pathophysiological activity of the virus by the use of ACE2 and FcRII (the antibody-dependent enhancement mechanism). Therefore, we propose a way of washing out (by plasmapheresis) the possible antibodies against the spike protein of the virus out of patients plasma to stop the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)-mediated infection of the immune system cells at the first phase of the treatment and simultaneous use of the anti-ACE2 with anti-FcRII monoclonal antibodies at the second phase. We propose these procedures for the patients that have no significant response for typical anti-viral, ARDS and conservative therapies, and the disease persists or progresses despite sufficient therapies.","output":"Plasmapheresis, Anti-ACE2 and Anti-FcRII Monoclonal Antibodies: A Possible Treatment for Severe Cases of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The primary objective of this study was to analyse the association between multiple sclerosis (MS) disease-modifying therapy (DMT) exposure and hospitalisation in patients infected with COVID-19.

FINDINGS: As of 18 January 2021, a total of 476 reported COVID-19 cases had been recorded in MS patients in the Swedish MS registry. Of these, 292 (61.3%) had confirmed COVID-19. The mean value (standard deviation (SD)) age at infection was 44.0 years (11.6). Of the 292 confirmed infections, 68 (23.2%) required hospitalisation. A total of 49 of the 164 confirmed COVID-19 patients on rituximab at baseline (29.9%) required hospitalisation, compared to a rate of 12.7% for all other DMTs combined. Rituximab in confirmed COVID-19 patients was associated with 2.95 times the odds of hospitalisation relative to any other DMT combined (odds ratio = 2.95; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.48-5.87).

Video as an assessment tool also allows the use of historical videos or videos filmed by non-experts outside of clinical settings. Given the increased use of telemedicine, the use of video may be a useful addition to clinical trial assessments.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the weak point of the side-to-side anastomosis and to evaluate the effect of bioabsorbable reinforcement material. METHODS Fresh pig small bowel was used for all experiments. A side-to-side anastomosis was performed using a linear stapler, and the burst pressure of the anastomosis was measured. Three separate experiments were done. In experiment 1, the weak point and the burst pressure of that point were defined. In experiment 2, the burst pressure of the side of the anastomosis was measured. In experiment 3, we evaluated the effect of Neoveil(?) to strengthen the weak point of the anastomosis. RESULTS The weak point of the side-to side anastomosis was the crotch and the burst pressure was 39.8  5.7 mmHg. The burst pressure of the side of the anastomosis was 109.9  7.9 mmHg. This was significantly higher than the burst pressure of the crotch (P = 0.008). The burst pressure of the crotch in the group with Neoveil(?) was 83.3  14.9 mmHg. This pressure was significantly higher than the group with no Neoveil(?) reinforcement (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION These findings suggest that the use of Neoveil(?) as a buttressing material is associated with reinforced staple lines and increased crotch burst pressures compared to non-buttressed staple lines. Neoveil(?) was found to perform comparably to clinically available buttress materials in this ex vivo model. Reinforcement of the weak point of the side-to-side anastomosis with Neoveil(?)may lead to fewer anastomotic leaks.","output":"Use of bioabsorbable staple reinforcement material in side-to-side anastomoses: Suture line reinforcement of the weak point of the anastomosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 related restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus result in changes in daily routines and physical activity which can have a negative effect on eating and health habits.

However, in practice, recognition is essentially an open set problem. There are categories we know called \\"knowns\\", and there are more we do not know called \\"unknowns\\". Enumerating all categories beforehand is never possible, consequently, it is infeasible to prepare sufficient training samples for those unknowns. Applying closed set recognition methods will naturally lead to unseen-category errors. To address this problem, we propose the prototype-based Open Deep Network (P-ODN) for open set recognition tasks. Specifically, we introduce prototype learning into open set recognition. Prototypes and prototype radiuses are trained jointly to guide a CNN network to derive more discriminative features. Then P-ODN detects the unknowns by applying a multi-class triplet thresholding method based on the distance metric between features and prototypes. Manual labeling the unknowns which are detected in the previous process as new categories. Predictors for new categories are added to the classification layer to \\"open\\" the deep neural networks to incorporate new categories dynamically. The weights of new predictors are initialized exquisitely by applying a distances based algorithm to transfer the learned knowledge. Consequently, this initialization method speeds up the fine-tuning process and reduce the samples needed to train new predictors.

Literature is scarce and inconsistent about the viable virus particles free-distance from infected patients, as well as about different swabbing methods for surface contamination evaluation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the most sensitive method for the assessment of surface contamination, classify the likelihood of environmental contamination in risk zones and compare the environmental contamination between oxygenation and ventilatory support. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Swabs from potentially contaminated surfaces in a COVID-19 ward, with patients treated with different types of oxygen and ventilatory support, were collected. Three types of swabs were compared in order to evaluate the most sensitive collection method. For risk zone categorization, areas were divided according to the distance from the patient. RESULTS: Of the 63 swabs collected, 17 (27%) tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The highest positivity rate was observed with the sterile premoistened swab with saline (n = 8; 38%), but without statistically significant differences. The highest number of positive samples were collected from the high-risk zones, specifically those located one meter from the patient (n = 13; 48%), with statistically significant differences. Only the rooms of patients supported with non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula had evidence of bedroom contamination, with 45% and 27% of swab positivity, with statistically significant differences. DISCUSSION: Our findings favour the premoistened swab without transport medium for surface contamination assessment, even though without statistical differences. A statistically significant trend supporting the division in risk zones, according to the distance from the patient, was also identified. The higher positivity rate from the non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal cannula bedrooms suggests a significant association between ventilatory strategies and surface contamination, probably due to higher particle dispersion. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of the sterile premoistened swab without preservation medium, the classification of risk areas considering the distance from the patient, and the variability of RNA dispersion between oxygenation and ventilatory support.","output":"Sampling Methods and Risk Stratification Regarding Environmental Contamination by SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We aimed to describe the potential benefit of new rapid molecular respiratory tests (MRT) in decreasing inappropriate antibiotic use among the inpatients presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI).

RESULTS: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by rapid testing and immunoassay among asymptomatic LHCWs was 29.6% and 24.4%. Laboratory phlebotomists (55.6%) were most likely to be exposed to positive patients and samples, followed by those working in the sample receiving area (32%), LHCWs in the automation area (29.6%), rotating doctors (28.6%), and LHCWs in the diagnostic molecular biology laboratory (15.4%). The sensitivities of the rapid test and SARS-CoV-2 total antibody were 94.1% and 92%, whereas the specificities were 92.6% and 91%. CONCLUSION: Rapid serological testing is an effective screening method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection among asymptomatic LHCWs and the identification of the groups of workers who have a significantly higher seroprevalence than the rest of the laboratory population.","output":"Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Laboratory Healthcare Workers at Assiut University Hospital, Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sporadic human infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A (H5N6) virus have been reported in different provinces in China since April 2014. From June 2015 to January 2016, routine live poultry market (LPM) surveillance was conducted in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. H5N6 viruses were not detected until November 2015. The H5N6 virus-positive rate increased markedly beginning in December 2015, and viruses were detected in LPMs in all districts of the city. Coincidently, two human cases with histories of poultry exposure developed symptoms and were diagnosed as H5N6-positive in Shenzhen during late December 2015 and early January 2016. Similar viruses were identified in environmental samples collected in the LPMs and the patients. In contrast to previously reported H5N6 viruses, viruses with six internal genes derived from the H9N2 or H7N9 viruses were detected in the present study. The increased H5N6 virus-positive rate in the LPMs and the subsequent human infections demonstrated that sustained LPM surveillance for avian influenza viruses provides an early warning for human infections. Interventions, such as LPM closures, should be immediately implemented to reduce the risk of human infection with the H5N6 virus when the virus is widely detected during LPM surveillance.","output":"Sustained live poultry market surveillance contributes to early warnings for human infection with avian influenza viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this article, we have explored methods for the strategic management of web projects By introducing a long-term web project development strategy into the operation of a web project, mechanisms can be developed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the web project An important factor is to develop a strategy taking into account all possible crisis situations and ways out of these situations The authors analyzed and simulated the web project structure, working out methods of web project strategy realization and implementation in a crisis situation Additionally, in this article, the authors have presented the model for the strategic map of the balanced scorecard of a web project The authors tested the developed methods on six web projects of university departments The received results confirmed the appropriateness and necessity of the development and implementation of methods of the strategic management of web projects ? 2021 by the authors Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland","output":"Development of methods for the strategic management of web projects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This months Genome Watch highlights how metagenomics can be used for surveillance and studying infections with respiratory pathogens.","output":"Metagenomics for surveillance of respiratory pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Among COVID-19 patients, the decision of which ventilation strategy to adopt is crucial and not guided by existing outcome evidence. We described the clinical characteristics and outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients according to the adopted respiratory strategy. Methods: Population-based cohort study including all COVID-19 patients (26/02/2020-18/04/2020) within Rimini Italian province. Hospitalized patients were classified according to the maximum level of respiratory support: oxygen supplementation (group Oxygen), NIV (group NIV-only), IMV (group IMV-only), and IMV after a NIV trial (group IMV-after-NIV). Sixty-day mortality risk was estimated with a Cox proportional hazard analysis adjusted by age, sex, and administration of steroids, canakinumab, and tocilizumab. Findings: We identified 1,424 symptomatic patients: 520 (36.5%) were hospitalized, the remaining 904 (63.5%) were treated at home with no 60-days death. According to the respiratory support, 408 (78.5%) were assigned to Oxygen, 46 (8.8%) to NIV-only, 25 (4.8%) to IMV-after-NIV, and 41 (7.9%) to IMV-only groups. There was no significant difference in the P/F at IMV inception among IMV-after-NIV and IMV-only groups (p=0.9). Overall 60-day mortality was 24.2% (Oxygen: 23.0%; NIV-only: 19.6%; IMV-after-NIV: 32.0%; IMV-only: 36.6%; p = 0.165). Compared with Oxygen group, the 60-day mortality risk significantly increased for IMV-after-NIV (HR 2.776; p=0.024) and IMV-only group (HR 2.966; p=0.001). Conclusions: This study provides a population-based figure of the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.

In this paper, we are evaluating the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in limiting the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic during a wedding ceremony from Irbid, Northern Jordan. Agent-based modeling was used in a real wedding event that occurred at the beginning of the spread of the pandemic in Jordan. Two infected nationals of Jordan, who arrived in Jordan about a week before the event, initiated the spread of the pandemic within the contact community. METHODS: In this work, a strict national NPI that the government implemented is developed by using an abstract model with certain characteristics similar to the Jordanian community. Thus, the Jordanian community is represented in terms of ages, occupations, and population movements. After that, the extent of the impact of the NPI measures on the local community is measured. RESULTS: We observed the deterioration of the state of society while the epidemic is spreading among individuals in the absence of preventive measures. Also, the results show that the herd immunity case was an epidemic, with a high level of spread among the community with 918 cases during a short interval of time. On the other hand, the preventive measures scenario shows a totally controlled spread with only 74 cases applied on the same interval of time. Furthermore, a convergence in the actual results of the real system with the hypothetical system were detected in the case of applying the strict NPI measures.

Racist rhetoric toward East and Southeast Asian Americans and Canadians during COVID-19 tends to center on three themes-unclean food practices, eating any kind of animal, and spreading diseases-that form an \\"Asian health hazard\\" stereotype. For East and Southeast Asians in Canada and the U.S., believing that their group is being perceived as \\"health hazards\\" is associated with lower psychological well-being. The anti-Asian sentiment in Canada and the U.S during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic centers on perceptions of East and Southeast Asians as \\"health hazards\\", due to their alleged animal-eating habits, uncleanliness, and tendency to spread diseases. In a preregistered study, we demonstrated that for East and Southeast Asians in Canada and the U.S., their belief that society holds the Asian health hazard stereotype was associated with higher distress and lower life satisfaction. No differences were observed between East and Southeast Asian Americans (n = 352) and Canadians (n = 351), as well as Chinese and non-Chinese participants. Importantly, these effects were robust to pandemic- and discrimination-related stressors. We also demonstrated that Asian health hazard and perpetual foreigner stereotypes were psychometrically distinct.

A rapidly evolving body of literature has quantitatively demonstrated significant psychological impacts of the pandemic on health care workers. However, little is known about the lived experience of the pandemic for frontline medical staff. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the qualitative experience of perioperative staff from a large trauma hospital in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: Inductive thematic analysis using a critical realist approach was used to analyze data from 9 semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified. Hospital preparedness related to the perceived readiness of the hospital to respond to the pandemic and encompassed key subthemes around communication of policy changes, team leadership, and resource availability. Perceptions of readiness contributed to the perceived psychological impacts of the pandemic, which were highly varied and ranged from anger to anxiety. A number of coping strategies were identified in response to psychological impacts which incorporated both internal and external coping mechanisms. Finally, adaptation with time reflected change and growth over time, and encompassed all other themes. CONCLUSIONS: While frontline staff and hospitals have rapidly marshalled a response to managing the virus, relatively less consideration was seen regarding staff mental health in our study.

This study was conducted to create a nomogram to provide an objective medical basis for selectively performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among patients with isolated dizziness. METHODS This retrospective observational study enrolled patients who visited the ED of a tertiary hospital with isolated dizziness and underwent diffusion-weighted MRI and subsequently consulted with the departments of neurology, neurosurgery, or otorhinolaryngology. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors in patients diagnosed with central lesions to create a nomogram with the significant variables. RESULTS Of the 1,078 patients who were screened, 119 were diagnosed with central lesions. Significant variables in the multivariable logistic regression analysis were albumin levels (odds ratio [OR] = 0.339, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.188 to 0.610, p = 0.0003), inorganic phosphate levels (OR = 0.891, 95% CI = 0.832 to 0.954, p = 0.0010), history of ischemic stroke (OR = 3.170, 95% CI = 1.807 to 5.560, p < 0.0001), presyncope (OR = 3.152, 95% CI = 1.184 to 8.389, p = 0.0216), and nystagmus (OR = 0.365, 95% CI = 0.237 to 0.561, p < 0.0001).

Our objective was to update the data in a living systematic review of the literature concerning the efficacy and toxicity of the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Data sources were Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Daily, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Web of Science, Scopus up, preprint servers and Google from 8th October 2020 till 24th February 2021. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies at low or moderate risk of bias. The participants were hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and intervention was tocilizumab versus placebo or standard of care. We pooled crude risk ratios (RRs) of RCTs with a random effects model and evaluated inconsistency between studies with I2. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. RESULTS: Of 1600 citations, eight RCTs and 28 cohorts were eligible. The eight RCTs had low risk of bias, and with 6311 patients they examined the effect of tocilizumab on short-term mortality; pooled RR was 0.91 (95%CI 0.78-1.07, I2 25%). Only the REMAP-CAP and RECOVERY trials, with the majority of their patients on concomitant corticosteroids, showed lower 30-day mortality with tocilizumab use: RR 0.74 (95%CI 0.59-0.93) and 0.89 (95%CI 0.81-0.97), respectively. Seven RCTs, with 5391 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on risk of mechanical ventilation; pooled RR was 0.84 (95%CI 0.76-0.93), I2 0%, with a corresponding number needed to treat of 20 (95%CI 14.3-33.3). Eight RCTs, with 5340 patients, examined the effect of tocilizumab on a composite of poor outcome; pooled RR was 0.82 (95%CI 0.76-0.90, I2 3%). Data from the RCTs showed a lower risk of infections and no higher risk of serious adverse events with tocilizumab: pooled RR 0.67 (95%CI 0.45-0.99, eight RCTs) and 0.85 (95%CI 0.63-1.16, seven RCTs), respectively. Among 28 cohorts with 15 484 patients, the pooled adjusted RR for mortality was 0.53 (95%CI 0.43-0.67, I2 76%).

There has been no documentation on the effect of sodium azulene sulfonate on pharyngitis in laboratory models, probably because of no availability of such models. We recently established a pharyngitis model using capsaicin application on pharyngeal mucosa in rats. The present study investigated the antipharyngitis activity of sodium azulene sulfonate comparing with those of ruthenium red (vanilloid receptor antagonist, 8.5 and 85 mg/ml), ascorbic acid (antioxidative compound, 100 g/ml), povidone iodine (gargle as disinfectant, oxidative compound, 5 and 20 mg/ml) and diclofenac sodium (cyclooxygenase inhibitor, 0.1 and 1 mg/ml). As an antipharyngeal effect, the capsaicin\\\\induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa of the rat was evaluated. The capsaicin\\\\induced plasma exudation in the pharyngeal mucosa was inhibited by sodium azulene sulfonate (100 and 200 g/ml) as well as ruthenium red and ascorbic acid, but not by povidone iodine and dicrofenac sodium; povidone iodine rather promoted the plasma exudation. In conclusion, the antipharyngitis effect of sodium azulene sulfonate was demonstrated for the first time in a laboratory model.

This time-based deferment has reduced since 2013; from an initial lifetime ban, to five-years, one-year, and now three-months. Our previous research revealed that gay, bisexual, queer, and other MSM (GBM) supported making blood donation policies gender-neutral and behaviour-based. In this analysis, we explored the willingness of Canadian GBM to donate plasma, even if they were not eligible to donate blood. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 39 HIV-negative GBM in Vancouver (n = 15), Toronto (n = 13), and Montreal (n = 11), recruited from a large respondent-driven sampling study called Engage. Men received some basic information on plasma donation prior to answering questions. Transcripts were coded in NVivo following inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Many GBM expressed a general willingness to donate plasma if they became eligible; like with whole blood donation, GBM conveyed a strong desire to help others in need. However, this willingness was complicated by the fact that most participants had limited knowledge of plasma donation and were unsure of its medical importance. Participants perspectives on a policy that enabled MSM to donate plasma varied, with some viewing this change as a stepping stone to a reformed blood donation policy and others regarding it as insufficient and constructing GBM as second-class donors. When discussing plasma, many men reflected on the legacy of blood donor policy-related discrimination. Our data reveal a significant plasma policy disjuncturea gulf between the critical importance of plasma donation from the perspective of Canadas blood operators and patients and the feelings of many GBM who understood this form of donation as less important. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma donor policies must be considered in relation to MSM blood donation policies to understand how donor eligibility practices are made meaningful by GBM in the context of historical disenfranchisement. Successful establishment of a MSM plasma donor policy will require extensive education, explicit communication of how this new policy contributes to continued/stepwise reform of blood donor policies, and considerable reconciliation with diverse GBM communities.","output":"Stepping Stones or Second Class Donors?: a qualitative analysis of gay, bisexual, and queer mens perspectives on plasma donation policy in Canada"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This report and its related products ultimately aim to help improve health and health equity, during COVID-19 and beyond by focusing on the integration of social care into the delivery of health care","output":"Integrating social care into the delivery of health care: moving upstream to improve the nation's health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (COVID-19) first detected in Wuhan, China, has created a public health emergency all over the world.

Two important products of tryptophan metabolism, viz kynurenine and interleukin (IL)4-inducible1 (IL41)-driven indole 3 pyruvate (I3P), activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thereby altering the nature of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. AhR activation dysregulates the initial pro-inflammatory cytokines production driven by neutrophils, macrophages, and mast cells, whilst AhR activation suppresses the endogenous antiviral responses of natural killer cells and CD8+ T cells. Such immune responses become further dysregulated by the increased and prolonged pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression of pineal melatonin production coupled to increased gut dysbiosis and gut permeability. The suppression of pineal melatonin and gut microbiome-derived butyrate, coupled to an increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) further dysregulates the immune response. The AhR mediates its effects via alterations in the regulation of mitochondrial function in immune cells. The increased risk of severe/fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection by high risk conditions, such as elderly age, obesity, and diabetes are mediated by these conditions having expression levels of melatonin, AhR, butyrate, and LPS that are closer to those driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has a number of future research and treatment implications, including the utilization of melatonin and nutraceuticals that inhibit the AhR, including the polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol.","output":"Tryptophan Metabolites and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter describes the interactions between the different structural components of the viruses and discusses their relevance for the process of virion formation.

RECENT FINDINGS: People with gout are likely to be at an increased risk of poor outcomes after COVID-19 infection due to comorbid cardiometabolic conditions. The effects of chronic hyperuricemia on trained immunity, and the hyperinflammatory state induced by gout itself may also play a role. Frequent courses of glucocorticoids for gout flares may be associated with adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection and reduced immunogenicity to the COVID-19 vaccination. Similarities between the pathophysiology of gout flares and the dysregulated inflammatory response of severe COVID-19 have been identified. Medications used in the treatment of gout, including colchicine and interleukin-1 inhibitors, have shown promise in the treatment of COVID-19 in clinical trials. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on gout care, with patients reporting more difficulty with disease control, accessing medications and healthcare, and poorer quality of life.

Patients were categorized into two groups: the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group, treated with HCQ in a dose of 400 mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily; the non HCQ group, treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to protocols recommended by the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the time. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation. Overall survival was also assessed. 568 patients who received HCQ (treatment group) were compared with 207 patients who did not receive HCQ (control group). HCQ did not improve mortality in the treated group (7.7% vs. 7.2%). There were no significant differences in terms of duration of hospitalization, need for and time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation among the groups.

Many such burns are deep partial or full-thickness and require some form of debridement to allow burn depth assessment, enhance healing and reduce scarring. At present, most deep burns are treated surgically, with a minority of patients treated with the only commercially available enzymatic debridement agent in the US, collagenase. However, there are few if any studies that demonstrate the efficacy of a collagenase-based enzymatic agent. In contrast, based on extensive preclinical and clinical data, a bromelain based enzymatic agent is now approved in Europe for treating deep burns. This agent is derived from the stems of pineapples and enriched with bromelain. No study has directly compared the debriding efficacy of a collagenase-based versus bromelain-based enzymatic agent. In this study, we hypothesize that a bromelain-based enzymatic agent will be more effective at debriding partial thickness burns compared with the collagenase based agent. We further hypothesize that the bromelain based agent will completely debride the burns after a single 4-hour application while the collagenase-based agent will be less effective and will require multiple daily applications. Finally, we hypothesize that burns debrided with the bromelain-based agent will heal faster than those debrided with the collagenase-based agent. Supportive results may lead to a major advance in how we provide therapy to hundreds of thousands of burn victims each year. Methods: This study will be conducted in an accredited medical center with 2 female domestic pigs. Our method of creating burns results in standardized and reproducible partial thickness burns based on a previously validated model. Burn wounds will be followed for a period of 28 days. Digital imaging and full thickness skin biopsies will be obtained at 4 hours, and at 10, 14, 18 and 28 days. Biopsies will be subjected to blinded histomorphometric analysis. Results: None currently available. To date we are awaiting the bromelain and collagenase product which is being shipped internationally to our location (delayed due to COVID19). Conclusion: Although we cannot draw any conclusions presently, preliminary data from the mentors lab concluded that a single 4-hour application of a bromelain-based enzymatic agent completely debride deep partial thickness burns in a validated porcine model. If the bromelain-based enzymatic agent shows to be more efficacious than collagenase, it may replace both collagenase mediated and surgical debridement. Ultimately, this could lead to fewer consequences from the injury to the patient, better aesthetic outcomes at the site of injury, and potentially a decreased financial burden.","output":"EMF Comparison of the Effects of a Bromelain and Collagenase-based Enzymatic Agent on Inflammation and Eschar Debridement in a Partial Thickness Porcine Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose- Health systems are faced with the challenge of ensuring fast access to appropriate therapy for patients with acute stroke. The paradigms primarily discussed are mothership and drip and ship. Less attention has been focused on the drip-and-drive () paradigm. Our aim was to analyze whether and under what conditions  would predict the greatest probability of good outcome for patients with suspected ischemic stroke in Northwestern Germany. Methods- Conditional probability models based on the decay curves for endovascular therapy and intravenous thrombolysis were created to determine the best transport paradigm, and results were displayed using map visualizations. Our study area consisted of the federal states of Lower Saxony, Hamburg, and Schleswig-Holstein in Northwestern Germany covering an area of 64 065 km2 with a population of 12 703 561 in 2017 (198 persons per km2). In several scenarios, the catchment area, that is, the region that would result in the greatest probability of good outcomes, was calculated for each of the mothership, drip-and-ship, and the  paradigms. Several different treatment time parameters were varied including onset-to-first-medical-response time, ambulance-on-scene time, door-to-needle time at primary stroke center, needle-to-door time, door-to-needle time at comprehensive stroke center, door-to-groin-puncture time, needle-to-interventionalist-leave time, and interventionalist-arrival-to-groin-puncture time. Results- The mothership paradigm had the largest catchment area; however, the  catchment area was larger than the drip-and-ship catchment area so long as the needle-to-interventionalist-leave time and the interventionalist-arrival-to-groin-puncture time remain <40 minutes each. A slowed workflow in the  paradigm resulted in a decrease of the  catchment area to 1221 km2 (2%). Conclusions- Our study suggests the largest catchment area for the mothership paradigm and a larger catchment area of  paradigm compared with the drip-and-ship paradigm in Northwestern Germany in most scenarios. The existence of different paradigms allows the spread of capacities, shares the cost and hospital income, and gives primary stroke centers the possibility to provide endovascular therapy services 24/7.","output":"Modeling the Optimal Transportation for Acute Stroke Treatment: The Impact of the Drip-and-Drive Paradigm."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One major micronutrient known to have a possible protective effect against COVID-19 disease is vitamin D.

Methods: Three databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar were searched systematically to obtain English language journal article published within 1/12/2019 and 3/11/2020. The search consisted of the terms (\\"Vitamin D,\\" OR \\"25-Hydroxyvitamin D,\\" OR \\"Low Vitamin D.\\") AND (\\"COVID-19\\" OR \\"2019-nCoV\\" OR \\"Coronavirus\\" OR \\"SARS-CoV-2\\") AND (\\"disease severity\\" OR \\"IMV\\" OR \\"ICU admission\\" OR \\"mortality\\" OR \\"hospitalization\\" OR \\"infection\\"). We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines in executing this study. After going through the screening of the articles, eleven articles were included in the review. Findings: Almost all the included studies reported a positive association between Vitamin D sufficiency and COVID-19 status and health outcomes. Vitamin D deficient patients (< 25 ng/mL) are 5.84 times [aOR=6.84, p=0.01] more likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the vitamin D sufficient people. Another study also found that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with higher risk of death with Hazard ratio (HR) 14.73, p<0.001. Vitamin D deficient (<12 ng/mL) people were 2.2 times [aOR=3.2, p=0.07] more likely to develop severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease compared to the vitamin D sufficient people.

The interdisciplinary diagnostics during the study visit, including cardiovascular, pneumatological, neurological, and psychiatric tests, were performed. All patients completed the study. Two-hundred unselected adult Caucasian men and women who had symptoms of COVID-19 in the acute phase were included, of which 86 patients had the disease without the need for hospitalization. RESULTS: The median (IQR) time from symptom onset to the study visit was 107 (87-117) and 105 (79-127) days in non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients, respectively. Lung lesions in high-resolution computed tomography were found in 10 (8.8%) and 33 (39.3%) non-hospitalized and hospitalized patients (P <0.01), respectively; no lesions were visualized on chest X-ray images. Elevated platelet distribution width was found in more than 70% of patients in both groups. More than half of the patients had insomnia, regardless of the hospitalization status.

We sought to explore what clinical information is readily available to patients who have been offered innovative surgical procedures, using two examples drawn from our recent experience: one a surgical technique, and the other a prosthetic material. We wanted to determine from our review the extent to which information available on the Internet might augment the medical literature and help satisfy the ethical requirements for patients to be adequately informed before they proceed with innovative surgery. METHODS A scoping review of the medical literature was performed to look for studies addressing the review aims; targeted searches on Google, YouTube, and patient websites were carried out to find readily available patient information on two chosen innovative surgical procedures. We conducted a content analysis of the selected references to determine the availability, relevance, and the utility of the published information to a layperson. RESULTS Medical database searches identified 614 records, 91 were screened and only six were relevant. The Internet searches returned thousands of results; however, we limited our screening to the first five pages of results for those sources. From both types of searches, 348 references were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 51 were included in the analysis. The findings are presented in four themes: safety and feasibility of the technique, availability and accessibility to a layperson, relevance and utility to a layperson, and commercial information. CONCLUSION The review has shown that lay people seeking to find out more about the two innovations would get very little useful information from Google, YouTube, or patient websites. Practitioners offering SI should provide sufficient information to allow their patients to make an autonomous decision about whether to proceed.

Promoting healthy behaviors in the daily travels and transport choices of adolescents is very important in early establishing healthy habits that imply routine physical activity.

The paper investigates these aspects by means of a discrete choice experiment, using data from more than 4300 16C17 year-old adolescents in Italy. The results show that adolescents generally prefer walking for long time alone. However, females prefer cycling, while adolescents from lower educated families prefer motorized means of transport. Environmental factors affect the adolescents preferences: living nearby a green area is associated with more active and healthier choices in their short daily travels. Conversely, adolescents living closer to an industrial or high traffic area prefer to use motorized vehicles.

In this review, we critically appraise the current pharmacological, preclinical and clinical data of azithromycin for treating COVID-19. Interest in azithromycin has been fuelled by favourable treatment outcomes in other viral pneumonias, a documented antiviral effect on SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and uncontrolled case series early in the pandemic. Its antiviral effects presumably result from interfering with receptor mediated binding, viral lysosomal escape, intracellular cell-signalling pathways and enhancing type I and III interferon expression. Its immunomodulatory effects may mitigate excessive inflammation and benefit tissue repair. Currently, in vivo reports on azithromycin in COVID-19 are conflicting and do not endorse its widespread use outside of clinical trials. They are, however, mostly retrospective and therefore inherently biased. The effect size of azithromycin may depend on when it is started. Also, extended follow-up is needed to assess benefits in the recovery phase.

Limited data on the quality and performance of mechanical ventilation in HEMS are available in the literature. METHOD: We conducted an international survey to evaluate mechanical ventilation infrastructure in HEMS and collect data of transported ventilated patients. From June 20C22, 2019, the participating HEMS bases were asked to provide data via a web-based platform. Vital parameters and ventilation settings of the patients at first patient contact and at handover were compared using non-parametric statistical tests. RESULTS: Out of 215 invited HEMS bases, 53 responded. Respondents were from Germany, Denmark, United Kingdom, Luxembourg, Austria and Switzerland. Of the HEMS bases, all teams were physician staffed, mainly anesthesiologists (79%), the majority were board certified (92.5%) and trained in intensive care medicine (89%) and had a median (range) experience in HEMS of 9 (0C25) years. HEMS may provide a high level of expertise in mechanical ventilation whereas the majority of ventilators are able to provide pressure controlled ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure modes (77%). Data of 30 ventilated patients with a median (range) age of 54 (21C100) years and 53% male gender were analyzed. Of these, 24 were primary missions and 6 interfacility transports. At handover, oxygen saturation (p < 0.01) and positive end-expiratory pressure (p = 0.04) of the patients were significantly higher compared to first patient contact. CONCLUSION: In this survey, the management of ventilated HEMS-patients was not associated with ventilation related serious adverse events. Patient conditions, training of medical crew and different technical and environmental resources are likely to influence management. Further studies are necessary to assess safety and process quality of mechanical ventilation in HEMS.

Despite advances in supportive care approaches, ARDS is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-based therapy may be an potential alternative strategy for treating ARDS by targeting the various pathophysiological events of ARDS. By releasing a variety of paracrine factors and extracellular vesicles, MSC can exert anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-microbial, and pro-angiogenic effects, promote bacterial and alveolar fluid clearance, disrupt the pulmonary endothelial and epithelial cell damage, eventually avoiding the lung and distal organ injuries to rescue patients with ARDS. An increasing number of experimental animal studies and early clinical studies verify the safety and efficacy of MSC therapy in ARDS. Since low cell engraftment and survival in lung limit MSC therapeutic potentials, several strategies have been developed to enhance their engraftment in the lung and their intrinsic, therapeutic properties.

Locoregional therapies include ablation and hepatic artery therapies such as embolization and radioembolization. In this study we evaluate the feasibility of using novel antivascular ultrasound (AVUS) as a noninvasive locoregional therapy to reduce perfusion in HCC lesions in a rat model and, monitor the effect with contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging. Methods: HCC was induced in 36 Wistar rats by the ingestion of 0.01% diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for 12 weeks. Two therapy regimens of AVUS were evaluated. A primary regimen (n = 19) utilized 2-W/cm2, 3-MHz ultrasound (US) for 6 minutes insonation with 0.7 ml of microbubbles administered as an intravenous bolus. An alternate dose at half the primary intensity, sonication time, and contrast concentration was evaluated in 11 rats to assess the efficacy of a reduced dose. A control group (n = 6) received a sham therapy. Tumor perfusion was measured before and after AVUS with nonlinear contrast ultrasound (NLC) and power Doppler (PD). The quantitative perfusion measures included perfusion index (PI), peak enhancement (PE), time to peak (TTP), and perfusion area from NLC and PD scans. Total tumor area perfused during the scan was measured by a postprocessing algorithm called delta projection. Tumor histology was evaluated for signs of tissue injury and for vascular changes using CD31 immunohistochemistry. Results: DEN exposure induced autochthonous hepatocellular carcinoma lesions in all rats. Across all groups prior to therapy, there were no significant differences in the nonlinear contrast observations of peak enhancement and perfusion index. In the control group, there were no significant differences in any of the parameters after sham treatment. After the primary AVUS regimen, there were significant changes in all parameters (p  0.05) indicating substantial decreases in tumor perfusion. Peak enhancement in nonlinear contrast scans showed a 37.9%  10.1% decrease in tumor perfusion. Following reduced-dose AVUS, there were no significant changes in perfusion parameters, although there was a trend for the nonlinear contrast observations of peak enhancement and perfusion index to increase. Conclusion: This study translated low-intensity AVUS therapy into a realistic in vivo model of HCC and evaluated its effects on the tumor vasculature. The primary dose of AVUS tested resulted in significant vascular disruption and a corresponding reduction in tumor perfusion. A reduced dose of AVUS, on the other hand, was ineffective at disrupting perfusion but demonstrated the potential for enhancing tumor blood flow. Theranostic ultrasound, where acoustic energy and microbubbles are used to monitor the tumor neovasculature as well as disrupt the vasculature and treat lesions, could serve as a potent tool for delivering noninvasive, locoregional therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.","output":"Microbubble-enhanced ultrasound for the antivascular treatment and monitoring of hepatocellular carcinoma."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This research aims to develop and test a model of digital health communication media (DHCM) use for healthy food information C DHCM usage C during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Three Fab clones recognized recombinant MSP-1(19) under nonreducing conditions. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that three Fab clones stained the surfaces of late trophozoites/schizonts and merozoites of the FCR3 and 3D7 strains, suggesting the Fabs' reactivities to a conserved epitope. Sequence analysis of the heavy-chain genes revealed that the closest germ line V segments were VH1-8 and VH7-81, with 91% to 98% homology. The closest germ line D segment was D3-10, and the closest germ line J segment was JH4 or JH5, with 90% to 97% homology. In the light-chain genes, the closest germ line V segment was A27 for the Jkappa2, Jkappa4, and Jkappa5 segments. The dissociation constants of these Fab fragments for recombinant MSP-1(19) ranged from 1.09 x 10(-9) to 2.66 x 10(-9) M.

CASE REPORT: An 84-year-ool male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was admitted for respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was continued on his home apixaban 5 mg twice daily. On day 2 of admission, he developed a new aphasia, and right-sided facial droop. Computed tomography (CT) head was unrevealing. CT angiography did not show large vessel occlusion. CT perfusion demonstrated a left middle cerebral artery ischemic penumbra, without core.

Transplacental SARS-CoV-2 transmission is typically accompanied by chronic histiocytic intervillositis together with necrosis and positivity of syncytiotrophoblast for SARSCoV-2. Hofbauer cells are placental macrophages that have been involved in viral diseases including HIV and Zika virus, but their involvement in SARS-CoV-2 in unknown. OBJECTIVE: - To determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can extend beyond the syncytiotrophoblast to enter Hofbauer cells, endothelium and other villous stromal cells in infected placentas of liveborn and stillborn infants. DESIGN: - Case-based retrospective analysis by 29 perinatal and molecular pathology specialists of placental findings from a preselected cohort of 22 SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas delivered to pregnant women testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 from 7 countries. Molecular pathology methods were used to investigate viral involvement of Hofbauer cells, villous capillary endothelium, syncytiotrophoblast and other fetal-derived cells. RESULTS: - Chronic histiocytic intervillositis and trophoblast necrosis was present in all 22 placentas (100%). SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Hofbauer cells from 4/22 placentas (18%). Villous capillary endothelial staining was positive in 2/22 cases (9%), both of which also had viral positivity in Hofbauer cells. Syncytiotrophoblast staining occurred in 21/22 placentas (95%). Hofbauer cell hyperplasia was present in 3/22 placentas (14%). In the 7 cases having documented transplacental infection of the fetus, 2 occurred in placentas with Hofbauer cell staining positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: - SARS-CoV-2 can extend beyond the trophoblast into the villous stroma, involving Hofbauer cells and capillary endothelial cells, in a small number of infected placentas.

We inspected catheter lab records and interviewed electrophysiologists in each centre to gather information on the impact of the pandemic on working patterns and on the health of staff members and patients. There was a striking decline in interventional electrophysiology activity in each of the centres. The decline occurred within a week of the recognition of widespread community transmission of the virus in each region and shows a striking correlation with the national figures for new diagnoses of COVID-19 in each case. During the period of restriction, workflow dropped to <5% of normal, consisting of emergency cases only. In two of three centres, electrophysiologists were redeployed to perform emergency work outside electrophysiology. Among the centres studied, only Wenzhou has seen a recovery from the restrictions in activity. Following an intense nationwide programme of public health interventions, local transmission of COVID-19 ceased to be detectable after 18 February allowing the electrophysiology service to resume with a strict testing regime for all patients.

Here, BALB/c mice were topically exposed to OPA (0.5%) for 3-days, rested, then topically exposed to DDAC (0.0625, 0.125, 0.25%) for 14-days. Co-exposure resulted in phenotypic changes in draining lymph node (dLN) cells, including a decreased frequency of CD8+ T cells and increased frequency and number of B cells compared to DDAC-only treated mice. The co-exposed mice also had enhanced Th2 responses, including significant alterations in: dLN Il4 (increased), B-cell activation (increased), CD8 T-cell activation (decreased), and local and systemic IgE production (increased). These changes were not observed if mice were exposed to DDAC prior to OPA. Exposure to OPA alone shows Th2 skewing, indicated by increased activation of skin type 2 innate lymphoid cells, increased frequency and activation of draining lymph node B cells, and increased levels of type 2 cytokines. These findings suggest that the OPA-induced immune environment may alter the response to DDAC, resulting in increased IgE mediated immune responses.

Design: In this retrospective study, we included all adults admitted to the inpatient medicine service at George Washington University Hospital between March 12, 2020 and May 9, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors not requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring ICU transfer, survivors requiring intubation, and non-survivors. Key Results: 299 patients were included in our study, of whom 69 required transfer to the ICU, 39 required intubation, and 71 died. Threshold values for IL-6 (>50 pg/mL), D-dimer (>3 mcg/mL), ferritin (>450 ng/mL), CRP (>100 mg/L), and LDH (1,200 u/L) were found to be statistically significant and independently associated with higher odd of clinical deterioration and death. Hypertension, CVA and heart disease independently had an increased risk of all three outcomes, while CKD had only an increased risk of death. Patient co-morbidities had no effect on the different biomarkers' significant association with poor patient clinical outcomes, except cancer. Conclusion: Laboratory markers of inflammation and coagulopathy can help clinicians identify patients who are at high risk for clinical deterioration, independent of clinically significant medical comorbidities","output":"The Association Between Biomarkers and Clinical Outcomes in Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pneumonia in a U.S. Cohort"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme disease. Recent studies have shown that recognition of the spirochete is mediated by TLR2 and NOD2. The latter receptor has been associated with the induction of the intracellular degradation process called autophagy. The present study demonstrated for the first time the induction of autophagy by exposure to B. burgdorferi and that autophagy modulates the B. burgdorferi-dependent cytokine production. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with autophagy inhibitors showed an increased IL-1 and IL-6 production in response to the exposure of the spirochete, whereas TNF production was unchanged. Autophagy induction against B. burgdorferi was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS) because cells from patients with chronic granulomatous disease, which are defective in ROS production, also produced elevated IL-1. Further, the enhanced production of the proinflammatory cytokines was because of the elevated mRNA expression in the absence of autophagy. Our results thus demonstrate the induction of autophagy, which, in turn, modulates cytokine production by B. burgdorferi for the first time.","output":"Autophagy modulates Borrelia burgdorferi-induced production of interleukin-1 (IL-1)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the present article, we explore the risks of circadian disruptions and impact on the sleep-wake cycle of individuals with diabetes during COVID-19 pandemic The association between the duration and quality of sleep and the stability of glucose levels is well-established Therefore, during the pandemic with changes and limitations in the exposure to cyclic cues that entrain the circadian rhythms, such as light-dark and social interactions, we hypothesize that the power and stability of circadian rhythms decrease if measures are not taken to intentionally create a routine that includes zeitgebers Knowing that sleep-wake cycle disruptions impair melatonin production, immune system response and glucose metabolism, and that individuals with diabetes are at higher risk for poor prognosis when infected by SARS-CoV-2 (especially if their blood glucose is out of target), we recommend monitoring and advising these individuals towards strategies to maintain adequate sleep quality and duration as part of their preventive and protective measures during the new pandemic routine","output":"Sleep-wake cycle impairment adding on the risk for COVID-19 severity in people with diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The successful development of effective vaccines has been elusive for many of the worlds most important infectious diseases. Additionally, much of the population, such as the aged or immunocompromised, are unable to mount an effective immunologic response for existing vaccines. Vectored Immunoprophylaxis (VIP) is a novel approach designed to address these challenges. Rather than utilizing an antigen to trigger a response from the hosts immune system as is normally done with traditional vaccines, VIP genetically engineers the production of tailored antibodies from non-hematopoietic cells, bypassing the humoral immune system. Direct administration of genes encoding for neutralizing antibodies has proven to be effective in both preventing and treating several infectious diseases in animal models. While, a significant amount of work has focused on HIV, including an ongoing clinical trial, the approach has also been shown to be effective for malaria, dengue, hepatitis C, influenza, and more. In addition to presenting itself as a potentially efficient approach to solving long-standing vaccine challenges, the approach may be the best, if not only, method to vaccinate immunocompromised individuals. Many issues still need to be addressed, including which tissue(s) makes the most suitable platform, which vector(s) are most efficient at transducing the platform tissue used to secrete the antibodies, and what are the long-term effects of such a treatment.

In tMCAO model, intraluminal suture technique is widely used to achieve ischemia and reperfusion. However, variation of infarct volume in this model often requires large sample size, which hinders the progress of preclinical research. Our previous study demonstrated that infarct volume was related to the success of reperfusion although the reason remained unclear. The aim of present study is to explore the relationship between focal thrombus formation and model reproducibility with respect to infarct volume. We hypothesize that suture-induced thrombosis causes infarct volume variability due to insufficient reperfusion after suture withdrawal. Seventy-two adult male CD-1 mice underwent 90 minutes of tMCAO with or without intraperitoneal administration of heparin. Dynamic synchrotron radiation microangiography (SRA) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were performed before and after tMCAO to observe the cerebral vascular morphology and to measure the cerebral blood flow in vivo. Infarct volume and neurological score were examined to evaluate severity of ischemic brain injury. We found that the rate of successful reperfusion was much higher in heparin-treated mice compared to that in heparin-free mice according to the result of SRA and LSCI at 1 and 3 hours after suture withdrawal (p<0.05). Pathological features and SRA revealed that thrombus formed in the internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery or anterior cerebral artery, which blocked reperfusion following tMCAO.

Active myocarditis, a suspected precursor of IDC, is myocardial inflammation and injury without ischemia. The disease ranges from a self-limited flulike illness to one of serious consequence with arrhythmias, heart failure, or death. Many agents have been associated with myocarditis, and the clinical manifestations depend on an interplay between the inciting agent and the host response. The development of a murine model and the expanded use of endomyocardial biopsy using the Dallas criteria have increased our understanding of myocarditis and its sequelae.

METHODS: The EQA program consisted of two phases; self-validation and blind assessment. For the first EQA phase, in vitro transcribed upstream region of the envelope gene (upE) and the open reading frame (ORF)1a RNAs were used at a concentration of 1,000 copies/L. The test panel for the second EQA phase consisted of RNA extracts from three samples, which were obtained from two MERS-CoV positive patients and one MERS-CoV negative patient. RESULTS: The first EQA phase results for 46 participants showed a linear relationship between the threshold cycle (C(T)) values of RNA materials and the logarithmic concentrations for both upE and ORF1a gene targets (R(2)=0.73 and 0.75, respectively). The mean C(T) value for each concentration was different depending on which commercial kit was used for the assay. Among the three commonly used kits, PowerChek MERS Real-Time PCR kit (KogeneBiotech, Korea) showed the lowest C(T) values at all concentrations of upE and most concentrations of ORF1a.

Lung fibroblasts are known as a potent producer of inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and eotaxin 1, by which neutrophils and eosinophils are strongly attracted during inflammation. Therefore, we studied the effects of GL on the production of these chemokines using a human fetal lung fibroblast cell line, HFL-1, stimulated with TNF- and IL-4. Moreover, we examined the structureCactivity relationships of GL to explore more beneficial compounds. 18,-GL inhibited IL-8 dose-dependently and inhibited eotaxin 1 slightly. 18,-Glycyrrhetic acid (GA) did not inhibit IL-8 but inhibited eotaxin 1.

In addition, responses of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals (OHCPs) were compared. METHODS: The inclusion criteria were all staff working in clinical areas of the hospital. Staff were invited to take part using a link to an online questionnaire advertised by email, posters displayed in clinical areas, and social media. Questions grouped into the three key themes - staff awareness, perceptions, and concerns - were answered using a five-point Likert scale. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare results across all three groups of staff. RESULTS: Overall, 315 staff took part in our study. There was a high awareness of PPE guidance at 84.4%, but only 52.4% of staff reported adequate PPE provision. 67.9% were still keen to come to work, despite very high levels of anxiety relating to contracting COVID-19 despite wearing PPE. Doctors had significantly higher ratings for questions relating to PPE awareness compared to other staff groups, while nursing staff and OHCPs had significantly higher levels of anxiety compared to doctors in relation to PPE and contracting COVID-19 (p < 0.05 using a Kruskal-Wallis test).

We hope the insight and recommendations from this study can improve the PPE situation and maintain the health and wellbeing of the clinical work force, in order to care for COVID-19 patients safely and effectively.","output":"Personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 crisis: a snapshot and recommendations from the frontline of a university teaching hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We report on how one community builds capacity for disrupting injustice and supporting each other during the COVID-19 crisis We engaged long-term community partners (parents, their youth, and local community center leaders) in on-going conversation on their experiences with the pandemic We learned with and from community partners about how and what people in communities most vulnerable in this crisis learn about and respond to COVID-19 in highly contextualized ways, individually and through extended family groups and trusted social networks We report on how they put understandings towards educated, organized, urgent community infrastructuring actions within informal coalition networks We explore these actions as necessary localized responses to systemic neglect from dominant institutional infrastructures during a global pandemic","output":"Community Infrastructuring as Necessary Ingenuity in the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Boleslaw waste heap in South Poland, with total soil Zn concentrations higher than 50,000 mg kg-1, 5,000 mg Pb kg-1, and 500 mg Cd kg-1, is a unique habitat for metallicolous plants, such as Trifolium repens L.

Rhizobia originating from the nutrient-poor waste heap area showed to be efficient in plant nodulation and nitrogen fixation. They demonstrated not only potential plant growth promotion traits in vitro, but they also improved the growth of T. repens plants to a similar extent as strains from a non-polluted reference area. Our results revealed that the adaptations of T. repens to high Zn-Pb-Cd concentrations are related to the storage of metals predominantly in the roots (excluder strategy) due to nodule apoplast modifications (i.e., thickening and suberization of cell walls, vacuolar storage), and symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi of a substantial genetic diversity. As a result, the rhizobia-mycorrhizal fungi-T. repens association appears to be a promising tool for phytostabilization of Zn-Pb-Cd-polluted soils.","output":"An Alliance of Trifolium repens-Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii-Mycorrhizal Fungi From an Old Zn-Pb-Cd Rich Waste Heap as a Promising Tripartite System for Phytostabilization of Metal Polluted Soils"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although sodium increases the risk of coronary artery disease and hypertension, whether sodium also impacts other cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors is less clear. We examined the causal role of urinary sodium in these CVDs and risk factors using Mendelian randomization. METHODS We identified strong, independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of urinary sodium from the most up to date genome wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 446,237) and applied them to GWAS of stroke and its subtypes (40,585 cases and 406,111 non-cases), atrial fibrillation (60,620 cases and 970,216 non-cases) and heart failure (47,309 cases and 930,014 non-case). We assessed the impact of sodium on these diseases and associated risk factors using inverse variance weighting. Sensitivity analyses included weighted median, contamination mixture method, MR-PRESSO, and multivariable Mendelian randomization. RESULTS Higher log transformed urinary sodium was associated with higher risk of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 2.08), ischemic stroke (OR 1.60 95% CI 1.12 to 2.30), heart failure (OR 1.77 95% CI 1.19 to 2.62), and type 2 diabetes (OR 4.17 95% CI 1.53 to 11.35).

In response, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued guidance on which groups should be prioritized to receive vaccines. For the first phase of vaccine allocation, the ACIP recommended healthcare personnel and long-term care facility residents as recipients. This recommendation was based on risks endemic to these populations, as well as ethical principles related to benefits and harms, mitigating health inequalities, and promoting justice. Commercial truck drivers have played a vital and underappreciated role during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the indispensable role that commercial drivers play in distributing vaccines, they have not been recommended for vaccine allocation in the next phase (1b) by the ACIP. However, the rationale and ethical principles cited for the first vaccine phase suggest that these workers should be recommended for inclusion. By doing so, the acquisition and transmission of COVID-19 may be mitigated, which would benefit both these workers and the US public. Further, persistent vulnerabilities render commercial truck drivers susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection; therefore, vaccination during the next phase is imperative to curb the exacerbation of extant health inequities. Finally, because present-day COVID-19 vulnerabilities in these workers have been shaped by unjust policies over the past several decades, and because COVID-19 public health policies have excluded and potentially exacerbated the impacts of the pandemic for these workers, allocating vaccines to commercial truck drivers is a necessary step toward promoting justice.","output":"Commercial truck drivers should be a priority population for COVID-19 vaccinations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the strategies on COVID-19 outbreak control in Shenzhen, and to clarify the feasibility of these strategies in metropolitans that have high population density and strong mobility. Methods: The epidemic feature of COVID-19 was described by different phases and was used to observe the effectiveness of intervention. Hierarchical spot map was drawn to clarify the distribution and transmission risk of infection sources at different time points. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Asymptomatic-Recovered model was established to estimate case numbers without intervention and compare with the actual number of cases to determine the effect of intervention. The positive rate of the nucleic acid test was used to reflect the risk of human exposure. A survey on COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude and behaviors were used to estimate the abilities of personal protection and emergency response. Results: The epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen experienced the rising, plateau and decline stage. The case number increased rapidly at the beginning, with short duration of peak period. Although the epidemic curve showed human-to-human transmission, the \\"trailing\\" was not obvious. From the spot map, during the intervention period, the source of infection was widely distributed. More cases and higher transmission risk were observed in areas with higher population density. After the effective intervention measures, both infection sources and the risk of transmission decreased. After compared with the estimated case numbers without intervention, actual number proved the COVID-19 control strategies were effective. The positive rate of nucleic acid test for high risk populations decreased and no new cases reported since February 16. Shenzhen citizens had high knowledge, attitude and behavior level, and high protection ability and emergency response. Conclusions: Although the response initiated by the health administration department played a key role at the early stage of the epidemic, it was not enough to contain the outbreak of COVID-19.

In this study, we investigated whether measurement of lung diffusing capacity for nitric oxide (DLNO ) offers additional insights on the presence and mechanisms of gas transport abnormalities. In 94 subjects, recovering from mild-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia, we measured DLNO and DLCO between 10 and 266 days after each patient was tested negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. In 38 subjects, a chest computed tomography (CT) was available for semiquantitative analysis at six axial levels and automatic quantitative analysis of entire lungs. DLNO was abnormal in 57% of subjects, independent of time of lung function testing and severity of COVID-19, whereas standard DLCO was reduced in only 20% and mostly within the first 3 months. These differences were not associated with changes of simultaneous DLNO /DLCO ratio, while DLCO /VA and DLNO /VA were within normal range or slightly decreased. DLCO but not DLNO positively correlated with recovery time and DLCO was within the normal range in about 90% of cases after 3 months, while DLNO was reduced in more than half of subjects. Both DLNO and DLCO inversely correlated with persisting CT ground glass opacities and mean lung attenuation, but these were more frequently associated with DLNO than DLCO decrease. These data show that an impairment of DLNO exceeding standard DLCO may be present during the recovery from COVID-19, possibly due to loss of alveolar units with alveolar membrane damage, but relatively preserved capillary volume.

Whilst the significant release of metal-enriched drainage has been documented during this event, the fate of these elements in receiving systems is still largely unknown. Here we investigate the spatial distribution, chemical partitioning, and potential bioavailability of S, Fe, Mn, Al, trace metals (V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Pb) and rare earth elements in the surficial sediments of Lake Albert, South Australia; a system that received prolonged (2007-2011) acidic drainage during the Millennium Drought. The highest concentrations of all metals (Enrichment Factors ranging from 1.06-1.97) were observed in the sediments closest to shorelines where sulfidic material were oxidised, generating metal-enriched acidic drainage. Localised enrichment indicates metals have not been completely redistributed across the system following their initial deposition by physical (wind-driven resuspension) or chemical (diagenetic and redox changes) processes. Based on selective extraction data, these metals are likely partitioned as discrete sulfides (Pb) or are with organic material (V, Cr, Cu, Pb, REEs), Fe monosulfides (V, Co, Ni), or pyrite (Co, Ni, Pb). Lake-wide enrichment of trace metals Cr (mean concentration 57 ppm), Ni (39 ppm), Cu (36 ppm), and Pb (24 ppm) relative to other Lower Murray River sites is also evident, suggesting that metal contamination associated with acidic drainage is not restricted to near-source sites. Importantly, the mobilisation, transport, and accumulation of metals is controlled by sediment transport pathways and system hydrology and will thus function differently under varying states of geomorphology, climate, and anthropogenic modification. Our study shows that extreme drought is recorded as a lasting geochemical signature in estuarine sediments, demonstrating that metal and rare earth element geochemistry provides insights into the distribution and behaviour of contaminants mobilised into dynamic, anthropogenically altered estuaries.","output":"Geochemical signatures of acidic drainage recorded in estuarine sediments after an extreme drought."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing evidence shows that many infections of COVID-19 are asymptomatic, becoming a global challenge, since asymptomatic infections have the same infectivity as symptomatic infections.

Participants included 138 emerging adults between the ages of 18-21 years (M = 19.33 years, SD = 1.11; 38.4% racial/ethnic minority) who identified as a gender (48.6%) and/or sexual minority (98.6%) and who reported living with a companion animal in the past year. We utilized the following analytic methods: (a) confirmatory factor analyses to compare the unidimensional structure of the CCAS with the two alternative models, (b) multiple group analyses to test measurement invariance across demographic groups, and (c) structural equation models to evaluate construct validity. Preliminary analysis found that the majority of participants did not endorse the two lowest response options. To conduct invariance testing, we eliminated items 3, 5, and 8 from the CCAS and collapsed the lowest response options. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported the use of this revised unidimensional model. We found evidence of measurement invariance across gender identity, sexual orientation, and race/ethnicity groups. Construct validity was supported by comparing the CCAS with factors on the Pet Attachment and Life Impact Scale; the positive association between the CCAS and anxiety are discussed in the context of prior research. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of validating human-animal interaction measures across samples from diverse backgrounds.

Through liquid chromatography-tandem high-resolution/mass spectrometry (HR/MS) analysis under negative ion mode, the fragmentation behavior for all parent fragment ions almost conformed to successive losses of sugar moieties, -dissociation and McLafferty rearrangement of aglycones in high-energy collision induced dissociation. The saccharide moieties produced sugar fragment ions from m/z (monosaccharide) to m/z (polysaccharides). The parent and sugar fragment ions of other saponins were predicted using the above mentioned fragmentation pattern.

We administered trial treatment once daily for a maximum of seven days until either death or hospital discharge. We measured zinc concentration at baseline and during treatment and observed patients for any significant side effects. RESULTS: For eligible patients, we randomised and administered treatment to 33 adult participants to either HDIVZn (n=15) or placebo (n=18). We observed no serious adverse events throughout the study for a total of 94 HDIVZn administrations. However, 3 participants in the HDIVZn group reported infusion site irritation.

As this virus has been associated with severe illness, it poses a threat to vulnerable populationsincluding pregnant women. The obstetric population already faces multiple barriers to receiving quality healthcare due to personal, environmental and economic barriers, now challenged with the additional risks of COVID-19 exposure and limited care in times much defined by social distancing. ASSESSMENT: The current prenatal care framework requires patients to attend multiple in-office prenatal visits that can exponentially multiply depending on maternal and fetal comorbidities. To decrease the rate of transmission of the COVID-19 and limit exposure to patients, providers in Hillsborough County, Florida (and nationwide) are rapidly transitioning to telehealth. The use of a virtual care model allows providers to reduce in-person visits and incorporate virtual visits into the schedule of prenatal care. CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, implementation of telehealth and telehealth have become crucial to ensure the safe and effective delivery of obstetric care.

In this paper, we adopt a qualitative approach to investigate how Australians learnt about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 and what sources of information they had found most useful and valuable during the early months of the pandemic. METHODS: In-depth semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with a diverse group of 40 Australian adults in mid-2020 about their experiences of the COVID-19 crisis. Participants were recruited through Facebook advertising. Detailed case studies were created for each participant, providing the basis of a thematic analysis which focused on the participants' responses to the questions about COVID-19-related information sources. RESULTS: Diverse sources of COVID-19-related information, including traditional media, online media and in-person interactions, were actively accessed, appraised and engaged with by participants. There was a high level of interest in COVID-19 information as people grappled with uncertainty, anxiety and feeling overwhelmed. Certain key events or experiences made people become aware that the outbreak was threatening Australia and potentially themselves. Most people demonstrated keen awareness that misinformation was rife in news outlets and social media sites and that they were taking steps to determine the accuracy of information. High trust was placed in health experts, scientists and government sources to provide reliable information. Also important to participants were informal discussions with friends and family members who were experts or working in relevant fields, as well as engaging in-person in interactions and hearing from friends and family who lived overseas about what COVID-19 conditions were like there. CONCLUSION: A constantly changing news environment raises challenges for effective communication of risk and containment advice. People can become confused, distressed and overwhelmed by the plethora of information sources and fast-changing news environment.

In its severe form, the disease is characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome, and there are no targeted intervention strategies to treat or prevent it. The immune response is thought to both contribute to the pathogenesis of disease and provide protection during its resolution. Thus, understanding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is of the utmost importance for developing and testing vaccines and therapeutics.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This trial was a prospective, multicentre, randomized, 12-week double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. The double-blind period was followed by a 24-week open-label clinical trial. One hundred patients with T2D who failed to achieve the glycaemic target (7.1%  HbA1c  9.0%) with conventional triple oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) of metformin, sulphonylurea, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) were assigned randomly 1:1 into teneligliptin and placebo-teneligliptin groups. The primary endpoint was mean change in HbA1c level from baseline in each group at 12 weeks. RESULTS In a total of 99 patients (n= 51 for the teneligliptin group, and n=48 for the placebo-teneligliptin group), the mean age and duration of diabetes were 60.7 and 13.6 years, respectively, and HbA1c was 7.8% at baseline. At 12 weeks, the teneligliptin group achieved a significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (-0.9  0.6%, p < 0.001) compared to the placebo group, with an inter-group difference of -0.75% (95% CI [-0.99, -0.51], p<0.001). At the end of the 24-week treatment, both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1c level from baseline (placebo-teneligliptin group, -0.8  0.6% [p<0.001], teneligliptin group, -0.9  0.6% [p < 0.001]), without significant inter-group difference (-0.17%, 95% CI [-0.41, 0.07], p = 0.156).

Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT) is one of the promising therapies being tried for COVID-19 patients. However, the presence or disappearance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (RNAemia) in convalescent plasma is unclear and the prognostic implication of viral RNA detection in these samples is not fully understood. Hence, we aimed to investigate SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in the convalescent plasma of COVID-19 patients. Methods & Materials Convalescent plasma samples from donors with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Samples were screened for the presence of Anti-SARS CoV-2 IgG antibodies using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay targeting the whole-cell antigen of SARS-CoV-2. Then plasma samples were pooled by the mixing of five samples. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 specific gene targets was performed for pooled plasma samples. Results A total of 250 convalescent plasma samples of COVID-19 patients with different disease severity were included in the study; of these, 149 (59.6%) were found to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using serological tests. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the convalescent plasma samples. Conclusion SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia was not found in individuals with a previous laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 28 days after the resolution of their symptoms. All RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients subsequently may not develop antibodies. Our study showed that screening for neutralizing antibody titres is more important rather than SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in convalescent plasma samples for therapeutic use.","output":"Investigation of SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in the convalescent plasma of COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is increasing interest from cancer patients and their healthcare providers in the use of virtual care in routine clinical practice. In the setting of hematologic malignancy, where patients often undergo complex and immunodepleting treatments, understanding how to use virtual care safely and effectively is critically important. We aimed to describe the use of virtual care in patients with hematologic malignancies and to examine physician- and patient-reported outcomes in the form of a systematic scoping review. An electronic search of PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, Elsevier Embase, Scopus, and EBSCO CINAHL was conducted from January 2000 to April 2021. A comprehensive search strategy was used to identify relevant articles, and data were extracted to assess the study design, population, setting, patient characteristics, virtual care platform, and study results. Studies were included if they described the use of virtual care for patients with hematologic malignancies; commentaries were excluded. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria after abstract and full-text review. Three studies found that app-based tools were effective in monitoring patient symptoms and triggering alerts for more urgent follow-up. Four studies described the use of phone-based interventions. Five studies found that videoconferencing, with both physicians and oncology nurses, was highly rated by patients. Emerging themes included high levels of patient satisfaction across all domains of virtual care. Provider satisfaction scores were rated lower than patient scores, with concerns about technical issues leading to challenges with virtual care. Four studies found that virtual care allowed providers to promptly respond to patient concerns, especially when patients were experiencing side-effects or had questions about their treatment. Overall, the use of virtual care in patients with hematologic malignancies appears feasible, and resulted in high patient satisfaction.

METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science from inception to June-6, 2020, limiting to the studies that reported the comparison of the effectiveness of CC in terms of CC rate, CC depth, the proportion of adequate CC rate, the proportion of adequate CC depth or proportion of adequate recoil; in study arms with or without PPE. Risk of bias was assessed by the ROB-2 and ROBINS-I tool. Quantitative data synthesis was done using the generic inverse variance method and the fixed-effects model. RESULTS: Five simulation-based studies were finally included. A Significant decrease in CC rate (SMD: -0.28, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.10) and CC depth (SMD: -0.26, 95%CI: -0.44 to -0.07) were observed in the PPE arm as compared to the no-PPE arm. The difference in CC rate was more prominently seen in adult CPR than in paediatric CPR. Without PPE, the proportion of adequate CC rate delivered was 0.74, which reduced significantly to 0.60 after use of PPE (p - 0.035). Similarly, the proportion of adequate CC depth was significantly lesser (p - 0.001) in PPE arm (0.55), as compared to that of the no-PPE arm (0.78). CONCLUSION: The use of PPE compromises the quality of CC during CPR significantly, and newer ways to deliver chest compression has to be investigated.

One thousand four hundred forty four patients were admitted to our hospital with a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2, 559 patients (39%) were exposed to corticosteroids during hospital stay, 844 (61%) were not exposed to corticosteroids. In the cohort of patients exposed to corticosteroids, 171 (30.6%) died. In the cohort of patients not exposed to corticosteroids, 183 (21.7%) died (unadjusted p < 0.001). Nonetheless, exposure to corticosteroids was not associated with in-hospital mortality after balancing with overlap weight propensity score (adjusted p = 0.25). Patients in the corticosteroids cohort had a reduced risk of ICU admission (adjusted p < 0.001).

Adaptive memory is established by memory T and B lymphocytes following the recognition of an antigen. On the other hand, innate immune memory, also called trained immunity, is imprinted in innate cells such as macrophages and natural killer cells through epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming. However, these mechanisms of memory generation and maintenance are compromised as organisms age. Almost all immune cell types, both mature cells and their progenitors, go through age-related changes concerning numbers and functions. The aging immune system renders the elderly highly susceptible to infections and incapable of mounting a proper immune response upon vaccinations. Besides the increased infectious burden, older individuals also have heightened risks of metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, which have an immunological component. This review discusses how immune function, particularly the establishment and maintenance of innate and adaptive immunological memory, regulates and is regulated by epigenetics, metabolic processes, gut microbiota, and the central nervous system throughout life, with a focus on old age. We explain in-depth how epigenetics and cellular metabolism impact immune cell function and contribute or resist the aging process. Microbiota is intimately linked with the immune system of the human host, and therefore, plays an important role in immunological memory during both homeostasis and aging. The brain, which is not an immune-isolated organ despite former opinion, interacts with the peripheral immune cells, and the aging of both systems influences the health of each other. With all these in mind, we aimed to present a comprehensive view of the aging immune system and its consequences, especially in terms of immunological memory. The review also details the mechanisms of promising anti-aging interventions and highlights a few, namely, caloric restriction, physical exercise, metformin, and resveratrol, that impact multiple facets of the aging process, including the regulation of innate and adaptive immune memory. We propose that understanding aging as a complex phenomenon, with the immune system at the center role interacting with all the other tissues and systems, would allow for more effective anti-aging strategies.","output":"Immune Memory in Aging: a Wide Perspective Covering Microbiota, Brain, Metabolism, and Epigenetics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To prevent the transmission of Covid-19 the US Centers for Disease Control recommends using a face mask in public.

Forty-one listeners heard 24 pseudorandomized unpredictable sentences from the four mask conditions and typed what they heard. We measured intelligibility as the percentage of whole words correctly perceived. Acoustic analysis revealed that all masks filter the signal, with the greatest overall effect for the N95 respirator. A mixed model two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of mask condition, driven by the low percent words correct for N95 respirators.

Hence, the aim of this study is to investigate the genetic diversity of non-repeat regions of csp in P. knowlesi from Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 46 csp genes were subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification. The genes were obtained from P. knowlesi isolates collected from different divisions of Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, and Peninsular Malaysia. The targeted gene fragments were cloned into a commercial vector and sequenced, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed while incorporating 168 csp sequences retrieved from the GenBank database. The genetic diversity and natural evolution of the csp sequences were analysed using MEGA6 and DnaSP ver. 5.10.01. A genealogical network of the csp haplotypes was generated using NETWORK ver. 4.6.1.3. RESULTS: The phylogenetic analysis revealed indistinguishable clusters of P. knowlesi isolates across different geographic regions, including Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia. Nucleotide analysis showed that the csp non-repeat regions of zoonotic P. knowlesi isolates obtained in this study underwent purifying selection with population expansion, which was supported by extensive haplotype sharing observed between humans and macaques. Novel variations were observed in the C-terminal non-repeat region of csp. CONCLUSIONS: The csp non-repeat regions are relatively conserved and there is no distinct cluster of P. knowlesi isolates from Malaysian Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia.

When the occurrence of PTSS is great in both number and severity, these become the key elements of the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This study explores the prevalence and predisposing factors of PTSS in anaesthetists during the second wave of COVID-19 in South Africa. Methods: Members of the South African Society of Anaesthesiologists (SASA) completed an electronic questionnaire regarding their sociodemographic information as well as COVID-19 exposure. The PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) was used to measure PTSS. The resulting score gave an indication of symptom severity, with a score of 33 or higher indicating a provisional diagnosis of PTSD. Results: A total of 483 participants completed the questionnaire (23.8% response rate). Of these, 391 participants were included in the study and 69 participants (17.6%) received a provisional PTSD diagnosis. Participants who are younger and have less experience, who are female, who are single or who do not have children exhibited a greater prevalence of PTSD.

PRRSV employs ?1 PRF directed by RNA secondary and tertiary structures within its viral genome (canonical PRF), as well as a noncanonical ?1 and ?2 PRF that are stimulated by the interactions of PRRSV nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) and host protein poly(C)-binding protein (PCBP) 1 or 2 with the viral genome. Together, nsp1 and one of the PCBPs act as transactivators that bind a C-rich motif near the shift site to stimulate ?1 and ?2 PRF, thereby enabling the ribosome to generate two frameshift products that are implicated in viral immune evasion. How nsp1 and PCBP associate with the viral RNA genome remains unclear. Here, we describe the purification of the nsp1:PCBP2:viral RNA complex on a scale sufficient for structural analysis using small-angle X-ray scattering and stochiometric analysis by analytical ultracentrifugation. The proteins associate with the RNA C-rich motif as a 1:1:1 complex. The monomeric form of nsp1 within the complex differs from previously reported homodimer identified by X-ray crystallography. Functional analysis of the complex via mutational analysis combined with RNA-binding assays and cell-based frameshifting reporter assays reveal a number of key residues within nsp1 and PCBP2 that are involved in complex formation and function. Our results suggest that nsp1 and PCBP2 both interact directly with viral RNA during formation of the complex to coordinate this unusual PRF mechanism.","output":"Molecular characterization of the RNA-protein complex directing ?2/?1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting during arterivirus replicase expression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the development of novel affordable steel-framed modular units for construction with enhanced overall (healthcare, structural, fire, and lightweight) performance, which ideally suits for emergency response situation, such as current covid-19 pandemic The nature of quick response and well-prepared strategies are essential to cope with the demand of quicker construction for emergency response structures and if similar situation continues or arises in the future as well Off-site oriented modular construction is ideal to provide these requirements at very short notice for emergencies Modular units made of steel components are a leading choice due to the exceptional strength and rigidity for lightweight construction A new weight optimisation procedure was developed for Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) joists in varying shapes of and results show that weight for per unit length of the joists can be reduced up to 24% without compromising structural capacity This was verified with validated Finite Element (FE) models In order to improve the faster jointing method, a novel cut and bend intra-module connection was also introduced In addition, strap bracing is used for the lateral stability of steel-framed modular buildings Modular breathing panels are proposed to be employed in corner post modules as sidewalls to improve the indoor air quality and reduce the spread of disease Based on the comprehensive assessment and numerical results conceptual design of performance improved steel-framed corner post modular unit was proposed to offer short-to-medium (in response to emergencies), as well as long-term solutions for the construction industry","output":"Development of Affordable Steel-Framed Modular Buildings for Emergency Situations (Covid-19)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID-19 has affected all spheres of life, including education.

The successful design of optimal wind power sites to create power is one of the most vital concerns in the exploitation of wind farms. Wind energy site selection is determined by the rules and standards of environmentally sustainable development, leading to a low, renewable energy source that is cost effective and contributes to global advancement. The major contribution of this research is a comprehensive analysis of information for the multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) approach and evaluation of ideal site selection for wind power plants employing q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy rough Einstein aggregation operators. A MADM technique is then developed using q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy rough aggregation operators. For further validation of the potential of the suggested method, a real case study on wind power plant site has been given. A comparison analysis based on the unique extended TOPSIS approach is presented to illustrate the offered method's capability. The results show that this method has a larger space for presenting information, is more flexible in its use, and produces more consistent evaluation results.

Gun violence produces lifelong psychological adversity, trauma, and grief. In the face of this epidemic, efficacious therapies that assuage gun violence-based trauma and negative health are lacking. METHODS: The proposed, longitudinal pilot experiment examined the effects of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on traumatized individuals as a direct consequence of gun violence. Twenty-four victims of gun violence (median age = 53 years; 21 female) completed measures of the primary outcome: trauma. Secondary outcomes were characterized as grief, depression, sleep quality, life satisfaction, and mindfulness. All assessments were administered before, after 5, and 8 weeks of MBSR training. It was hypothesized that trauma and other comorbidities would improve following MBSR. It was also predicted that outcomes would be significantly stronger from baseline to 5 weeks of MBSR training than from 5 to 8 weeks of training. RESULTS: Before MBSR, volunteers exhibited high levels of trauma, depression, sleep difficulty, and grief. Participation in MBSR was associated with improved trauma, depression, sleep difficulty, and life satisfaction. The most pronounced improvements in psychological disposition were exhibited within the first 5 weeks of MBSR. However, these benefits were largely preserved after completion of the course. Importantly, increases in dispositional mindfulness predicted lower trauma, complicated grief, and sleep difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings should be interpreted with caution because they were derived from an uncontrolled, non-randomized trial.

The present study has made an effort toward elucidating the prevalence, diversity and characterization of co-infecting respiratory pathogens in the nasopharyngeal tract of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Two complementary metagenomics based sequencing approaches, Respiratory Virus Oligo Panel (RVOP) and Holo-seq, were utilized for unbiased detection of co-infecting viruses and bacteria. The limited SARS-CoV-2 clade diversity along with differential clinical phenotype seems to be partially explained by the observed spectrum of co-infections. We found a total of 43 bacteria and 29 viruses amongst the patients, with 18 viruses commonly captured by both the approaches. In addition to SARS-CoV-2, Human Mastadenovirus, known to cause respiratory distress, was present in a majority of the samples. We also found significant differences of bacterial reads based on clinical phenotype. Of all the bacterial species identified, 60% have been known to be involved in respiratory distress. Among the co-pathogens present in our sample cohort, anaerobic bacteria accounted for a preponderance of bacterial diversity with possible role in respiratory distress. Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus and Halomonas sp. are anaerobes found abundantly across the samples. Our findings highlight the significance of metagenomics based diagnosis and detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory co-infections in the current pandemic to enable efficient treatment administration and better clinical management.

Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2.

AI holds great potential for improving education as it has started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in education to create better learning. To provide better education, data analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid solutions with high accuracy.

Increasing concentrations of virus RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in CaCo-2 cell lines documenting productive infections. SARS-COV-2 infection induced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects and abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a iPS-derived human 3D cardiosphere tissue models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions The demonstration that cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro warrants the further in depth monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19 patients. Clinical Perspective What is New? This study demonstrates that human cardiac myocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study documents that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory circle and induces a cytotoxic response in cardiomyocytes. Infection was confirmed in two cardiac tissue models, including living human heart slices. What are the Clinical Implications? The study may provide a rational to explain part of the cardiotoxicity observed in COVID-19 patients The demonstration of direct cardiotoxicity induced by SARS-CoV-2 warrants an in depth further analysis of cardiac tissue of COVID-19 patients and a close monitoring for putative direct cardiomyocyte injury. The established models can be used to test novel therapeutic approaches targeting COVID-19.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 infects and induces cytotoxic effects in human cardiomyocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The acquisition of egg protection is vital for species survival. Poisonous eggs from Pomacea apple snails have defensive macromolecules for protection. Here we isolated and characterized a novel lectin called PdPV1 that is massively accumulated in the eggs of Pomacea diffusa and seems part of its protective cocktail. The native protein, an oligomer of ca. 256 kDa, has high structural stability, withstanding 15 min boiling and denaturing by sodium dodecyl sulphate. It resists in vitro proteinase digestion and displays structural stability between pH 2.0C12.0 and up to 85 C. These properties, as well as its subunit sequences, glycosylation pattern, presence of carotenoids, size, and global shape resemble those of its orthologs from other Pomacea. Further, like members of the canaliculata clade, PdPV1 is recovered unchanged in faeces of mice ingesting it, supporting an antinutritive defensive function. PdPV1 also displays a strong hemagglutinating activity specifically recognizing selected ganglioside motifs with high affinity. This activity is only shared with PsSC, a perivitelline from the same clade (bridgesii clade). As a whole, these results indicate that species in the genus Pomacea have diversified their eggs defences: Those from the bridgesii clade are protected mostly by non-digestible lectins that lower the nutritional value of eggs, in contrast with protection by neurotoxins of other Pomacea clades, indicating apple snail egg defensive strategies are clade-specific. The harsh gastrointestinal environment of predators would have favoured their appearance, extending by convergent evolution the presence of plant-like highly stable lectins, a strategy not reported in other animals.

Now more than ever, it has become paramount to push the limits of online learning in every manner to keep flourishing the education system. One crucial component of online learning is Knowledge Tracing (KT). The aim of KT is to model student's knowledge level based on their answers to a sequence of exercises referred as interactions. Students acquire their skills while solving exercises and each such interaction has a distinct impact on student ability to solve a future exercise. This \\\\textit{impact} is characterized by 1) the relation between exercises involved in the interactions and 2) student forget behavior. Traditional studies on knowledge tracing do not explicitly model both the components jointly to estimate the impact of these interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware self-attention model for Knowledge Tracing (RKT). We introduce a relation-aware self-attention layer that incorporates the contextual information. This contextual information integrates both the exercise relation information through their textual content as well as student performance data and the forget behavior information through modeling an exponentially decaying kernel function. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, among which two new collections are released to the public, show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge tracing methods.

Illumina MiSeq 2500 sequencing of nirS showed that the multi-colored meadow had greater diversity and abundance of nirS-type denitrifiers than the flood-plain meadow and that the total N content, ammonium content, and denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) in soil differed significantly between the two types of meadows. The abundances of dominant denitrifiers at phylum and genus levels showed different responses to the two soil layers of the two meadow types. In top-soils, the highest abundance of Firmicutes was recorded in the multi-colored meadow, while in the flood-plain meadow, there was the highest abundance of Proteobacteria. The Actinobacteria abundance was the highest in top-soil and sub-soil of the flood-plain meadow. The abundance of Chloroflexi was the highest in top-soil of the flood-plain meadow and in sub-soil of the multi-colored meadow. The diversity of denitrifying bacteria was strongly influenced by variations of soil properties down the soil profile.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women with SCD and its impact on pregnancy. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included SCD pregnant women tested positive for COVID-19 between March 2020 C February 2021. The primary endpoint was the severity of the COVID-19 infection. Secondary endpoints were pregnancy complications and fetal outcomes. RESULTS: During the study period among 82 pregnant women with SCD, 8 have presented symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and were tested positive. A common mild clinical presentation was observed in 6 women (75%), one woman was asymptomatic and one required oxygen. The latter was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and a cesarean section was performed in the context of an ongoing vaso-occlusive crisis and acute chest syndrome together with incidental preeclampsia. Labor was induced in another patient who developed a vaso-occlusive crisis after COVID-19 remission. Fetal outcomes were good with an average Apgar score of 10 and normal umbilical blood pH at birth. Two newborns were small-for-gestational-age as expected on the ultrasound follow-up before occurrence of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection in our population of pregnant women with SCD had typical presentation and rarely triggered a sickle cell crisis or other complications.

Many tests have been developed, yet with variable speed to first result, and of unknown quality, particularly when considering the prediction of neutralizing capacity. OBJECTIVES/METHODS The LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay was designed to measure antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 native S1/S2 proteins in a standardized automated chemiluminescent assay. Clinical and analytical performance of the test were validated in an observational study using residual samples (>1500) with positive or negative Covid-19 diagnosis. RESULTS The LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay proved highly selective and specific, and offers semiquantitative measures of serum or plasma levels of anti-S1/S2 IgG with neutralizing activity. The diagnostic sensitivity was 91.3% and 95.7% at >5 or 15 days from diagnosis respectively, and 100% when assessed against a neutralizing assay. The specificity ranged between 97% and 98.5%. The average imprecision of the assay was <5 % coefficient of variation. Assay performance at 2 different cut-offs was evaluated to optimize predictive values in settings with different % disease prevalence. CONCLUSIONS. The automated LIAISON? SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay brings efficient, sensitive, specific, and precise serological testing to the laboratory, with the capacity to test large amounts of samples per day: first results are available within 35 minutes with a throughput of 170 tests/hour. The test also provides a semiquantitative measure to identify samples with neutralizing antibodies, useful also for a large scale screening of convalescent plasma for safe therapeutic use. IMPORTANCE With the worldwide advance of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficient, reliable and accessible diagnostic tools are needed to support public health officials and healthcare providers in their efforts to deliver optimal medical care, and articulate sound demographic policy. DiaSorin has developed an automated serology based assay for the measurement of IgG specific to SARS CoV-2 Spike protein, and tested its clinical performance in collaboration with Italian health care professionals who provided access to large numbers of samples from infected and non-infected individuals. The assay delivers excellent sensitivity and specificity, and is able to identify samples with high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This will provide guidance in assessing the true immune status of subjects, as well as meeting the pressing need to screen donors for high titer convalescent sera for subsequent therapeutic and prophylactic use.","output":"Clinical And Analytical Performance Of An Automated Serological Test That Identifies S1/S2 Neutralizing IgG In Covid-19 Patients Semiquantitatively"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is responsible for the current pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Weber ex F.H.Wigg, Dioscorea batatas Decaisne and Schizonepeta tenuifolia (Benth.) Briquet. These plants have traditionally been used in Asia to treat a variety of respiratory diseases. A bulk of literature on traditional Korean medicine describe their activities and functions for respiratory problems. Therefore, we hypothesized that the combination of these plants might be effective in alleviating respiratory symptoms. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated whether TADIOS ameliorates LPS-induced acute lung injury via regulation of the Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The LPS-induced acute lung injury mouse model was used to determine the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress effects of TADIOS. The amount of marker compounds contained in TADIOS was quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The protein level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in culture supernatant was measured by ELISA. Changes in the RNA level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice lungs and RAW264.7 cells were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. The relative amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured by DCF-DA assay. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate expression of cellular proteins. Effects of TADIOS on antioxidant responsive elements (AREs) were determined by luciferase assay. The severity of acute lung injury was evaluated by Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining. To test the effects of TADIOS on LPS-induced oxidative stress, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the total antioxidant capacity were measured. RESULTS: TADIOS was prepared by extraction of a blend of these three plants by ethanol, and quality control was performed through quantification of marker compounds by HPLC and measurement of bioactivities using cell-based bioassays. In the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7, TADIOS effectively suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1, and also ROS induced by LPS. When RAW264.7 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing nucleotide sequences for AREs, TADIOS treatment increased the level of relative luciferase units in a dose-dependent manner. In the LPS-induced acute lung injury mouse model, orally administered TADIOS alleviated lung damage and neutrophil infiltration induced by LPS. Consistent with the in vitro data, treatment with TADIOS inhibited the LPS-mediated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, and activated the Nrf2-HO-1 axis. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the potential for TADIOS to be developed as a safe and effective therapeutics for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.","output":"Botanical formulation, TADIOS, alleviates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced acute lung injury in mice via modulation of the Nrf2-HO-1 signaling pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The close association between astrocytes and microglia causes great difficulties to distinguish their individual roles in innate immune responses in central nervous system. Current chemical-based methods to eliminate microglia in glial cell culture introduce various molecular and functional alterations to astrocytes. Here, we describe a novel two-step approach to achieve a complete elimination of microglia without affecting the biological properties of co-cultured astrocytes by temporal treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). We verify TSA as a potent inducer for microglial-specific cell death, which also causes comprehensive gene expression changes in astrocytes. However, withdrawal of TSA not only ensures no microglia repopulation, but also restores all the gene expression changes in terms of astrocyte functions, including neurotrophic factors, glutamate and potassium transporters, and reactive astrocyte subtypes. By contrast, withdrawal of PLX5622, the commonly used colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor neither prevents microglia repopulation nor restores the gene expression changes mentioned above. Using this method, we are able to discriminate differential roles of microglia and astrocytes in the induced expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines upon various pathological stimuli including the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. This simple and efficient method can be customized for the understanding of microglia-astrocyte interaction and the development of epigenetic therapies that target over-activated microglia in neuroinflammation-related diseases.","output":"A novel histone deacetylase inhibitor-based approach to eliminate microglia and retain astrocyte properties in glial cell culture"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has affected gynecologic cancer management.

The majority of respondents did not alter indications of treatment if patients were COVID-19-negative, while treatments were generally postponed in COVID-19-positive patients. Treatments were considered priority for: early stage high-risk uterine cancers (85/187; 45%), newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer (76/187; 41%), and locally advanced cervical cancer (76/187; 41%). Treatment of early stage low-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer was deferred according to 49% (91/187) of respondents, with hormonal treatment as the option of therapy (31%; 56/178).

PPP loan amounts, however, are negatively related to the minority share of the population. The EIDL program, in contrast, both in numbers and amounts, was distributed positively to minority communities.","output":"Did the $660 Billion Paycheck Protection Program and $220 Billion Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program Get Disbursed to Minority Communities in the Early Stages of COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The success of COVID-19 vaccination depends on individual's vaccine acceptance.

The objective of this study was to assess the factors influencing the acceptance and hesitancy toward the COVID-19 vaccine in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted. An online survey was conducted with four parameters: Demographics, medical history, knowledge and information sources about COVID-19 and vaccine, and hesitancy/acceptance of vaccinations. Bivariate analysis between several survey items and the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine was conducted using Chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to assess to what degree each variable affects the acceptance and the hesitancy toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Approximately 64% show a desire to accept the vaccine while 18.3% were extremely hesitant to take the vaccine. Non-demographic factors that were associated with the acceptance toward the COVID-19 vaccine were the source of health information about COVID-19 (OR:1.63; 95% CI:1.07-2.47), perception toward whether the vaccine is effective on other variants of the virus (OR:7.24; 95% CI:4.58-11.45), previous uptake of the influenza vaccine (OR:1.62; 95% CI:1.07-2.47), and potential mandatory of vaccination in order to travel internationally (OR:16.52; 95% CI:10.23-26.68).

This paper demonstrates that the FAIMS system can detect specific chemicals in complex mixtures.

An EfficientNetV2 discriminant model was constructed, and a blind test set was used to verify whether the deep-learning model is capable of the required task. The results show that the pre-trained EfficientNetV2 model completed convergence at a learning rate of 0.1 as well as 200 iterations. Specific substances in complex mixtures can be effectively identified using the trained model and the homemade FAIMS system. Accuracies of 100%, 96.7%, and 86.7% are obtained for ethanol, ethyl acetate, and acetone in the blind test set, which are much higher than conventional methods. The deep learning network provides higher accuracy than traditional FAIMS spectral analysis methods.

Although no reliable data suggests that patients of well controlled Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) being at increased risk of becoming severely ill with SARS-CoV2, but lockdown may impact patients with T1DM requiring regular medications and follow up. Hence this study was planned to see the impact of lockdown on glycemic control in patients with T1DM. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done in T1DM patients in whom a structured questionnaire was administered on follow up within 15 days after lockdown. Data regarding hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), insulin dose missed, regular glucose monitoring, dietary compliance, physical activity, hospitalization during the phase of lockdown was taken. Average blood glucose and HbA1C of lockdown phase was compared with the readings of prelockdown phase. RESULTS: Out of 52 patients, 36.5% had hyperglycemic and 15.3% had hypoglycemic episodes. Insulin dose was missed in 26.9%, glucose monitoring not done routinely in 36.5% and 17.4% were not diet compliant during lockdown. Average blood glucose during lockdown phase was 276.9  64.7 mg/dl as compared to 212.3  57.9 mg/dl during prelockdown phase. Mean HbA1c value of lockdown (10  1.5%) which was much higher that of pre lockdown (8.8  1.3%) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Glycemic control of T1DM patients has worsened mainly due to non availability of insulin/glucostrips during lockdown period.

Although these separate substantive areas agree that epidemiology refers to the distribution of disease in a population and the determinants of that distribution, the literature presents conflicting definitions of what makes a study a molecular epidemiologic study. In cancer and environmental epidemiology, molecular is defined almost exclusively in terms of biomarkers. However, biomarkers are only one type of molecular measure, and this definition ignores the many applications of molecular methods in genetic and infectious disease epidemiology. Early epidemiologists made tremendous strides with what are now relatively simple molecular tools, such as using microscopy for identification, showing agents not visible by microscope cause disease, and detecting protective antibodies with hemagglutination assays. In the microbiology literature, molecular epidemiology has become synonymous with the use of molecular fingerprintsregardless of whether the study was population based or met other criteria consistent with an epidemiologic study.

Effective contact tracing of potentially exposed health care workers is crucial for the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks in the health care setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of contact tracing during the COVID-19 pandemic through the real-time locating system (RTLS) and review of the electronic medical record (EMR) at the designated hospital for COVID-19 response in Singapore. METHODS: Over a 2-day study period, all admitted patients with COVID-19, their ward locations, and the health care workers rostered to each ward were identified to determine the total number of potential contacts between patients with COVID-19 and health care workers. The numbers of staff-patient contacts determined by EMR reviews, RTLS-based contact tracing, and a combination of both methods were evaluated. The use of EMR-based and RTLS-based contact tracing methods was further validated by comparing their sensitivity and specificity against self-reported staff-patient contacts by health care workers. RESULTS: Of 796 potential staff-patient contacts (between 17 patients and 162 staff members), 104 (13.1%) were identified by both the RTLS and EMR, 54 (6.8%) by the RTLS alone, and 99 (12.4%) by the EMR alone; 539 (67.7%) were not identified through either method. Compared to self-reported contacts, EMR reviews had a sensitivity of 47.2% and a specificity of 77.9%, while the RTLS had a sensitivity of 72.2% and a specificity of 87.7%. The highest sensitivity was obtained by including all contacts identified by either the RTLS or the EMR (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 73.4%). CONCLUSIONS: RTLS-based contact tracing showed higher sensitivity and specificity than EMR review. Integration of both methods provided the best performance for rapid contact tracing, although technical adjustments to the RTLS and increasing user compliance with wearing of RTLS tags remain necessary.","output":"Use of a Real-Time Locating System for Contact Tracing of Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic at an Infectious Disease Center in Singapore: Validation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19.

In addition to modifying products of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the GC may be involved in processing events because of its participation in other routes of vesicular trafficfor example, centripetal traffic from the cell surface. Various nonequivalent criteria have been used to ascribe processing events to the GC-autoradiography, preparative or analytic subcellular fractionation, interruption by ICT inhibitors, and delay in the impact of cycloheximide.","output":"The Confined Function Model of the Golgi Complex: Center for Ordered Processing of Biosynthetic Products of the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oceans cover more than 70 percent of the surface of our planet and are characterized by huge taxonomic and chemical diversity of marine organisms.

Second, based on the relative utility function, some new rules are defined to calculate the thresholds and conditional probabilities in 3WD and some corresponding theorems are explored and proved. Next, a new information fusion mechanism in the framework of evidential reasoning algorithm is developed. Then, the decision results are obtained based on the Bayesian decision procedure and the principle of maximum utility. Finally, an example with large-scale data set and an example about medicine selection for COVID-19 are provided to show the implementation process and effectiveness of the proposed method.

However, the integration of qualitative and quantitative approaches continues to be one of much debate and there is a need for a rigorous framework for designing and interpreting mixed methods research. This paper explores the analytical approaches (i.e. parallel, concurrent or sequential) used in mixed methods studies within healthcare and exemplifies the use of triangulation as a methodological metaphor for drawing inferences from qualitative and quantitative findings originating from such analyses. DESIGN: This review of the literature used systematic principles in searching CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO for healthcare research studies which employed a mixed methods approach and were published in the English language between January 1999 and September 2009. RESULTS: In total, 168 studies were included in the results. Most studies originated in the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and Canada. The analytic approach most widely used was parallel data analysis. A number of studies used sequential data analysis; far fewer studies employed concurrent data analysis. Very few of these studies clearly articulated the purpose for using a mixed methods design. The use of the methodological metaphor of triangulation on convergent, complementary, and divergent results from mixed methods studies is exemplified and an example of developing theory from such data is provided. CONCLUSION: A trend for conducting parallel data analysis on quantitative and qualitative data in mixed methods healthcare research has been identified in the studies included in this review. Using triangulation as a methodological metaphor can facilitate the integration of qualitative and quantitative findings, help researchers to clarify their theoretical propositions and the basis of their results. This can offer a better understanding of the links between theory and empirical findings, challenge theoretical assumptions and develop new theory.","output":"Combining qualitative and quantitative research within mixed method research designs: A methodological review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The present novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection has engendered a worldwide crisis on an enormous scale within a very short period. The effective solution for this pandemic is to recognize the nature and spread of the disease so that appropriate policies can be framed. Mathematical modelling is always at the forefront to understand and provide an adequate description of the transmission of any disease. In this research work, we have formulated a deterministic compartmental model (SEAMHCRD) including various stages of infection, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical to study the spreading of COVID-19 and estimated the model parameters by fitting the model with the reported data of ongoing pandemic in Oman. The steady-state, stability and final pandemic size of the model has been proved mathematically. The various transmission as well as transition parameters are estimated during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020. Based on the currently estimated parameters, the pandemic size is also predicted for another 100 days. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key model parameters, and the parameter gamma due to contact with the symptomatic moderately infected is found to be more significant in spreading the disease. Accordingly, the corresponding basic reproduction number has also been computed using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. As the value of the basic reproduction number (R0) is 0.9761 during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020, the disease-free equilibrium is stable.

It is unclear whether people perceive this principle as ethically more legitimate than some other principle such as \\"saving more life-years\\". Understanding the answer to this question is particularly relevant to the allocation of scarce medical resources during public health emergencies. Different principles typically lead to different allocations, and consequently have dramatically different implications as to who survives and who dies. We fielded an online randomized controlled survey experiment in the context of scarce ventilator allocation with a demographically representative sample of US adults (n = 700) from October 22 to October 30, 2020. Participants faced hypothetical situations where they had to allocate few available ventilators among several needy patients. The experiment was designed such that the allocation decision made by a participant can be used to infer the principle in line with their personal ethical values. We interpret this inferred principle as the one that the participant perceives to be most legitimate. The treatment group, but not the control group, was provided balanced information that described the ethical dilemmas faced by experts in developing ventilator allocation guidelines. Nearly half of the participants in the control group perceive saving more lives the most legitimate principle. Despite the balanced nature of the information, the perceived legitimacy of saving more lives was 76 percentage points higher in the treatment group. The magnitude of this impact was particularly strong among republican-leaning participants, a subgroup that has less trust in experts according to previous research. Our findings suggest that enhancing public awareness of ethical dilemmas faced by health experts can increase the perceived legitimacy of their proposed guidelines even among those with lower trust in experts.","output":"Awareness of ethical dilemmas enhances public support for the principle of saving more lives in the United States: A survey experiment based on ethical allocation of scarce ventilators."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe inflammation during gram negative bacterial disease is common in periparturient dairy cows and increases the severity of diseases such as Escherichia coli mastitis.

However, responses of diverse bovine macrophage phenotypes to lipopolysaccharide are unclear. The objective of this research was to compare the lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response in several phenotypes of bovine primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from whole blood using Ficoll (n = 8 cows).

Monocytes were cultured with interferon- or interleukins (IL) 4 and 13 to induce a classical or alternative macrophage phenotype, respectively, then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. Macrophage mRNA was quantified in adipose using qPCR. Fold changes in mRNA concentration were calculated by 2(-Ct), using the untreated cells as calibrator and three endogenous control mRNA. Treatment differences in mRNA expression were identified using Fisher pairwise comparisons and ANOVA (P  0.05). Flow cytometry showed magnetic assisted cell sorting increased CD172(+) cells from 22.3  1.9 to 81.6  2.8%. After 48 h in vitro, CD68 expression increased and CD172(+) was 95.2  0.4%.

Together these results show an exacerbated proinflammatory cytokine profile in a model of classical bovine macrophages during gram negative bacterial disease. Results suggest that macrophage phenotype could be involved with severe inflammatory responses seen during dairy cow periparturient periods characterized by prolonged and exacerbated lipolysis and increased disease susceptibility. Ongoing research will describe macrophage phenotype during bovine disease and identify factors contributing to phenotype change. Such factors could ultimately be manipulated to control the bovine macrophage inflammatory response.","output":"0177 Bovine macrophage phenotype influences inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective This study aims to analyze the clinical characteristics of hospitalized children infected with HCoV-NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1 and provide the basis for disease diagnosis and treatment. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical manifestations, imaging data, and treatment measures of hospitalized children with positive HCoV-NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1 from 2015 to 2020. Results A total of 1062 children aged 33 days to 12 years were analyzed, including 879 (82.77%) between 33 days to three years. Lower respiratory tract infections were the most common in 698 children positive for HCoVs (65.72%). The incidences of runny nose, cough, pharyngeal hyperemia, and fine crackles in the mild case group (n = 894, 84.18%) were significantly higher than in the severe case group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01). The incidences of gasp, stridor, and convulsions, the proportion of underlying diseases, such as congenital heart disease, laryngomalacia, and general developmental disorders, anemia, and abnormal liver function, and mixed infections in the severe group (n = 168, 15.82%) were significantly higher than in the mild group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). Imaging manifestations differed. Pleural effusion and atelectasis occurred in the severe cases. After treatment, patients fully recovered or improved and were discharged from the hospital. There were no deaths. Conclusion HCoV-NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1 infection is most common in children under three years old, and the infection site is mainly the lower respiratory tract. The main clinical manifestations include fever, cough, and runny nose. Inspiratory three concave signs, respiratory failure, and heart failure occurred in the severe cases, with pleural effusion and atelectasis possibly occurring at the same time. Severe cases should be identified early so that they may be given comprehensive treatment in time to improve the prognosis.","output":"Clinical Study of Human Coronavirus NL63, OC43, 229E, HKU1 Infentions in Hospitalized Children from 2015 to 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: A bilateral diaphragmatic rupture is a rare event that occurs in cases of blunt thoracic-abdominal trauma. Case Presentation: We report the case of a 56-year-old female patient with pelvic fracture and second-stage bilateral rupture of the diaphragm due to a car accident. After a chest and abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan, the patient underwent emergency suturing of the left hemidiaphragm. On postoperative day (POD) 4, a CT scan performed due to the sudden onset of dyspnea revealed rupture of the right hemidiaphragm, which was not detected on the preoperative CT scan. On POD 9, the right hemidiaphragm was repaired with mesh during a right thoracotomy. The patient recovered 14 days after surgery. However, the postoperative course was complicated by an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection that significantly delayed her discharge from the hospital.

Epidemiological parameters such as contagiousness (virus transmission rate), initial number of infected people, and probability of being tested depend on the region's demographic and geographical features, the containment measures introduced;they are calibrated to data about COVID-19 spread in the region of interest. At the first stage of our study, epidemiological data (numbers of people tested, diagnoses, critical cases, hospitalizations, and deaths) for each of the mentioned regions were analyzed. The data were characterized in terms of seasonality, stationarity, and dependency spaces, and were extrapolated using machine learning techniques to specify unknown epidemiological parameters of the model. At the second stage, the Optuna optimizer based on the tree Parzen estimation method for objective function minimization was applied to determine the model's unknown parameters. The model was validated with the historical data of 2020. The modeled results of COVID-19 spread in New York State, the UK and the Novosibirsk region have demonstrated that if the level of testing and containment measures is preserved, the number of positive cases in New York State and the Novosibirsk region will remain the same during March of 2021, while in the UK it will reduce. Due to the features of the data for the Novosibirsk region (two datasets are characterized as stationary series with probability of 1), the forecast precision is relatively high for the number of hospitalizations, but is lower for new cases of COVID-19.","output":"Agent-based modeling of COVID-19 outbreaks for New York state, UK and Novosibirsk region"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Previous studies have suggested that kennelled dogs are more likely to test positive for CECoV than household pets. Here we describe both cross sectional and longitudinal studies in two rescue kennels and two boarding kennels, together with molecular diagnostics, to provide a new insight into the epidemiology of CECoV. Prevalence of CECoV in the cross sectional studies tended to be higher in the rescue kennels (13.8% and 33.3%) than the boarding kennels (5.3% and 13.5%). In each kennel, type I CECoV was more prevalent than type 2 CECoV. The mean quantity of type I detected was equivalent to 6.3  10(8) gc/gm (range = 5  10(6), 8.5  10(11)), compared to 1.3  10(8) gc/gm (range = 3  10(6), 2.4  10(10)) for type II. In one rescue shelter where dogs were followed longitudinally, infection was significantly associated with accommodation block as well as the length of stay (increased risk of CECoV per week in residence of 1.9). Of those animals sampled on two or more occasions, none tested positive on arrival, and 54.5% later shed CECoV, suggesting that infection may have been acquired within the kennel. Shedding patterns and sequence analysis suggested both types I and II CECoV were maintained in this population by a combination of introductions into the shelter and within-shelter transmission. The findings suggest that some kennel environments may be important in maintaining CECoV infection in the population. We also propose that the diversity of viruses like CECoV in these populations may provide a novel surrogate marker for the success of biosecurity.","output":"Cross sectional and longitudinal surveys of canine enteric coronavirus infection in kennelled dogs: A molecular marker for biosecurity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Molecular testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the gold standard for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the clinical performance of these tests is still poorly understood, particularly with regard to disease course, patient-specific factors, and viral shedding. From 10 March to 1 May 2020, NewYork-Presbyterian laboratories performed 27,377 SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays from 22,338 patients. Repeat testing was performed for 3,432 patients, of which 2,413 had initial negative and 802 had initial positive results. Repeat-tested patients were more likely to have severe disease and low viral loads. The negative predictive value of the first-day result among repeat-tested patients was 81.3% The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays was estimated between 58% and 96%, depending on the unknown number of false-negative results in single-tested patients. Conversion to negative was unlikely to occur before 15 to 20 days after initial testing or 20 to 30 days after the onset of symptoms, with 50% conversion occurring at 28 days after initial testing. Conversion from first-day negative to positive results increased linearly with each day of testing, reaching 25% probability in 20 days. Sixty patients fluctuated between positive and negative results over several weeks, suggesting that caution is needed when single-test results are acted upon. In summary, our study provides estimates of the clinical performance of SARS-CoV-2 molecular assays and suggests time frames for appropriate repeat testing, namely, 15 to 20 days after a positive test and the same day or next 2 days after a negative test for patients with high suspicion for COVID-19.","output":"Clinical Performance of SARS-CoV-2 Molecular Tests"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nipah virus (NiV), a highly pathogenic member of the Paramyxoviridae which originated from bats, encodes for a fusion (F) protein which is proteolytically processed within endosomes by cathepsin L.

A total of 24,795 adolescent boys (6th-12th grade) were included in the reviewed studies from 1997-2017. In the quantitative articles (n = 20), associations varied by aspect of masculinity assessed. Specifically, we found that greater endorsement of \\"masculine\\" traits (e.g., ambitious, assertive) was generally associated with fewer internalizing behavior problems and greater social support. However, lower gender \\"typicality\\" and higher adherence to stereotypical gender role norms were generally associated with more internalizing behavior problems and lower social support. In the qualitative articles (n = 9), the most predominant theme was emotional restriction (i.e., a gender role norm) and consequences for mental health.

However, no study on somatization in anxiety and its relationship with insomnia has been conducted. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the prevalence of anxiety, somatization and insomnia and explore the relationships between different psychological states in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A total of 1,172 respondents were recruited from 125 cities in mainland China by an online questionnaire survey. All subjects were evaluated with the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, the somatization subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), and the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). RESULTS: The percentages of anxiety, somatization, and insomnia were 33.02%, 7.59%, and 24.66%, respectively. The prevalence of somatization was 19.38% in participants with anxiety. Compared to the anxiety without somatization group, the anxiety with somatization group had a significantly higher percentage of patients with a history of physical disease and insomnia, as well as higher GAD-7 scores and SCL-90 somatization subscores (all p < 0.001). The SCL-90 somatization subscores were positively correlated with age, history of physical disease, GAD-7 scores, and ISI scores (all p < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression showed that GAD-7 score, ISI score, and age were risk factors for somatization in the anxious population.

To understand exosome-mediated improvement in cardiac function we examined the proteomic alternations in the MSC exosome-treated mice hearts subjected to left coronary artery (LCA) ligation, with particular emphasis on peri-infarct areas. At 7 days after LCA ligation, left ventricular end systolic thickness, infarct size and survival of mice were studied. Mass spectrometric analysis of infarct and peri-infarct areas was carried out. Expression of inflammatory markers (LOX-1 and NLRP3) and cell death markers (Bax, Bcl-2, Caspases 1 and 3 and GSDMD) were investigated by Western blots and immunofluorescence. Proteomic analysis of the infarct and peri-infarct areas in saline-treated hearts revealed differentially expressed proteins involved in inflammation and apoptotic cell death, while showing depletion of processes governing cell death. Exosome treatment significantly improved the proteomic profile in both infarct and peri-infarct areas, more so in the peri-infarct areas. The infarct size was smaller (9  1%), and cardiac contractile function (fractional shortening) was preserved in the exosome-treated mice (28  2%). Survival of exosome-treated mice was also better. White blood cell accumulation in and around the infarct area, expression of LOX-1 and NLRP3 inflammasome, and markers of cell death (cleaved Caspase-3, Caspase-1, GSDMD, Bcl-2 and Bax) were dramatically reduced by MSC exosome treatment (all p < 0.01). In cultured primary mouse cardiomyocytes, treatment with MSC exosomes essentially reversed inflammation-induced pro-apoptotic and inflammatory signals (p < 0.01).

Though these two cancer types are predominantly seen in adult patients worldwide, in the current context, these malignancies are diagnosed at a younger age with a significant rate of incidents than previous. Such early-onset cancers are generally present at an advanced stage of the most aggressive type with a poor prognosis. In the past, the focus of the research was mainly on studying possible candidate genes to understand the onset. However, it is now recognized that genetics, epigenetics, and other environmental factors play a pivotal role in cancer susceptibility. Thus, most studies were diversified to study the behavior of host microRNAs, and the involvement of gut microbiota and good communication between them surfaced in the occurrence and state of the disease. It is understood that the impact of these factors affects the outcome of the disease. Out of the adverse outcomes identified relating to the disease, immunosuppression is one of the most concerning outcomes in the current world, where such individuals remain vulnerable to infections.

STUDY A total of 539 patients undergoing our cannulation protocol with early precut were randomized into a placebo-controlled, prospective, double-blind study to rectally receive either 100 mg indomethacin or placebo. The effect of indomethacin on PEP was stratified based on difficulties of cannulation and analyzed in patients with different risks. RESULTS In 70.3% of patients, biliary intubation was successful in the first 5 atraumatic attempts, PEP rate was low, and indomethacin was ineffective (7.4% in the placebo group and 5.2% in the indomethacin group, P=0.406). In the next phase of intubation using guidewire, the success rate increased up to 83.5%, and PEP rate rose up to 8.7%, the effect of indomethacin was significant (11.9% vs. 5.4%, P=0.018). Applying early precut success rate of biliary cannulation increased up to 98.1% and overall indomethacin diminished the frequency of PEP from 13.8% to 6.7% (P=0.007).

After a cervical or thoracic lesion, impairment of the respiratory muscles decreases respiratory function, which increases the risk of respiratory complications. Pneumonia substantially reduces patients quality of life, may prolong inpatient rehabilitation time, increase healthcare costs or at worse, lead to early death. Respiratory function and coughing can be improved through various interventions after SCI, but the available evidence as to which aspect of respiratory care should be optimised is inconclusive. Furthermore, ability of respiratory function parameters to predict pneumonia risk is insufficiently established. This paper details the protocol for a large-scale, multicentre research project that aims to evaluate the ability of parameters of respiratory function to predict and understand variation in inpatient risk of pneumonia in SCI. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: RESCOM, a prospective cohort study, began recruitment in October 2016 across 10 SCI rehabilitation centres from Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Inpatients with acute SCI, with complete or incomplete cervical or thoracic lesions, 18 years or older and not/no more dependent on 24-hour mechanical ventilation within the first 3 months after injury are eligible for inclusion. The target sample size is 500 participants. The primary outcome is an occurrence of pneumonia; secondary outcomes include pneumonia-related mortality and quality of life. We will use the longitudinal data for prognostic models on inpatient pneumonia risk factors.

We scrutinized the production of IFNs along the respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and found that high levels of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent IFN-I, characterize the upper airways of patients with high viral burden but reduced disease risk or severity. Production of specific IFN-III, but not IFN-I, members, denotes patients with a mild pathology and efficiently drives the transcription of genes that protect against SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, compared to subjects with other infectious or non-infectious lung pathologies, IFNs are over-represented in the lower airways of patients with severe COVID-19 that exhibit gene pathways associated with increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation.

We aim to assess the impact of organ injury (OI) on prognosis according to the number of affected organs at admission. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan Third Hospital & Tongren Hospital of Wuhan University from February 17 to March 22, 2020. We classified the patients according to the presence and number of damaged organs (heart, liver, and kidney). RESULTS: The percentage of patients with no, one, two, or three organs affected was 59.75%, 30.46%, 8.07%, and 1.72%, respectively. With the increasing number of OI, there is a tendency of gradual increase regarding the white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, and fibrinogen as well as the incidence of most complications. In a Cox regression model, individuals with OI, old age, and an abnormal level of C-reactive protein were at a higher risk of death compared with those without. Patients with three organ injuries had the highest mortality rate [57.9%; hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) vs. patients without OI: 22.31 (10.42-47.77), those with two (23.6%; HR 8.68, 95% CI 4.58-16.48), one (8.6%; HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.7-5.7), or no OI (2.6%); P < 0.001].

Politicians around the globe have to balance different interests. Accordingly, they make decisions which heavily impact our daily life or even curtail fundamental rights. They consequently base their judgements on advices from scientists. For these reasons, many epidemiological models have appeared and have been famous since the beginning of the twentieth century. However, scientists depend on rich data to evaluate them and their assumptions. As this pandemic outbreak has lead to large data collections by the John Hopkins University since its beginning, we take advantage of this situation and compare two deterministic epidemiological models heavily used - the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model (SIR model) and the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered-Dead model (SIRD model). In contrast to other works which concentrate on future predictions, we aim to investigate the validity of assumptions with respect to available data. For that purpose, instead of using these models forward in time, we propose modified time-discrete versions of the continuous models with relaxing all transfer rates to be time-varying and develop algorithms to predict these coefficients based on the principle of divide-and-conquer for the inverse problems. Since Asia, Europe and North America are especially affected by this pandemic, we choose countries from these continents to illustrate our results. In the main part of this article, we escepially discuss our results for Hubei (China). As supplementary material, we illustrate our findings for the aforementioned choice of countries.

A DNA based anticounterfeiting system has significant advantages such as relative ease of synthesis and vast data storage abilities, along with great potential in encryption. Although DNA is equipped with such beneficial properties, major challenges that limit its real-world anti-counterfeiting applications include protection in harsh environments, rapid inexpensive sequence determination, and its attachment to products. This review elaborates the current progress of DNA based anti-counterfeiting systems and identifies technological gaps that need to be filled for its practical application.

DATA SOURCES Primary studies were identified though PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS A systematic review was performed by querying databases for articles published through August 2020. Studies were included that reported on objective sleep parameters (apnea-hypopnea index) and sinonasal and sleep-specific patient-reported outcome measures: Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire, Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EpSS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS The database search yielded 1414 unique articles, of which 28 AR and 7 NSD studies were utilized for meta-analysis. A total of 9037 patients (8515 with AR, 522 with NSD) were identified with a mean age of 35.0 years (35.3 for AR, 34.0 for NSD). Treatment for AR and NSD significantly improved subjective sleep quality. For AR, the EpSS mean difference was -1.5 (95% CI, -2.4 to -0.5; P = .002) and for the PSQI, -1.7 (95% CI, -2.1 to -1.2; P < .00001).

To explore the implications of integrating social distancing with evacuation operations, we describe this evacuation process as a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and solve it using a DNN (Deep Neural Network)-based solution (Deep Reinforcement Learning) and a non-DNN solution (Sweep Algorithm). A central question is whether Deep Reinforcement Learning provides sufficient extra routing efficiency to accommodate increased social distancing in a time-constrained evacuation operation. We found that, in comparison to the Sweep Algorithm, Deep Reinforcement Learning can provide decision-makers with more efficient routing. However, the evacuation time saved by Deep Reinforcement Learning does not come close to compensating for the extra time required for social distancing, and its advantage disappears as the emergency vehicle capacity approaches the number of people per household.","output":"Routing algorithms as tools for integrating social distancing with emergency evacuation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 9-year-old boy suffering from COVID-19 presented after an acute conjunctivitis, symptomatic glossitis, cheilitis, then reticular livedo, urticaria angioedema and finally a palmar-plantar scarlet fever-like rash.

There has been rapid progress over the past years in fetal and placental MRI methodology but there is uncertainty about whether the gains afforded outweigh the challenges in supporting fetal MRI protocols at scale. Here, we will define challenges inherent in building a common protocol across sites with variable expertise and will propose a tentative framework for evaluation of design decisions.

From an initial individual (the patient zero), the coronavirus infects new patients at known rates, creating new populations of infected people. Every individual can either die or infect and, afterwards, be sent to the recovered population. Relevant terms such as re-infection probability, super-spreading rate or traveling rate are introduced in the model in order to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The Coronavirus Optimization Algorithm has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the input parameters are already set according to the disease statistics, preventing researchers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability of ending after several iterations, without setting this value either. Infected population initially grows at an exponential rate but after some iterations, the high number recovered and dead people starts decreasing the number of infected people in new iterations.

Here, we systematically evaluated the impact of number, structure, and sequence context of PS-modified backbones on cellular uptake and RNAi-mediated silencing efficacy. We find that PS enhances cellular internalization in a sequence-dependent manner but only when present in a single-stranded but not double-stranded region. Furthermore, the observed increase in cellular internalization did not correlate with functional silencing improvement, indicating that PS-mediated uptake may drive compounds to non-productive sinks. Thus, the primary contributing factor of PS modifications to functional efficacy is likely stabilization rather than enhanced cellular uptake. A better understanding of the relative impact of different chemistries on productive versus non-productive uptake will assist in improved design of therapeutic RNAs.","output":"Single-Stranded Phosphorothioated Regions Enhance Cellular Uptake of Cholesterol-Conjugated siRNA but Not Silencing Efficacy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, more than 3 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and about 200,000 deaths have been reported worldwide.

Since the inhibition of v-ATPase resulted in anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects in different tumor models, this enzyme has emerged as promising strategy against cancer. Here, we used the well-established v-ATPase inhibitor archazolid, a natural product first isolated from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, to study the consequences of v-ATPase inhibition in endothelial cells (ECs), in particular on the interaction between ECs and cancer cells, which has been neglected so far. Human endothelial cells treated with archazolid showed an increased adhesion of tumor cells, whereas the transendothelial migration of tumor cells was reduced. The adhesion process was independent from the EC adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and N-cadherin. Instead, the adhesion was mediated by 1-integrins expressed on tumor cells, as blocking of the integrin 1 subunit reversed this process. Tumor cells preferentially adhered to the 1-integrin ligand collagen and archazolid led to an increase in the amount of collagen on the surface of ECs. The accumulation of collagen was accompanied by a strong decrease of the expression and activity of the protease cathepsin B. Overexpression of cathepsin B in ECs prevented the capability of archazolid to increase the adhesion of tumor cells onto ECs. Our study demonstrates that the inhibition of v-ATPase by archazolid induces a pro-adhesive phenotype in endothelial cells that promotes their interaction with cancer cells, whereas the transmigration of tumor cells was reduced. These findings further support archazolid as a promising anti-metastatic compound.","output":"The vacuolar-type ATPase inhibitor archazolid increases tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells by accumulating extracellular collagen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: During 2009-2010, pandemic influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus (pH1N1) infections in England occurred in two epidemic waves. Reasons for a reported increase in case-severity during the second wave are unclear. METHODS: We analysed hospital-based surveillance for patients with pH1N1 infections in England during 2009-2010 and linked national data sets to estimate ethnicity, socio-economic status and death within 28 days of admission. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess whether changes in demographic, clinical and management characteristics of patients could explain an increase in ICU admission or death, and accounted for missing values using multiple imputation. RESULTS: During the first wave, 54/960 (6%) hospitalised patients required intensive care and 21/960 (2%) died; during the second wave 143/1420 (10%) required intensive care and 55/1420 (4%) died. In a multivariable model, during the second wave patients were less likely to be from an ethnic minority (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.26-0.42), have an elevated deprivation score (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.83), have known comorbidity (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.97) or receive antiviral therapy &#8804;2 days before onset (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56-0.92).

The expected value of the number of condemned carcasses due to mycobacteriosis therefore would be a useful threshold to detect an outbreak, and the present study aims to develop such an expected value through time series modeling. The model was developed using eight years of inspection data (2003 to 2010) obtained at 2 abattoirs of the Higashi-Mokoto Meat Inspection Center, Japan. The resulting model was validated by comparing the predicted time-dependent values for the subsequent 2 years with the actual data for 2 years between 2011 and 2012.

The sum of the ARIMA model and the weekly ensemble average was regarded as the time-dependent expected value. During 2011 and 2012, the number of whole or partial condemned carcasses exceeded the 95% confidence interval of the predicted values 20 times.

Two calves were euthanized before and 1, 2, 4, 7, or 14 days after BHV-1 inoculation. Another 10 calves were inoculated intranasally with BHV-1 only and euthanized 1, 2, 4, 7, or 14 days later. Two calves were inoculated intranasally with virus-free tissue culture fluid and euthanized as negative controls. Pathological changes and viral antigen distribution in various tissue samples from calves with and without BVDV infection (all of which had been experimentally inoculated with BHV-1) were compared. RESULTS Following BHV-1 challenge, calves with preexisting subclinical BVDV infection had earlier development of more severe inflammatory processes and, consequently, more severe tissue lesions (limited to lymphoid tissues and respiratory and digestive tracts) and greater dissemination of BHV-1, compared with calves without preexisting BVDV infection. Moreover, coinfected calves had an intense lymphoid depletion in the Peyer patches of the ileum as well as the persistence of BVDV in target organs and the reappearance of digestive tract changes during disease progression.

In this study, we investigated the question of whether automatic interference effects found in the dot-perspective task are the product of domain-specific perspective-taking processes or of domain-general submentalising processes. Previous attempts to address this question have done so by implementing inanimate controls, such as arrows, as stimuli. The rationale for this is that submentalising processes that respond to directionality should be engaged by such stimuli, whereas domain-specific perspective-taking mechanisms, if they exist, should not. These previous attempts have been limited, however, by the implied intentionality of the stimuli they have used (e.g., arrows), which may have invited participants to imbue them with perspectival agency. Drawing inspiration from novel entity paradigms from infant gazeCfollowing research, we designed a version of the dot-perspective task that allowed us to precisely control whether a central stimulus was viewed as animate or inanimate. Across four experiments, we found no evidence that automatic perspective-taking effects in the dot-perspective task are modulated by beliefs about the animacy of the central stimulus. Our results also suggest that these effects may be due to the task-switching elements of the dot-perspective paradigm, rather than automatic directional orienting.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and OMalley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented realityCbased chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances. CONCLUSIONS: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.","output":"The Use of Artificial IntelligenceCBased Conversational Agents (Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The clinical effectiveness of screening is highly dependent on uptake Previous randomised controlled trials suggest that non-participant reminders, which highlight the opportunity to re-book an appointment, can improve participation The present analysis examines the impact of implementing these reminders within the English Flexible Sigmoidoscopy (FS) Screening Programme, which offers once-only FS screening to adults aged 55-59 years We assessed the screening status of 26,339 individuals invited for once-only FS screening in England A total of 10,952 (41 6%) had attended screening, and were subsequently ineligible The remaining 15,387 had not attended screening, and were selected to receive a reminder, 1-2 years after their invitation Descriptive statistics were used to assess the increase in uptake and the adenoma detection rate (ADR) of those who self-referred, six months after the delivery of the final reminder Pearsons Chi-Square was used to compare the ADR between those who attended when invited and those who self-referred Of the 15,387 adults eligible to receive a reminder, 13,626 (88 6%) were sent a reminder as intended (1,761 were not sent a reminder, due to endoscopy capacity) Of these, 8 0% (n=1,086) booked and attended an appointment, which equated to a 4 1% increase in uptake, from 41 6% at baseline, to 45 7% at follow-up The ADR was significantly higher for those who self-referred, compared with those who attended when invited (13 3% and 9 5%, respectively;X2=16 138, p=0 000059) The implementation of non-participant reminders led to a moderate increase in uptake Implementing non-participant reminders could help mitigate any negative effects of COVID-19 on uptake","output":"Implementation of long-term non-participant reminders for flexible sigmoidoscopy screening"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: Several reports indicate lower rates of emergency admissions in the cardiovascular sector and reduced admissions of patients with chronic diseases during the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic.

A study period including the start of the German national protection phase (13 March 2020 to 16 July 2020) was compared to a previous year control cohort (15 March 2019 to 18 July 2019), with further sub-division into early and late phase. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated. Numbers of admission per day (A/day) for incident and prevalent AF and care pathways including readmissions, numbers of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), electrical cardioversion (CV), and catheter ablation (CA) were analysed. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in total AF admissions both in the early (44.4 vs. 77.5 A/day, IRR 0.57 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.61], P < 0.01) and late (59.1 vs. 63.5 A/day, IRR 0.93 [95% CI 0.90-0.96], P < 0.01) phases, length of stay was significantly shorter (3.3  3.1 nights vs. 3.5  3.6 nights, P < 0.01), admissions were more frequently in high-volume centres (77.0% vs. 75.4%, P = 0.02), and frequency of readmissions was reduced (21.7% vs. 23.6%, P < 0.01) compared to the previous year. Incident AF admission rates were significantly lower both in the early (21.9 admission per day vs. 41.1 A/day, IRR 0.53 [95% CI 0.48-0.58]) and late (35.5 vs. 39.3 A/day, IRR 0.90 [95% CI 0.86-0.95]) phases, whereas prevalent admissions were only lower in the early phase (22.5 vs. 36.4 A/day IRR 0.62 [95% CI 0.56-0.68]), but not in the late phase (23.6 vs. 24.2 A/day IRR 0.97 [95% CI 0.92-1.03]). Analysis of care pathways showed reduced numbers of TEE during the early phase [34.7% vs. 41.4%, odds ratio (OR) 0.74 [95% CI 0.64-0.86], P < 0.01], but not during the late phase (39.9% vs. 40.2%, OR 0.96 [95% CI 0.88-1.03], P = 0.26). Numbers of CV were comparable during early (40.6% vs. 39.7%, OR 1.08 [95% CI 0.94-1.25], P = 0.27) and late (38.6% vs. 37.5%, OR 1.06 [95% CI 0.98-1.14], P = 0.17) phases, compared to the previous year, respectively. Numbers of CA were comparable during the early phase (21.6% vs. 21.1%, OR 0.98 [95% CI 0.82-1.17], P = 0.82) with a distinct increase during the late phase (22.9% vs. 21.5%, OR 1.05 [95% CI 0.96-1.16], P = 0.28). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, AF admission rates declined significantly, with a more pronounced reduction in incident than in prevalent AF. Overall AF care was maintained during early and late pandemic phases with only minor changes, namely less frequent use of TEE. Confirmation of these findings in other study populations and identification of underlying causes are required to ensure optimal therapy in patients with AF during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Admission rates and care pathways in patients with atrial fibrillation during the COVID-19 pandemic-insights from the German-wide Helios hospital network"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To study the histopathology of patients dying of COVID-19 using post-mortem minimally invasive sampling techniques. METHODS: This was a single-center observational study conducted at JPNATC, AIIMS. Thirty-seven patients who died of COVID-19 were enrolled. Post-mortem percutaneous biopsies were taken from lung, heart, liver, kidney and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using CD61 and CD163. SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected using IHC with primary antibodies. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.7 years and 59.5% were males. Lung histopathology showed diffuse alveolar damage in 78% patients. Associated bronchopneumonia was seen in 37.5% and scattered microthrombi in 21% patients. Immunopositivity for SARS-CoV-2 was observed in Type II pneumocytes. Acute tubular injury with epithelial vacuolization was seen in 46% of renal biopsies. Seventy-one percent of liver biopsies showed Kupffer cell hyperplasia and 27.5% showed submassive hepatic necrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Predominant finding was diffuse alveolar damage with demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 protein in the acute phase. Microvascular thrombi were rarely identified in any organ. Substantial hepatocyte necrosis, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, microvesicular, and macrovesicular steatosis unrelated to microvascular thrombi suggested that liver might be a primary target of COVID-19.","output":"Clinico-pathological features in fatal COVID-19 infection: a preliminary experience of a tertiary care center in North India using postmortem minimally invasive tissue sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Individuals who are overweight or suffering from obesity are in a chronic state of low-grade inflammation, making them particularly susceptible to developing severe forms of respiratory failure.

Eosinopenia was often noticed in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but its role is poorly investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and eosinopenia. METHODS: We revised the records of consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to our ER-COVID-19 area in order to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with and without eosinopenia. We considered the following clinical outcomes: 4-weeks survival; need for intensive respiratory support; and hospital discharge. RESULTS: Out of first 107 consecutive patients with pneumonia and a positive COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab, 75 patients showed undetectable eosinophil count (absolute eosinopenia). At 4 weeks, 38 patients (38.4%) had required intensive respiratory treatment, 25 (23.4%) deceased and 42 (39.2%) were discharged. Compared with patients without absolute eosinopenia, patients with absolute eosinopenia showed higher need of intensive respiratory treatment (49.3% vs 13.3%, P < .001), higher mortality (30.6% vs 6.2%, P .006) and lower rate of hospital discharge (28% vs 65.6%, P < .001). Binary logistic regression analyses including neutrophil, lymphocyte, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte counts showed that absolute eosinopenia was an independent factor associated with 4-weeks mortality, need for intensive respiratory support and hospital discharge.

Considering that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, along with its associated sanitary regime, social distancing measures and nationwide quarantines, could itself induce public fears, including in children, it is of great interest to explore whether this situation and the necessity of reorganizing dental care could potentially affect the emotional state of pediatric patients facing a need for urgent dental intervention. The present study assessed the emotional state of children  seven years old (n = 25) requiring dental healthcare during a nationwide quarantine in Poland, as well as the anxiety levels of their caregivers. The Faces Anxiety Scale was adopted, and the evaluation was independently performed by the dentist, caregivers and children themselves. The level of anxiety in caregivers was also measured. As demonstrated, children requiring dental intervention during the nationwide quarantine did not reveal a significantly higher anxiety level as compared to the age-and indication-matched pre-pandemic control group (n = 20), regardless of whether their emotional state was evaluated by the dentist, caregivers, or by themselves. However, the share of children scoring the lowest anxiety level in all assessments was smaller in the pandemic group. Boys in the pandemic group had a higher anxiety level, as indicated by a caregiver assessment, and displayed a negative correlation with age in all three types of evaluation. Moreover, caregiver anxiety levels were higher in the pandemic group as compared to the pre-pandemic subset and revealed stronger correlations with the dental anxiety in children. The results suggest that the reorganization of oral healthcare under the pandemic scenario did not have a profound effect on childrens dental anxiety. Nevertheless, findings in young boys highlight that they may be more vulnerable and require special care to mitigate their anxiety and decrease the risk of dentophobia in the futurethese observations must be, however, treated with caution due to the small sample size and require further confirmation.

Vaccine hesitancy is a key driver of vaccine refusal and has been associated with vaccine preventable outbreaks. While parents seek information from many sources to inform their vaccine decision-making process, they continue to view their child's pediatric provider as a trusted source of vaccine information. The communication that occurs between a provider and parent with regards to vaccination is critical in reducing concerns and nudging parents toward vaccine acceptance. However, vaccine-hesitant parents raise issues in this encounter that many providers feel ill-equipped to answer, due to lack of training on evidence-based communication strategies. We focus on promising approaches related to patient-provider communication within the context of vaccination. We found empirical evidence that the use of a presumptive format to recommend vaccines, motivational interviewing, and tailoring information to increase message salience are approaches that can positively affect vaccine acceptance. As providers continue to serve as important influencers in the vaccine decision-making process, it is evident that there is a need to continue to identify evidence-based, and practically implementable approaches to mitigate parental vaccine hesitancy.

Closed-incision negative-pressure therapy can be used postoperatively to support healing by promoting angiogenesis and decreasing tension. The authors hypothesized that using it with panniculectomies would minimize complications, and that a longer duration of therapy would not increase the incidence of complications. The authors also evaluated whether closed-incision negative-pressure therapy malfunction was associated with complications. METHODS This retrospective, uncontrolled case series analyzed 91 patients who underwent panniculectomies managed with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy performed by a single surgeon from 2014 to 2018. Patients were followed for 6 months; therapy duration and malfunction were recorded. Patients were placed into therapy duration groups (2 to 7, 8 to 10, or >10 days). Complications managed conservatively were minor and major if they required intervention. Odds ratios were performed with 95 percent confidence intervals and p values. RESULTS Mean follow-up was 225.1 days and mean closed-incision negative-pressure therapy duration was 10.5 days. Major complications were reported in five patients (5.5 percent), infections in four (4.4 percent), dehiscence in two (2.2 percent), and seroma in four (4.4 percent). Patients with malfunction [n = 16 (17.6 percent)] were more likely to experience complications (OR, 3.3; p = 0.043). No significant increase in complications was found with therapy duration longer than 10 days, but potentially there is an increased risk of infection (OR, 4.0; p = 0.067). CONCLUSIONS Although high complication rates have been associated with panniculectomies, the authors' results show that low complication rates can be achieved with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy.

Methods: Data were collected using ethnographic methods and semi-structured interviews among 16 nurses working in the COVID-19 ward of a rural community hospital in Japan. A grounded theory approach was used for the qualitative analysis. Results: In total, 70 hours' observation and participation were completed, and 27 pages of field notes were taken and used for the analysis. In addition, 32 interviews were conducted with 16 participants. Four themes emerged from the data: pre-COVID-work perceptions, overcoming fear, shadow cast by working in the COVID-19 ward, and an integrated approach to the fear of COVID-19. The nurses initially felt unpredictable fear. However, the establishment of standard approaches and practices for COVID-19 gave them confidence in their safety and helped them regain sympathy for patients. Nevertheless, working on COVID-19 cases negatively affected their activities outside of the ward, and some of them developed an identity crisis as they feared for the future.

Comparing with other model structures, it is evident that trRosetta (TM-score: 0.64; TM region RMSD: 2 ?) can provide the best model than Robetta (TM-score: 0.61; TM region RMSD: 3.3 ?) and I-TASSER (TM-score: 0.45; TM region RMSD: 6.5 ?). 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations are performed on the model structures by incorporating membrane environment. Moreover, secondary structure elements and principal component analysis (PCA) have also been performed on MD simulation data. Finally, trRosetta model is utilized for interpretation and visualization of interacting residues during protein-protein interactions. The common interacting residues including Phe103, Arg107, Met109, Trp110, Arg131, and Glu135 in the C-terminal domain of M protein are identified in membrane-spike and membrane-nucleocapsid protein complexes.

Agreement was also higher for those with a self-reported chronic disease (aOR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1C2.0); P = 0.04) and among those who held private health insurance (aOR = 1.7 (95% CI: 1.3C2.3); P < 0.001). Beyond individual perceptions, 78% stated that their decision to vaccinate would be supported by family and friends. CONCLUSION: This study presents an early indication of public perceptions towards a future COVID-19 vaccine and represents a starting point for mapping vaccine perceptions. To support an effective launch of these new vaccines, governments need to use this time to understand the communities concerns and to identify the strategies that will support engagement.","output":"Examining Australian public perceptions and behaviors towards a future COVID-19 vaccine"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Following a relatively mild first wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India, a deadly second wave of the pandemic overwhelmed the healthcare system due to the emergence of fast-transmitting SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants. The emergence and spread of the B.1.617.2/Delta variant considered to be driving the devastating second wave of COVID-19 in India. Currently, the Delta variant has rapidly overtaken the previously circulating variants to become the dominant strain. Critical mutations in the spike/RBD region of these variants have raised serious concerns about the virus's increased transmissibility and decreased vaccine effectiveness. As a result, significant scientific and public concern has been expressed about the impact of virus variants on COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to provide an additional explanation in the context of the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 variants in India, the vaccine-induced immune response to the variants of concern (VOC), and various vaccine deployment strategies to rapidly increase population immunity. CONTENT: Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates circulating in India suggests the emergence and spread of B.1.617 variant. The immunogenicity of currently approved vaccines indicates that the majority of vaccines elicit an antibody response and some level of protection. According to current data, vaccines in the pre-fusion configuration (2p substitution) have an advantage in terms of nAb titer, but the duration of vaccine-induced immunity, as well as the role of T cells and memory B cells in protection, remain unknown. Since vaccine efficacy on virus variants is one of the major factors to be considered for achieving herd immunity, existing vaccines need to be improved or effective next-generation vaccines should be developed to cover the new variants of the virus.","output":"Relevance of immune response and vaccination strategies of SARS-CoV-2 in the phase of viral red queen dynamics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to the need to use personal protective equipment such as masks, among healthcare professionals and the general public. Numerous facial dermatoses linked to the use of masks have been described, from which the term maskne or mask acne has emerged. Although prolonged mask usage has been necessary, and a vast majority of people develop various skin conditions, there is a lack of research on the effects of masks on skin. In this article, we review alterations in biochemical properties of skin associated with mask use in individuals with skin of color and the factors predisposing them to developing acne. Because masks are crucial in preventing the spread of COVID-19, we also elucidate some fundamental strategies such as gentle skin care measures, decreasing the duration of mask wear, and following appropriate protocols for mask re-use, which may prevent mask acne and its long-term effects.","output":"Mask Acne in Skin of Color: A Significant Dermatological Condition Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is widely used in intensive care units, but this conventional method has some disadvantages, such as requirement of a lot of equipment and experts at the site. Especially, in situations where the patient is isolated due to an infectious disease, difficulties in using the equipment may occur, and the number of exposed persons may increase. In this paper, we introduce hybrid tracheostomy that combines the advantages of surgical tracheostomy and PDT and describe our experiences. METHODS: Data from 55 patients who received hybrid tracheostomy without bronchoscopy from January 2020 to February 2021 were collected and reviewed retrospectively. Hybrid tracheostomy was performed at the bedside by a single thoracic surgeon. The hybrid tracheostomy method was as follows: after the skin was incised and the trachea was exposed, only the extent of the endotracheal tube that could not be removed was withdrawn, and then tracheostomy was performed by the Seldinger method using a PDT kit. RESULTS: The average age was 66.5 years, and the proportion of men was 69.1%. Among the patients, 21.8% were taking antiplatelet drugs and 14.5% were taking anticoagulants. The average duration of the procedure was 13.3 minutes. There was no major bleeding, and there was one case of paratracheal placement of the tracheostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: In most patients, the procedure can be safely performed without any major complications. However, patients with a short neck, a neck burn or patients who have received radiation therapy to the neck should be treated with conventional methods.","output":"Safety and feasibility of hybrid tracheostomy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are a key step in fighting the pandemic. Nevertheless, their rapid development did not allow for testing among specific population subgroups such as pregnant and breastfeeding women, or elaborating specific guidelines for healthcare personnel working in high infection risk specialties, such as otolaryngology (ORL). This clinical consensus statement (CCS) aims to offer guidance for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to this high-risk population based on the best evidence available. Methods: : A multidisciplinary international panel of 33 specialists judged statements through a 2-rounds modified Delphi method survey. Statements were designed to encompass the following topics: risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection and use of protective equipment in ORL;SARS-Cov-2 infection and vaccines and respective risks for the mother/child dyad;and counseling for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnant, breastfeeding, or fertile healthcare workers (PBFHW). All ORL PBFHW were considered as the target audience. Results: : Of the 13 statements, 7 reached consensus or strong consensus, 2 reached noConsensus and 2 reached near-consensus. According to the statements with strong consensus Otorhinolaryngologists C Head & Neck Surgeons who are pregnant, breastfeeding or with childbearing potential should have the opportunity to receive SARS-Cov-2 vaccination. Moreover, personal protective equipment (PPE) should still be used even after the vaccination. Conclusion: Until prospective evaluations on these topics are available, ORL-HNS must be considered a high infection risk specialty. While the use of PPE remains pivotal, ORL PBFHW should be allowed access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provided they receive up-to-date information.","output":"Appropriateness for SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination for Otolaryngologist and Head and Neck Surgeons in case of Pregnancy, Breastfeeding or Childbearing potential: YO-IFOS and CEORL-HNS joint clinical consensus statement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"S56 Table 1Table to show measures of complement activation, inflammation and coagulation in patients with COVID-19 stratified by disease severityMildModerateSevereOverall P-ValueMild vs Mod*Mild vs Sev*Mod vs Sev*Number (%)30289----CRP (mg/L)75.5 [28.5,117.25]93.5 [72,143.5]60 [34,157.5]NSNSNSNSFerritin (ug/L)426 [290.5,847.5]728 [381.25,1071.5]857 [443,1607.5]NSNSNSNSPCT (ug/L)0.08 [0.06,0.19]0.16 [0.09,0.49]0.19 [0.12,0.8]0.019NS0.046NSLDH (U/L)708.5 [523.5,903]830 [569,1122]1037 [927.5,1086]0.008NS0.006NSPlatelets (10*9/L)220 [174.75,328.75]255 [203.5, 335]292 [209.5, 329.5]NSNSNSNSINR1.1 [1.08,1.23]1.1 [1.1, 1.2]1.1 [1.1, 1.15]NSNSNSNSAPTR0.9 [0.9,1.0]0.9 [0.9, 1.0]1.0 [0.95, 1.10]NSNSNS0.038D-dimer (ugFEU/ml)0.56 [0.38,0.95]0.74 [0.55, 1.52]0.85 [0.54, 19.2]NSNSNSNSFibrinogen (g/L)4.45 [4.05,5.22]4.7 [4.3, 6.38]4.3 [3.9, 6.0]NSNSNSNSThrombin-AT III Complex ug/L)4.75 [2.65,12.13]8.8 [5.3, 12]14.3 [6.9, 40.7]0.045NSNSNSProthrombin Fragment 1&2 (pMol/L)275 [164.5,380.5]311 [163, 492]301 [258, 709]NSNSNSNSCH50 (U Eq/ml)123.4 [101.75,174.7]113.4[88.68, 153.43]114.7 [74.6,158.9]NSNSNSNSComplement C5a (ng/ml)29 [21.5, 36]36.5[25.5, 48.75]68 [39.5,122.5]<0.0010.0380.001NSComplement C5 (mg/L)270 [235.25,290.5]263[235.25, 279]276 [220,299.5]NSNSNSNSComplement C3 (g/L)1.5 [1.25,1.77]1.48[1.33, 1.71]1.56 [1.16,1.73]NSNSNSNSSC5b-9 complex (ng/ml)1070.46 [836.41,1632.17]1725.48[1092.62, 2403.3]2392.66 [1245.68,5145.88]0.006NS0.019NSComplement Fragment Bb (g/ml)0.2[0.15,0.27]0.25[0.17, 0.3]0.29 [0.2,0.43]NSNSNSNSComplement C3a ng/ml)296.88[244.33,345.22]325.88[248.33, 484.03]460.23 [282.49,652.1]NSNSNSNS*P-values given a Bonferroni adjustment to allow for multiple testing between subgroupsDiscussionOur findings demonstrated increased levels of complement activity in patients with COVID-19, particularly in those patients requiring non-invasive and mechanical ventilation and those patients that deteriorate requiring increasing ventilatory support.

High-throughput quantification of small-molecules in bio-samples, i.e. metabolomics, is steadily gaining popularity, as it is highly informative for various phenotypical characteristics. Here we aim to leverage metabolomics to impute missing data in clinical variables routinely assessed in large epidemiological and clinical studies. METHODS: To this end, we have employed 26,000 (1)H-NMR metabolomics samples from 28 Dutch cohorts collected within the BBMRI-NL consortium, to create 19 metabolomics-based predictors for clinical variables, including diabetes status (AUC(5-Fold CV) = 094) and lipid medication usage (AUC(5-Fold CV) = 090). FINDINGS: Subsequent application in independent cohorts confirmed that our metabolomics-based predictors can indeed be used to impute a wide array of missing clinical variables from a single metabolomics data resource. In addition, application highlighted the potential use of our predictors to explore the effects of totally unobserved confounders in omics association studies. Finally, we show that our predictors can be used to explore risk factor profiles contributing to mortality in older participants.

Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Where variations in the viral spike protein, in turn, lead to the cross-species transmission of the virus, genetic variations in the host receptor ACE2 may also contribute to the susceptibility and/or resistance against the viral infection. This study aims to explore the binding of the proteins encoded by different human ACE2 allelic variants with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Briefly, coding variants of ACE2 corresponding to the reported binding sites for its attachment with coronavirus spike protein were selected and molecular models of these variants were constructed by homology modeling. The models were then superimposed over the native ACE2 and ACE2-spike protein complex, to observe structural changes in the ACE2 variants and their intermolecular interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, respectively. Despite strong overall structural similarities, the spatial orientation of the key interacting residues varies in the ACE2 variants compared with the wild-type molecule. Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild-type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. However, ACE2 alleles, rs73635825 (S19P) and rs143936283 (E329G) showed noticeable variations in their intermolecular interactions with the viral spike protein.

During the last 50 years, extensive data have been gathered enabling a study of time trends in the prevalence of common diseases in this age group. OBJECTIVES To examine the current prevalence of common diseases, compare the results with those of previous cohorts, and assess the influence of the massive immigration during the 1990s. METHODS The health examination at the recruitment centers includes a medical history, complete physical examination, and review of medical documentation provided by the family physician. If needed, additional tests and referral to specialists are ordered. The prevalence of selected diseases and severity was drawn from the computerized database of the classification board. Two cohorts, 1992-94 and 2003-04, were examined and compared with three previous cohort studies in 1957-61, 1977-78 and 1982-84. Data were stratified according to origin and country of birth. RESULTS The prevalence of asthma increased dramatically during the years from 10.2 per 1000 examinees in 1957-61 to 111.6 per 1000 examinees in 2003-04. The prevalence of tuberculosis declined and then increased from 0.6 per 1000 adolescents in 1982-84 to 2.4 per 1000 adolescents in 2003-04. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes mellitus increased from 0.2 cases per 1000 examinees in 1957-61 to 0.8 cases in 1977-78 and 1982-84 and 0.9 cases per 1000 examinees in 2003-04.

The resultant models demonstrate that tourism EEs represent an expanding meso-level experience space made up of actors engaged in multiple types of activities, complemented by an ever-expanding set of interactions, and driven by a variety of entrepreneurial behaviors and technological innovations. Theoretical implications suggest that future research should employ dynamic measurement approaches to understanding and measuring EE performance vis-a-vis the disruptive impact of digital technology.

Human coronavirus (hCoV) NL63 is associated with up to 10% of common colds. Viral plaque assays enable the characterization of virus infectivity and allow for purifying virus stock solutions. They are essential for drug screening. Hitherto used cell cultures for hCoV-NL63 show low levels of virus replication and weak and diffuse cytopathogenic effects. It has not yet been possible to establish practicable plaque assays for this important human pathogen. RESULTS: 12 different cell cultures were tested for susceptibility to hCoV-NL63 infection. Human colon carcinoma cells (CaCo-2) replicated virus more than 100 fold more efficiently than commonly used African green monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2). CaCo-2 cells showed cytopathogenic effects 4 days post infection. Avicel, agarose and carboxymethyl-cellulose overlays proved suitable for plaque assays. Best results were achieved with Avicel, which produced large and clear plaques from the 4(th )day of infection. The utility of plaque assays with agrose overlay was demonstrated for purifying virus, thereby increasing viral infectivity by 1 log 10 PFU/mL. CONCLUSION: CaCo-2 cells support hCoV-NL63 better than LLC-MK2 cells and enable cytopathogenic plaque assays. Avicel overlay is favourable for plaque quantification, and agarose overlay is preferred for plaque purification. HCoV-NL63 virus stock of increased infectivity will be beneficial in antiviral screening, animal modelling of disease, and other experimental tasks.","output":"Plaque assay for human coronavirus NL63 using human colon carcinoma cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the potential association of cerebral autoregulation (CA) with postoperative delirium (PD), a common complication of cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). METHODS: In patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery with CPB, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) and blood pressure (BP) were continuously recorded during 5-min preoperatively (T1), after 24 h (T2), and 7 days after procedure (T3). Prospective multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the independent risk factors of PD. Autoregulation index (ARI) was calculated from the CBFV response to a step change in BP derived by transfer function analysis. RESULTS: In 67 patients, mean age 64.3  9.5 years, CA was depressed at T2 as shown by values of ARI (3.9  1.7), compared to T1 (5.6  1.7) and T3 (5.5  1.8) (p < 0.001). Impaired CA was found in 37 (55%) patients at T2 and in 7 patients (20%) at T3. Lower ARI at T1 and T2 were predictors of PD (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Dynamic CA was impaired after CABG surgery with CPB and was a significant independent risk factor of PD. SIGNIFICANCE: Assessment of CA before and after surgery could have considerable potential for early identification of patients at risk of PD, thus reducing poor outcomes and length of stay.

In this study, we describe a fetoscopic two-layer (myofascial and skin) closure technique for the treatment of NTD in five patients and report the preliminary anatomical outcome at birth. METHODS From February to September 2017, five pregnant women with a fetus with a NTD, including three cases of myelomeningocele and two cases of myelocele, were operated on using a fetoscopic two-layer closure technique. In this technique, with the uterus exteriorized and using three 10-Fr ports, the placode is dissected from the surrounding tissue and detethered, removing the cystic tissue. The skin is undermined by blunt dissection and the defect is sutured to the midline in two layers (myofascial and skin) using a running 4/0 resorbable barbed suture. RESULTS Median gestational age at the procedure was 24 + 3 (range, 23 + 5 to 27 + 3) weeks. Surgery was successful in all cases, without any intraoperative complications. Median time in surgery was 180 (range, 140-180) min and median time for fetoscopy was 105 (range, 65-120) min. In terms of obstetric complications, three cases of premature rupture of membranes and one case of chorioamnionitis were recorded. Median gestational age at delivery was 34 + 1 (range, 25 + 4 to 37 + 2) weeks and two patients delivered vaginally. The closed defect was watertight with good quality tissue in all cases. CONCLUSION Fetoscopic two-layer closure of NTD may improve the quality of the tissue covering the defect, diminishing the need for postnatal surgical revision, and preserving the well-documented beneficial effects of prenatal closure on the neural tissue and hindbrain herniation. However, this technique may not be appropriate for those cases with wide diastasis of the myofascial layer or with a low quantity of available tissue. Copyright ? 2018 ISUOG.

Epistemic uncertainty, which usually is due to insufficient knowledge about the model, can be reduced by collecting more data or refining the learning models. Over the last few years, scholars have proposed many epistemic uncertainty handling techniques which can be roughly grouped into two categories, i.e., Bayesian and ensemble. This paper provides a comprehensive review of epistemic uncertainty learning techniques in supervised learning over the last five years. As such, we, first, decompose the epistemic uncertainty into bias and variance terms. Then, a hierarchical categorization of epistemic uncertainty learning techniques along with their representative models is introduced. In addition, several applications such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) are presented, followed by a discussion on research gaps and possible future research directions.","output":"A Survey on Epistemic (Model) Uncertainty in Supervised Learning: Recent Advances and Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Patients who require positive pressure ventilation through a tracheostomy are unable to phonate due to the inflated tracheostomy cuff. Whilst a speaking valve (SV) can be used on a tracheostomy tube, its use in ventilated ICU patients has been inhibited by concerns regarding potential deleterious effects to recovering lungs. The objective of this study was to assess end expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and standard bedside respiratory parameters before, during and after SV use in tracheostomised patients weaning from mechanical ventilation. METHODS A prospective observational study was conducted in a cardio-thoracic adult ICU. 20 consecutive tracheostomised patients weaning from mechanical ventilation and using a SV were recruited. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) was used to monitor patients' EELI. Changes in lung impedance and standard bedside respiratory data were analysed pre, during and post SV use. RESULTS Use of in-line SVs resulted in significant increase of EELI. This effect grew and was maintained for at least 15 minutes after removal of the SV (p < 0.001). EtCO2 showed a significant drop during SV use (p = 0.01) whilst SpO2 remained unchanged. Respiratory rate (RR (breaths per minute)) decreased whilst the SV was in situ (p <0.001), and heart rate (HR (beats per minute)) was unchanged. All results were similar regardless of the patients' respiratory requirements at time of recruitment. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort of critically ill ventilated patients, SVs did not cause derecruitment of the lungs when used in the ventilator weaning period. Deflating the tracheostomy cuff and restoring the airflow via the upper airway with a one-way valve may facilitate lung recruitment during and after SV use, as indicated by increased EELI.

Accordingly, not all prolonged stays or even deaths are due directly to SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first review, focusing both on cardiovascular and metabolic aspects of this dreadful disease, in an integrated and personalized way, following the guidelines of the Cardiometabolic Health/Medicine. Therefore, current personalized aspects such as ACEIs and ARBs, the place of statins and the most appropriate management of heart failure in diabetics are analysed.

BACKGROUND: Frailty is a major problem in patients discharged from acute care, but no data are available on the frailty risk in survivors of COVID\\\\19 infection. DESIGN: A descriptive cross\\\\sectional study (STROBE checklist). METHODS: At admission to sub\\\\acute care in 2020, 236 COVID\\\\19 patients (median age 77 years C interquartile range 68C83) were administered BRASS and classified into 3 levels of frailty risk. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) was also administered to measure physical function and disability. Differences between BRASS levels and associations between BRASS index and clinical parameters were analysed. RESULTS: The median BRASS index was 14.0 (interquartile range 9.0C20.0) denoting intermediate frailty (32.2%, 41.1%, 26.7% of patients exhibited low, intermediate and high frailty, respectively). Significant differences emerged between the BRASS frailty classes regards to sex, comorbidities, history of cognitive deficits, previous mechanical ventilation support and SPPB score. Patients with no comorbidities (14%) exhibited low frailty (BRASS: median 5.5, interquartile range 3.0C12.0). Age 65 years, presence of comorbidities, cognitive deficit and SPPB % predicted <50% were significant predictors of high frailty.

METHODS Medetomidine (0.2 mg kg-1) with 10 mg kg-1 ketamine (MK) or 5 mg kg-1 S(+)-ketamine (MS) was administered IN to each rabbit in a randomized fashion. In Centre 1 (n = 42) rabbits were held in sternal recumbency, and in Centre 2 (n = 41) in dorsal recumbency, during drug instillation. Adverse reactions were recorded. If a rabbit swallowed during endotracheal intubation, half of the initial IN dose was repeated and intubation was re-attempted after 5 minutes. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane. Heart rate, blood pressure, endtidal carbon dioxide concentration and blood gases were recorded. Data were analysed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS In all, 39 animals were assigned to the MK group and 44 to the MS group. Two rabbits in the MS group held in dorsal recumbency died after instillation of the drug.

AIMS To assess the presence of emotional disorders in Spain and the association to sociodemographic characteristics and CERS during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD Cross-sectional survey administered through an online platform. Sociodemographic variables and CERS (CERQ-Short) were collected and possible diagnoses of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD, GAD-7), major depression disorder (MDD; Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), panic attacks (PA; PHQ-PD), and panic disorders (PD; PHQ-PD) were assessed. Sociodemographic risk factors and CERS association to the possible diagnosis of emotional disorders were reported with hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS A total of 1,753 respondents completed the questionnaire in Spain. Of these, most (76.8%) were female, with a mean (SD) age of 40.4 years (12.9). A high proportion of participants met diagnostic criteria for emotional disorders: 15.3% for GAD, 12.2% for MDD, 17.2% for PD, and 25.7% had experienced a PA. The contribution of sociodemographic variables to diagnoses of emotional disorders was modest, explaining from 3.1% to 5.7% of the variance; however, when CERS were added, the combination of sociodemographic and CERS explained from 15% to 29% of the variance. Rumination and catastrophizing were the most transdiagnostic maladaptive strategies and positive refocusing was another adaptive strategy. DISCUSSION Although results from convenience samples should be handled with caution, the high prevalence of emotional disorders in this study suggests that the demand of mental health interventions will probably increase in Spain. Also, CERS play a clear role in the presence of these disorders. CONCLUSION Intervention programs should focus on training CERS in populations at high risk, focusing on the reduction of maladaptive CERS and the reinforce of other more adaptive CERS.","output":"Emotional Disorders During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Spain: The Role of Sociodemographic Risk Factors and Cognitive Emotion Regulation Strategies."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Image: see text] Background: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a therapeutic target against type II diabetes (T2D). Synthetic sesquiterpene derivatives were investigated to identify novel AMPK activators as anti-diabetic drugs because the leading drugs like metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate AMPK by inhibiting the synthesis of adenosine 5-triphosphate and thus are associated with some side effects. Results: We identified WSF-CT-11 as an AMPK activator in HEK293T cells and found that WSF-CT-11 activates AMPK by the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1), a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel. The increased Ca(2+) influx then activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which in turn phosphorylates TRPV1 and facilitates the formation of a TRPV1/Akt/CaMKII/AMPK complex. This complex might be important for the regulation of AMPK activity. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, WSF-CT-11-induced AMPK activation has three anti-diabetic effects. It promotes the assembly of high-molecular-weight adiponectin, which has stronger insulin-sensitizing activity than other multimers. It improves translocation of the glucose transporter type 4, increases glucose uptake, and induces the inhibitory phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  and thus suppresses adipogenesis.

In a randomized trial we evaluated whether remote symptom monitoring and management utilizing Symptom Care at Home (SCH), would reduce symptom burden, improve quality of life, and decrease unplanned health care use in cancer patients receiving active treatment. Methods: Patients (n = 252) receiving chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy were randomized to the SCH intervention (n = 128) or usual care (UC) (n = 124). Daily, those in the intervention group, utilized the SCH system to report the presence and severity of 9 common symptoms during treatment. For symptoms endorsed, SCH participants received immediate, tailored automated self-management coaching. Symptoms at moderate to severe levels were automatically reported to oncology nurse practitioners who called the SCH patients to improve symptom management based on a decision support dashboard. Participants from both groups were assessed at baseline and monthly for up to 5 months on symptom burden (MDASI), mental health well-being and social isolation (PROMIS;HADS) and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) (Penedo Covid-19 HRQoL subscale). Unplanned health care use was extracted from the EHR. Descriptive statistics examined equivalency between groups. Mixed effects models with random intercepts were utilized to examine group differences over time with post-hoc analyses to determine specific timepoint differences. Results: Participants did not differ on demographic or baseline measures. On average participants were 61 years of age, predominantly female (61%) and white (93%). A variety of cancers were represented with colon, breast and ovarian most common and 60% had stage 3 or 4 disease. Longitudinal mixed effects models found significant effects for lower symptom burden (p =.018) and better HRQoL (p =.007) for SCH participants versus UC at months 1 and 2 with improvements subsiding over the remaining months. Mental health wellbeing and social isolation were not significantly different. There were a total of 71 unplanned health care episodes with 28 for SCH and 43 for UC.

This is a multi-centre, observational, nationwide survey, involving high-volume Italian CHD centres. COVID-19 diagnosis was defined as either clinically suspected or confirmed, where a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) test had been performed and was positive. Cardiovascular comorbidities were observed among adult patientsatrial fibrillation (seven; 9%), hypertension (five; 7%), obesity (seven; 9%) and diabetes (one; 1%)but were absent among children. Cardiovascular complications were mainly observed in the confirmed COVID-19+group, consisting of heart failure (9%), palpitations/arrhythmias (3%), stroke/TIA (3%) and pulmonary hypertension (3%).

Disparities occur in the effects of response efficacy, flood experience, beliefs in governmental actions, demographics, and media, which we attribute to specific cultural or institutional characteristics. Climate adaptation policies can leverage on the revealed similarities when extrapolating best practices across countries, yet should exercise caution as context-specific socio-behavioral drivers may discourage or even reverse household adaptation motivation.","output":"Contextualizing cross national patterns in household climate change adaptation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: The aim of this study is to examine the health anxiety states and behaviours of athletes during the social isolation period due to COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, there is an imperative to develop novel highly efficient (synthetic) agents against both drug-sensitive-TB and DR-TB. The exploration of various heterocycles as prospective core scaffolds for the discovery, development and optimization of anti-TB drugs remains an intriguing scientific endeavour. Telacebec (Q203;TCB), a molecule containing an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide (IPA) structural motif, is considered a novel very promising anti-TB agent showing a unique mechanism of action. The compound blocks oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting a mycobacterial respiratory chain due to interference with a specific cytochrome b subunit (QcrB) of transmembrane bc1 menaquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase as an essential component for transporting electrons across the membrane from menaquinol to other specific subunit, cytochrome c (QcrC). Thus, the ability of mycobacteria to synthesize adenosine-5'-triphosphate is limited and energy generating machinery is disabled. The TCB molecule effectively fights drug-susceptible, MDR as well as XDR M. tuberculosis strains. The article briefly explains a mechanism of an anti-TB action related to the compounds containing a variously substituted IPA scaffold and is focused on their fundamental structure-anti-TB activity relationships as well. Special consideration is paid to TCB indicating the importance of particular structural fragments for maintaining (or even improving) favourable pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and/or toxicological properties. High lipophilicity of TCB might be regarded as one of the key physicochemical properties with positive impact on anti-TB effect of the drug.

However, evidence from a variety of nations showed that the COVID-19 outbreak and its associated quarantine measures triggered a wide range of psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress in the general population. As a result, the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms among Tepi town residents during the pandemic lockdown. METHODOLOGY: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among residents of Tepi town from September 15 through September 25, 2020, and residents who have lived in Tepi town for at least 6 months were included. We have employed the depression, anxiety, and stress scale 21 (DASS-21) to evaluate depression, anxiety, and stress. The Chi-squared test of association and logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among residents of Tepi town. For all statistical analysis, we used (IBM) SPSS version 25. RESULTS: According to the current study, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms were 37.7%, 39.0%, and 44.2%, respectively, among residents of Tepi town. Estimated odds of having depression, anxiety, and stress were as follows: for being female 6.315, 4.591, and 3.155; smoking 1.787, 1.883, and 1.787; sleep problem 2.613, 2.254, and 1.721; chewing Khat 2.156, 2.053, and 2.110; quarantine for 14 days 2.251, 1.902, and 1.960; and frequent use of social media 3.126, 1.849, and 3.126 times more likely as compared to their corresponding reference group respectively. The odds of developing depression and anxiety respectively were as follows: for alcohol consumption 2.438 and 1.797 times higher than their corresponding reference group respectively. Those exposed to COVID-19 were 3.870 times more likely to develop depression symptoms. Estimated odds of having anxiety and stress symptoms for fear of COVID-19 were 1.776 and 1.835; social interactions altered were 3.197 and 2.069, moderate levels of hope were 2.687 and 2.849 respectively. The odds ratio for those taking traditional preventive medicine, and having family members infected with COVID-19 were 2.475 and 1.837 times more likely to experience anxiety symptoms respectively. CONCLUSION: In this study, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms was found to be high among residences in Tepi town. Being female, chewing Khat, smoking, being quarantined for 14 days, frequently using social media, and having sleeping problems were all found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of developing depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, whereas alcohol consumption and family members infected by COVID-19 were considerably linked to depression and anxiety symptoms. Fear of COVID-19, influence on social interaction and having a moderate level of hope were substantially related to stress and anxiety symptoms, while taking preventive medicine was found to be a significant factor in anxiety symptoms among Tepi town residences.

There has been a rapid evolution of evidence, establishing an increased risk of morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes and concurrent COVID-19. The objective of this review is to explore the current evidence for inpatient assessment and management of diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight areas requiring further exploration. METHODS: A literature search of databases was conducted to November 2020 using variations on keywords SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS, MERS and diabetes. Information relating to the impact of diabetes on severity of COVID-19 infection, the impact of COVID-19 infection on diabetes management and diabetes-related complications was integrated to create a narrative review. DISCUSSION: People with diabetes and COVID-19 are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. It is important that people with both known and previously unrecognised diabetes and COVID-19 be promptly identified and assessed during acute illness, with close monitoring for clinical deterioration or complications. People with diabetes may require titration or alteration of their glycaemic management due to the potential for worse outcomes with hyperglycaemia and COVID-19 infection. Comprehensive discharge planning is vital to optimise ongoing glycaemic management. CONCLUSION: Further understanding of the risk of adverse outcomes and optimisation of glycaemic management for people with diabetes during COVID-19 is required to improve outcomes. Increased glucose and ketone monitoring, substitution of insulin for some oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications and careful monitoring for complications of diabetes such as diabetic ketoacidosis should be considered.","output":"An overview of COVID-19 in people with diabetes: Pathophysiology and considerations in the inpatient setting"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Due to COVID-19, universities across Canada were forced to undergo a transition from classroom-based face-to-face learning and invigilated assessments to online-based learning and non-invigilated assessments.

METHODS A survey was conducted in all 6 neurosurgical departments in the Veneto region to collect data about surgical, inpatient care and endovascular procedures during the month of March for each year from 2016 to 2020. Safety measures to avoid infection from SARS-CoV-2 and any COVID-19 cases reported among neurosurgical patients or staff members were considered. RESULTS The mean number of neurosurgical admissions for the month of March over the 2016-2019 period was 663, whereas in March 2020 admissions decreased by 42%. Emergency admissions decreased by 23%. The average number of neurosurgical procedures was 697, and declined by 30% (range -10% to -51% in individual centers). Emergency procedures decreased in the same period by 23%. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage both decreased in Veneto-by 25% and 22%, respectively. Coiling for unruptured aneurysm, coiling for ruptured aneurysm, and surgery for ruptured aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation diminished by 49%, 27%, and 78%, respectively. Endovascular procedures for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) increased by 33% in 2020 (28 procedures in total). There was a slight decrease (8%) in brain tumor surgeries. Neurosurgical admissions decreased by 25% and 35% for head trauma and spinal trauma, respectively, while surgical procedures for head trauma diminished by 19% and procedures for spinal trauma declined by 26%. Admissions and surgical treatments for degenerative spine were halved. Eleven healthcare workers and 8 patients were infected in the acute phase of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS This multicenter study describes the effects of a COVID-19 outbreak on neurosurgical activities in a vast region in Italy. Remodulation of neurosurgical activities has resulted in a significant reduction of elective and emergency surgeries compared to previous years. Most likely this is a combined result of cancellation of elective and postponable surgeries, increase of conservative management, increase in social restrictions, and in patients' fear of accessing hospitals. Curiously, only endovascular procedures for AIS have increased, possibly due to reduced physical activity or increased thrombosis in SARS-CoV-2. The confounding effect of thrombectomy increase over time cannot be excluded. No conclusion can be drawn on AIS incidence. Active monitoring with nasopharyngeal swabs, wearing face masks, and using separate pathways for infected patients reduce the risk of infection.","output":"Neurosurgery in times of a pandemic: a survey of neurosurgical services during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Veneto region in Italy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this study, we investigate the potential driving factors that lead to the disparity in the time-series of home dwell time, aiming to provide fundamental knowledge that benefits policy-making for better mitigation strategies of future pandemics.

We find that demographic/socioeconomic variables can explain the disparity in home dwell time in response to the stay-at-home order, which potentially leads to disparate exposures to the risk from the COVID-19. The results further suggest that socially disadvantaged groups are less likely to follow the order to stay at home, pointing out the extensive gaps in the effectiveness of social distancing measures exist between socially disadvantaged groups and others. Our study reveals that the long-standing inequity issue in the U.S. stands in the way of the effective implementation of social distancing measures.

However, the magnitude of this association still needs to be defined. Furthermore, clinical predictors of thrombogenesis, and the relationship with the inflammatory status are currently unknown. On this basis, we conducted a retrospective, observational study on 259 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to an academic tertiary referral hospital in Northern Italy between March 19th and April 6th, 2020. Records of COVID-19 patients with a definite VTE event were reviewed for demographic information, co-morbidities, risk factors for VTE, laboratory tests, and anticoagulation treatment. Twenty-five cases among 259 COVID-19 patients developed VTE (9.6%), all of them having a Padua score > 4, although being under standard anticoagulation prophylaxis since hospital admission. In the VTE subcohort, we found a significant positive correlation between platelet count (PLT) and either C reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.0001) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.0013), while a significant inverse correlation was observed between PLT and mean platelet volume (p < 0.0001). Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio significantly correlated with CRP (p < 0.0001). The majority of VTE patients was male and younger compared to non-VTE patients (p = 0.002 and p = 0.005, respectively). No significant difference was found in D-dimer levels between VTE and non VTE patients, while significantly higher levels of LDH (p = 0.04) and IL-6 (p = 0.04) were observed in VTE patients in comparison to non-VTE patients. In conclusion, our findings showed a quite high prevalence of VTE in COVID-19 patients.

For example, in recent years, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza have emerged in Asia, spread through Eastern Europe, and threaten to become pandemic. As demonstrated by the coordinated response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza, agents of infectious disease are being addressed via large-scale genomic sequencing. The goal of genomic sequencing projects are to rapidly put large amounts of data in the public domain to accelerate research on disease surveillance, treatment, and prevention. However, our ability to derive information from large comparative genomic datasets lags far behind acquisition. Here we review the computational challenges of comparative genomic analyses, specifically sequence alignment and reconstruction of phylogenetic trees. We present novel analytical results on two important infectious diseases, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and influenza. SARS and influenza have similarities and important differences both as biological and comparative genomic analysis problems. Influenza viruses (Orthymxyoviridae) are RNA based. Current evidence indicates that influenza viruses originate in aquatic birds from wild populations. Influenza has been studied for decades via well-coordinated international efforts. These efforts center on surveillance via antibody characterization of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N) proteins of the circulating strains to inform vaccine design. However, we still do not have a clear understanding of (1) various transmission pathways such as the role of intermediate hosts like swine and domestic birds and (2) the key mutation and genomic recombination events that underlie periodic pandemics of influenza. In the past 30 years, sequence data from HA and N loci has become an important data type. In the past year, full genomic data has become prominent. These data present exciting opportunities to address unanswered questions in influenza pandemics. SARS is caused by a previously unrecognized lineage of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which like influenza has an RNA based genome. Although SARS-CoV is widely believed to have originated in animals, there remains disagreement over the candidate animal source that lead to the original outbreak of SARS. In contrast to the long history of the study of influenza, SARS was only recognized in late 2002 and the virus that causes SARS has been documented primarily by genomic sequencing. In the past, most studies of influenza were performed on a limited number of isolates and genes suited to a particular problem. Major goals in science today are to understand emerging diseases in broad geographic, environmental, societal, biological, and genomic contexts. Synthesizing diverse information brought together by various researchers is important to find out what can be done to prevent future outbreaks [JON03]. Thus comprehensive means to organize and analyze large amounts of diverse information are critical. For example, the relationships of isolates and patterns of genomic change observed in large datasets might not be consistent with hypotheses formed on partial data. Moreover when researchers rely on partial datasets, they restrict the range of possible discoveries. Phylogenetics is well suited to the complex task of understanding emerging infectious disease. Phylogenetic analyses can test many hypotheses by comparing diverse isolates collected from various hosts, environments, and points in time and organizing these data into various evolutionary scenarios. The products of a phylogenetic analysis are a graphical tree of ancestorCdescendent relationships and an inferred summary of mutations, recombination events, host shifts, geographic, and temporal spread of the viruses. However, this synthesis comes at a price. The cost of computation of phylogenetic analysis expands combinatorially as the number of isolates considered increases. Thus, large datasets like those currently produced are commonly considered intractable. We address this problem with synergistic development of heuristics tree search strategies and parallel computing.","output":"Large-Scale Phylogenetic Analysis of Emerging Infectious Diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The aim of the study is to determine the perception of general public on the Serbian police behaviors in combating COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the perception of the citizens how successful the police units were in fulfilling their tasks Design/methodology/approach: Due to the state of emergency declared due to COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the restriction of movement and the need for social distance, the data collection for this study had to be conducted via the online survey platform (Google doc) The study was conducted during MarchCApril 2020, only four weeks after the state of emergency was declared The participants were invited to complete the online questionnaire in their native language by using the snowball sampling strategy focused on recruiting the general public via social media tools Findings: Considering the fact that police officers are not sufficiently prepared and trained to respond in these specific circumstances, it is necessary to improve their engagement in the future by conducting appropriate training, procuring adequate resources, implementing adequate planning activities, etc The results of the multivariate regressions of public perception preparedness subscale show that the most important predictor is gender and it explains 23 6% of the variance in preparedness subscale The remaining variables did not have significant effects on preparedness This model with all mentioned independent variables explains 6 1% of the variance of preparedness subscale Originality/value: Bearing in mind that there were no completed studies on public perception of police behaviors about the COVID-19 disaster in Serbia, the research has a considerable scientific and social importance ? 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","output":"Public perception of police behaviors in the disaster COVID-19 C The case of Serbia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many ethical issues arise concerning the care of critically ill and dying patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

METHOD: This cross-sectional study used an online survey that was disseminated to homeless service, supportive housing, and harm reduction organizations and networks. Data were collected on depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress, compassion satisfaction and fatigue, and substance use problems as well as pandemic-related changes in mental health and wellness. A total of 701 service providers completed the survey and were included in data analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the primary research questions, with hierarchical multiple regression models also being fit to explore mental health and wellness differences by occupational service setting. RESULTS: Most direct service providers (79.5%) working with people experiencing homelessness reported a decline in their mental health during the pandemic. There were high rates of common mental health problems within the sample that are largely consistent with those found among health-care workers during the pandemic. Occupational service settings were not associated with the severity of mental health problems, indicating pervasive issues across the workforce, though providers who were younger and spent more time in direct service roles were at greater risk. CONCLUSIONS: The common mental health problems and negative impacts of the pandemic among service providers working with people experiencing homelessness highlight a highly vulnerable workforce that could benefit from improved access to supports. Given the similarities between our findings and other studies examining essential workforces, it is recommended that initiatives that provide accessible mental health care to the health-care workforce during the pandemic be expanded to include homeless and social service providers.","output":"Mental Health and Wellness of Service Providers Working with People Experiencing Homelessness in Canada: A National Survey from the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lessons learned from the response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic are important to quell the opioid use disorder epidemic in the United States.

Metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis links metabolism to inflammation and such a shift is commonly observed in sepsis under normoxic conditions. By shifting the metabolic state from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, we hypothesized it would reverse unresolved inflammation and subsequently improve outcome. We propose a shift from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation as a sepsis therapy by targeting the pathways involved in the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Chemical manipulation of PDH using dichloroacetic acid (DCA) will promote oxidative phosphorylation over glycolysis and decrease inflammation. We tested our hypothesis in a Drosophila melanogaster model of surviving sepsis infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Drosophila were divided into 3 groups: unmanipulated, sham and sepsis survivors, all treated with linezolid; each group was either treated or not with DCA for one week following sepsis. We followed lifespan, measured gene expression of Toll, defensin, cecropin A, and drosomycin, and levels of lactate, pyruvate, acetyl-CoA as well as TCA metabolites. In our model, metabolic effects of sepsis are modified by DCA with normalized lactate, TCA metabolites, and was associated with improved lifespan of sepsis survivors, yet had no lifespan effects on unmanipulated and sham flies.

However, its recent descendants BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 have surged dramatically to become dominant in the United States and South Africa, respectively2,3. That these novel Omicron subvariants carry additional mutations in their spike proteins raises concerns that they may further evade neutralizing antibodies, thereby further compromising the efficacy of our COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutic monoclonals. We now report findings from a systematic antigenic analysis of these surging Omicron subvariants. BA.2.12.1 is only modestly (1.8-fold) more resistant to sera from vaccinated and boosted individuals than BA.2. On the other hand, BA.4/5 is substantially (4.2-fold) more resistant and thus more likely to lead to vaccine breakthrough infections. Mutation at spike residue L452 found in both BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5 facilitates escape from some antibodies directed to the so-called Class 2 and Class 3 regions of the receptor-binding domain (RBD)4. The F486V mutation found in BA.4/5 facilitates escape from certain Class 1 and Class 2 antibodies to the RBD but compromises the spike affinity for the cellular receptor ACE2. The R493Q reversion mutation, however, restores receptor affinity and consequently the fitness of BA.4/5.

Vaccine safety is the main target of criticism. The rapid distribution of false information, or even conspiracy theories on the internet has tremendously favored vaccine hesitancy.

Parents and patients have several concerns about vaccine safety, of which the ubiquitous anxieties include inactivating agents, adjuvants, preservatives, or new technologies such as genetic vaccines. In general, increasing doubts concerning side effects have been observed, which may lead to an increasing mistrust of scientific results and thus, the scientific method. Hence, this review targets five topics concerning vaccines and reviews current scientific publications in order to summarize the available information refuting conspiracy theories and myths about vaccination. The topics have been selected based on the authors personal perception of the most frequently occurring safety controversies: the inactivation agent formaldehyde, the adjuvant aluminum, the preservative mercury, the mistakenly-drawn correlation between vaccines and autism and genetic vaccines. The scientific literature shows that vaccine safety is constantly studied. Furthermore, the literature does not support the allegations that vaccines may cause a serious threat to general human life. The author suggests that more researchers explaining their research ideas, methods and results publicly could strengthen the general confidence in science.

To reduce the exponential growth of infections due to the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting overburdening of the healthcare system, many European Countries, parts of the US and Switzerland gradually implemented measures of quarantine and isolation defined as lockdown. This consideration leads to the need to understand how individuals are motivated to protect themselves and others. Recent research suggested that prosocial mental dispositions, such as empathy, might promote adherence to social norms of distancing. Other research conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak indicates, however, that empathy levels might fluctuate according to anxiety linked to the risk of death, and this negatively predicted prosocial willingness. The present protocol proposes a study on whether people's empathic dispositions, interacting with the levels of risk, influence the psychological impact of lockdown. The rationale is that emphatic dispositions, encouraging the acceptance of the lockdown, determine a better psychological adaptation and less distress. One retrospective study will be developed in Switzerland and, if the pandemic conditions force a new wave of lockdown on the population, one prospective study as well. A total of 120 participants will be involved, distinguished by their level of objective risk: (1) high objective risk (COVID-19 positive patients, hospitalized in isolation in post-acute phase); (2) moderate objective risk (COVID-19 positive patients, isolated at home); (3) minimum objective risk (non-positive adults, in lockdown). Measures of perceived risk of being contagious for third parties, empathic dispositions and acceptance of lockdown will be collected. The expected results provide important answers related to the immediate impact of empathic dispositions, effective risk and risk perception on the psychological impact of lockdown during a pandemic outbreak.

TSL have been combined with various heating modalities, but there is no consensus on required hyperthermia duration or ideal timing of heating relative to TSL administration. The goal of this study was to determine changes in drug uptake when heating duration and timing are varied when combining TSL with radiofrequency ablation (RF) heating. METHODS We used computer models to simulate both RF tissue heating and TSL drug delivery, to calculate spatial drug concentration maps. We simulated heating for 5, 12 and 30 min for a single RF electrode, as well as three sequential 12 min ablations for 3 electrodes placed in a triangular array. To support simulation results, we performed porcine in vivo studies in normal liver, where TSL filled with doxorubicin (TSL-Dox) at a dose of 30 mg was infused over 30 min. Following infusion, RF heating was performed in separate liver locations for either 5 min (n = 2) or 12 min (n = 2). After ablation, the animal was euthanized, and liver extracted and frozen. Liver samples were cut orthogonal to the electrode axis, and fluorescence imaging was used to visualize tissue doxorubicin distribution. RESULTS Both in vivo studies and computer models demonstrate a ring-shaped drug deposition within ~1 cm of the visibly coagulated tissue. Drug uptake directly correlated with heating duration. In computer simulations, drug concentration increased by a factor of 2.2x and 4.3x when heating duration was extended from 5 to either 12, or 30 minutes, respectively. In vivo, drug concentration was by a factor of 2.4x higher at 12 vs 5 min heating duration (7.1 g/g to 3.0 g/g). The computer models suggest that heating should be timed to maximize area under the curve of systemic plasma concentration of encapsulated drug. CONCLUSIONS Both computer models and in vivo study demonstrate that tissue drug uptake directly correlates with heating duration for TSL based delivery. Computational models were able to predict the spatial drug delivery profile, and may serve as a valuable tool in understanding and optimizing drug delivery systems.","output":"Temperature sensitive liposomes combined with thermal ablation: Effects of duration and timing of heating in mathematical models and in vivo."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Daratumumab is approved for newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).

The association between chronic therapy with these medications and infection risk remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine the association between prior ACEI or ARB therapy and SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with hypertension in the U.S. Veteran's Affairs health system. METHODS: We compared the odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among three groups: patients treated with ACEI, treated with ARB, or treated with alternate first-line anti-hypertensives without ACEI/ARB. We excluded patients with alternate indications for ACEI or ARB therapy. We performed an augmented inverse propensity weighted analysis with adjustment for demographics, region, comorbidities, vitals, and laboratory values. RESULTS: Among 1,724,723 patients with treated hypertension, 659,180 were treated with ACEI, 310,651 with ARB, and 754,892 with neither. Before weighting, patients treated with ACEI or ARB were more likely to be diabetic and use more anti-hypertensives. There were 13,278 SARS-CoV-2 infections (0.8%) between February 12, 2020 and August 19, 2020. Patients treated with ACEI had lower odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; 95% CI: 0.89-0.97) while those treated with ARB had similar odds (OR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.96-1.07) compared with patients treated with alternate first-line anti-hypertensives without ACEI/ARB.

Evaluation of the integration process of the EAEUThe results of the integration process of the EAEU are as follows: first, the EAEU has created an institutional foundation as an economic integrator. Second, the EAEU has enacted new tariff laws and laid the foundation for creating a common market in finance, electricity, petroleum and petroleum products, gas, and transportation services. Third, the effect of the integration of EAEU began to emerge as GDP and trade volume increased since 2017 gradually. Fourth, the EAEU has signed free trade agreements or trade and economic treaties with several non-member countries. Notwithstanding these achievements, the limitations of the EAEU are as follows: first, the EAEU has structural limitations in functioning as a trans-national economic integrator. Second, due to the EAEUa?s low level of tariff harmonization, it remains in a a?limited customs union,a? and the complete single market of the EAEU has not yet been visible. Third, the limitations in Russiaa?s leadership have weakened the drive for the integration of the EAEU. Fourth, the protective features of the EAEU result in poor performance in economic integration.Considering these achievements and limitations of EAEU, the prospects for developing the integration process of the EAEU will be as follows: first, it is unlikely that the EAEU will be dissolved, but it is difficult for the EAEU to achieve a high level of economic integration. If the common market is fully operational, the government procurements could be activated, and macroeconomic stability could be maintained, and regional trade could be further promoted. Third, to strengthen the macroeconomic potential, it would be required of the enlargem nt of EU with securing new member states. South Korea is pushing for a a?New Northern Policya? to expand economic cooperation with the former Soviet countries. Therefore, the EAEU is believed to become a partner in developing and diversifying trade, and creating new growth engines for Korea.2. Strategy and measures for Korea-EAEU economic cooperation1) Korea-EAEU Economic Cooperation StrategyThis report proposes a private and market-driven strategy as the economic cooperation strategy between Korea and EAEU. It suggests identifying and supporting the industrial cooperation-focused areas in the current market, selecting and supporting future-oriented industrial cooperation, and promoting Korea-EAEU FTA.2) Cooperation plan in areas focused on industrial cooperation in the current marketKoreaa?s major export industries are already showing results in the market, including the EAEU vertical division (minerals, coke, oil, nuclear fuel, metals, etc.) and industries imported from other regions and consumed as domestic demand in both regions. In other words, market-led and private-led trade cooperation structures and systems are working, so they were selected as the focus areas for industrial cooperation in Chapter 3. The measures to strengthen industrial cooperation in these industrial groups are as follows: first, from the perspective of intergovernmental cooperation, the government should continue to work together to address the constraints of trade potential in both regions and institutionalize communication systems. Second, it is suggested to make efforts to reduce tariffs on Koreaa?s imports of EAEU and EAEUa?s imports of Korea. Third, it is recommended to implement projects to transfer export capabilities of EAEU countries, support projects to revitalize trade sources such as customs and strengthen market economy capabilities by utilizing existing ODA programs.3) Future-oriented industrial cooperation areas and cooperation measuresEAEU countries are currently facing the challenges of growing their economies through industrialization and fostering a digital economy and new industries in line with changes in the Fourth Industrial Revolution age. Korea, a country with already achieved industrialization, needs to strengthen industrial cooperation with EAEU countries for a cooperative partnership to grow small and medium-sized enterprises facing limitations in the domestic market. Besides, fostering the digital economy at the overall level of the EAEU is a critical task. By strengthening cooperation with leading countries within the EAEU, such as Russia, it is necessary to build a digital economy infrastructure and establish a collaborative industrial ecosystem in various fields in self-driving cars, artificial intelligence(AI), and the cloud. In the recent Covid 19 pandemic, cooperation in the medical and health sectors has become more critical than ever. Considering the high possibility of developing the medical system, medicine, and medical device markets in EAEU countries, the outlook for Korean medical institutionsa? management consulting, consignment management, and medical device and drug exports is bright.4) Strategies and cooperation measures for the Korea-EAEU FTAConsidering the environment of the two countriesa? industries, it is necessary to push for the Korea-EAEU FTA in a direction that benefits each other through phased discussions.According to a CGE study, the effect of the FTA will slightly increase Koreaa?s GDP, but the impact of each industry is different. If the Korea-EAEU FTA goes into effect, the damage to the Korean grain industry is the biggest, and it is expected to have a negative effect on the metal, electricity, electronics, and machinery industries, especially among the manufacturing sectors. On the other hand, it is expected to positively affect the meat, processed foods, and transportation equipment industries. As a result of analyzing the extent of the FTAa?s impact by dividing the service industry into wholesale and retail, transportation, health and welfare, and business services, the service industrya?s production is expected to increase in general. Among EAEU countries, Russia and Kyrgyzstana?s GDP increases, while Kazakhstan, Belarus, and Armeniaa?s GDP decrease. Industrial production in the manufacturing and service industries of EAEU countries is expected to decline, and precise cooperation measures in these areas need to be sought in future FTA or economic cooperation.Taken together, the two should seek ways to cooperate through the FTA, as the Korea-EAEU FTA has no unilaterally favorable results for only one country. In particular, cooperative relations between the two countries should be formed to boost technical support, new technology cooperation projects, and ODA in the highly competitive transportation equipment industry and minimize damage to particular industries in Korea.","output":"The Evaluation of the Integrating Process of the EAEU and the Economic Cooperation Strategy between Korea and EAEU"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To elucidate the impact of a hepatitis B (HB) vaccination program on the prevalence of HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and HB envelope antigen (HBeAg) as well as the success rate of HBeAg clearance among parturients, we collected data on parturients who gave birth between 2000 and 2010, and recorded the HB status postpartum of those with positive HBeAg before birth. A total of 8696 parturients were enrolled, of whom 113 with prenatal positive HBeAg were invited back. The prevalence of HBsAg decreased over the study period, particularly in the vaccinated cohort, while there was no change in the prevalence of HBeAg. Foreign parturients had a higher HBeAg-positive rate and delayed HBeAg clearance, and those with a higher body mass index (>24 kg/m(2)) had earlier HBeAg clearance (51.9% vs. 23.9%, p = 0.005). Only 30% of the subjects who were positive for HBeAg before birth became negative 5 years after delivery. In conclusion, the downward trend in HB infection with more significance among vaccinated parturients reflects effective prevention and the impact of universal HB immunization. Nonetheless, aggressive follow-up is necessary for parturients who are persistently positive for HBeAg postpartum, as well as developing different public health policies for foreign parturients from endemic areas.","output":"Changes in the Prevalence of HBsAg and HBeAg: a Study of 8696 Parturients in a Well Vaccinated Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires mass immunization to control the symptoms and global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

We performed a literature review and undertook semi-structured reflections on the current state of undergraduate surgical education across five countries: Egypt, Morocco, Somaliland, Kenya, and the UK. The main barriers to surgical education at medical school identified were (1) the lack of standardised surgical curricula with mandatory learning objectives and (2) the inadequacy of human resources for surgical education. COVID-19 has exacerbated these challenges by depleting the pool of surgical educators and reducing access to learning opportunities in clinical environments. To address the global need for a larger surgical workforce, specific attention must be paid to improving undergraduate surgical education.

The present review aims to provide an overview of the main unmet needs in asthma control and of the potential tools for overcoming the issue. Implementing a personalized medicine approach is essential, not only in terms of pharmacological treatments, biologic drugs or sophisticated biomarkers. In fact, exploring the complex profile of each patient, from his inflammation phenotype to his preferences and expectations, may help in filling the gap between the big potential of currently available treatments and the overall unsatisfactory asthma control. Telemedicine and e-health technologies may provide a strategy to both optimize disease assessment on a regular basis and enhance patients empowerment in managing their asthma.

In this study, we applied theories from Bourdieu to address the question, How was a partial and partisan scientific account of SARS-CoV-2 transmission constructed and maintained, leading to widespread imposition of infection control policies which de-emphasised airborne transmission?. Methods: From one international case study (the World Health Organisation) and four national ones (UK, Canada, USA and Japan), we selected a purposive sample of publicly available texts including scientific evidence summaries, guidelines, policy documents, public announcements, and social media postings. To analyse these, we applied Bourdieusian concepts of field, doxa, scientific capital, illusio, and game-playing. We explored in particular the links between scientific capital, vested interests, and policy influence. Results: Three fieldspolitical, state (policy and regulatory), and scientificwere particularly relevant to our analysis. Political and policy actors at international, national, and regional level alignedpredominantly though not invariablywith medical scientific orthodoxy which promoted the droplet theory of transmission and considered aerosol transmission unproven or of doubtful relevance. This dominant scientific sub-field centred around the clinical discipline of infectious disease control, in which leading actors were hospital clinicians aligned with the evidence-based medicine movement. Aerosol scientiststypically, chemists, and engineersrepresenting the heterodoxy were systematically excluded from key decision-making networks and committees. Dominant discourses defined these scientists ideas and methodologies as weak, their empirical findings as untrustworthy or insignificant, and their contributions to debate as unhelpful. Conclusion: The hegemonic grip of medical infection control discourse remains strong. Exit from the pandemic depends on science and policy finding a way to renegotiate what Bourdieu called the rules of the scientific gamewhat counts as evidence, quality, and rigour.","output":"Orthodoxy, illusio, and playing the scientific game: a Bourdieusian analysis of infection control science in the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic caused a marked increase in admissions to intensive care units.

Early diagnostics enable a timely noninvasive ventilation treatment and can prevent overt ventilatory failure and avoid acute invasive ventilation. Diagnostic measures are available, so that the risk of developing overt respiratory failure can be ascertained in time. Treatment of respiratory pump insufficiency, i.e. ventilatory insufficiency, is also established. Many patients with ventilatory insufficiency use intermittent or continuous ventilation every day in order to relieve the respiratory musculature. Many studies have confirmed an extension of life expectancy and a better quality of life, when this relief together with a lowering of the pCO2 is achieved under ventilation and more importantly while breathing spontaneously. If the target of lowering the pCO2 is not achieved, an effect of intermittent ventilation cannot be detected. The more severe the disease, the more difficult it is to achieve relief, because the substantial effort needed for breathing by the patient can hardly be relieved by assisted ventilation alone. The relief is always guaranteed by a total passive mechanical ventilation below the apnea threshold so that the patient does not need to independently breathe. A high tidal volume, an adequately high respiratory rate and a prolonged inspiration time are necessary in order to reduce the pCO2 to below the normal range and to induce passive ventilation.

The programme aims to address exclusion from access to health services by generating and acting on research evidence of practical, local relevance. METHODS: Drawing on existing links in the provincial and national health systems and applying rapid, participatory evaluation techniques, we evaluated the first action-learning cycle of the VAPAR programme (2017C19). We collected data in three phases: (1) 10 individual interviews with programme stakeholders, including from government departments and parastatals, nongovernmental organizations and local communities; (2) an evaluative/exploratory workshop with provincial and district Department of Health managers; and (3) feedback and discussion of findings during an interactive workshop with national child health experts. RESULTS: Individual programme stakeholders described early outcomes relating to effective research and stakeholder engagement, and organization and delivery of services, with potential further contributions to the establishment of an evidence base for local policy and planning, and improved health outcomes. These outcomes were verified with provincial managers. Provincial and national stakeholders identified the potential for VAPAR to support engagement between communities and health authorities for collective planning and implementation of services. Provincial stakeholders proposed that this could be achieved through a two-way integration, with VAPAR stakeholders participating in routine health planning and review activities and frontline health officials being involved in the VAPAR process. Findings were collated into a revised theory of change. CONCLUSIONS: The VAPAR learning platform was regarded as a feasible, acceptable and relevant approach to facilitate cooperative learning and community participation in health systems. The evaluation provides support for a collaborative learning platform within routine health system processes and contributes to the limited evaluative evidence base on embedded health systems research.","output":"Collective reflections on the first cycle of a collaborative learning platform to strengthen rural primary healthcare in Mpumalanga, South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing crisis of COVID-19 pandemic that swept across the world, poses serious challenges on health delivery systems particularly in developing countries.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective quantification of aerosol generation during office\\\\based nasal endoscopy procedures. METHODS: Using an optical particle sizer, airborne particles concentrations 0.3 to 10 microns in diameter, were measured during 30 nasal endoscopies in the clinic setting. Measurements were taken at time points throughout diagnostic and debridement endoscopies and compared to preprocedure and empty room particle concentrations. RESULTS: No significant change in airborne particle concentrations was measured during diagnostic nasal endoscopies in patients without the need for debridement. However, significant increases in mean particle concentration compared to preprocedure levels were measured during cold instrumentation at 2,462 particles/foot(3) (95% CI 837 to 4,088; P = .005) and during suction use at 2,973 particle/foot(3) (95% CI 1,419 to 4,529; P = .001). In total, 99.2% of all measured particles were 1 m in diameter. CONCLUSION: When measured with an optical particle sizer, diagnostic nasal endoscopy with a rigid endoscope is not associated with increased particle aerosolization in patient for whom sinonasal debridement is not needed. In patients needing sinonasal debridement, endonasal cold and suction instrumentation were associated with increased particle aerosolization, with a trend observed during endoscope use prior to tissue manipulation. Endonasal debridement may potentially pose a higher risk for aerosolization and SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 transmission.

COVID-19 also caused the overwhelming majority of information workers to rapidly shift to working from home (WFH). The central question this work addresses is: can we isolate the effects of WFH on information workers' collaboration activities from all other factors, especially the other effects of COVID-19? This is important because in the future, WFH will likely to be more common than it was prior to the pandemic. We use difference-in-differences (DiD), a causal identification strategy commonly used in the social sciences, to control for unobserved confounding factors and estimate the causal effect of WFH. Our analysis relies on measuring the difference in changes between those who WFH prior to COVID-19 and those who did not. Our preliminary results suggest that on average, people spent more time on collaboration in April (Post WFH mandate) than in February (Pre WFH mandate), but this is primarily due to factors other than WFH, such as lockdowns during the pandemic. The change attributable to WFH specifically is in the opposite direction: less time on collaboration and more focus time. This reversal shows the importance of using causal inference: a simple analysis would have resulted in the wrong conclusion. We further find that the effect of WFH is moderated by individual remote collaboration experience prior to WFH. Meanwhile, the medium for collaboration has also shifted due to WFH: instant messages were used more, whereas scheduled meetings were used less. We discuss design implications -- how future WFH may affect focused work, collaborative work, and creative work.","output":"How Work From Home Affects Collaboration: A Large-Scale Study of Information Workers in a Natural Experiment During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Fisheries are among the sectors hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) crisis due to the sudden decrease in the demand for seafood This study employs demand-driven and supply-driven input-output models to conduct an economy-wide assessment of the contraction of the fisheries activities in Cyprus, as well as a questionnaire survey to reveal fishermen&rsquo;s perceptions of COVID-19 crisis impacts The results at the macroeconomic level reveal that the contraction in the economic output of the fisheries sector does not have any significant impact on the wider economy due to the small size of the sector However, the COVID-19 crisis has major negative effects on fishermen&rsquo;s income and the livelihoods of fishers&rsquo;households The average gross margin of the interviewed fishermen for March 2020, i e , the month where a national quarantine and lockdown was imposed, was four times less the average monthly gross margin for the winter period (December 2019&ndash;February 2020) and 2 5 times less compared to the average monthly gross margin of 2019 The recessionary impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in conjunction with the chronic challenges that fisheries are currently facing in Cyprus, negatively affect the viability of the sector","output":"Economic Consequences of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) on Fisheries in the Eastern Mediterranean (Cyprus)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study presents a methodology to reveal traces of viral particles, as aerosol with known chemical and molecular structure, in a sample by means of photon and electron interactions.

The multivariable odds ratios (95% CIs) for high W_F_C in those with high vs low work demands, job control, social support at work, and family were 4.11 (2.89C7.03), 0.0 (0.66C0.90), 0.86 (0.62C0.98), and 0.74 (0.59C0.94), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Work and family situational factors were the most significant antecedents of the levels of W_F_C in Egyptian civil workers. The Egyptian authorities could reduce the civil workers W_F_C by improving the work environment, finding ways to relieve the workload demands, and helping the civil workers to have more job control and social support.","output":"Antecedents of workCfamily conflict among Egyptian civil workers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To measure temporal trends in survival over time in people with severe coronavirus disease 2019 requiring critical care (high dependency unit or ICU) management, and to assess whether temporal variation in mortality was explained by changes in patient demographics and comorbidity burden over time. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort; based on data reported to the COVID-19 Hospitalisation in England Surveillance System. The primary outcome was in-hospital 30-day all-cause mortality. Unadjusted survival was estimated by calendar week of admission, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted survival, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, major comorbidities, and geographical region. SETTING: One hundred eight English critical care units. PATIENTS: All adult (18 yr +) coronavirus disease 2019 specific critical care admissions between March 1, 2020, and June 27, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one thousand eighty-two critical care patients (high dependency unit n = 15,367; ICU n = 5,715) were included. Unadjusted survival at 30 days was lowest for people admitted in late March in both high dependency unit (71.6% survival) and ICU (58.0% survival). By the end of June, survival had improved to 92.7% in high dependency unit and 80.4% in ICU. Improvements in survival remained after adjustment for patient characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, and major comorbidities) and geographical region. CONCLUSIONS: There has been a substantial improvement in survival amongst people admitted to critical care with coronavirus disease 2019 in England, with markedly higher survival rates in people admitted in May and June compared with those admitted in March and April. Our analysis suggests this improvement is not due to temporal changes in the age, sex, ethnicity, or major comorbidity burden of admitted patients.","output":"Improving Survival of Critical Care Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in England: A National Cohort Study, March to June 2020*"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Testing for active SARS-CoV-2 infections is key to controlling the spread of the virus and preventing severe disease. A central public health challenge is defining test allocation strategies in the presence of limited resource and/or multiple competing test options. In this paper, we provide a mathematical framework for defining an optimal strategy for allocating viral tests. The framework accounts for imperfect test results, testing in certain high-risk patient populations, practical constraints in terms of budget and/or total number of available tests, and the goal of testing. In our proposed approach, tests can be allocated across population strata defined by symptom severity and other patient characteristics, allowing the test allocation plan to prioritize higher risk patient populations. We extend our proposed method to address the challenge of allocating two different types of tests with different cost and accuracy (for example the expensive but more accurate RT-PCR test versus the cheap but less accurate rapid antigen test), administered under budget constraints. We provide a R Shiny web application allowing users to explore test allocation strategies across a variety of pandemic scenarios. This work can serve as a useful tool for guiding public health decision-making at a community level, adapted to different stages of the pandemic.

These disruptions are expected to be of a large scale, such as the disaster of September 11, only 5% of the time; more often than not, disruptions are minor and on a much smaller scale. These smaller disruptions may be due to short-term power outages, fires, disk drive failures, or computer viruses. Regardless, the firm must make a plan based on a thorough analysis of all scenarios that may affect its normal working, and create and test contingency and recovery measures for such situations. This chapter discusses the salient parts of a BCP, which constitutes a strategy for recovering from sudden and unexpected disruption of critical business functionalities. Business continuity and disaster recovery became more important after the occurrence of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, which led to widespread failure in financial systems. Developing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan requires setting aside resources and treating the development of the plan as a project for the firm. Once the analysis has been conducted and strategies have been formulated, the plan must be tested using simulated emergency scenarios. These scenarios are also important when it comes to industry-wide testing, which has become more of a focus recently as firms in financial sectors across the world become more deeply interlinked. While it is crucial for each firm to have its own business continuity plan, it is just as important for the industry as a whole to protect its infrastructure, since systems of each firm are intricately linked together in an STP environment.","output":"Chapter 9 Business Continuity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung ultrasound (US) imaging has the potential to be an effective point-of-care test for detection of COVID-19, due to its ease of operation with minimal personal protection equipment along with easy disinfection.

Recent reports suggest that ACE2, which is the target protein to invade the host, has a ubiquitous presence in human organs, including lung parenchyma, gastrointestinal tract, nasal mucosa, renal and urinary tract, airway epithelia, lymphoid tissues, reproductive organs, vascular endothelium and neurons. In this scenario, neurologists are particularly involved into considering even more specific therapeutic strategies according to the available data during the pandemic. In particular, MS patients are usually receiving disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) with immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory effects, which increase the risk of infections and morbidity, compared with the general population.

Working persons accounted for 52% of the respondents, while 38.1% were hired workers. Two standardized (0-100 pts) indices were defined. The level of mental health symptoms index (LMHSI) concerned the incidence of 4 problems within the past 2 months, whereas the change in mental health symptoms index (CMHSI) concerned the degree of mental health deterioration. RESULTS: The mean value of LMHSI was 40.91 (SD = 26.97), and that of CMHSI 60.51 (SD = 23.97). In both cases, a worse assessment was obtained among women than among men. In the group of working respondents, the least advantageous results were found among those who worked casually or under a commission contract.

Thus, this concept goes beyond the video-based formats of the examination course. Optimization: During the course, we performed online evaluations to ensure an immediate feedback from the students. This enabled us to implement ongoing changes that had a positive impact on the course format, for example using better equipment to ensure a better video and audio quality. In the future, we hope to create a clinic's own online channel to further increase data security.","output":"Neurological examination course in an interactive webinar as a solution during a pandemic.

CR3022 targets a highly conserved epitope, distal from the receptor-binding site, that enables cross-reactive binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

We evaluated 6923 patients with COVID-19 at six New York City hospitals from March 15-May 14, 2020, corresponding with the implementation of public health interventions in March. We assessed changes in cycle threshold (C(T)) values from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests and in-hospital mortality and modeled the impact of viral load on mortality. Mean C(T) values increased between March and May, with the proportion of patients with high viral load decreasing from 47.7% to 7.8%. In-hospital mortality increased from 14.9% in March to 28.4% in early April, and then decreased to 8.7% by May. Patients with high viral loads had increased mortality compared to those with low viral loads (adjusted odds ratio 2.34). If viral load had not declined, an estimated 69 additional deaths would have occurred (5.8% higher mortality).

To examine the prevalence of general anxiety among Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students and the role of academic distress and family distress in causing general anxiety.Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among first, second, and third year PharmD students. All students received an online survey consisting of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-62 (CCAPS-62) questionnaire and sample characteristics. Variables from CCAPS-62 considered in this study included academic distress and family distress measured on a three-level scale: no, low, and high clinical level. Data on gender, race, work status, and physical activity were also collected. Descriptive and multinomial logistic regression were conducted to identify factors associated with general anxiety.Results. Of the 238 students who took the online survey (63% response rate), the majority were female (67%) and Asian (49%). Overall, 69 first year, 75 second year, and 94 third year students participated. The prevalence of general anxiety was 50%, with equal distribution (25% each) among high-clinical and low-clinical general anxiety groups. High academic distress and high family distress were associated with a greater probability of a student having high general anxiety.Conclusion. General anxiety was quite prevalent among pharmacy students. Identification and implementation of strategies to lower general anxiety as well as academic distress is of great importance.

METHOD: A UV lamp (PADNUT 38 W, 253 nm UV-C light tube) and UV-C dosimeter (GENERAL UV-C Digital Light Meter No. UV512C) were used to measure irradiance throughout the inner bore of a CT scanner gantry. Irradiance (units W/cm2 ) was related to the time required to achieve 6-log viral kill (10-6 survival fraction). RESULTS: A warm-up time of ~120 s was required for the lamp to reach stable irradiance. Irradiance at the scan plane (z = 0 cm) of the CT scanner was 580.9 W/cm2 , reducing to ~350 W/cm2 at z = 20 cm toward the front or back of the gantry. The angular distribution of irradiation was uniform within 10% coefficient of variation. A conservative estimate suggests at least 6-log kill (survival fraction &#8804; 10-6 ) of viral RNA within 20 cm of the scan plane with an irradiation time of 120 s from cold start. More conservatively, running the lamp for 180 s (3 min) or 300 s (5 min) from cold start is estimated to yield survival fraction <<10-7 survival fraction within 20 cm of the scan plane. CONCLUSION: Ultraviolet irradiation of the inner bore of the CT gantry can be achieved with a simple UV-C lamp attached to the CT couch. Such practice could augment manual wipe-down procedures, improve safety for CT technologists or housekeeping staff, and could potentially reduce turnover time between scanning sessions.","output":"Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation of the inner bore of a CT gantry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Environmental exposure of people plays an important role in assessing the quality of human life.

The infection commonly starts in the upper respiratory tract (URT) but can migrate to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and other organs, often with severe consequences. Whereas LRT infection can lead to shedding of virus via breath and cough droplets, URT infection enables shedding via abundant speech droplets. Their viral load can be high in carriers with mild or no symptoms, an observation linked to the abundance of SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cells in the oral cavity epithelium. Expelled droplets rapidly lose water through evaporation, with the smaller ones transforming into long-lived aerosol. Although the largest speech droplets can carry more virions, they are few in number, fall to the ground rapidly and therefore play a relatively minor role in transmission. Of more concern is small speech aerosol, which can descend deep into the LRT and cause severe disease. However, since their total volume is small, the amount of virus they carry is low. Nevertheless, in closed environments with inadequate ventilation, they can accumulate, which elevates the risk of direct LRT infection. Of most concern is the large fraction of speech aerosol that is intermediate-sized because it remains suspended in air for minutes and can be transported over considerable distances by convective air currents. The abundance of this speech-generated aerosol, combined with its high viral load in pre- and asymptomatic individuals, strongly implicates airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through speech as the primary contributor to its rapid spread.","output":"Breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing: What drives transmission of SARS-CoV-2?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The 2019 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic continued into 2020, and the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) associated death toll increased. OBJECTIVES To analyze COVID-19 death rates in European countries or regions to determine whether there was a significant association between bacillus Calmette-Gurin (BCG) vaccination policy and lower rates of COVID-19 related deaths. METHODS Certain Northern European countries or regions had low death rates regardless of BCG policy. The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables. RESULTS Using least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P < 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm. CONCLUSIONS The results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19.

Methods: In this review, our searching was performed on international databases of Embase, ScienceDirect, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science (ISI) from October 2019 to June 2020. Results: Most patients infected with COVID-19 have mild symptoms. Approximately 15% of patients have severe pneumonia, and about 5% acute distress syndrome or organ failure. In the absence of definitive treatment and vaccines, the most effective measure is to prevent infection, particularly in those at high risk of taking the severe form of the disease with adverse outcomes. Pharmacotherapy is essentially supportive;the role of antiviral agents is yet to be established. The commonest drugs used in treating this viral disease are tocilizumab, remdesivir, favipiravir, and camostat mesilate. Also, drugs related to malaria, AIDS, and Ebola, such as hydroxychloroquine, are widely used. Based on physical examinations alone, it is impossible to comment with certainty in mild cases of the disease. Accordingly, a wide range of methods is used for diagnosing and treating the disease.

Currently, there is no specific drug or vaccine against this deadly virus; therefore, there is a pressing need to understand the mechanism(s) through which this virus enters the host cell. Viral entry into the host cell is a multistep process in which SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein to recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the human cells; this initiates host-cell entry by promoting viralChost cell membrane fusion through large-scale conformational changes in the S protein. Receptor recognition and fusion are critical and essential steps of viral infections and are key determinants of the viral host range and cross-species transmission.

Objective: To quantify and compare SARS-CoV2 copies in the NPS, WMF and RD samples, and correlate with disease severity. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Tertiary care multispeciality hospital with limited resources in a low to middle income country. Participants: Eighty suspected COVID-19 patients were recruited from the COVID-19 out patient clinic and hospital isolation wards. Intervention: Concurrent NPS, WMF and RD samples were collected from all the recruited patients and tested for SARS-CoV2 copies by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR). Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome was COVID-19 measured by SARS-CoV2 quantitative RT PCR in NPS samples. COVID-19 disease severity was determined according to NIH criteria. Virus shedding was defined as the presence of SARS-CoV2 copies in the WMF and RD samples. Results: SARS-CoV2 was detected in 55/80 (69%) of the NPS samples. Of these 55, WMF and RD samples were positive in 44 (80%) and 17 (31%), respectively. The concordance of WMF with NPS was 84% (p=0.02).

The relatively large files require additional files, beyond the scope of the original format, to identify sequences and to provide random access. Multiple compressors have been developed to archive FASTA files back and forth, but these lack direct access to targeted content or metadata of the archive. Moreover, these solutions are not directly backwards compatible to FASTA files, resulting in limited software integration. RESULTS: We designed a linux based toolkit that virtualises the content of DNA, RNA and protein FASTA archives into the filesystem by using filesystem in userspace. This guarantees in-sync virtualised metadata files and offers fast random-access decompression using bit encodings plus Zstandard (zstd). The toolkit, FASTAFS, can track all its system-wide running instances, allows file integrity verification and can provide, instantly, scriptable access to sequence files and is easy to use and deploy. The file compression ratios were comparable but not superior to other state of the art archival tools, despite the innovative random access feature implemented in FASTAFS. CONCLUSIONS: FASTAFS is a user-friendly and easy to deploy backwards compatible generic purpose solution to store and access compressed FASTA files, since it offers file system access to FASTA files as well as in-sync metadata files through file virtualisation. Using virtual filesystems as in-between layer offers format conversion without the need to rewrite code into different programming languages while preserving compatibility.

Such immune responses become further dysregulated by the increased and prolonged pro-inflammatory cytokine suppression of pineal melatonin production coupled to increased gut dysbiosis and gut permeability. The suppression of pineal melatonin and gut microbiome-derived butyrate, coupled to an increase in circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) further dysregulates the immune response. The AhR mediates its effects via alterations in the regulation of mitochondrial function in immune cells. The increased risk of severe/fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection by high risk conditions, such as elderly age, obesity, and diabetes are mediated by these conditions having expression levels of melatonin, AhR, butyrate, and LPS that are closer to those driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection. This has a number of future research and treatment implications, including the utilization of melatonin and nutraceuticals that inhibit the AhR, including the polyphenols, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and resveratrol.","output":"Tryptophan Metabolites and Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pathophysiology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Studies comparing SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in the upper respiratory tract (URT) between children and adults, either presenting with COVID-19 or asymptomatic have yielded inconsistent results. Here, we conducted a retrospective, single center study to address this issue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 1,184 consecutive subjects (256 children and 928 adults) testing positive for SARS-COV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal exudates (NP), of whom 424 (121 children and 303 adults) had COVID-19 and 760 (135 children and 625 adults) were asymptomatic close contacts of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA testing was carried out using the TaqPath COVID-19 Combo Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MS, USA). The AMPLIRUN? TOTAL SARS-CoV-2 RNA Control (Vircell SA, Granada, Spain) was used for estimating SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads (in copies/mL). SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads at the time of laboratory diagnosis (single specimen/patient) were used for comparison purposes. RESULTS: Median initial SARS-COV-2 RNA load was lower (P=0.094) in children (6.98 log(10) copies/ml; range, 3.0-11.7) than in adults (7.14 log(10) copies/ml; range, 2.2.-13.4) with COVID-19. As for asymptomatic individuals, median SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was comparable (P=0.97) in children (6.20 log(10) copies/ml; range, 1.8-11.6) and adults (6.48 log(10) copies/ml; range, 1.9-11.8). Children with COVID-19 symptoms displayed SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads (6.98 log(10) copies/ml; range, 3.0-11.7) comparable to their asymptomatic counterparts (6.20 log(10) copies/ml; range, 1.8-11.6) (P=0.61). Meanwhile in adults, median SARS-CoV-2 RNA load was significantly higher in symptomatic (7.14 log(10) copies/ml; range, 2.2.-13.4) than in asymptomatic subjects (6.48 log(10) copies/ml; range, 1.9-11.8) (P=<0.001). Overall, a faster URT SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance rate was observed in children than in adults. CONCLUSIONS: Based on viral load data at the time of diagnosis, our results suggested that SARS-CoV-2 infected children, with or without COVID-19, may display NP viral loads of comparable magnitude to that found in their adult counterparts; However, children may have shorter viral shedding as compared to adults.","output":"Upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 RNA loads in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to impose movement restrictions on their citizens. Although critical to reducing the virus' reproduction rate, these restrictions come with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers currently working from home. Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal study ($N~=~192$), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological factors that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include anxiety, distractions, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and work motivation. This design allowed us to identify those variables that explain unique variance in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively, and stress predicted an individual's well-being negatively when controlling for other variables consistently across both waves; (2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively; (3) productivity was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time two compared to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time; and (4) the longitudinal study did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained variance in well-being and productivity. Our study can assess the effectiveness of current work-from-home and general well-being and productivity support guidelines and provide tailored insights for software professionals.","output":"Predictors of Well-being and Productivity among Software Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic -- A Longitudinal Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More than half of patients who recover from COVID-19 experience fatigue. We studied fatigue using neuropsychological and neurophysiological investigations in post-COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects. Neuropsychological assessment included: Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fatigue Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Apathy Evaluation Scale, cognitive tests, and computerized tasks. Neurophysiological examination was assessed before (PRE) and 2 min after (POST) a 1-min fatiguing isometric pinching task and included: maximum compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude in first dorsal interosseous muscle (FDI) following ulnar nerve stimulation, resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and silent period (SP) duration in right FDI following transcranial magnetic stimulation of the left motor cortex. Maximum pinch strength was measured. Perceived exertion was assessed with the Borg-Category-Ratio scale. Patients manifested fatigue, apathy, executive deficits, impaired cognitive control, and reduction in global cognition. Perceived exertion was higher in patients. CMAP and MEP were smaller in patients both PRE and POST. CMAP did not change in either group from PRE to POST, while MEP amplitudes declined in controls POST. SP duration did not differ between groups PRE, increased in controls but decreased in patients POST. Patients' change of SP duration from PRE to POST was negatively correlated to FSS. Abnormal SP shortening and lack of MEP depression concur with a reduction in post-exhaustion corticomotor inhibition, suggesting a possible GABAB-ergic dysfunction. This impairment might be related to the neuropsychological alterations.

A pilot trial has demonstrated that improved blood pressure control, achevied via self-management during the puerperium, was associated with lower blood pressure 3-4 years postpartum. Physician Optimised Post-partum Hypertension Treatment (POP-HT) will formally evaluate whether improved blood pressure control in the puerperium results in lower blood pressure at 6 months post partum, and improvements in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular phenotypes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: POP-HT is an open-label, parallel arm, randomised controlled trial involving 200 women aged 18 years or over, with a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension, and requiring antihypertensive medication at discharge. Women are recruited by open recruitment and direct invitation around time of delivery and randomised 1:1 to, either an intervention comprising physician-optimised self-management of postpartum blood pressure or, usual care. Women in the intervention group upload blood pressure readings to a smartphone app that provides algorithm-driven individualised medication-titration. Medication changes are approved by physicians, who review blood pressure readings remotely. Women in the control arm follow assessment and medication adjustment by their usual healthcare team. The primary outcome is 24-hour average ambulatory diastolic blood pressure at 6C9 months post partum. Secondary outcomes include: additional blood pressure parameters at baseline, week 1 and week 6; multimodal cardiovascular assessments (CMR and echocardiography); parameters derived from multiorgan MRI including brain and kidneys; peripheral macrovascular and microvascular measures; angiogenic profile measures taken from blood samples and levels of endothelial circulating and cellular biomarkers; and objective physical activity monitoring and exercise assessment. An additional 20 women will be recruited after a normotensive pregnancy as a comparator group for endothelial cellular biomarkers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: IRAS PROJECT ID 273353.

An aberrant inflammatory response and impaired respiratory function have been suggested as underlying mechanisms. We investigated whether obesity is associated with differences in inflammatory, respiratory, and clinical outcome parameters in critically ill COVID-19 patients. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixty-seven COVID-19 ICU patients were divided into obese (BMI  30 kg/m(2), n = 18, 72% class I obesity, 28% class II obesity) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m(2), n = 49) groups. Concentrations of circulating interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), interferon gamma (IFN-), interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) were determined from ICU admission until 10 days afterward, and routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected. RESULTS: BMI was 32.6 [31.2C34.5] and 26.0 [24.4C27.7] kg/m(2) in the obese and non-obese group, respectively. Apart from temperature, which was significantly lower in obese patients (38.1 [36.9C38.9] vs. 38.7 [38.0 ?39.5] C, p = 0.02), there were no between-group differences on ICU admission. Plasma cytokine concentrations declined over time (p < 0.05 for all), but no differences between obese and non-obese patients were observed. Also, BMI did not correlate with the cytokine response (IL-6 r = 0.09, p = 0.61, TNF- r = 0.03, p = 0.99, IP-10 r = 0.28, p = 0.11). The kinetics of clinical inflammatory parameters and respiratory mechanics were also similar in both groups. Finally, no differences in time on ventilator, ICU length of stay or 40-day mortality between obese and non-obese patients were apparent.

Initially, the major proportion of virus-infected cases (i.e. about 99%) was reported in China and now it is being reported in other counties as well. Humans begin to be infected within their communities and transmittance of the viral epidemic increased rapidly due to lack of understanding of its transmission routes and precautionary measures. The existence of SARS-CoV-2 in China threatened the population greatly due to the high incidence of fatal respiratory infections. Current investigations speculated that this virus transferred into a human from viral-infected bats. However, the process of interspecies viral transmission is an important scientific question to be addressed. Due to the continuous increase in the patients infected with COVID-19 associated pneumonia, the World Health Organization (WHO) has included this viral epidemic to the priority list of diseases. Therefore, accelerated research developments are required to control the spread of this outbreak, as it is declared as a public health emergency by WHO especially in the absence of efficacious drugs and vaccines.

From the stability analysis of the model, it is shown that if the social distancing is practiced by the large number of susceptible population, then the disease will not spread, and it may eventually die out. Further, it is derived from the analysis of the model that if most of the infected populations are isolated or quarantined, then the spread of the disease can be eventually controlled. However, from the analysis of the model, it is observed that if there is constant immigration of asymptomatic infected persons, then the disease will continue to spread and will remain pandemic.

Materials and Methods: The change in perceptions and patterns of PPE use throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was studied in detail through interviews conducted among 15 key informants, and the data were analyzed using health belief model in our study. Results: A health belief model explains the trajectory of PPE use by otorhinolaryngology health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The course of usage of PPE by otorhinolaryngology health-care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic was explained through the health belief model. During the initial days of the COVID-19 pandemic, intense perceived severity and susceptibility to COVID infection led to PPE use, and otorhinolaryngology HCWs resorted to higher grade PPEs which gave optimal protection; but in course of time with a better understanding of the natural course of illness, minimal PPEs without compromising HCW safety were used with minimal discomfort. Perceived severity of COVID infection on self and family, health knowledge, influence of peers, and support from the institution encouraged them in using PPEs. Conclusion: We found that various aspects of health belief model such as the perceived susceptibility, perceived severity of the disease, perceived barriers and benefits in PPE use, self-efficacy, health-related knowledge, and the cues to action influence PPE use among otorhinolaryngology HCWs.

We have since created a more expanded and operational framework Mhealth Index and Navigation Database (MIND) that aligns with the APA categories but includes objective and auditable questions (105). We sought to survey the existing space, conducting a review of all mobile health app evaluation frameworks published since 2018, and demonstrate the comprehensiveness of this new model by comparing it to existing and emerging frameworks. DESIGN: We conducted a scoping review of mobile health app evaluation frameworks. DATA SOURCES: References were identified through searches of PubMed, EMBASE and PsychINFO with publication date between January 2018 and October 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Papers were selected for inclusion if they meet the predetermined eligibility criteriapresenting an evaluation framework for mobile health apps with patient, clinician or end user-facing questions. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers screened the literature separately and applied the inclusion criteria. The data extracted from the papers included: author and dates of publication, source affiliation, country of origin, name of framework, study design, description of framework, intended audience/user and framework scoring system. We then compiled a collection of more than 1701 questions across 79 frameworks. We compared and grouped these questions using the MIND framework as a reference. We sought to identify the most common domains of evaluation while assessing the comprehensiveness and flexibilityas well as any potential gapsof MIND. RESULTS: New app evaluation frameworks continue to emerge and expand. Since our 2019 review of the app evaluation framework space, more frameworks include questions around privacy (43) and clinical foundation (57), reflecting an increased focus on issues of app security and evidence base. The majority of mapped frameworks overlapped with at least half of the MIND categories. The results of this search have informed a database (apps.digitalpsych.org) that users can access today.

Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to December 30, 2020. Search items included SARS-CoV-2, Coronavirus, COVID-19, and liver injury. Results: We included 22 related articles. Among included studies, there was five case report, five case series, four randomizes control trial (RCT), seven cohort studies, and one cross-sectional study. The drugs included in this systematic review were remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir/ritonavir. Among included studies, some studies revealed a direct role of drugs, while others couldn't certainly confirm that the liver injury was due to SARS-CoV-2 itself or administration of medications. However, a significant number of studies reported that liver injury could be attributable to drug administration. Discussion: Liver injury in COVID-19 patients could be caused by the virus itself or the administration of some types of drug.

METHODS: In addition to the kit iQC materials, supplemental quality indicators were integrated in a total quality assurance (QA) program: patient-derived iQC's samples (negative, 1/160 fine speckled and 1/160 homogeneous), median sample FI per run and percentage of ANA IIF positive samples per run.Analytical rejection criteria were based on the imprecision of the positivity index (PI) measure of the Zenit PRO system (Menarini). Clinical rejection criteria were based on changes in FI that correspond to a change in ANA IIF titer of &#8805;2. To evaluate the QA program, different artificial errors were introduced during the ANA IIF process. After every run, quality indicators were evaluated and compared to the pre-set target values. RESULTS: Rescanning the ANA IIF slides five times, using an old conjugate and a needle obstruction resulted in analytically and even clinically relevant errors in ANA IIF results. All errors were correctly detected by the different defined quality indicators.

However, it is unclear how TCR-T cells are affected by PD-L1 molecule in the tumor environment. We performed an in-depth evaluation on how differential expressions of tumor PD-L1 can affect the functionality of T cells. Methods: We used MART-1-specific TCR-T cells (TCR-T(MART-1)), stimulated with MART-1(27-35) peptide-loaded MEL-526 tumor cells, expressing different proportions of PD-L1, to perform cellular assays and high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: Different clusters of activated or cytotoxic TCR-T(MART-1) responded divergently when stimulated with tumor cells expressing different percentages of PD-L1 expression. Compared to control T cells, TCR-T(MART-1) were more sensitive to exhaustion, and secreted not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also anti-inflammatory cytokines with increasing proportions of PD-L1(+) tumor cells. The gene profiles of chemokines were modified by increased expression of tumor PD-L1, which concurrently downregulated pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory transcription factors. Furthermore, increased expression of tumor PD-L1 showed distinct effects on different inhibitory checkpoint molecules (ICMs). In addition, there was a limited correlation between the enrichment of cell death signaling in tumor cells and T cells and increased tumor PD-L1 expression. Conclusion: Overall, though the effector functionality of TCR-T cells was suppressed by increased expression percentages of tumor PD-L1 in vitro, scRNA-seq profiles revealed that both the anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory responses were triggered by a higher expression of tumor PD-L1. This suggests that the sole blockade of tumor PD-L1 might inhibit not only the anti-inflammatory response but also the pro-inflammatory response in the complicated tumor microenvironment. Thus, the outcome of PD-L1 intervention may depend on the final balance among the highly dynamic and heterogeneous immune regulatory circuits.","output":"Single-cell transcriptome analysis of the heterogeneous effects of differential expression of tumor PD-L1 on responding TCR-T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical devices needed during the COVID-19 pandemic were widely reported in early 2020.

This energy-allocation role is especially salient during physical activity, when skeletal muscle releases large amounts of IL-6. We predict that during bouts of physical activity, myokine IL-6 fulfills the three main characteristics of a short-term energy allocator: it is secreted from muscle in response to an energy deficit, it liberates somatic energy through lipolysis and it enhances muscular energy uptake and transiently downregulates immune function. We then extend this model of energy allocation beyond myokine IL-6 to reinterpret the roles that IL-6 plays in chronic inflammation, as well as during COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation and multiorgan failure.","output":"Interleukin 6 as an energy allocator in muscle tissue"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Preoperative assessment of geriatric-specific determinants of health may enhance perioperative risk stratification among elderly patients.

Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods under the UDA setting. In particular, we propose selecting models whose predictions of interventions' effects satisfy known causal structures in the target domain.

High rates of reproduction and dispersal, extreme polyphagy, and development of insecticide resistance, together with human activities, have made these insects global pests. These supervectors transmit a diversity of plant viruses by different mechanisms and mediate virus emergence through local evolution, host shifts, mixed infections, and global spread. Associated virus evolution involves reassortment, recombination, and component capture. Emergence of B. tabaci-transmitted geminiviruses (begomoviruses), ipomoviruses, and torradoviruses has led to global disease outbreaks as well as multiple paradigm shifts. Similarly, F. occidentalis has mediated tospovirus host shifts and global dissemination and the emergence of pollen-transmitted ilarviruses.

However, it remains unclear whether revascularisation should be performed at the index procedure or at a later stage. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) Guided Multivessel Revascularisation During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Acute Myocardial Infarction trial is a multicentre, randomised controlled prospective open-label trial with blinded evaluation of endpoints. After successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), eligible STEMI patients with residual non-culprit lesions are randomised, to instantaneous wave-free ratio guided treatment of non-culprit lesions during the index procedure versus deferred cardiac MR-guided management within 4 days to 6 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is the combined occurrence of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction and hospitalisation for heart failure at 12 months follow-up. Clinical follow-up includes questionnaires at 3 months and outpatient visits at 6 months and 12 months after primary PCI. Furthermore, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed.

While clinical trial data demonstrated reductions in hospitalization rate, real-world data at the time of approval was vastly limited. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of non-hospitalized patients who received either BAM or CAS-IMD from November 27(th), 2020 to February 16(th), 2021. Variables included timing of monoclonal antibody infusion, adverse events, and 30-day hospitalization rate. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all data. RESULTS: 101 patients received either BAM (75.2%) or CAS-IMD (24.8%) at a median of 6 days (IQR 4-7) from reported symptom onset. The most commonly reported symptoms of COVID-19 at time of referral were cough (57.4%), fever (29.7%), and myalgia (27.7%). All patients (100%) had at least 1 documented EUA defined risk factor for severe COVID-19 (Table 1). Following transfusion, 7/101 (6.9%) and 3/101 (3.0%) experienced mild to moderate and severe adverse events, respectively (Table 2). At day 30, 5 patients (5.0%) were hospitalized with COVID-19 at a median of 7 days (IQR 3-8) post monoclonal antibody infusion. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: We observed a higher frequency of hospitalization compared to 1.6% for BAM in BLAZE-1 and 3% for CAS-IMD in REGN-COV-2. This observation may reflect our higher risk population as all patients presented with at least 1 risk factor for severe disease compared to 69.6% and 65.0% in BAM and CAS-IMD clinical trials, respectively. Additionally, patients presented with longer durations of symptoms prior to infusion in our study population compared to 3 days reported in BAM and 4 days reported in CAS-IMD trials. Since the conclusion of this study, the FDA revoked the EUA for BAM administered alone based on increased observations of resistant variants to BAM monotherapy. However, our observations highlight the need for further exploration in the prevention of hospitalization in high risk populations as well as the optimal timing of monoclonal antibody therapy.

Identification of clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients from March 7, 2020 to August 25, 2020 at 14 U.S. hospitals. Ensemble clustering was performed on 33 variables collected within 72 hours of admission. Principal component analysis was performed to visualize variable contributions to clustering. Multinomial regression models were fit to compare patient comorbidities across phenotypes. Multivariable models were fit to estimate associations between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The database included 1,022 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III), with 236 [23.1%] patients in phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients in phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients in phenotype III. Patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly phenotype III (p = 0.002), while patients with hematologic, renal, and cardiac (all p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly phenotype I. Adjusted odds of respiratory, renal, hepatic, metabolic (all p<0.001), and hematological (p = 0.02) complications were highest for phenotype I. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR:7.30, 95% CI:(3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR:2.57, 95% CI:(1.10-6.00), p = 0.03) increases in hazard of death relative to phenotype III.

METHODS: Two hundred seventy-five patients had LAT between January 2010 and December 2018. Data on outcomes and complications were obtained from the patients notes, electronic records, laboratory, and radiographic findings. RESULTS: The main diagnoses were malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) (n=110, 40%), chronic inflammation/fibrinous pleuritis (77, 28%), lung cancer (26, 9.5%), and breast cancer (16, 6%). LAT failed to diagnose cancer in 7/275 patients (false-negative rate 2.5%, diagnostic sensitivity 97.5%). Out of the 105 patients with chronic inflammation/fibrinous pleuritis or atypical proliferative processes, 21 (20%) were subsequently diagnosed with malignancy. Talcum pleurodesis was performed in 146 patients, and was successful in 86%. Seventy eight (28%) patients had trapped lung; 27 of those had a repeat procedure.

Among these TTE endpoints, overall survival (OS) is always considered as the gold standard. However, OS data can take years to mature, and its use for measurement of efficacy can be confounded by the use of post-treatment rescue therapies or supportive care. Therefore, to accelerate the development process and better characterize the treatment effect of new investigational therapies, other TTE endpoints such as progression-free survival and event-free survival (EFS) are applied as primary efficacy endpoints in some confirmatory trials, either as a surrogate for OS or as a direct measure of clinical benefits. For evaluating novel treatments for acute myeloid leukemia, EFS has been gradually recognized as a direct measure of clinical benefits. However, the application of an EFS endpoint is still controversial mainly due to the debate surrounding definition of treatment failure (TF) events. In this article, we investigate the EFS endpoint with the most conservative definition for the timing of TF, which is Day 1 since randomization.

Eight elite fencers and nine physical education students performed an attack with a lunge in self-paced and reaction time conditions from three different initial stance widths. The onset of the center of pressure (COP) displacement and EMG activities for the tibialis anterior (TA) of both limbs were recorded. The results show that expertise in fencing delays the onset of the activity of TA of the front leg and the onset of COP displacement during fencing lunge performance in comparison to controls. Additionally, in contrast to the control group, fencers produce typical APA patterns in the activation of TA under different performance conditions, delayed reaction time in comparison to self-initiated lunging, and constant time of APA onset under different widths of stance.

Seroprevalence was determined using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 IgG test. RESULTS: The mean ( standard deviation) age of the respondent was 37.5 (18.5) years. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 infection seroprevalence was found 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 3.1C6.2) with no significant difference on age and gender of participants. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antibody seroprevalence was significantly associated with individuals who have been worked by moving from home to work area (adjusted odds ratio = 7.8, 95% confidence interval: 4.2C14.3, p < 0.019), not wearing masks (adjusted odds ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.9C3.8, p < 0.02), and baseline comorbidity (adjusted odds ratio = 6.3, 95% confidence interval: 2.3C17.1, p < 0.01) as compared to their counter groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that lower coronavirus disease 2019 seroprevalence, yet the large population in the community to be infected and insignificant proportion of seroprevalence, was observed between age and sex of respondents. Protective measures like contact tracing, face covering, and social distancing are therefore vital to demote the risk of communitystrengthening factors should be continued as effect modification of anticipation for severe course of coronavirus disease 2019.","output":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 ) IgG-antibody seroprevalence among quarantined population, during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic, In North West Ethiopia (from 30 April to 30 May 2020)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pandemi Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) merupakan kegawatan internasional di bidang kesehatan masyarakat yang membebani sistem kesehatan dan mengganggu kelangsungan layanan kesehatan rutin termasuk imunisasi dasar.

We describe a package of measures to control the outbreak and to prevent a spill over into the general population. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After outbreak confirmation, a package of measures such as quarantine of the elderly care home, staff and visitors, and their households was implemented. By sequential testing, quarantine measures were lifted. Surveillance of staff and residents by rapid antigen test and symptom monitoring was used in parallel. RESULTS: The outbreak was on-going for around 17 days until it was noticed by a symptomatic external staff member as index case. A total of 23 out of 96 residents (24.0%) and nine out of 114 staff (7.9%) were infected. Three residents died. Effective first-dose vaccine coverage was 85.4% in residents, 27.4% in internal, and 10.5% in external staff. Given the long latency period, the use of household quarantine prevented a spill over into the public. Already 16 days after notification of the index case the outbreak could be declared over. CONCLUSIONS: Interferences between vaccination coverage and outbreak characteristics in regard to an extended latency period were observed. Household quarantine of case as well as contact households is of increased importance in the era of vaccination to prevent further spread into the general population until population-based control measures and lockdowns can be lifted.","output":"Vaccine-masked spread of SARS-CoV2 in an elderly care home, and how to prevent a spill-over into the general population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 caused the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The virus is likely to show seasonal dynamics in European climates as other respiratory viruses and coronaviruses do. Analysing the association with meteorological factors might be helpful to anticipate how cases will develop with changing seasons. METHODS: Routinely measured ambient daily mean temperature, absolute humidity, and relative humidity were the explanatory variables of this analysis. Test-positive COVID-19 cases represented the outcome variable. The analysis included 54 English cities. A two-stage meta-regression was conducted. At the first stage, we used a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model including distributed lag non-linear elements. Thereby, we investigate the explanatory variables' non-linear effects as well as the non-linear effects across lags. RESULTS: This study found a non-linear association of COVID-19 cases with temperature. At 11.9C there was 1.62-times (95%-CI: 1.44; 1.81) the risk of cases compared to the temperature-level with the smallest risk (21.8C). Absolute humidity exhibited a 1.61-times (95%-CI: 1.41; 1.83) elevated risk at 6.6 g/m3 compared to the centering at 15.1 g/m3. When adjusting for temperature RH shows a 1.41-fold increase in risk of COVID-19 incidence (95%-CI: 1.09; 1.81) at 60.7% in respect to 87.6%. CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests that in England meteorological variables likely influence COVID-19 case development. These results reinforce the importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., social distancing and mask use) during all seasons, especially with cold and dry weather conditions.","output":"Influence of temperature, and of relative and absolute humidity on COVID-19 incidence in England - A multi-city time-series study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contaminated surfaces and indoor environments are important sources of infectious spread within hospital and non-hospital facilities Bacterial infections such as infections with Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile (C difficile) and Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) and its antibiotic resistant strains continue to pose a significant risk to healthcare workers and patients Additionally, the recent emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), highlights the need for safe and effective methods to decontaminate surfaces to control infection spread in hospitals and the community To address these critical needs, we tested a photocatalytic reactor decontamination method to disinfect contaminated surfaces in a hospital and a laboratory setting By placing the reactor in a test hospital room, growth of S aureus and C difficile were significantly reduced compared with a control room Additionally, using a model enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, dengue virus type 2 (DENV2), we showed that the use of the photocatalytic reactor reduces viral infectivity Collectively, the results demonstrate the potential utility of photocatalytic reactors in reducing the spread of highly contagious bacterial and viral infections through contaminated surfaces and environments","output":"Reducing Spread of Infections with a Photocatalytic ReactorPotential Applications in Control of Hospital Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridioides difficile Infections and Inactivation of RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that continues to disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low-income segments of society, around the world. In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. METHODS: A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted from 14-30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: About half (48%, 95% CI: 46-49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58-61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48-50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention practices and control the spread of COVID-19.

DON treatment suppressed lymphocyte proliferation in cervical lymph nodes resulting in reduced CNS immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and cell death compared to untreated SINV-infected mice. Production of SINV-specific antibody and interferon-gamma were also impaired by DON treatment with a delay in virus clearance.

Though some researchers have investigated the linkage between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility across different geographical locations and over time, yet these studies are scarce. This study aims to bridge this gap using daily temperature and COVID-19 cases (transmissibility) by employing grey incidence analysis (GIA) models (i.e., Dengs grey incidence analysis (DGIA), the absolute degree GIA (ADGIA), the second synthetic degree GIA (SSDGIA), the conservative (maximin) model) and correlation analysis. Data on temperature are accessed from the NASA database, while the data on COVID-19 cases are collected from the official website of the government of Pakistan. Empirical results reveal the existence of linkages between temperature and COVID-19 in all Pakistani provinces. These linkages vary from a relatively stronger to a relatively weaker linkage. Based on calculated weights, the strength of linkages is ranked across provinces as follows: Gilgit Baltistan (0.715301) > Baluchistan (0.675091) > Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (0.619893) > Punjab (0.619286) > Sindh (0.601736). The disparity in the strength of linkage among provinces is explained by the discrepancy in the intensity of temperature. Besides, the diagrammatic correlation analysis shows that temperature is inversely linked to COVID-19 cases (per million persons) over time, implying that low temperatures are associated with high COVID-19 transmissibility and vice versa. This study is among the first of its kind to consider the linkages between temperature and COVID-19 transmissibility for a tropical climate country (Pakistan) using the advanced GIA models. Research findings provide an up-to-date glimpse of the outbreak and emphasize the need to raise public awareness about the devastating impacts of the COVID-19.

Additionally, individuals should practice handwashing, social distancing, personal hygiene, mask-wearing, and the use of hand sanitizers to ensure a secure and supportive atmosphere for preventing and controlling the current pandemic.","output":"Does temperature matter for COVID-19 transmissibility?

The study human subjects were selected from two imaging-based severe asthmatic clusters with one characterized by non-constricted airways and the other by constricted airways in the lower left lobe (LLL). We compared the deposition fractions of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles with a range of aerodynamic diameters (1C8 m) in cluster archetypes under conditions with and without hygroscopic growth. The temperature and water vapor distributions in the airways were simulated with an airway wall boundary condition that accounts for variable temperature and water vapor evaporation at the interface between the lumen and the airway surface liquid layer. On average, the deposition fraction increased by about 6% due to hygroscopic particle growth in the cluster subjects with constricted airways, while it increased by only about 0.5% in those with non-constricted airways. The effect of particle growth was most significant for particles with an initial diameter of 2 m in the cluster subjects with constricted airways. The effect diminished with increasing particle size, especially for particles with an initial diameter larger than 4 m. This suggests the necessity to differentiate asthmatic subjects by cluster in engineering the aerosol size for tailored treatment. Specifically, the treatment of severe asthmatic subjects who have constricted airways with inhalation aerosols may need submicron-sized hygroscopic particles to compensate for particle growth, if one targets for delivering to the peripheral region. These results could potentially inform the choice of particle size for inhalational drug delivery in a cluster-specific manner.","output":"Transport and deposition of hygroscopic particles in asthmatic subjects with and without airway narrowing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cleavage of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus strain A59 spike protein was blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by a peptide furin inhibitor, indicating that furin or a furin-like enzyme is responsible for this process.

In this paper, we report on perceptions and experiences of prejudice and racism by Indigenous Mori with kidney disease and their family members and donors who took part in a wider study about experiences of kidney transplantation. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 Mori between September and December 2020. Participants included those with kidney disease who had considered, were being worked up for, or who had already received a kidney transplant as well as family members and potential or previous donors. We examined the data for experiences of racism using a theoretical framework for racism on three levels: institutionalised racism, personally mediated racism, and internalised racism. RESULTS: We identified subthemes at each level of racism: institutional (excluded and devalued by health system; disease stigmatization; discriminatory body weight criteria, lack of power), personally mediated (experiencing racial profiling; explicit racism), and internalized racism (shame and unworthiness to receive a transplant). CONCLUSIONS: The wide-reaching experiences and perceptions of racism described by participants with kidney disease and their families in this research point to an unfair health system and suggest that racism may be contributing to kidney transplantation inequity in Aotearoa New Zealand.
