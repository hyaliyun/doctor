Here, we present mortality rates and case fatality rates for COVID-19 over the past year compared with other historic leading causes of death in the United States. Among the risk categories considered, COVID-19 is the third leading cause of death for individuals 40 years old and over, with an overall annual mortality rate of 325 deaths per 100K individuals, behind only cancer (385 deaths per 100K individuals) and heart disease (412 deaths per 100K individuals). In addition, for individuals 40 years old and over, the case fatality rate for COVID-19 is greater than the case fatality rate for motor vehicle accidents. In particular, for the age group 40-49, the relative case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 1.5 fold (95% CI: [1.3, 1.7]) that of a motor vehicle accident, demonstrating that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be significantly more dangerous than a car crash for this age group. For older adults, COVID-19 is even more dangerous, and the relative case fatality rate of COVID-19 is 29.4 fold (95% CI: [23.2, 35.7]) that of a motor vehicle accident for individuals over 80 years old. On the other hand, motor vehicle accidents have a 4.5 fold (95% CI: [3.9, 5.1]) greater relative case fatality rate compared to COVID-19 for the age group of 20-29 years. These results highlight the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic especially for adults above 40 years of age and underscore the need for large-scale preventative measures to mitigate risks for these populations. Given that FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines have now been validated by multiple studies for their outstanding real-world effectiveness and safety, vaccination of all individuals who are over 40 years of age is one of the most pressing public health priorities of our time.","output":"Case fatality rates for COVID-19 are higher than case fatality rates for motor vehicle accidents for individuals over 40 years of age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human activity recognition is one among the foremost vital rising technology Principle parts from the body parts territory are utilized for human movement acknowledgment to scale back spatial property A multi scale delineation human action acknowledgment is done to save the segregate data before spatial property decrease This paper could be a human action Recognition system for identification of person It takes input a video of COVID-19 patients and searches for a match within the hold on pictures This method is predicate d on Gabor options extraction mistreatment Gabor filter For feature extraction the input image is matching with Gabor filter and further personal sample generation formula is employed to pick out a collection of informative and non redundant Gabor options DNN (Deep learning Models) is used for matching the input human action image to the hold on pictures This method is used in hospital management application for detecting the COVID-19 patient activity from surveillance cameras By using the SVM and deep learning the human activity is recognized using matlab tool","output":"Human activity recognition using SVM and deep learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Since identification of the first cases in December 2019, COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2) has spread across the world, giving rise to a global pandemic METHODS: A literature search was carried out in PubMed, using search terms defined by the authors Questions important for the management of patients with COVID-19 were identified and discussed, and recommendations or statements on these topics were formulated in a structured consensus process RESULTS: Determination of the indication for the admission of COVID-19 patients to the hospital should involve consideration of age, comorbidities, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation Every patient admitted without a recent PCR test should be tested immediately It is recommended that any COVID-19 patient with hypoxemia (SpO2 &lt;90%) despite being given oxygen, dyspnea, or a high respiratory rate be admitted to intensive care In the case of hypoxemic respiratory insufficiency, an attempt at treatment with high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation is suggested, while patients with severe hypoxemia/high respiratory rate should undergo intubation and invasive ventilation In the presence of additional risk factors (such as obesity, known thrombophilia, intensive care treatment, or elevated D-dimers), intensified prophylaxis against thromboembolism may be indicated Treatment with dexamethasone decreases the mortality among patients with severe or critical COVID-19 The important personal protection measures are attention to hygiene and the correct wearing of personal protective equipment CONCLUSION: The principal treatment measures are maintenance of adequate oxygenation, pharmacological prevention of thrombosis, and, in severe cases, administration of dexamethasone","output":"Recommendations on Inpatient Treatment of Patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Professor Alan Glasper, from the University of Southampton, delves into history and discusses the international quest to develop an effective vaccine to tackle COVID-19.","output":"The quest to find an effective vaccine for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Anaphylaxis is an acute and potentially fatal allergic reaction. No studies have yet been conducted to evaluate the spectrum of anaphylactic reactions among Omani patients. As such, this study aimed to describe the clinical features, causes, investigation, and management of anaphylaxis among patients presenting to a tertiary care center in Oman. METHODS: This retrospective study took place between August 2005 and June 2020 at the allergy and immunology clinic of Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. All patients diagnosed with anaphylaxis during the study period were included. Data were collected from electronic medical records. RESULTS: One hundred patients were diagnosed with anaphylaxis during the study period. Of these, 52.0% were male. The mean age was 15.916.2 years, with 70.0% aged < 18 years old. The eosinophil count ranged from 0.0-16.9  109/L, with a mean of 0.82.2  109/L and a median of 0.3 (0.1-0.6)  109/L. Total immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels ranged from 25-8706 kIU/L, with a mean of 935.11369.5 kIU/L and a median of 500.4 (186.0-972.5) kIU/L. The majority of patients had a family history of allergies (72.0%), and other had concomitant allergic conditions (66.0%). All were prescribed epinephrine (100%). The most common cause of anaphylaxis was food (65.0%). The second most frequent trigger was insect venom (32.0%). Most patients had one category cause (81.0%); two or more causes were present in 12.0% of patients. Clinical symptoms manifested most frequently as cutaneous (92.0%) and respiratory (85.0%). The majority of patients (87.0%) demonstrated the involvement of more than one bodily system. Mean total IgE levels were significantly higher in patients with concomitant presence of other allergic conditions (1193.8 kIU/L) than patients without another concomitant allergic disease (503.6 kIU/L; p =0.030). In addition, concomitant allergic disease is significantly higher in patients < 18 years of age (75.4%) compared to patients > 18 years of age (45.2%; p =0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Due to its life-threatening nature, knowledge of the epidemiology and clinical features of anaphylaxis in different populations is necessary to deliver rapid treatment. This study found that the clinical features of anaphylactic patients in Oman were similar to those reported elsewhere. Further research is needed to determine the true incidence of anaphylaxis in Oman to minimize associated morbidity and mortality.","output":"Anaphylaxis in Omani Patients: A Study from a Tertiary Care Center"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper introduces a multigroup COVID-19 model with immunity, in which the total population of each group is partitioned into five compartments, that is, susceptible, exposed, infective, infective in treatment and recovered compartment If the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one, and the infection graph is strongly connected, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease dies out However, the COVID-19 is already in a pandemic state, and the basic reproduction number is large than one Hence, in order to make the COVID-19 die out in some groups in an area, we design some appropriate control strategies which reduce the number of exposed people and increase the number of people treated These two methods have been proved to be the most effective methods at present An effective algorithm is proposed to identify the groups that need to be controlled Finally, we use the actual limited data of Hubei, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces in China to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results","output":"Control of a multigroup COVID-19 model with immunity: treatment and test elimination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is thought to cause kidney injury by a variety of mechanisms. To date, pathologic analyses have been limited to patient reports and autopsy series. METHODS: We evaluated biopsy samples of native and allograft kidneys from patients with COVID-19 at a single center in New York City between March and June of 2020. We also used immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy to examine this tissue for presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: The study group included 17 patients with COVID-19 (12 men, 12 black; median age of 54 years). Sixteen patients had comorbidities, including hypertension, obesity, diabetes, malignancy, or a kidney or heart allograft. Nine patients developed COVID-19 pneumonia. Fifteen patients (88%) presented with AKI; nine had nephrotic-range proteinuria. Among 14 patients with a native kidney biopsy, 5 were diagnosed with collapsing glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with minimal change disease, 2 were diagnosed with membranous glomerulopathy, 1 was diagnosed with crescentic transformation of lupus nephritis, 1 was diagnosed with anti-GBM nephritis, and 4 were diagnosed with isolated acute tubular injury. The three allograft specimens showed grade 2A acute T cell-mediated rejection, cortical infarction, or acute tubular injury. Genotyping of three patients with collapsing glomerulopathy and the patient with minimal change disease revealed that all four patients had APOL1 high-risk gene variants. We found no definitive evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney cells. Biopsy diagnosis informed treatment and prognosis in all patients.

Reconstruction of the lateral canthus is important in the rehabilitation of the aging eyelid and an unfortunate necessity after failed lateral canthal surgery. The common methods for improving or maintaining position, tone, and shape of the lower eyelid and lateral canthus use tightening or shortening the lower eyelid horizontally, keeping the canthal angle in an appropriate vertical level, and hugging the ocular surface. Many techniques have been described for the reconstruction of the lateral canthus in functional conditions or for aesthetic purposes. These methods have met with varying success.

During lockdown, players could only train at home, with limited evidence regarding the effect of this period. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of COVID-19 lockdown on professional soccer players' physical performance. Aerobic fitness and vertical jump were assessed before and after four periods in two different seasons: COVID-19 lockdown, competitive period before lockdown, competitive period and summer break of the 2016-2017 season. Linear mixed models were used to examine within-period changes and between-period differences in changes observed during COVID-19 lockdown and the three other periods. Within-period changes in aerobic fitness showed a significant improvement following COVID-19 lockdown (p<0.001) and a significant decline during summer break (p<0.001). Between-period differences were significant in the comparison of COVID-19 lockdown with both the competitive 2019-2020 season (p<0.01) and summer break (p<0.001). For the vertical jump, only the between-period comparison revealed significant differences as the changes associated with COVID-19 lockdown were worse than those of the two competitive periods, for both absolute (p<0.05; p<0.001) and relative peak power (p<0.01; p<0.001).

Thus, early identification of patients at risk of poor outcomes is critical. Our objective was to analyse SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in serum as a severity biomarker in COVID-19. Retrospective observational study including 193 patients admitted for COVID-19. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum (viremia) was performed with samples collected at 48C72 h of admission by two techniques from Roche and Thermo Fischer Scientific (TFS). Main outcome variables were mortality and need for ICU admission during hospitalization for COVID-19. Viremia was detected in 50C60% of patients depending on technique. The correlation of Ct in serum between both techniques was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.612; p < 0.001). Patients with viremia were older (p = 0.006), had poorer baseline oxygenation (PaO(2)/FiO(2); p < 0.001), more severe lymphopenia (p < 0.001) and higher LDH (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p = 0.021), C-reactive protein (CRP; p = 0.022) and procalcitonin (p = 0.002) serum levels. We defined \\"relevant viremia\\" when detection Ct was < 34 with Roche and < 31 for TFS. These thresholds had 95% sensitivity and 35% specificity. Relevant viremia predicted death during hospitalization (OR 9.2 [3.8C22.6] for Roche, OR 10.3 [3.6C29.3] for TFS; p < 0.001). Cox regression models, adjusted by age, sex and Charlson index, identified increased LDH serum levels and relevant viremia (HR = 9.87 [4.13C23.57] for TFS viremia and HR = 7.09 [3.3C14.82] for Roche viremia) as the best markers to predict mortality. Viremia assessment at admission is the most useful biomarker for predicting mortality in COVID-19 patients.

Although this virus primarily causes respiratory symptoms, an increasing number of cutaneous manifestations associated with this disease have been reported. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to collate and categorize the dermatologic findings reported in patients with COVID-19 and identify specific lesions that may facilitate diagnosis and prognostication. METHODS: An evidence-based review of the PubMed database was conducted on 14 May, 2020 using the search terms Covid-19 skin, Covid-19 rash, Covid-19 exanthem, and Covid-19 chilblains. Peer-reviewed publications containing original COVID-19 patient cases and a discussion of the associated cutaneous findings were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The literature search identified 115 records, of which 34 publications describing 996 patients with dermatologic conditions were included. Case reports (n = 15), case series (n = 13), and observational prospective studies (n = 4) were the most common publication types. Acral lesions resembling pseudo-chilblains were the most frequent lesion identified (40.4% of cases), appearing in young adults (mean age, 23.2 years) after the onset of extracutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (55/100 patients). Erythematous maculopapular rashes affected 21.3% of patients, most frequently impacting middle-aged adults (mean age, 53.2 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (110/187 patients). Vesicular rashes affected 13.0% of patients, appearing in middle-aged adults (mean age, 48.3 years) after the onset of other symptoms (52/84 patients). Urticarial rashes affected 10.9% of patients, appearing in adults (mean age, 38.3 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous symptoms (46/78 patients). Vascular rashes resembling livedo or purpura were uncommon (4% of cases), appearing in elderly patients (mean age, 77.5 years) and occurring at the same time as non-cutaneous COVID-19 symptoms (18/29 patients). Erythema multiforme-like eruptions, although infrequent (3.7% of cases), affected mostly children (mean age, 12.2 years). CONCLUSIONS: Vesicular rashes may suggest an initial diagnosis of COVID-19, acral lesions may be most appropriate for epidemiological uses, and vascular rashes may be a useful prognostic marker for severe disease.

Objectives: To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods: Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results: Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion: An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India.

Results and Discussion-A total of 400 respondents (male 56.2, female 43.2%)) were eligible for the analysis, majority (93.6%) of them were young adults (18-38) involved in sedentary to light occupation (95.3%).Sedentary behavior in occupation was doubled (80%) as compared to pre COVID situation (42.5%). Majority of the respondents reported an increase in screen and sleep time. On calculating TPA ~33% of the respondents were found in each group;inactive, active and very active. Majority of them were performing pa for &lt;150m/w in each domain i.e. OPA, MV-LTPA and HHPA. Significant difference was found between male and female, of all the three domains, in their physical activity group whereas no significant difference was found in their TPA group. Significant association was found between physical activity groups in terms of considering physical activity benefits, change in post COVID physical activity, and their self reported type of physical activity. Significant association was found between male and female respondents in terms of their BMI and perceived Body weight whereas no association was found between physical activity groups in terms of their BMI and body weight perception. Family/friends and health benefits were the most motivating factors for the majority of respondents whereas social distancing norms and lack of motivation were reported as restricting factors in doing physical activity. Conclusion-It can be concluded that physical activity among people was low even before the COVID-19 pandemic, this pandemic acted as a catalyst in promoting sedentary behavior.","output":"A study of physical activity behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Amidst the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its precarious conditions that have impacted the worldwide community, the need to achieve a herd immunity through immunization has become the only resort to control this horrendous pandemic.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 429 COVID-19 patients who were on follow up from July to October 2020. Data was described using frequency tables. Robust Poisson regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 severity where adjusted relative risk (ARR), P-value and 95 CI for ARR were used to test significance. Binary Logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of statistically significant association between the explanatory variables and COVID-19 outcome where adjusted odds ratio (AOR), P-value and 95%CI for AOR were used for testing significance. RESULTS: Among the 429 patients studied, 182 (42.4%) had Severe disease at admission and the rest 247 (57.6%) had Non-severe disease. Regarding disease outcome, 45 (10.5%) died and 384 (89.5%) were discharged alive.

METHODS Medical records of dogs with pyothorax managed via VATS were reviewed for signalment, history, clinical signs, clinicopathological findings, diagnostic imaging results, surgical variables, bacterial culture and sensitivity results, post-operative management and outcome. VATS was performed after placing a paraxyphoid endoscopic portal and 2-3 intercostal instrument portals. VATS exploration was followed by one or more of the following: mediastinal debridement, tissue sampling, pleural lavage, and placement of a thoracostomy tube. RESULTS Two dogs (14%) required conversion from VATS to an open thoracotomy to completely resect proliferative mediastinal tissue. These dogs had severe pleural effusion on preoperative thoracic radiographs and one had severely thickened contrast-enhancing mediastinum on preoperative computed tomography (CT). The cause of pyothorax was identified as a penetrating gastric foreign body (n = 2), migrating plant material (n = 2), and idiopathic (n = 10). The median follow-up time was 143 days (range, 14-2402 days). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and their clinical signs resolved.

It is typically described as objective hypoxia in the absence of proportional respiratory distress. The physiological basis for this phenomenon is controversial, and its prognostic value is unclear. We present a case below, of a 66-year-old female presenting with severe hypoxia that was managed without mechanical ventilation. Presentation of case: A 66 year old female with multiple comorbidities initially presented with a cough, fever and an oxygen saturation of 70% on room air in the absence of respiratory distress or altered mentation. She subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the intensive care unit; received oxygen via high flow nasal cannula and continuous positive pressure mask. The patient remained in the intensive care unit for 40 days under close observation and exhibited multiple episodes of silent hypoxia on weaning oxygen. She was discharged on room air with an oxygen saturation >90% after 56 days. The patient was not intubated during her stay. Discussion and conclusion: Clinicians face a clinical dilemma on whether to intubate a \\"silently hypoxemic\\" patient, who displays hypoxia out of proportion to clinical examination. The decision is confounded by a lack of clear evidence on whether the benefits of precautionary intubation outweighs the risks, especially in the current COVID-19 pandemic. A recent paradigm shift that recommends delaying intubation further displays the need for clearer analysis of the situation. Our case demonstrates a favorable outcome of the latter approach, yet emphasizes a case-by-case approach until clearer recommendations are available.","output":"Caution against precaution: A case report on silent hypoxia in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government has decided a general lockdown. This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. METHODS: We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) \\"How is your child doing since the lockdown?\\" 2) \\"How is life at home since the lockdown?\\" 3) \\"If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us\\" 4) \\"Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation\\". This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. RESULTS: Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95 % (95 % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95 % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71 % (95 % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33 % (95 % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96 % (95 % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. CONCLUSIONS: According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.","output":"Comment les enfants et adolescents avec le trouble dficit d'attention/hyperactivit (TDAH) vivent-ils le confinement durant la pandmie COVID-19 ?/ [How do children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak?]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Although policies and guidelines may not always be optimal in all settings, a tailor-fitted guideline is appropriate.

In response, most countries in the world implemented lockdowns, restricting their population's movements, work, education, gatherings, and general activities in attempt to \\"flatten the curve\\" of COVID-19 cases. The public health goal of lockdowns was to save the population from COVID-19 cases and deaths, and to prevent overwhelming health care systems with COVID-19 patients. In this narrative review I explain why I changed my mind about supporting lockdowns. The initial modeling predictions induced fear and crowd-effects (i.e., groupthink). Over time, important information emerged relevant to the modeling, including the lower infection fatality rate (median 0.23%), clarification of high-risk groups (specifically, those 70 years of age and older), lower herd immunity thresholds (likely 20-40% population immunity), and the difficult exit strategies. In addition, information emerged on significant collateral damage due to the response to the pandemic, adversely affecting many millions of people with poverty, food insecurity, loneliness, unemployment, school closures, and interrupted healthcare. Raw numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths were difficult to interpret, and may be tempered by information placing the number of COVID-19 deaths in proper context and perspective relative to background rates. Considering this information, a cost-benefit analysis of the response to COVID-19 finds that lockdowns are far more harmful to public health (at least 5-10 times so in terms of wellbeing years) than COVID-19 can be. Controversies and objections about the main points made are considered and addressed. Progress in the response to COVID-19 depends on considering the trade-offs discussed here that determine the wellbeing of populations. I close with some suggestions for moving forward, including focused protection of those truly at high risk, opening of schools, and building back better with a economy.","output":"COVID-19: Rethinking the Lockdown Groupthink"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have applied restrictions in order to slow down its spreading. However, creating such policies is hard, especially because the government needs to trade-off the spreading of the pandemic with the economic losses. For this reason, several works have applied machine learning techniques, often with the help of special-purpose simulators, to generate policies that were more effective than the ones obtained by governments. While the performance of such approaches are promising, they suffer from a fundamental issue: since such approaches are based on black-box machine learning, their real-world applicability is limited, because these policies cannot be analyzed, nor tested, and thus they are not trustable. In this work, we employ a recently developed hybrid approach, which combines reinforcement learning with evolutionary computation, for the generation of interpretable policies for containing the pandemic. These policies, trained on an existing simulator, aim to reduce the spreading of the pandemic while minimizing the economic losses.

Depression among diabetic people has led to poor treatment adherence, defective treatment outcomes, and consequently worsened quality of life. However, there is a limited study conducted to assess the magnitude and factors associated with depression among diabetic patients in Ethiopia including this study area. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with depression among adult diabetic outpatients attending diabetic clinic in Eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 407 adult diabetic outpatients on treatment in Ethiopia in 2020. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression among randomly selected samples. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was fitted to identify factors associated with depression among diabetic outpatients. A p value less than 0.05 with a 95% confidence interval was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression among diabetic outpatients was found to be 48.9% (95% confidence interval: 44.2%, 53.4%). Being female (adjusted odds ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence interval: 1.39, 2.73), Khat chewing (adjusted odds ratio = 1.88, 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 2.93), having poor and moderate social support (adjusted odds ratio = 1.79, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 2.98 and adjusted odds ratio = 1.90, 95% confidence interval: 1.14, 3.17, respectively), taking both oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin medication (adjusted odds ratio = 1.33, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 2.80) and duration of diabetes mellitus for more than 6 years (adjusted odds ratio = 5.40, 95% confidence interval: 3.42, 8.14) were significantly associated with depression. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a relatively high prevalence of depression in diabetic outpatients. A lesser level of social support, taking oral and insulin treatment regimes, longer duration of illness, using Khat, and being female were associated with depression among diabetic outpatients. Therefore, early screening and identification of such factors could help ameliorate some of the deleterious effects of depression in diabetic outpatients.","output":"Prevalence and associated factors of depression among diabetic outpatients attending diabetic clinic at public hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions can adversely impact antenatal maternal well-being and health behaviours. AIM: To examine antenatal stress and stress-reduction strategies, social support, and health behaviours between women pregnant before and during the pandemic in Ireland. METHODS: 210 pregnant women were recruited online and in the antenatal department of a tertiary maternity hospital before the pandemic, and 235 women recruited online during the pandemic. Only women resident in Ireland were included in this study. Women completed measures of stress, social support, health-behaviours, and self-reported stress-reduction strategies. Differences in outcomes were examined between women pregnant before and during the pandemic, and between Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the Irish Government COVID-19 restrictions. FINDINGS: Women pregnant during the pandemic reported lower perceived social support, including support from a significant other, friends and family, than women pregnant before the pandemic. There were no significant differences in stress in health behaviours but women reported higher stress and less physical activity during the pandemic. Women reported a range of comparable stress-reduction strategies before and during the pandemic. No differences were observed between phases of pandemic-related restrictions for any outcome. DISCUSSION: Our findings highlight negative impacts of the pandemic on social support, stress, and physical activity, which can have implications for maternal and child health. Lack of differences between restriction phases suggests on-going negative effects for antenatal well-being and behaviours. CONCLUSION: Development of supports for pregnant women during the pandemic should include social-support and stress-reduction components.","output":"Differences in levels of stress, social support, health behaviours, and stress-reduction strategies for women pregnant before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and based on phases of pandemic restrictions, in Ireland"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Learning to code is increasingly embedded in secondary and higher education curricula, where solving programming exercises plays an important role in the learning process and in formative and summative assessment.

Them are 12 items in this sub-factor: The lowest possible score is 12, and the highest score is 60. The other sub-factors are the work environment, employees, equipment, and environmental factors. Results: Accessibility to personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 pandemic caused a difference in bodily, physical, and vital anxiety levels (P &lt; 0.05). Gender, chronic disease before COVID-19 status. marital status. years of experience, overtime work during the COVID-19 pandemic, and SARS-COV-2 contagion status during the treatment process did not cause any difference in bodily. physical, and vital anxiety levels (P &gt; 0.05). The place of work caused a significant difference in the level of bodily. physical and vital anxiety (P &lt; 0.05). Years of experience in the profession caused a significant difference in the level of anxiety regarding work atmosphere, employee, PPE, and environmental factors (P &lt; 0.05). During the COVID-19 pandemic, overtime work during the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant difference in the level of anxiety related to work atmosphere, employee, equipment, and environmental factors (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergency service working hours caused a significant difference in the anxiety levels related to work atmosphere, employees, equipment. and environmental factors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to personal protective equipment caused a difference in anxiety levels. As a result, the anxiety level of the emergency medicine professionals who are in the front line in the hospitals should be treated, and they should be provided psychological and behavioural support.","output":"The analysis of emergency medicine professionals' occupational anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objective To report the experience of adapting the stomatherapy service during the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE To assess the baseline prevalence and predictors of CVD risks among severely obese adolescents undergoing weight-loss surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study was conducted from February 28, 2007, to December 30, 2011, at the following 5 adolescent weight-loss surgery centers in the United States: Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio; Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, Ohio; Texas Children's Hospital in Houston; University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Children's Hospital of Alabama in Birmingham. Consecutive patients aged 19 years or younger were offered enrollment in a long-term outcome study; the final analysis cohort consisted of 242 participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES This report examined the preoperative prevalence of CVD risk factors (ie, fasting hyperinsulinemia, elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels, impaired fasting glucose levels, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus) and associations between risk factors and body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Preoperative data were collected within 30 days preceding bariatric surgery. RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 17 (1.6) years and median body mass index was 50.5. Cardiovascular disease risk factor prevalence was fasting hyperinsulinemia (74%), elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels (75%), dyslipidemia (50%), elevated blood pressure (49%), impaired fasting glucose levels (26%), and diabetes mellitus (14%). The risk of impaired fasting glucose levels, elevated blood pressure, and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels increased by 15%, 10%, and 6%, respectively, per 5-unit increase in body mass index (P < .01). Dyslipidemia (adjusted relative risk = 1.60 [95% CI, 1.26-2.03]; P < .01) and elevated blood pressure (adjusted relative risk = 1.48 [95% CI, 1.16-1.89]; P < .01) were more likely in adolescent boys compared with adolescent girls. White individuals were at greater risk of having elevated triglyceride levels (adjusted relative risk = 1.76 [95% CI, 1.14-2.72]; P = .01) but were less likely to have impaired fasting glucose levels (adjusted relative risk = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.38-0.89]; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Numerous CVD risk factors are apparent in adolescents undergoing weight-loss surgery. Increasing body mass index and male sex increase the relative risk of specific CVD risk factors. These data suggest that even among severely obese adolescents, recognition and treatment of CVD risk factors is important to help limit further progression of disease.","output":"Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Severely Obese Adolescents: The Teen Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (Teen-LABS) Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: Sepsis is one of the most common critical care illnesses with increasing survivorship. The quality of life in sepsis survivors is adversely affected by several co-morbidities, including increased incidence of dementia, stroke, cardiac disease and at least temporary deterioration in cognitive dysfunction. One of the potential explanations for their progression is the persistence of lipid profile abnormalities induced during acute sepsis into recovery, resulting in acceleration of atherosclerosis. (2) Methods: This is a targeted review of the abnormalities in the long-term lipid profile abnormalities after sepsis; (3) Results: There is a well-established body of evidence demonstrating acute alteration in lipid profile (HDL-c , LDL-C -c ). In contrast, a limited number of studies demonstrated depression of HDL-c levels with a concomitant increase in LDL-C -c in the wake of sepsis. VLDL-C -c and Lp(a) remained unaltered in few studies as well. Apolipoprotein A1 was altered in survivors suggesting abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism concomitant to overall lipoprotein abnormalities. However, most of the studies were limited to a four-month follow-up and patient groups were relatively small. Only one study looked at the atherosclerosis progression in sepsis survivors using clinical correlates, demonstrating an acceleration of plaque formation in the aorta, and a large metanalysis suggested an increase in the risk of stroke or acute coronary event between 3% to 9% in sepsis survivors. (4) Conclusions: The limited evidence suggests an emergence and persistence of the proatherogenic lipid profile in sepsis survivors that potentially contributes, along with other factors, to the clinical sequel of atherosclerosis.","output":"Persistence of Lipoproteins and Cholesterol Alterations after Sepsis: Implication for Atherosclerosis Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research examined the underlying beliefs and psychological determinants of COVID-19 vaccination intention in order to inform effective health promotion efforts.

Sex disparities in genetics, immunological responses, and hormonal mechanisms may underlie the substantially higher fatality rates reported in male COVID-19 patients. To optimise care for COVID-19 patients, prophylactic and therapeutic studies should include sex-specific design and analyses. Therefore, in this scoping review, we investigated whether studies on pharmacological treatment in COVID-19 were performed based on a priori sex-specific design or post-hoc sex-specific analyses. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, UpToDate, clinical trial.org, and MedRxiv for studies on pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 until June 6th, 2020. We included case series, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in humans (18 years) investigating antiviral, antimalarial, and immune system modulating drugs. Data were collected on 1) the proportion of included females, 2) whether sex stratification was performed (a priori by design or post-hoc), and 3) whether effect modification by sex was investigated. FINDINGS: 30 studies were eligible for inclusion, investigating remdesivir (n = 2), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 5), favipiravir (n = 1), umifenovir (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n = 8), convalescent plasma (n = 6), interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway inhibitors (n = 5), interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway inhibitors (n = 1) and corticosteroids (n = 3). Only one study stratified its data based on sex in a post-hoc analysis, whereas none did a priori by design. None of the studies investigated effect modification by sex. A quarter of the studies included twice as many males as females. INTERPRETATION: Analyses assessing potential interference of sex with (side-)effects of pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 are rarely reported. Considering sex differences in case-fatality rates and genetic, immunological, and hormonal mechanisms, studies should include sex-specific analyses in their design to optimise COVID-19 care.

As the pandemic's socioeconomic consequences worsen and pandemic fatigue settles in, another frailty is unveiled to the public and media space: the lack of a critical mass of health communicators, which has direct consequences on how the pandemic is managed. Communicating in such a context of crisis and uncertainty requires identifying what are the important facts to communicate to different population segments, clarifying myths and fake information, responding to ongoing uncertainties, listening to and involving stakeholders, developing and testing messages, and monitoring and evaluating implemented strategies. The use of communication as a management support strategy allows organizations to build confidence and reputation, manage relationships with internal and external stakeholders, and prepare for future uncertainties, which are crucial competencies in managing a health crisis. Given the lack of scientific evidence about health communication practiced in Portugal, a significant part of the analysis and diagnosis is based on the authors' empirical knowledge, obtained through professional experience in communications at several health institutions.

When there is little information about the symptoms of a novel disease, interventions to contain the spread of the disease would be suboptimal because people experiencing symptoms that are not yet known to be related to the disease may not limit their social activities. Our goal was to understand whether users' social media postings about the symptoms of novel diseases could be used to develop a complete list of the disease symptoms in a shorter time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Twitter API to download tweets that contained 'coronavirus', 'COVID-19', and 'symptom'. After data cleaning, the resulting dataset consisted of over 95,000 unique, English tweets posted between January 17, 2020 and March 15, 2020 that contained references to the symptoms of COVID-19. We analyzed this data using network and time series methods. RESULTS: We found that a complete list of the symptoms of COVID-19 could have been compiled by mid-March 2020, before most states in the U.S. announced a lockdown and about 75 days earlier than the list was completed on CDC's website. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: We conclude that national and international health agencies should use the crowd-sourced intelligence obtained from social media to develop effective symptom surveillance systems in the early stages of pandemics. We propose a high-level framework that facilitates the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information that are posted in various languages and on different social media platforms about the symptoms of novel diseases.","output":"Miscommunication in the age of communication: A crowdsourcing framework for symptom surveillance at the time of pandemics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Smoking rates are significantly higher among young people experiencing homelessness than in the general population. Despite a willingness to quit, homeless youth have little success in doing so on their own, and existing cessation resources tailored to this population are lacking. Homeless youth generally enjoy the camaraderie and peer support that group-based programs offer, but continuous in-person support during a quit attempt can be prohibitively expensive. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of an automated text messaging intervention (TMI) as an adjunct to group-based cessation counseling and provision of nicotine patches to help homeless youth quit smoking. This paper outlines the lessons learned from the implementation of the TMI intervention. METHODS: Homeless youth smokers aged 18 to 25 years who were interested in quitting (n=77) were recruited from drop-in centers serving homeless youth in the Los Angeles area. In this pilot randomized controlled trial, all participants received a group-based cessation counseling session and nicotine patches, with 52% (40/77) randomly assigned to receive 6 weeks of text messages to provide additional support for their quit attempt. Participants received text messages on their own phone rather than receiving a study-issued phone for the TMI. We analyzed baseline and follow-up survey data as well as back-end data from the messaging platform to gauge the acceptability and feasibility of the TMI among the 40 participants who received it. RESULTS: Participants had widespread (smart)phone ownership-16.4% (36/219) were ineligible for study participation because they did not have a phone that could receive text messages. Participants experienced interruptions in their phone use (eg, 44% [16/36] changed phone numbers during the follow-up period) but reported being able to receive the majority of messages. These survey results were corroborated by back-end data (from the program used to administer the TMI) showing a message delivery rate of about 95%. Participant feedback points to the importance of carefully crafting text messages, which led to high (typically above 70%) approval of most text messaging components of the intervention. Qualitative feedback indicated that participants enjoyed the group counseling session that preceded the TMI and suggested including more such group elements into the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The TMI was well accepted and feasible to support smoking cessation among homeless youth. Given high rates of smartphone ownership, the next generation of phone-based smoking cessation interventions for this population should consider using approaches beyond text messages and focus on finding ways to develop effective approaches to include group interaction using remote implementation. Given overall resource constraints and in particular the exigencies of the currently ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, phone-based interventions are a promising approach to support homeless youth, a population urgently in need of effective smoking cessation interventions.

Some evidence suggests that individuals living in rural areas may be at greater risk of problem alcohol use. The present exploratory cross-sectional study sought to examine problem alcohol use at diagnosis in a sample of HNC patients by rural vs urban status. METHODS Self-reported problem alcohol use as measured by the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST) was examined in rural and urban HNC patients at diagnosis (N=454). Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to examine correlates of problem alcohol use. Subgroup analyses examined HNC-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) by problem drinking status at diagnosis and 3- and 12-months postdiagnosis in rural patients. RESULTS Multivariable linear regression analysis controlling for age, cancer site, cancer stage, depressive symptoms at diagnosis, and tobacco use at diagnosis indicated that rural residence was significantly associated with SMAST scores at diagnosis such that rural patients were more likely to report higher scores (?=.095, sr2 =.010, p=.04). Covariate-adjusted subgroup analyses suggest that rural patients with self-reported problem alcohol use may exhibit deficits in HNC-specific HRQOL at diagnosis and 3- and 12-months postdiagnosis. CONCLUSIONS HNC patients should be screened for problem alcohol use at diagnosis and counseled regarding the deleterious effects of continued drinking during treatment and beyond. Because access to treatment and referral options may be lacking in rural areas, additional ways of connecting rural patients to specialty care should be explored.

However, urban transportation has not been addressed for all dimensions of sustainability. This study presents a life cycle sustainability assessment of a light rail transit system in Kayseri, Turkey, by integrating environmental, economic, and social aspects. The sustainability performance of the light rail transit system is evaluated using a cradle-to-grave approach to assess three aspects of sustainability. For the environmental evaluation, a life cycle assessment was applied using SimaPro 8.4.1 PhD version based on ISO 14040 and 14044. The method, which includes nine environmental impact categories, was employed to assess the environmental performance of the light rail transit system with the functional unit of one passenger-km. For the economic assessment, life cycle costing was utilized with the functional unit of USD for one passenger-km. A social life cycle assessment was applied to assess the social performance of the light rail transit system based on guidelines published by the United Nations Environment Programme in collaboration with the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. For the determination of social impacts, 11 subcategories and 18 social indicators were selected. The results showed that the global warming potential and abiotic depletion potential of the light rail system per passenger-km were 2.4E-02 kg CO2 eq and 2.7E-01 MJ, respectively, with a service life of 50 years. The total life cycle cost of the light rail system was calculated as 0.046 USD for 1 passenger-km. The results also revealed that the main contributor to the total life cycle cost was energy cost, with 92% (2.88E+08 USD) of the total cost. In the social performance evaluation, it is found that the industry performs well for society, the local community, and workers but has a weaker social performance for the consumer due to a weak feedback mechanism.

OBJECTIVES This prospective, observational cohort study sought to evaluate the feasibility of a novel, virtual, and remote health care strategy for TAVR patients with smart wearable devices. METHODS A total of 100 consecutive severe aortic stenosis patients who underwent elective transfemoral TAVR were enrolled and each received a HUAWEI smartwatch at least one day before TAVR. Vital signs were continuously tracked and recorded. Single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded periodically after TAVR. A designated heart team member was to provide remote data-assisted health care to address the medical demand. RESULTS Thirty-eight cardiac events were reported in 34 patients after discharge, with most of the events (76.0%) were detected and confirmed by the smartwatch. Six patients were advised and readmitted to the hospital for arrhythmia events, among whom, four received pacemaker implantations. The remaining 28 (82.4%) patients received telemedicine monitoring instead of face-to-face clinical visits, and three of them received new medication treatment under a doctor's online guidance of doctors. New-onset LBBB was found in 48 patients with transient and recovered spontaneously in 30 patients, while new-onset atrial fibrillation in 4 patients. There were no significant differences in the average weekly heart rates, the ratio of abnormal or low oxygen saturation when compared with the baseline.

Some mental health apps incorporate gamification into their app design, yet it is unclear whether features differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms over and above mental health apps without gamification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether mental health apps with gamification elements differ in their effectiveness to reduce depressive symptoms when compared to those that lack these elements. METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies that examined the effect of app-based therapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and mindfulness, on depressive symptoms was performed. A total of 5597 articles were identified via five databases. After screening, 38 studies (n=8110 participants) remained for data extraction. From these studies, 50 total comparisons between postintervention mental health app intervention groups and control groups were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A random effects model was performed to examine the effect of mental health apps on depressive symptoms compared to controls. The number of gamification elements within the apps was included as a moderator. Results indicated a small to moderate effect size across all mental health apps in which the mental health app intervention effectively reduced depressive symptoms compared to controls (Hedges g=C0.27, 95% CI C0.36 to C0.17; P<.001). The gamification moderator was not a significant predictor of depressive symptoms (=C0.03, SE=0.03; P=.38), demonstrating no significant difference in effectiveness between mental health apps with and without gamification features.

The presence of severe kyphoscoliosis not only increases the incidence of paraesophageal hernia but also increases the risk of hiatal hernia (HH) repair. Moreover, the technical skills and the pitfalls of laparoscopic repair of HH in this special condition have yet been described. Methods The technical skills, experience and pitfalls of laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients were described. These include perioperative care of patients' pulmonary function, patients' operating position and trocar placement, and the key steps and risks of laparoscopic HH repair in this special condition. Results Paraesophageal HHs were successfully laparoscopically repaired, and prolonged hospital stay was due to post-operative pulmonary complications. Conclusion These techniques are essential to minimise the perioperative complications in laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients, and great pulmonary care is required in these patients.","output":"Techniques and pitfalls of laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair in severe kyphoscoliosis patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engineering accreditation agencies and governmental educational bodies worldwide require programs to evaluate specific learning outcomes information for attainment of student learning and establish accountability. Ranking and accreditation have resulted in programs adopting shortcut approaches to collate cohort information with minimally acceptable rigor for Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI). With tens of thousands of engineering programs seeking accreditation, qualifying program evaluations that are based on reliable and accurate cohort outcomes is becoming increasingly complex and is high stakes. Manual data collection processes and vague performance criteria assimilate inaccurate or insufficient learning outcomes information that cannot be used for effective CQI. Additionally, due to the COVID19 global pandemic, many accreditation bodies have cancelled onsite visits and either deferred or announced virtual audit visits for upcoming accreditation cycles. In this study, we examine a novel meta-framework to qualify state of the art digital Integrated Quality Management Systems for three engineering programs seeking accreditation. The digital quality systems utilize authentic OBE frameworks and assessment methodology to automate collection, evaluation and reporting of precision CQI data. A novel Remote Evaluator Module that enables successful virtual ABET accreditation audits is presented. A theory based mixed methods approach is applied for evaluations. Detailed results and discussions show how various phases of the meta-framework help to qualify the context, construct, causal links, processes, technology, data collection and outcomes of comprehensive CQI efforts. Key stakeholders such as accreditation agencies and universities can adopt this multi-dimensional approach for employing a holistic meta-framework to achieve accurate and credible remote accreditation of engineering programs.","output":"ABET Accreditation During and After COVID19 - Navigating the Digital Age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The debate on the pros and cons of employee attachment to social networking sites (SNS) has led to social media policy paralysis in many organizations, and often a prohibition on employee use of SNS.

We examined the relationship between DS and HAP after ischemic stroke. METHODS Get with the Guidelines-Stroke defines HAP as postadmission diagnosis of pneumonia requiring antibiotics, and DS as the use of bedside swallow screening prior to oral intake. Univariable and multivariable analyses examined the relationship between DS and HAP. RESULTS Among 314,007 ischemic stroke patients at 1244 Get with the Guidelines-Stroke hospitals from 2003-2009 who were eligible for DS and had completed HAP data, a total of 216,372 (68.9%) underwent DS and a total of 17,906 (5.7%) developed HAP. When compared with patients without HAP, patients with HAP were older, had admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (median NIHSS score: 10 versus 4), were more likely to undergo DS (75.5% versus 68.5%), and had increased length of stay and in-hospital mortality (12.4% versus 2.3%). In multivariable analyses, factors independently associated with a lower risk of HAP were female gender (odds ratio [OR] 0.84), dyslipidemia (OR 0.84), and hypertension (OR 0.94). DS was associated with a higher adjusted OR for HAP (OR 1.40), but the OR was greatly attenuated after adding NIHSS score to the model (OR 1.10). CONCLUSIONS HAP occurs in 1 of 17 hospitalized stroke patients and is associated with a greater than 5-fold increase in mortality. DS did not occur in 31.1% of eligible patients, with increased screening among those with more severe strokes and those who developed HAP. The attenuation of the relationship between DS and HAP risk when controlling for NIHSS score suggests the association between screening and pneumonia is confounded by severity.

The models used in the discovery of cancer treatment are continuously changing and extending toward advanced preclinical studies. Cancer models are either naturally existing or artificially prepared experimental systems that show similar features with human tumors though the heterogeneous nature of the tumor is very familiar. The choice of the most fitting model to best reflect the given tumor system is one of the real difficulties for cancer examination. Therefore, vast studies have been conducted on the cancer models for developing a better understanding of cancer invasion, progression, and early detection. These models give an insight into cancer etiology, molecular basis, host tumor interaction, the role of microenvironment, and tumor heterogeneity in tumor metastasis. These models are also used to predict novel cancer markers, targeted therapies, and are extremely helpful in drug development. In this review, the potential of cancer models to be used as a platform for drug screening and therapeutic discoveries are highlighted. Although none of the cancer models is regarded as ideal because each is associated with essential caveats that restraint its application yet by bridging the gap between preliminary cancer research and translational medicine.

No evidence regarding optimal treatment targets exists. METHODS The Carbon dioxide, Oxygen, and Mean arterial pressure After Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (COMACARE) trial is a pilot multi-center randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the feasibility of targeting low- or high-normal PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP in comatose, mechanically ventilated patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), as well as its effect on brain injury markers. Using a 23 factorial design, participants are randomized upon admission to an intensive care unit into one of eight groups with various combinations of PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP target levels for 36 h after admission. The primary outcome is neuron-specific enolase (NSE) serum concentration at 48 h after cardiac arrest. The main feasibility outcome is the between-group differences in PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP during the 36 h after ICU admission. Secondary outcomes include serum concentrations of NSE, S100 protein, and cardiac troponin at 24, 48, and 72 h after cardiac arrest; cerebral oxygenation, measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS); potential differences in epileptic activity, monitored via continuous electroencephalogram (EEG); and neurological outcomes at six months after cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION The trial began in March 2016 and participant recruitment has begun in all seven study sites as of March 2017. Currently, 115 of the total of 120 patients have been included. When completed, the results of this trial will provide preliminary clinical evidence regarding the feasibility of targeting low- or high-normal PaCO2, PaO2, and MAP values and its effect on developing brain injury, brain oxygenation, and epileptic seizures after cardiac arrest.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed, including all women aged 17C41 years admitted to a level 3 ICU in the Netherlands, between January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2016. Primary outcome was indication for admission and mortality. Mortality, length of stay (LOS), need for mechanical ventilation and APACHE II score were compared between obstetric and non-obstetric admissions. The obstetric group was further analyzed for maternal and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: 3461 women (median age 32 years) were included, with an overall mortality rate of 13.3%. The obstetric group consisted of 265 women (7.7%). The non-obstetric group (n = 3196) was admitted most often for cardiovascular disease (19.6%), followed by oncologic disease (15%). Mortality was the highest in women with oncologic disease (23.9%). The obstetric group had lower mortality compared to the non-obstetric group (4.9% vs. 14%, p < 0.001), despite higher APACHE II score (14 vs. 11, p < 0.001) and a higher ventilation rate (47.9% vs. 39%, p = 0.004).

Failure to translate viral mRNAs and generate viral proteins would affect the propagation and evolution of a virus. Thus, independently of their size, complexity, and genomes, viruses evolved sophisticated molecular mechanisms to hijack the translational apparatus of a host in order to recruit ribosomes for efficient protein production. One of the prevalent mechanisms of translation regulation utilized by viruses is non-canonical translation initiation. It is often governed by the 5-untranslated regions (5-UTRs) present upstream of a protein-coding sequence in viral mRNAs, such as internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) and capindependent translation enhancers (CITEs). Viruses can also utilize canonical translation initiation factors of a host in non-canonical ways. Understanding strategies and mechanisms used by viruses to generate proteins is an important task, as it might help develop new therapeutic interventions. We previously have demonstrated that mRNA from the genome of the black beetle virus (BBV) of the Nodaviridae family contains short and unstructured 5-UTR, which governs translation initiation as a CITE and as a canonical translational enhancer. In this Commentary, we summarize cap-dependent and cap-independent translation initiation mechanisms and further elaborate on the unique ability of the BBV mRNA 5-UTR to switch between these two modes of translation initiation in the context of the viral life cycle.

To address this knowledge gap, this study estimated the cumulative deficits of routine vaccine doses among US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimated the time and effort needed to recover from those deficits. METHODS: Monthly reductions in Tdap, meningococcal, and HPV doses administered to US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic were quantified using MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters data. The time and effort required to reverse the vaccination deficit under various catch-up scenarios were estimated.

Patients can suffer acute severe pain and may have long-term mental, cognitive, and functional health deterioration after discharge. However, few controlled trials are evaluating interventions for the prevention and treatment of PICS. The study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The primary objective is to determine whether the program is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life, incidence of chronic pain and degree of functional limitation, incidence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. METHODS: The PAINCOVID trial is a unicentric randomized, controlled, patient-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups. The primary endpoint is the health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This paper details the methodology and statistical analysis plan of the trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. The estimated sample size is 84 patients, 42 for each arm.

DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews. Due to social distancing and associated COVID-19 restrictions at the time of the study, the interviews were held remotely via telephone. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the interview data. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: A large urban tertiary referral maternity unit (greater than 8000 births per year) in the Republic of Ireland. Women of low and high obstetric risk, primiparous and multiparous, who gave birth in April or May of 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Women were invited to take part via a hospital-based gatekeeper who had no other involvement in the study. FINDINGS: Nineteen women consented to take part and were interviewed. Four dominant themes reflective of women's views and experiences emerged during data analysis. These were: navigating the system, at the end of the day it's just you, preparing for and adapting to uncertainty and blessing in disguise. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Women experienced added challenges as a result of COVID-19 associated altered care structures and processes. Some changes implemented in response to the pandemic were positively experienced by women. The findings will contribute to and assist in planning future services for women and their partners, and in tailoring care to meet women's expectations and needs as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and beyond.","output":"Women's views and experiences of maternity care during COVID-19 in Ireland: A qualitative descriptive study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction In the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic era, it is essential to rule out COVID-19 effectively to prevent transmission in both communities and medical facilities. According to previous reports in high prevalence areas, CT screening may be useful in the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, the value of CT screening in low prevalence areas has scarcely been reported. Methods This report examines the diagnostic efficacy of CT screening before admission to a hospital in Tokyo. We conducted a retrospective analysis at Keio University Hospital from April 6, 2020, through May 29, 2020. We set up an outpatient screening clinic on April 6 for COVID-19, administering both PCR with nasopharyngeal swabs and chest CT for all patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. Results A total of 292 asymptomatic patients were included in this study. There were three PCR-positive patients, and they all had negative CT findings, which revealed that both the sensitivity and positive predictive value of CT (PPV) were 0%. There were nine CT-positive patients; the specificity and the negative predictive value (NPV) were 96.9% and 98.9%, respectively. Conclusion CT screening was not useful in low prevalence areas at this time in Tokyo, even with the inclusion of the most prevalent phase. Given that the utility of CT screening depends on disease prevalence, the criteria for performing CT screening based on the prevalence of COVID-19 should be established.","output":"CT Screening for COVID-19 in Asymptomatic Patients before Hospital Admission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on acute and elective thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures. METHODS: Forty departments shared their data on acute and elective thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures between January and May 2020 and January and May 2019 in Europe, Asia and the USA. Admission rates as well as delay from onset of symptoms to referral were compared. RESULTS: No differences in the number of acute thoracic and abdominal aortic procedures were observed between 2020 and the reference period in 2019 [incidence rates ratio (IRR): 0.96, confidence interval (CI) 0.89-1.04; P = 0.39]. Also, no difference in the time interval from acute onset of symptoms to referral was recorded (<12 h 32% vs > 12 h 68% in 2020, < 12 h 34% vs > 12 h 66% in 2019 P = 0.29). Conversely, a decline of 35% in elective procedures was seen (IRR: 0.81, CI 0.76-0.87; P < 0.001) with substantial differences between countries and the most pronounced decline in Italy (-40%, P < 0.001). Interestingly, in Switzerland, an increase in the number of elective cases was observed (+35%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: There was no change in the number of acute thoracic and abdominal aortic cases and procedures during the initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the case load of elective operations and procedures decreased significantly.

Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been associated with a host of symptoms affecting numerous organ systems, including the lungs, cardiovascular system, kidney, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and skin, among others. OBJECTIVE: Although several risk factors have been identified as related to complications from and severity of COVID-19, much about the virus remains unknown. The host immune response appears to affect the outcome of disease. It is not surprising that patients with intrinsic or secondary immune compromise might be particularly susceptible to complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathogenic loss-of-function or gain-of-function heterozygous variants in nuclear factor-&#954;B2 have been reported to be associated with either a combined immunodeficiency or common variable immunodeficiency phenotype. METHODS: We evaluated the functional consequence and immunologic phenotype of a novel NFKB2 loss of function variant in a 17-year-old male patient and describe the clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this context. RESULTS: This patient required a 2-week hospitalization for SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 7 days of mechanical ventilation. We used biologic therapies to avert potentially fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome and treat hyperinflammatory responses. The patient had an immunologic phenotype of B-cell dysregulation with decreased switched memory B cells. Despite the underlying immune dysfunction, he recovered from the infection with intense management. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical case exemplifies some of the practical challenges in management of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in the context of underlying immune dysregulation.","output":"Severe SARS-CoV-2 disease in the context of a NF-B2 loss-of-function pathogenic variant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Surveillance programs and research for acute respiratory infections in remote Aboriginal communities are complicated by difficulties in the storage and transport of frozen samples to urban laboratories for testing.

Although social connectivity is a defining condition for virus transmission, the network paradigm in the study of the COVID-19 spatio-temporal spread has not been used accordingly. Toward contributing to this demand, this paper uses network analysis to develop a multidimensional methodological framework for understanding the uneven (cross-country) spread of COVID-19 in the context of the globally interconnected economy. The globally interconnected system of tourism mobility is modeled as a complex network and studied within the context of a three-dimensional (3D) conceptual model composed of network connectivity, economic openness, and spatial impedance variables. The analysis reveals two main stages in the temporal spread of COVID-19, defined by the cutting-point of the 44th day from Wuhan. The first describes the outbreak in Asia and North America, the second stage in Europe, South America, and Africa, while the outbreak in Oceania intermediates. The analysis also illustrates that the average node degree exponentially decays as a function of COVID-19 emergence time. This finding implies that the highly connected nodes, in the Global Tourism Network (GTN), are disproportionally earlier infected by the pandemic than the other nodes. Moreover, countries with the same network centrality as China are early infected on average by COVID-19. The paper also finds that network interconnectedness, economic openness, and transport integration are critical determinants in the early global spread of the pandemic, and it reveals that the spatio-temporal patterns of the worldwide spreading of COVID-19 are more a matter of network interconnectivity than of spatial proximity.","output":"Understanding the uneven spread of COVID-19 in the context of the global interconnected economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identifying economically viable intervention measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission on aircraft is of critical importance especially as new SARS-CoV2 variants emerge. Computational fluid-particle dynamic simulations are employed to investigate aerosol transmission and intervention measures on a Boeing 737 cabin zone. The present study compares aerosol transmission in three models: (a) a model at full passenger capacity (60 passengers), (b) a model at reduced capacity (40 passengers), and (c) a model at full capacity with sneeze guards/shields between passengers. Lagrangian simulations are used to model aerosol transport using particle sizes in the 1C50 m range, which spans aerosols emitted during breathing, speech, and coughing. Sneeze shields placed between passengers redirect the local air flow and transfer part of the lateral momentum of the air to longitudinal momentum. This mechanism is exploited to direct more particles to the back of the seats in front of the index patient (aerosol source) and reduce lateral transfer of aerosol particles to other passengers. It is demonstrated that using sneeze shields on full capacity flights can reduce aerosol transmission to levels below that of reduced capacity flights without sneeze shields.","output":"Simulation of aerosol transmission on a Boeing 737 airplane with intervention measures for COVID-19 mitigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on gender disparities in three employment outcomes: labor force participation, full-time employment, and unemployment.

We also test separate models to examine differences between women and men based on the presence of young children. Because the economic effects of the epidemic coincided with the summer months, when women's employment often declines, we account for seasonality in women's employment status.

Cyclophilin A (CYPA) is upregulated in EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) with unknown roles. In the present approach, cytosolic CYPA was found to be bound with EBNA1 into the nucleus. The amino acid 376-459 of the EBNA1 domain was important for the binding. CYPA depletion attenuated and ectopic CYPA expression improved EBNA1 expression in EBV-positive cells. The loss of viral copy number was also accelerated by CYPA consumption in daughter cells during culture passages. Mechanistically, CYPA mediated the connection of EBNA1 with oriP (origin of EBV DNA replication) and subsequent oriP transcription, which is a key step for the initiation of EBV genome replication. Moreover, CYPA overexpression markedly antagonized the connection of EBNA1 to Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7), which is a strong host barrier with a role of inhibiting EBV genome replication. The PPIase activity of CYPA was required for the promotion of oriP transcription and antagonism with USP7. The results revealed a strategy that EBV recruited a host factor to counteract the host defense, thus facilitating its own latent genome replication. This study provides a new insight into EBV pathogenesis and potential virus-targeted therapeutics in EBV-associated NPC, in which CYPA is upregulated at all stages.","output":"Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen 1 Recruits Cyclophilin A to Facilitate the Replication of Viral DNA Genome"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A produ??o in vitro de embri?es exp?e o concepto a condi??es diferentes do ambiente intra-tubrico-uterino.

Although the causal relationship among mutations and the features of SARS-CoV-2 such as rapid transmission, pathogenicity, and tropism, remains unclear, our results of genomic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 may help to interpret the interaction between genomic characterization in SARS-CoV-2 and infectivity with the host. METHODS: A total of 4,254 genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID). Multiple sequence alignment for phylogenetic analysis and comparative genomic approach for mutation analysis were conducted using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA), and an in-house program based on Perl language, respectively. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 strains indicated that there were 3 major clades including S, V, and G, and 2 subclades (G.1 and G.2). There were 767 types of synonymous and 1,352 types of non-synonymous mutation. ORF1a, ORF1b, S, and N genes were detected at high frequency, whereas ORF7b and E genes exhibited low frequency. In the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S gene, 11 non-synonymous mutations were observed in the region adjacent to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site. CONCLUSION: It has been reported that the rapid infectivity and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 associated with host receptor affinity are derived from several mutations in its genes. Without these genetic mutations to enhance evolutionary adaptation, species recognition, host receptor affinity, and pathogenicity, it would not survive.

METHODS Retrospective review of all patients with laboratory-confirmed NVG at The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario), from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2005. RESULTS One hundred forty-two episodes of NVG were found among 133 patients, occurring in 0.48 of 100 admissions. The median age was two years; 42% were <1 year of age and 41% were immunocompromised. The most commonly detected pathogen was torovirus (67% of episodes), followed by rotavirus (19%) and adenovirus (9%). Seventy-five cases (53%) were epidemiologically linked in 32 separate clusters (median cluster size two, range two to four).

Taking into account the pre-test scores as the covariate, an adjusted analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed significant depletion in anxiety and depression in general (F (2.91) = 4.488; p = 0.014; (2) = 0.090) and depression in particular (F (2, 91) = 6.653; p = 0.002; (2) = 0.128 at the post-test visit, maintaining their effects for 3 months (F (2.79) = 3.031; p = 0.050; (2) = 0.071F (2.79) = 2.874; p = 0.049; (2) = 0.068, respectively), which is associated with the use of a standard training program. The abbreviated training program did not have a significant effect on the level of anxiety and depression. The standard MBSR training program had a positive effect on anxiety and depression and promotes long-lasting effects in tutors and resident practitioners. New research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of abbreviated versions of training programs.","output":"Mindfulness-Based Program for Anxiety and Depression Treatment in Healthcare Professionals: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Germany has some peculiarities when it comes to dealing with financial issues.

A test-and-isolate strategy, using PCR diagnostic tests, could help to minimise the impact of this second wave. Meanwhile, population-level serological surveillance can provide valuable insights into the level of immunity in the population. Using a mathematical model, consistent with an Indian megacity, we examined how seroprevalence data could guide a test-and-isolate strategy, for fully lifting restrictions. For example, if seroprevalence is 20% of the population, we show that a testing strategy needs to identify symptomatic cases within 5-8 days of symptom onset, in order to prevent a resurgent wave from overwhelming hospital capacity in the city. This estimate is robust to uncertainty in the effectiveness of the lockdown, as well as in immune protection against reinfection. To set these results in their economic context, we estimate that the weekly cost of such a PCR-based testing programme would be less than 2.1% of the weekly economic loss due to the lockdown. Our results illustrate how PCR-based testing and serological surveillance can be combined to design evidence-based policies, for lifting lockdowns in Indian cities and elsewhere.","output":"Combining serology with case-detection, to allow the easing of restrictions against SARS-CoV-2: a modelling-based study in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"High fidelity simulations of expiratory events such as coughing provide the opportunity to predict the fate of the droplets from the turbulent jet cloud produced from a cough.

Previous improvement work has been targeted at this care transition, but gaps in discharge communication still exist. We aimed to increase documentation of 2-way communication between hospitalists and primary care providers (PCPs) for high-risk discharges from pediatric hospital medicine (PHM) services from 7% to 60% within 30 months. METHODS A3 improvement methodology was used. A list of high-risk discharge communication criteria was developed through engagement of PCPs and hospitalists. A driver diagram guided interventions. The outcome measure was documentation of successful 2-way communication with the PCP. Any documented 2-way discharge communication attempt was the process measure. Via a survey, hospitalist satisfaction with the discharge communication expectation served as the balancing measure. All patients discharged from PHM services meeting 1 high-risk criterion were included. Statistical process control charts were used to assess changes over time. RESULTS There were 3241 high-risk discharges (442 baseline: November 2017 to January 2018; 2799 intervention and sustain: February 2018 to June 2020). The outcome measure displayed iterative special cause variation from a mean baseline of 7% to peak of 39% but regressed and was sustained at 27%. The process measure displayed iterative special cause variation from a 13% baseline mean to a 64% peak, with regression to 41%. The balancing measure worsened from baseline of 5% dissatisfaction to 13%.

The ideal solutions centered on the creation of a predictive analytic tool that would help social service providers determine who is most likely, based on a set of weighted risk factors, to engage in gun violence. As various entities started to lay the foundation for implementing the CDCs recommendations, they faced several hurdles directly related to this new technological solution. After careful consideration and thorough vetting, which was also recommended by the CDC, led by Governor Carneys Family Services Cabinet Council (FSCC), Delaware concluded two things: a tool of this nature presents ethical issues, and there are evidence-based strategies to identify those engaging or likely to engage in gun violence; and notwithstanding the ethical concerns surrounding the tool, Delaware lacked the technology infrastructure and staffing to develop such a tool. Ultimately, good collaboration (facilitated by Social Contract, a local consulting firm) through the FSCC fostered an alternate path forward in keeping with the spirit of the CDCs recommendations; while the CDCs recommendations were not precisely enacted, their contribution has led to investments and capacity building in Delaware to support individuals and families most proximal to the problem. Ultimately, convening stakeholders to fully examine an issue and ideate solutions with the most potential for impact resulted in two meaningful outcomes: (1) an innovative approach to ultimately reduce gun violence in the City of Wilmington through widespread collaboration of state services, developing meaningful relationships with those directly engaged in gun violence; and (2) the creation of a statewide data-sharing system that will help improve service delivery and outcomes for Delawareans in need.","output":"The Data Dilemma:: How Delaware is Responding to the CDCs Recommendations on Gun Violence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Influenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections and substantial health concerns.

Avian immunoglobulins (IgY) have been previously shown in animal models to protect against new infection and mitigate established infection when applied intranasally. We carried out a proof-of-concept study to address the feasibility of using such antibodies as mucosally-applied prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Hens were immunized with recombinant S1 spike glycoprotein of the virus, and the resulting IgY was evaluated for binding specificity, inhibition of glycoprotein binding to angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein (the requisite binding site for the virus), and inhibition of viral replication in Vero cell culture. RESULTS: Titers of anti-S1 glycoprotein IgY were evident in yolks at 14 days post-immunization, peaking at 21 days, and at peak concentrations of 16.8 mg/ml. IgY showed strong and significant inhibition of S1/ACE2 binding interactions, and significantly inhibited viral replication at a concentration of 16.8 mg/ml. Four weeks' collection from eggs of two hens produced a total of 1.55 grams of IgY. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study we showed that avian immunoglobulins (IgY) raised against a key virulence factor of the SARS-CoV-2 virus successfully inhibited the critical initial adhesion of viral spike glycoproteins to human ACE2 protein receptors and inhibited viral replication in vitro, in a short period using only two laying hens.

This article seeks to examine the perception of crisis and emergency risk communication in an acute hospital in response to COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore and to identify its associated enablers and barriers. METHODS: A 13-item Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) Survey, based on the US Centers for Disease and Control (CDC) CERC framework, was developed and administered to hospital staff during February 24C28, 2020. The survey also included an open-ended question to solicit feedback on areas of CERC in need of improvement. Chi-square test was used for analysis of survey data. Thematic analysis was performed on qualitative feedback. RESULTS: Of the 1154 participants who responded to the survey, most (94.1%) reported that regular hospital updates on COVID-19 were understandable and actionable. Many (92.5%) stated that accurate, concise and timely information helped to keep them safe. A majority (92.3%) of them were clear about the hospitals response to the COVID-19 situation, and 79.4% of the respondents reported that the hospital had been able to understand their challenges and address their concerns.

Local leaders within the hospital would need support to better communicate and translate hospital updates in response to COVID-19 to actionable plans for their staff. Better communication in executing resource utilization plans, expressing more empathy and care for their staff, and enhancing communication channels, such as through the use of secure text messaging rather than emails would be important. CONCLUSION: CERC is relevant and important in the hospital setting to managing COVID-19 and should be considered concurrently with hospital emergency response domains.

Its symptoms cause a long-term decline in patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL). Inconsistencies often occur between the clinical findings and the subjective symptoms of DED. Therefore, a holistic, balanced, and quantitative evaluation of the subjective symptoms and HRQL using patient-reported outcome questionnaires, in addition to clinical findings, is crucial for accurate DED assessment in patients. This paper reviewed the characteristics of current dry eye questionnaires, including their objectives, number of questions, inclusion of HRQL-related items, and whether they were properly evaluated for psychometric properties. Twenty-four questionnaires were identified; among them, the following six questionnaires that included items assessing HRQL and were properly evaluated for psychometric properties are recommended: the Ocular Surface Disease Index, Impact of Dry Eye in Everyday Life, Dry Eye-Related Quality-of-life Score, University of North Carolina Dry Eye Management Scale, Chinese version of Dry Eye-Related Quality of Life, and 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire.

First, the well-posedness of the multi-scale model is discussed, followed by the stability analysis of the equilibrium points. The disease-free equilibrium point is shown to be globally asymptotically stable for $R_0<1$. When $R_0$ exceeds unity, a unique infected equilibrium exists, and the system is found to undergo a forward (trans-critical) bifurcation at $R_0=1$. Two parameter heat plots are also done to find the parameter combinations for which the equilibrium points are stable. The parameters $\\\\beta, \\\\pi$ and $\\\\Lambda$ are found to be most sensitive to $R_0$. The influence of within-host sub-model parameter on the between-host sub-model variables is numerically illustrated. The spread of infection in a community is shown to be influenced by within-host level sub-model parameters, such as the production of viral particles by infected cells $(\\\\alpha)$, the clearance rate of infected cells by the immune system $(x)$, and the clearance rate of viral particles by the immune system $(y)$. The comparative effectiveness of the three health interventions (antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, and generalized social distancing) for COVID-19 infection was examined using the effective reproductive number $R_E$ as an indicator of the effectiveness of the interventions. The results suggest that a combined strategy of antiviral drugs, immunomodulators and generalized social distancing would be the best strategy to implement to contain the spread of infection in the community.","output":"A Nested Multi-Scale Model for COVID-19 Viral Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND In obese patients, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) following sleeve gastrectomy under titration of total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and the relevance of risk factors to indicate prophylaxis is unknown. OBJECTIVES The hypothesis was that after automated TIVA, prophylaxis reduces PONV following laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Our objective was to determine the incidence of PONV and evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone and ondansetron as prophylaxis when automated intravenous anaesthesia is employed. DESIGN A randomised, placebo-controlled, single-centre, double-blinded study. SETTING Secondary care centre in New Caledonia from June 2013 to January 2014. PATIENTS A total of 122 patients were randomised and 117 (92 women) were included in the analysis (58 in the prophylaxis group and 59 in the placebo group). Eligibility criteria included at least two of the known risk factors for PONV: female sex, nonsmoking status, prior history of PONV or motion sickness and expected postoperative opioid analgesia. Exclusion criteria included disorders limiting the use of the bispectral index. INTERVENTIONS All patients received propofol and remifentanil controlled by the same automated system during induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. The controller modifies the calculated effect-site concentrations according to bispectral index values. Patients received either intravenous dexamethasone 4 mg after tracheal intubation and ondansetron 4 mg during skin closure, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary endpoint was the cumulative incidences of 24-h PONV and severe PONV (vomiting or nausea with a score of 4 on an 11-point verbal rating scale). Data are presented as percentage (95% confidence interval). RESULTS PONV in the first 24 h occurred in 45 (34 to 60)% of patients who received prophylaxis and 54 (41 to 67)% in the placebo group (P = 0.35). The numbers of patients who suffered severe PONV [19 (10 to 32)% in the prophylaxis group vs. 20 (11 to 33)%, P = 1, in the placebo group] and who required rescue antiemetic drugs [55 (41 to 68) vs. 63 (49 to 75)%, P = 0.46] were similar between the groups.

There is insufficient evidence from previous studies about the role of several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) in the early development of DN. This study aimed to describe the expression of miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-25, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 in a sample of type 1 diabetic children and adolescents to explore their association with DN and some indices of kidney injury. Patients and Methods Seventy type 1 diabetic patients, with 5 years' duration of diabetes or more, were recruited from Children's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of the above mentioned miRNAs in serum and to assess its association with DN, and the studied risk factors. Results There was a significantly higher percentage of up-regulation of miRNA-377 and miRNA-93 (P=0.03, 0.02, respectively) in addition to significant down-regulation of miRNA-25 (P=0.01) in patients with DN than in patients without DN. In patients with DN, expression of miR-216a was significantly negatively correlated with creatinine (r=-0.4, P=0.04) and positively correlated with eGFR using creatinine (r=0.5, P=0.03). In the same group, expression of miR-21 was positively correlated with urinary cystatin C (r=0.6, P=0.01) and was negatively correlated with e-GFR using cystatin c (r=-0.6, P=0.01). miRNA-93 was associated with increased risk (odds ratio=15, 95% CI=12.03-24.63, P=0.01), while miRNA-25 was associated with decreased risk for albuminuria (odds ratio=0.15, 95% CI=0.08-0.55, P=0.03). Conclusion miRNA-377, miRNA-93, miRNA-216a, and miRNA-21 may be implicated in the pathogenesis of DN, while miRNA-25 may have a reno-protective role.

Consistent basic data suggest that these same checkpoints are critical negative regulators of atherosclerosis. Therefore, our objectives were to test whether ICIs were associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and a higher risk of atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular events. Methods: The study was situated in a single academic medical center. The primary analysis evaluated whether exposure to an ICI was associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular events in 2842 patients and 2842 controls, matched by age, a history of cardiovascular events and cancer type. In a second design, a case-crossover analysis was performed with an \\"at-risk period\\" defined as the two-year period after and the \\"control period\\" as the two-year prior to treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization and ischemic stroke). Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Additionally, in an imaging sub-study (n=40), the rate of atherosclerotic plaque progression was compared from before and after starting an ICI. All study measures and outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results: In the matched cohort study, there was a 3-fold higher risk for cardiovascular events after starting an ICI (HR, 3.3 [95% CI, 2.0-5.5]; P<0.001). There was a similar increase in each of the individual components of the primary outcome. In the case-crossover, there was also an increase in cardiovascular events from 1.37 to 6.55 per 100 person-years at two years (adjusted HR, 4.8 [95% CI, 3.5-6.5]; P<0.001). In the imaging study, the rate of progression of total aortic plaque volume was >3-fold higher with ICIs (from 2.1%/year pre-to 6.7%/year post). This association between ICI use and increased atherosclerotic plaque progression was attenuated with concomitant use of statins or corticosteroids. Conclusions: Cardiovascular events were higher after initiation of ICIs, potentially mediated by accelerated progression of atherosclerosis. Optimization of cardiovascular risk factors and increased awareness of cardiovascular risk, prior to, during and after treatment, should be considered among patients on an ICI.","output":"Association Between Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors with Cardiovascular Events and Atherosclerotic Plaque"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study examined the difficulties of running online physical education classes in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and used the findings to develop an efficient operation plan to address these difficulties.

We developed an efficient, rapid, and scalable surveillance strategy to detect remaining COVID-19 community cases through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not require reinstatement. METHODS: We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of the following: hospital cases; fever, cough and/or ARI testing at community/primary care; and asymptomatic testing; using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities, reproductive number (R) and weekly cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms using data from Australia. We assessed system requirements to identify all transmission chains and follow up all cases and primary contacts within each chain, per million population. RESULTS: Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and 30% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases present for testing, with R = 2.2, a median of 14 unrecognised community cases (8 infectious) occur when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 7 unrecognised cases (4 infectious) through community-based surveillance. The 7 unrecognised community upstream cases are estimated to generate a further 55C77 primary contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 10 if 50% of cases are asymptomatic. Screening asymptomatic community members cannot exhaustively identify all cases under any of the scenarios assessed. The most important determinant of testing requirements for symptomatic screening is levels of non-COVID-19 respiratory illness. If 4% of the community have respiratory symptoms, and 1% of those with symptoms have COVID-19, exhaustive symptomatic screening requires approximately 11,600 tests/million population using 1/4 pooling, with 98% of cases detected (2% missed), given 99.9% sensitivity. Even with a drop in sensitivity to 70%, pooling was more effective at detecting cases than individual testing under all scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS: Screening all acute respiratory disease in the community, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of COVID-19 community transmission. An important component is identification, testing, and management of all contacts, including upstream contacts (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains). Pooling allows increased case detection when testing capacity is limited, even given reduced test sensitivity. Critical to the effectiveness of all aspects of surveillance is appropriate community engagement, messaging to optimise testing uptake and compliance with other measures.

However, discovering single-agent therapies with activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been challenging. Combination therapies play an important role in antiviral therapies, due to their improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. Recent approaches have applied deep learning to identify synergistic drug combinations for diseases with vast preexisting datasets, but these are not applicable to new diseases with limited combination data, such as COVID-19. Given that drug synergy often occurs through inhibition of discrete biological targets, here we propose a neural network architecture that jointly learns drug?target interaction and drug?drug synergy. The model consists of two parts: a drug?target interaction module and a target?disease association module. This design enables the model to utilize drug?target interaction data and single-agent antiviral activity data, in addition to available drug?drug combination datasets, which may be small in nature. By incorporating additional biological information, our model performs significantly better in synergy prediction accuracy than previous methods with limited drug combination training data. We empirically validated our model predictions and discovered two drug combinations, remdesivir and reserpine as well as remdesivir and IQ-1S, which display strong antiviral SARS-CoV-2 synergy in vitro.

RESULTS Forty-four articles reporting the views of 11,566 stakeholders were included. Stakeholders were broadly supportive of returning \\"actionable\\" findings, but definitions of actionability varied. Stakeholder views on SF disclosure exist along a spectrum: potential WES/WGS recipients' views were largely influenced by a sense of rights, whereas views of genomics professionals were informed by a sense of professional responsibility. Experience with genetic illness and testing resulted in greater caution about SF, suggesting that truly informed decisions require an understanding of the implications and limitations of WES/WGS and possible findings.

We report the case of a 51-year-old Filipino asthmatic woman who developed post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis subsequently treated with Nintedanib. CASE REPORT: The patient presented with a 4-day history of flu-like symptoms in September 2020 and was eventually diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite receiving Dexamethasone, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, and multiple antibiotics, there was increasing oxygen requirement, necessitating ICU admission and high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). An additional course of hydrocortisone was given due to asthma exacerbation, gradually liberating her from the HFNC. A chest CT scan showed extensive parenchymal changes, for which she received methylprednisolone and physical rehabilitation with persistence of respiratory symptoms. After 40 days of hospitalization, she was sent home on oxygen support and Nintedanib. The patient initially had severe dyspnea (Borg Scale 7) with 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) of 295 meters. Pulmonary function showed moderately severe restrictive lung defect at 52% predicted total lung capacity (TLC) and severely reduced DLCO (28% predicted). Chest CT scoring indicated severe lung involvement. One month after Nintedanib treatment, her Borg Scale improved to 4. Her 6MWD, TLC, and DLCO increased to 434 meters, 64% predicted, and 36% predicted, respectively. A chest CT scan showed regressing fibrosis. After 6 months of treatment, her pulmonary function normalized. DLCO remained moderately reduced (59% predicted) but her 6MWD (457 meters) and CT scan results continued to improve. CONCLUSIONS: Nintedanib, along with other interventions, may have potentially improved pulmonary function and CT scan findings in a COVID-19 survivor with pulmonary fibrosis 6 months after treatment.","output":"Pulmonary Function and Chest Computed Tomography (CT) Scan Findings After Antifibrotic Treatment for COVID-19-Related Pulmonary Fibrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A growing literature evaluates online learning outcomes and pedagogy within the virtual classroom, though assessments of entire online programs are comparatively rare As online learning takes place through multiple modalities in multiple contexts, we were particularly eager to explore the informal and hidden curricula within the University of North Texas (UNT) online program in applied anthropologyCthe structural situations and circumstances of learning from the assignments, approaches, and pedagogies that we formally employ We draw on alumni assessments of value to identify where these informal and hidden areas of our curricula are, and the challenges and opportunities they present Our results underscore how much professional socialization takes place outside the online classroom, from gaining experience with virtual communication and collaborative work teams, balancing time\\\\management skills, and being able to apply anthropological knowledge to different work situations Current events (this manuscript was finalized at the time of widespread COVID\\\\19 shelter\\\\in\\\\place quarantines and shuttered offices) suggest that learning how to succeed at online collaborations and virtual work teams will rapidly become globally critical occupational skills, and professional teaching programs will be increasingly pressed to respond [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Annals of Anthropological Practice is the property of Wiley-Blackwell and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Are These Wings or a Jet Pack?

We describe key elements used to succeed and in what ways these positively impacted on the teams.Arguably, clinical leadership in nursing education reflects that described by Joseph and Huber (2015);the process of influencing point-of-care innovation and improvement in both organizational processes and individual care practices to achieve quality and safety of care outcomes.Necessity, combined with strong senior leadership during the initial stages of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, led to the Lead Practice Education team taking up leadership positions across the trust to ensure that teams were clinically supported with effective, responsive nursing education. This re-modelling of the team, coupled with adaptations to workstreams enabled a singular focus on clinical nursing. Whether through upskilling and refreshing those in non-ward based roles, disseminating changeable infection control advice or developing education plans for emerging conditions such as PIMS-TS, the leadership of this team was highly effective and well received.Since this time, Lead Practice Educators have been called upon to support the delivery of high flow humidified oxygen to more patients transferring from ICU, and most recently in supporting the Parenteral Nutrition intravenous lines crisis.

She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on routine nasal swab testing but denied cough or fever. Endocrine testing demonstrated an elevated serum prolactin level, and central hypothyroidism. MRI showed a cystic-solid lesion with a fluid level in the pituitary fossa and expansion of the sella consistent with pituitary apoplexy.

Epidemiological surveillance has highlighted an overwhelming occurrence of the highly pathogenic fungus Sporothrix brasiliensis during feline outbreaks, leading to massive transmissions to humans. Early diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by demonstrating the presence of a surrogate marker of infection can have a key role for selecting appropriate disease control measures and minimizing zoonotic transmission to humans. METHODOLOGY: We explored the presence and diversity of serum antibodies (IgG) specific against Sporothrix antigens in cats with sporotrichosis and evaluated the utility of these antibodies for serodiagnosis. Antigen profiling included protein extracts from the closest known relatives S. brasiliensis and S. schenckii. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunoblotting enabled us to characterize the major antigens of feline sporotrichosis from sera from cats with sporotrichosis (n = 49), healthy cats (n = 19), and cats with other diseases (n = 20). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based quantitation of anti-Sporothrix IgG exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in cats with sporotrichosis (area under the curve, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.94C1; P<0.0001) versus controls. The two sets of Sporothrix antigens were remarkably cross-reactive, supporting the hypothesis that antigenic epitopes may be conserved among closely related agents. One-dimensional immunoblotting indicated that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase (a 60-kDa protein in S. brasiliensis and a 70-kDa protein in S. schenckii) is the immunodominant antigen in feline sporotrichosis. Two-dimensional immunoblotting revealed six IgG-reactive isoforms of gp60 in the S. brasiliensis proteome, similar to the humoral response found in human sporotrichosis. CONCLUSIONS: A convergent IgG-response in various hosts (mice, cats, and humans) has important implications for our understanding of the coevolution of Sporothrix and its warm-blooded hosts. We propose that 3-carboxymuconate cyclase has potential for the serological diagnosis of sporotrichosis and as target for the development of an effective multi-species vaccine against sporotrichosis in animals and humans.","output":"Proteomics-Based Characterization of the Humoral Immune Response in Sporotrichosis: Toward Discovery of Potential Diagnostic and Vaccine Antigens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Multidisciplinary conferences (MDC) are an important component of head and neck oncologic care including diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.

Despite the growing evidence about the link between the pandemic, its control measures, and mental health worldwide, there is still no regional evidence of the potential mental health impact. We describe the prevalence and distribution of depressive symptoms across demographic and socioeconomic risk factors in the Peruvian population amidst a national lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted during the community transmission phase and national lockdown in Peru (May 4thC16th, 2020). We recorded 64,493 responses from adult Peruvian residents through an opt-in online questionnaire. All analyses were weighted using raking based on proportions of sociodemographic variables from the last Peruvian census in 2017. The prevalence of depressive symptoms was calculated using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of 10 or more. We identified associated demographic and socioeconomic factors by prior mental health diagnosis. Sensitivity analysis considered an alternative cut-off point for depressive symptoms of PHQ-9  14. RESULTS: A total of 57,446 participants were included in the analytical sample. A third of the participants (n = 23,526, unweighted) showed depressive symptoms in the 2 weeks prior to the study. Participants who reported a previous mental health diagnosis doubled the sample prevalence of depressive symptoms (59, 95%CI 56.7, 61.4%) of those without a prior diagnosis. Psychosocial and functioning reactions were largely more prevalent among females and young adults. A dose-response relationship was found between household income and depressive symptoms across previous mental health diagnosis strata, being as low as 32% less in the wealthiest than the most impoverished group (PR: 0.68, 95%CI 0.58,0.79). Other critical factors associated with a higher burden of depressive symptoms were lower education level, single, unemployed, and chronic comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: An increased burden of depressive symptoms and psychosocial reactions has emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic in Peru compared to previous years. The mental health burden disproportionately affects women, the younger population, and those with low income and education. As the country eases the social distancing measures, it is crucial to use local evidence to adjust public health policies and mental health services to the renewed population needs.

Whole blood from 16 donors was incubated with air bubbles without or with inhibitors of C3, C5, C5aR1, or CD14. Complement activation, hemostasis, and cytokine release were measured using ELISA and quantitative PCR. Compared with no air, incubating blood with air bubbles increased, on average, C3a 6.5-fold, C3bc 6-fold, C3bBbP 3.7-fold, C5a 4.6-fold, terminal complement complex sC5b9 3.6-fold, prothrombin fragments 1+2 (PTF1+2) 25-fold, tissue factor mRNA (TF-mRNA) 26-fold, microparticle tissue factor 6.1-fold, -thromboglobulin 26-fold (all p < 0.05), and 25 cytokines 11-fold (range, 1.5C78-fold; all p < 0.0001). C3 inhibition attenuated complement and reduced PTF1+2 2-fold, TF-mRNA 5.4-fold, microparticle tissue factor 2-fold, and the 25 cytokines 2.7-fold (range, 1.4C4.9-fold; all p < 0.05). C5 inhibition reduced PTF1+2 2-fold and TF-mRNA 12-fold (all p < 0.05). C5 or CD14 inhibition alone reduced three cytokines, including IL-1 (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03). Combined C3 and CD14 inhibition reduced all cytokines 3.9-fold (range, 1.3C9.5-fold; p < 0.003) and was most pronounced for IL-1 (3.2- versus 6.4-fold), IL-6 (2.5- versus 9.3-fold), IL-8 (4.9- versus 8.6-fold), and IFN- (5- versus 9.5-fold).

Social support correlated with less mental health problems. HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic. We assessed the certainty of the estimates of prevalence of these symptoms as very low using GRADE.

Second, I develop an Aristotelian account of radical hope, drawing from ancient philosophy, virtue ethics, and recent climate ethics.

As far as we know, the effect of isotretinoin on COVID-19 has not been studied before. AIM: We aimed to evaluate whether patients receiving oral isotretinoin are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection by comparing them with patients on topical treatment for acne vulgaris. METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively from a cohort of 267 acne vulgaris patients, who were under follow-up for acne vulgaris treatment during the pandemic period. RESULTS: Total of 227 patients (141 receiving isotretinoin treatment and 86 receiving topical treatment) were included of whom 29 patients had COVID-19 infection during acne vulgaris treatment. Fifteen (10.6%) patients were receiving oral isotretinoin and 14 (16.3%) were receiving topical acne treatment at the time of COVID-19 infection. The mean cumulative dose was 2340  1988 mg at the time of COVID-19 infection. The mean elapsed time between the onset of isotretinoin treatment and positive PCR result for COVID-19 was 13.3  10.3 weeks. Nine patients (64.3%) receiving isotretinoin treatment and 9 patients (60%) under topical treatment had loss of taste and smell during COVID-19 infection. Isotretinoin treatment was not found to be associated with a significant increased risk of getting COVID-19 (odds ratio, 0.671; 95% confidence interval, 0.247-1.823; P = 0.434).

Few studies have sought to understand how risk perceptions related to social interaction and essential activities during the COVID-19 pandemic vary by sociodemographic factors, information that could inform targeted interventions to reduce inequities in access to care and information. Methods: We conducted a nationally representative online survey of 1,592 adults in the United States to understand risk perceptions related to transmission of COVID-19 for various social and essential activities. We assessed relationships for each activity, after weighting to adjust for the survey design, using bivariate comparisons and multivariable logistic regression modeling, between responses of safe and unsafe, and participant characteristics, including age, gender, race, education, income, and political affiliation. Results: Half of participants were younger than 45 years (n=844, 53.0%), female (n=800, 50.3%), and White/Caucasian (n=685, 43.0%), Black/African American (n=410, 25.8%), or Hispanic/Latino (n=382, 24.0%). Risk perceptions of unsafe for 13 activities ranged from 29.2% to 73.5%. Large gatherings, indoor dining, and visits with elderly relatives had the highest proportion of unsafe responses (>58%) while activities outdoor, visiting the doctor or dentist, and going to the grocery store had the lowest (<36%). Older respondents were more likely to view social gatherings and indoor activities as unsafe, yet more likely to view activities such as going to the grocery store, participating in outdoor activities, visiting elderly relatives, and visiting the doctor or emergency room as safe. Compared to White/Caucasian respondents, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino respondents were more likely to view activities such as dining and visiting friends outdoor as unsafe. Generally, men vs. women, Republicans vs. Democrats and independents, and individuals with higher vs. lower income were more likely to view activities as safe. Conclusions: These findings suggest the importance of sociodemographic differences in risk perception, health behaviors, and access to information and health care when implementing efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Further research should address how evidence-based interventions can be tailored considering these differences with a goal of increased health equity in the pandemic response.","output":"COVID-19 risk perceptions of social interaction and essential activities and inequity in the United States: Results from a nationally representative survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"School closures, home quarantine, and social distancing implemented worldwide can cause a sudden anxiety even among teachers.

Objective: We present the analysis of a COVID-19 outbreak in a hemodialysis center in Belgium and report the incidence, clinical course, and outcome of the disease. Design: A retrospective cross-sectional cohort study. Setting: A hemodialysis center during the COVID-19 outbreak. Patients: A total of 62 patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a tertiary care center in Belgium attended by 26 health care workers. Measurements: Baseline patients characteristics were retrieved. The incidence, clinical course, and outcome were reported. The differences between COVID-19 survivors and nonsurvivors were assessed along with the differences between COVID-19-hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients. The incidence of the disease and outcome of health care workers were also reported. Methods: Proportions for categorical variables were compared using the Fisher exact test and 2. The Mann-Whitney rank sum test was used to compare continuous variables. Univariate analysis and a binomial logistic regression were used to explore variables as predictors of death. Results: Between March 6 and April 14, 2020, 40 of 62 (65%) patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome beta coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) along with 18 of 26 (69%) health care professionals.

The spike (S) protein interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which plays a role in the viral entry into the cell. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is zoonotic, the wet animal market where live animals are sold is expected to be the source of infection. It is the third zoonotic coronavirus, after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Transmission of the virus among humans is confirmed by direct contact, droplet infection, fecal-oral, and blood transmission. The symptoms of COVID 19 include fever, dry cough, headache, and difficulty of breathing. COVID 19 complications, including the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute organ injury, secondary infection, and shock, are common in immunocompromised and elderly patients.

In the present study, 662 serum samples collected from February 2020 to January 2021 from acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients were tested to determine neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers using a microneutralization test (MNT) for live SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM directed against different viral antigens were measured by high-throughput automated platforms. We observed higher levels of NAbs in elderly (>60 years old) individuals and in patients presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs develop as soon as five days from symptom onset and, despite a decline after the second month, persist for over 11 months, showing variable dynamics. Through correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we set up a testing algorithm, suitable for the laboratory workload, by establishing an optimal cutoff value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for convalescent plasma donors to exclude from MNT samples foreseen to have low/negative NAb titers and ineligible for plasma donation. Overall, MNT, although cumbersome and not suitable for routine testing of large sample sizes, remains the reference tool for the assessment of antibody-mediated immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

To improve the yield of a chimeric fusion of the V(H)H with an IgA Fc, we employed two rational design strategies, supercharging and introducing de novo disulfide bonds, on the bovine IgA Fc component of the chimera. After mutagenizing the Fc, we screened for accumulation levels after transient transformation in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. We identified and characterized five supercharging and one disulfide mutant, termed (5 + 1)Fc, that improve accumulation in comparison to the native Fc. Combining all these mutations is associated with a 32-fold increase of accumulation for the Fc alone, from 23.9 mg/kg fresh weight (FW) to 599.5 mg/kg FW, as well as a twenty-fold increase when fused to a V(H)H that binds EHEC, from 12.5 mg/kg FW tissue to 236.2 mg/kg FW. Co-expression of native or mutated V(H)H-Fc with bovine joining chain (JC) and bovine secretory component (SC) followed by co-immunoprecipitation suggests that the stabilizing mutations do not interfere with the capacity of V(H)H-Fc to assemble with JC and FC into a secretory IgA.

We conducted a large-scale, natural language processing (NLP) analysis of conversations on opioid-related drug forums to better understand concerns among people who use opioids. METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, we analyzed posts from 14 opioid-related forums on the social network Reddit. We applied NLP to identify frequently mentioned substances and phrases, and grouped the phrases manually based on their contents into three broad key themes: (i) prescription and/or illegal opioid use; (ii) substance use disorder treatment access and care; and (iii) withdrawal. Phrases that were unmappable to any particular theme were discarded. We computed the frequencies of substance and theme mentions, and quantified their volumes over time. We compared changes in post volumes by key themes and substances between pre-COVID-19 (1/1/20192/29/2020) and COVID-19 (3/1/202011/30/2020) periods. RESULTS: Seventy-seven thousand six hundred fifty-two and 119,168 posts were collected for the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods, respectively. By theme, posts about treatment and access to care increased by 300%, from 0.631 to 2.526 per 1000 posts between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Conversations about withdrawal increased by 812% between the same periods (0.026 to 0.235 per 1,000 posts). Posts about drug use did not increase (0.219 to 0.218 per 1,000 posts). By substance, among medications for opioid use disorder, methadone had the largest increase in conversations (20.751 to 56.313 per 1,000 posts; 171.4% increase).

The corona-like component of the outer surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virion, named spike protein, is a key target for the adsorption and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces. However, a lack of knowledge in intermolecular interactions between spike protein and different substrate surfaces has resulted in ineffective preventive measures and inaccurate information. Herein, we quantified the surface interaction and adhesion energy of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with a series of inanimate surfaces via atomic force microscopy under a simulated respiratory droplet environment. Among four target surfaces, polystyrene was found to exhibit the strongest adhesion, followed by stainless steel (SS), gold, and glass. The environmental factors (e.g., pH and temperature) played a role in mediating the spike protein binding. According to systematic quantification on a series of inanimate surfaces, the adhesion energy of spike protein was found to be (i) 0-1 mJ/m2 for hydrophilic inorganics (e.g., silica and glass) due to the lack of hydrogen bonding, (ii) 2-9 mJ/m2 for metals (e.g., alumina, SS, and copper) due to the variation of their binding capacity, and (iii) 6-11 mJ/m2 for hydrophobic polymers (e.g., medical masks, safety glass, and nitrile gloves) due to stronger hydrophobic interactions.

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between LUS findings and chest CT in patients confirmed to have (positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]) or clinically highly suspected of having (dyspnea, fever, myasthenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, dry cough, ageusia or anosmia) COVID-19. This prospective study was carried out in the emergency department, where patients confirmed of having or clinically highly suspected of having COVID-19 were recruited and underwent chest CT and concurrent LUS exam. An experienced emergency department physician performed the LUS exam blind to the clinical history and results of the CT scan, which were reviewed by two radiologists in consensus for signs compatible with COVID-19 (bilateral ground-glass opacities in peripheral distribution). A compatible LUS exam was considered a bilateral pattern of B-lines, irregular pleural line and subpleural consolidations. Between March and April 2020, 51 patients were consecutively enrolled. The indication for CT was a negative or indeterminate RT-PCR test (49.0%) followed by suspicion of pulmonary embolism (41.2%). Radiologic signs compatible with COVID-19 were present in 37 patients (72.5%) on CT scan and 40 patients (78.4%) on LUS exam. The presence of LUS findings was correlated with a positive CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 (odds ratio: 13.3, 95% confidence interval: 4.5-39.6, p < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 100.0%, specificity of 78.6%, positive predictive value of 92.5% and negative predictive value of 100.0%. There was no missed diagnosis of COVID-19 with LUS compared with CT in our cohort. The correlation between LUS score and CT total severity score was good (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.803, 95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.90, p < 0.001).

METHODS We performed a meta-analysis of all studies published between January 2000 and September 2018 reporting the outcomes of DCB versus other modalities in the treatment of de novo SVD. RESULTS Seven studies with 1,824 patients (1,938 lesions) were included (four randomized controlled trials and three observational studies). During a mean follow-up of 14.5  10 months, DCBs were associated with a similar risk of target lesion revascularization (TLR) (OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.54, 1.84, P = 97) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.51, 1.45, P = 0.57) compared with drug-eluting stents (DES).

However, in the case of the 2009 World Games, the first international hallmark sporting event in Taiwan, the volume of hotel occupancies and revenue fell short of expectations, despite 4 years of planning and an investment of US$218 million. This study set out to investigate this phenomenon by adopting semi-structured interviews to gather opinions from key stakeholders regarding their business operation and societal conditions. Factors contributing to the lower than expected revenue included inefficient collaboration among stakeholders, a substantial displacement effect to regional hotel competitors, and the unfriendly local atmosphere associated with the fear of H1N1, Typhoon Morakot, and controversial political events. To mitigate inefficiencies from stakeholder collaborations, the study results suggest greater equality in terms of responsibility, information distribution, and risk sharing is needed among the broader tourism industry, the event planning association, and the event supervising authority.

METHODS: A population-based study was conducted including 3,780 individuals, diagnosed with alcohol or other drug dependence and cared for by the addiction service (AS) in the province of Reggio Emilia. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and relative 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of being tested and of being SARS-CoV-2 positive in the population of interest compared with those in the general population of Reggio Emilia were calculated. RESULTS: Both individuals with alcohol and those with other drug use disorders had a lower risk of being SARS-CoV-2 positive (SIR = 0.69; 95% CI 0.32-1.30, SIR = 0.56; 95% CI 0.24-1.10, respectively), despite higher rates of being tested than the general population (SIR = 1.48; 95% CI 1.14-1.89, SIR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.20-1.86, respectively).

Unfortunately, this unusual feature can often lead to missed or delayed diagnosis with potential life-threatening outcomes. Clinical Case: The patient is a 53-year-old Caucasian male with PMH of type 2 diabetes mellitus treating with Metformin and Empagliflozin. He presented to the emergency room with shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms, and decreased oral intake for a couple of days. Vital signs at presentation were: Temperature 98.2 F, pulse rate 108 beats/min, respiratory rate 28 breaths/min, and blood pressure 134/72 mmHg. He was alert but ill-looking, moderately dehydrated with dry mucus membranes. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable at the time of admission. In the initial blood work, sugar was found to be mildly elevated (163mg/dl), and hemoconcentration besides mild pre-renal acute kidney injury was detected. He was also found infected by the COVID-19 virus without hypoxemia or signs of pneumonia. Arterial blood gases showed metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap (PH 7.21, CO2 39.93mmHg, HCO3? 10mEq/L, anion gap 21mEq/L). Urine analysis was positive for ketones and glucose. After ruling out other causes of metabolic acidosis by screening for alcohols, salicylates, acetaminophen, lactic acid, and urine toxicology;the diagnosis of EDKA was made. He was treated with a 3L bolus of IV normal saline and an insulin drip with dextrose solution started as per the protocol based on his glucose levels and promptly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Serial blood tests showed gradual resolution of ketoacidosis and anion gap normalized after 36 hours when insulin drip was stopped and replaced by subcutaneous insulin therapy. Conclusion: SGLT2 inhibitors increase the urinary excretion rate of glucose and subsequent fall in plasma glucose level. Thus, In the absence of exogenous insulin use, increase glucagon release resulting in upregulation of lipolysis and activation of the ketogenesis. Factors such as low oral intake, concurrent infection, and alcohol use can also exacerbate the process. Timely diagnosis of EDKA can be a challenge for physicians unfamiliar with this class of medications, additionally, ketone studies and blood gas analyses are not part of the routine workup for diabetic patients in the emergency department. We recommend all first-line care providers to consider ketosis in ill patients with diabetes and metabolic acidosis, despite the normal or near-normal serum glucose levels.

We adopt a feature extraction method based on dual tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) and triple short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain a multi-channel spectrogram. Mixup method is introduced to augment adventitious lung sound recordings to address the imbalance dataset problem.

The purpose of this study was to non-invasively determine SvO2 using a variation of pulse oximetry techniques. Artificial respiration-like modulations applied to the peripheral vascular system were used to infer regional SvO2 using photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. To achieve this modulation, an artificial pulse generating system (APG) was developed to generate controlled, superficial perturbations on the finger using a pneumatic digit cuff. These low pressure and low frequency modulations affect blood volumes in veins to a much greater extent than arteries due to significant arterial-venous compliance differences. Ten healthy human volunteers were recruited for proof-ofconcept testing. The APG was set at a modulation frequency of 0.2 Hz (12 bpm) and 45-50 mmHg compression pressure. Initial analysis showed that induced blood volume changes in the venous compartment could be detected by PPG. Estimated arterial oxygen saturation (97% [IQR=96.1%-97.4%]) matches published values (95%-99%). Estimated venous oxygen saturation (93.2% [IQR=91.-93.9%]) agrees with reported ranges (92%-95%) measured in peripheral regions. The median difference between the two saturations was 3.6%, while the difference between paired measurements in each subject was statistically significant (p=0.002).

However, many studies have been conducted with nnAbs obtained from subtype B-infected individuals, with few studies in patients with non-subtype B infections. RESULTS: We isolated a monoclonal antibody 1E5 from a CRF02_AG-infected individual and constructed two forms of antibody with constant regions of IgG1 or IgG3. The epitope of 1E5 belongs to the C1C2 of gp120, and 1E5 binds to 27 out of 35 strains (77 %) across the subtypes. The 1E5 showed strong ADCC activity, especially in the form of IgG3 in the presence of small CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mc) and 4E9C (anti-CoRBS antibody), but did not show any neutralizing activity even against the isolates with strong binding activities. The enhancement in the binding of A32, anti-C1C2 antibody isolated from a patient with subtype B infection, was observed in the presence of 1E5 and the combination of 1E5, A32 and 4E9C mediated a strong ADCC activity. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that anti-C1C2 antibodies that are induced in patients with different HIV-1 subtype infections have common functional modality and may have unexpected interactions. These data may have implications for vaccine development against HIV-1.

We hypothesize that there are associations between preoperative seizures and morphologic features (e.g., tumor size, location) and histogram features in patients with glioblastoma (GB). Methods: Retrospectively, 160 consecutive patients with initial diagnosis and surgery of GB (WHO IV) and preoperative MRI were analyzed. Preoperative MRI sequences were co-registered (T2-FLAIR, T1-contrast, DTI) and tumors were segmented by a neuroradiologist using the software ITK-snap blinded to the clinical data. Tumor volume (FLAIR, T1-contrast) and histogram analyses of ADC- and FA-maps were recorded in the contrast enhancing tumor part (CET) and the non-enhancing peritumoral edema (FLAIR). Location was determined after co-registration of the data with an atlas. Permutation-based multiple-testing adjusted t statistics were calculated to compare imaging variables between patients with and without seizures. Results: Patients with seizures showed significantly smaller tumors (CET, adj. p = 0.029) than patients without preoperative seizures. Less seizures were observed in patients with tumor location in the right cingulate gyrus (adj. p = 0.048) and in the right caudate nucleus (adj. p = 0.009). Significant differences of histogram analyses of FA in the contrast enhancing tumor part were observed between patients with and without seizures considering also tumor location and size. Conclusion: Preoperative seizures in GB patients are associated with lower preoperative tumor volume. The different histogram analyses suggest that there might be microstructural differences in the contrast enhancing tumor part of patients with seizures measured by fractional anisotropy.

It has shown antiviral effect specifically against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and acts on cytokine signaling pathways that have been implicated in COVID-19. METHODS: DAWn-AZITHRO is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 proof-of-concept, multicenter clinical trial, evaluating the safety and efficacy of azithromycin for treating hospitalized patients with COVID-19. It is part of a series of trials testing promising interventions for COVID-19, running in parallel and grouped under the name DAWn-studies. Patients hospitalized on dedicated COVID wards are eligible for study inclusion when they are symptomatic (i.e., clinical or radiological signs) and have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 72 h through PCR (nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage) or chest CT scan showing typical features of COVID-19 and without alternate diagnosis. Patients are block-randomized (9 patients) with a 2:1 allocation to receive azithromycin plus standard of care versus standard of care alone. Standard of care is mostly supportive, but may comprise hydroxychloroquine, up to the treating physicians discretion and depending on local policy and national health regulations. The treatment group receives azithromycin qd 500 mg during the first 5 consecutive days after inclusion. The trial will include 284 patients and recruits from 15 centers across Belgium. The primary outcome is time from admission (day 0) to life discharge or to sustained clinical improvement, defined as an improvement of two points on the WHO 7-category ordinal scale sustained for at least 3 days. DISCUSSION: The trial investigates the urgent and still unmet global need for drugs that may impact the disease course of COVID-19. It will either provide support or else justify the discouragement of the current widespread, uncontrolled use of azithromycin in patients with COVID-19. The analogous design of other parallel trials of the DAWN consortium will amplify the chance of identifying successful treatment strategies and allow comparison of treatment effects within an identical clinical context.

The initial signs and symptoms of HCPS are indistinguishable from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, this distinction is critical, as the disease course differs greatly, with most patients with COVID-19 experiencing mild to moderate illness. We set out to determine if the evaluation of peripheral blood smears for five hematopathologic criteria previously identified as hallmarks of hantavirus infection, or \\"the hantavirus 5-point screen,\\" could distinguish between COVID-19 and HCPS. METHODS The hantavirus 5-point screen was performed on peripheral blood smears from 139 patients positive for COVID-19 seeking treatment from Tshootsoo Medical Center and two Emory University hospitals. RESULTS Of these 139 individuals, 136 (98%) received a score of 3/5 or below, indicating low suspicion for HCPS. While thrombocytopenia, one of the key signs of HCPS, was seen in the patients with COVID-19, it was generally mild and remained stable on repeat specimens collected 12 to 24 hours later.

The aim of our study was to explore burden and mental wellbeing (including depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms) in caregivers of people with dementia during the first wave of the pandemic in Italy and southern Switzerland, two bordering regions severely hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey with family carers of people with dementia between May and June 2020. We registered socio-demographic characteristics, and information about the relationship with the care recipient, dementia subtype, care inputs from others, and the need of care of the person with dementia. We measured caregiver burden with the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), psychological distress with the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and perceived isolation with the 3-item UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLALS3). Results Caregivers (N=571) reported moderate to severe care-related burden (mean=54.30;SD=18.33), moderate anxiety symptoms (mean=10.04;SD=6.93), mild depressive symptoms (mean=11.79;SD=6.12) and mild stress (mean=12.95;SD=5.53), and 72.3% of participants reported to feel lonely. All scores were significantly more severe in Swiss compared to Italian caregivers (all p values<0.001). Conclusions We found that caregivers burden, anxiety symptoms, depression and perceived loneliness were marked during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in two severely hit bordering countries.

The two viruses differ in their potential to cause disease. FeLV is more pathogenic, and was long considered to be responsible for more clinical syndromes than any other agent in cats. FeLV can cause tumors (mainly lymphoma), bone marrow suppression syndromes (mainly anemia), and lead to secondary infectious diseases caused by suppressive effects of the virus on bone marrow and the immune system. Today, FeLV is less commonly diagnosed than in the previous 20 years; prevalence has been decreasing in most countries. However, FeLV importance may be underestimated as it has been shown that regressively infected cats (that are negative in routinely used FeLV tests) also can develop clinical signs. FIV can cause an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome that increases the risk of opportunistic infections, neurological diseases, and tumors. In most naturally infected cats, however, FIV itself does not cause severe clinical signs, and FIV-infected cats may live many years without any health problems.

Although live or attenuated virus vaccines have been used to control CSFV, it is difficult to distinguish vaccinated pigs from infected pigs; this leads to restrictions on import and export. Subunit vaccines based on the CSFV E2 glycoprotein have been developed using baculovirus or insect cell systems, but some weaknesses remain. Here, we describe production of an E2 recombinant protein using a Nicotiana benthamiana plant expression system. To do this, we took advantage of the ability of the swine Fc domain to increase solubility and stability of the fusion protein and to strengthen immune responses in target animals. N. benthamiana expressed high amounts of pFc2-fused E2 proteins, which were isolated and purified by affinity chromatography to yield a high pure recombinant protein in a cost-effective manner. Native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size exclusion chromatography confirmed that the pmE2:pFc2 fusion exists as a multimer rather than as a dimer. Injection of recombinant pmE2 protein into mice or piglets generated anti-pmE2 antibodies with efficient neutralizing activity against CSFV. These results suggest that a purified recombinant E2 protein produced in N. benthamiana generates high titers of neutralizing antibodies in vivo; as such, the protein could be developed as a subunit vaccine against CSFV.

This study develops grey prediction power models to forecast the demand for such a promising green metal material. Grey prediction is an appropriate technique because available data regarding the demand for magnesium alloys are not in line with any statistical assumptions. In particular, because outliers might cause a deterioration of forecasting performance, a robust nonlinear interval regression analysis with neural networks is applied to detect outliers by estimating data intervals. Then, a power model is applied to the newly generated non-equidistant data sequence without outliers. Residual modification is further considered here to improve the forecasting performance of the power model.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter observational trial in 8 UK critical care units. A total of 50 participants with moderate or severe lung injury resulting from confirmed COVID-19 were recruited at discharge from critical care and given a smartwatch (Fitbit Charge 3) between April and June 2020. The data collected included step counts and daily resting heart rates. A subgroup of the overall cohort at one sitethe MDT site (n=19)had their smartwatch data used to inform a regular MDT meeting. A patient feedback questionnaire and direct feedback from the MDT were used to report our experience. Participants who did not upload smartwatch data were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Of the 50 participants recruited, 35 (70%) used and uploaded data from their smartwatch during the 1-year period. At the MDT site, 74% (14/19) of smartwatch users uploaded smartwatch data, whereas 68% (21/31) of smartwatch users at the control sites uploaded smartwatch data. For the overall cohort, we recorded an increase in mean step count from 4359 (SD 3488) steps per day in the first month following discharge to 7914 (SD 4146) steps per day at 1 year (P=.003). The mean resting heart rate decreased from 79 (SD 7) beats per minute in the first month to 69 (SD 4) beats per minute at 1 year following discharge (P<.001). The MDT subgroups mean step count increased more than that of the control group (176% increase vs 42% increase, respectively; +5474 steps vs +2181 steps, respectively; P=.04) over 1 year. Further, 71% (10/14) of smartwatch users at the MDT site and 48% (10/21) of those at the control sites strongly agreed that their Fitbit motivated them to recover, and 86% (12/14) and 48% (10/21), respectively, strongly agreed that they aimed to increase their activity levels over time.

This viral glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor in infected cells and, to be active, must be cleaved to two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2(3,4). For SARS-CoV-2 the cleavage is catalysed by furin, a host cell protease, which cleaves the S protein precursor at a specific sequence motif that generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg (RRAR) C-terminal sequence on S1. This sequence motif conforms to the C-end rule (CendR), which means that the C-terminal sequence may allow the protein to associate with cell surface neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors5.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the hypothesis that people's perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 influence their attitudes and behaviors. METHODS: This study used an open dataset of web-based questionnaires about COVID-19. The questionnaires were provided by Nexoid United Kingdom. We selected the results of a questionnaire on COVID-19-related behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions among the US public. The questionnaire was conducted from March 29 to April 20, 2020. A total of 24,547 people who lived in the United States took part in the survey. RESULTS: In this study, the average self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 was 33.2%, and 49.9% (12,244/24,547) of the respondents thought that their chances of contracting COVID-19 were less than 30%. The self-assessed probability of contracting COVID-19 among women was 1.35 times that of males.

Overall student satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.9/5 (standard deviation [SD] 0.3). Self-assessed achievement of SFCS learning objectives exceeded 90% for all objectives. Overall faculty satisfaction with the SFCS was 4.4/5 (SD 0.8). Most faculty (40/46 [87%]) planned to use the database to answer future COVID-19 questions. NEXT STEPS: The SFCS is a novel, student-initiated VAME curriculum focused on increasing students meaningful contributions to patient care. The authors will track SFCS students throughout their clerkships to gauge clerkship performance/preparedness, and they will develop training for integrating VAME into preclerkship curricula at other institutions. Given its adaptive, student-driven design, the VAME framework used to develop the SFCS empowers students to create their own personalized, experiential learning.","output":"Implementing Value-Added Medical Education: Lessons Learned From the Student-Initiated Stanford Frontline COVID-19 Consult Service"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The global COVID\\\\19 pandemic was particularly concerning for the pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) population due to immature immune systems and developmental comorbidities.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all pediatric patients followed by the PH Center at Texas Children's Hospital diagnosed with COVID\\\\19 infection from April 2020 to February 2021. RESULTS: We identified 23 patients with a median age of 58 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 25C75th, 21C132 months), 48% being Hispanics. Eight patients (35%) required hospitalization; median length of stay was 6 days (IQR: 25C75th, 5C8 days). Only three of these eight patients required increased respiratory support. Targeted PH therapy was escalated in four patients (two in dual and two in triple therapy). There was one mortality in a patient with failing Fontan physiology. Ninety\\\\one percent of patients have had post\\\\COVID outpatient follow\\\\up, median of 101 days (IQR: 25C75th, 50C159 days) from diagnosis. Of the five patients with 6 min walk test (6MWT) data, three (60%) children walked less distance, median of ?12 m (IQR: 25C75th, ?12 to +49 m) compared to pre\\\\COVID testing. Postinfection pulmonary function testing (PFT) was notable for decrease in predicted forced vital capacity (FVC; median ?6%, range ?11% to +6%) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1; median ?14%, range ?12% to ?18%) in 75% of the patients with PFT data.

However, precise understanding of the specific role perceived fatigue plays in the central regulation of performance remains unclear. Here, we examined whether the subjective intensity of a perceived state of fatigue, pre-induced through prior upper body activity, differentially impacted performance and altered perceived effort and affect experienced during a sustained, isometric contraction in lower body. We also explored whether (cardiac) interoception predicted the intensity of experienced perceptual and affective responses and moderated the relationships between constructs during physical activity. METHODS Using a repeated-measures study design, thirty male participants completed three experimental conditions, with the intensity of a pre-induced state of fatigue manipulated to evoke moderate (MOD), severe (SEV) and minimal (control; CON) intensity of perceptions prior to performance of the sustained contraction. RESULTS Performance of the sustained contraction was significantly impaired under a perceived state of fatigue, with reductions of 10% and 14% observed in the MOD and SEV conditions, respectively. Performance impairment was accompanied by greater perceived effort and more negative affective valence reported during the contraction. However, effects were limited to comparisons to CON, with no difference evident between the two experimental trials (i.e. MOD vs. SEV). Individuals' awareness of their accuracy in judging resting heartbeats was shown to predict the subjective intensity of fatigue experienced during the endurance task. However, interoception did not moderate the relationships evident between fatigue and both perceived effort and affective valence. CONCLUSIONS A perceived state of fatigue limits endurance performance, influencing both how effortful activity is perceived to be and the affective experience of activity. Though awareness of interoceptive representations of bodily states may be important to the subjective experience of fatigue, interoception does not modulate the relationships between perceived fatigue and other perceptual (i.e. effort) and affective constructs.","output":"Effect of the subjective intensity of fatigue and interoception on perceptual regulation and performance during sustained physical activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By the end of May 2020, SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused more than 350,000 deaths worldwide.

This leads to higher risk of trocar site complications, such as infection or incisional hernia. Natural orifice surgery (NOTES) is beneficial for minimizing these complications, and this is emphasized when the extracted specimen is of large volume. We have been using transgastric technique for appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Of these transgastric operations, we focus on the one with relatively large-organ extraction: LSG with transoral remnant extraction (TORE). We describe the details and feasibility of this procedure and compare the outcomes to conventional LSG. METHODS All patients undergoing LSG were considered candidates for TORE and were consented for this procedure if interested after an informed discussion. Eighteen LSGs with TORE (TORE group) and ten conventional LSGs (non-TORE group) were performed from August 2010 to March 2011. We retrospectively compared these two groups for the age, sex, preoperative body mass index, operating room time, hospital stay, excess weight loss (EWL), and trocar site complications. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with TORE consists of conventional LSG and transgastric retrieval of the resected stomach. The procedure exceeds exactly the same manner as conventional LSG until the initial stapling of the stomach. For TORE, the gastrectomy is initiated 5 cm proximal to the pylorus than usual LSG to save the space for the gastrotomy used for specimen retrieval. After the gastrectomy is completed, the full thickness of the distal most part of the staple line is incised open as wide as 2 cm by using electric cautery or ultrasonic dissector. A flexible upper endoscope, which has been in the stomach already as a bougie for gastrectomy, is then guided into the peritoneal cavity through the gastrotomy. The specimen is grasped endoscopically with a snare and extracted transorally. Following this, the gastrotomy is closed laparoscopically. The final shape of the gastric sleeve is identical to the one of conventional LSG. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the TORE and the non-TORE group for patients' profile, operating room time, hospital stay, and EWL. Neither group has experienced perioperative complications. All specimens were extracted readily and safely in the TORE group. Of the ten cases in the non-TORE group, four required extension of the trocar site. No trocar site complications were found in the TORE group, whereas the extended trocar site developed panniculitis in two cases of the non-TORE group; one required panniculectomy for refractory induration. CONCLUSIONS TORE can be safely and easily performed by surgeons with laparoscopic and endoscopic skill, and with commonly available instruments. While producing identical outcomes, our initial experience with the TORE technique demonstrates an advantage over traditional LSG, because it minimizes trocar site complications. Transgastric organ extraction is potentially applicable to other large-organ extractions in laparoscopic surgery without excessive risk or resources. Larger case volume and longer follow-up period is awaited.","output":"Transgastric large-organ extraction: the initial human experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nuclear warfare threat has been one of the main driver for cultural, political, economical and social changes in the late twentieth century, biological warfare threat is about to take it over.

In this study, the most appropriate distribution between the negatively skewed distributions for left-censored data in Parametric Inverse Hazard Models was tried to be determined. Methods: Within the scope of the study, firstly, the data were produced uncensored according to different parameters of each distribution. Then, simulation studies were carried out in different censorship rates (15%, 25% and 35%) and various sample sizes (1000, 2000 and 3000) in order to determine the most appropriate distribution. AIC, AICC, HQIC, and CAIC information criteria were employed to compare the distribution performances. Since it was not possible to study simulations of all possible scenarios, scenarios similar to each other were generally preferred over others. Results: In the simulation results, the most appropriate distributions to be used for left-censored data in Parametric Inverse Hazard Models were found as Generalized Inverse Weibull as well as Log-Logistic, Log-Normal, Inverse Normal and Gamma distributions. It was also detected that the Marshal-Olkin distribution revealed a superior performance compared to the Modified Weibull, Generalized Gamma, Gamma, and Flexible Weibull distributions. Log logistics dis?tribution gave the most appropriate result among the analyzed distributions in the examination made with real data application.

In a prospective clinical observation study, we evaluated volume-dependent respiratory system compliance in adult patients undergoing ear-nose-throat surgery with ventilation settings chosen empirically by the attending anaesthetist. METHODS In 40 patients, we measured the respiratory variables during intraoperative mechanical ventilation. All measurements were subdivided into 5 min intervals. Dynamic compliance (CRS) and the intratidal volume-dependent CRS curve was calculated for each interval and classified into one of the six specific compliance profiles indicating intratidal recruitment/derecruitment, overdistension or all. We retrospectively compared the occurrences of the respective compliance profiles at PEEP levels of 5 cm H2O and at higher levels. RESULTS The attending anaesthetists set the PEEP level initially to 5 cm H2O in 29 patients (83%), to 7 cm H2O in 5 patients (14%), and to 8 cm H2O in 2 patients (6%). Across all measurements the mean CRS was 61 (11) ml cm H2O(-1) (40-86 ml cm H2O(-1)) and decreased continuously during the procedure. At PEEP of 5 cm H2O the compliance profile indicating strong intratidal recruitment/derecruitment occurred more often (18.6%) compared with higher PEEP levels (5.5%, P<0.01). Overdistension was practically never observed. CONCLUSIONS In most patients, a PEEP of 5 cm H2O during intraoperative mechanical ventilation is too low to prevent intratidal recruitment/derecruitment. The analysis of the intratidal compliance profile provides the rationale to individually titrate a PEEP level that stabilizes the alveolar recruitment status of the lung during intraoperative mechanical ventilation.

In addition to cutaneous injury, a severe burn stimulates physiological derangements that induce a systemic hypermetabolic response resulting in impaired wound healing.

We developed and characterized a PCL scaffold that is capable of controlled release of androgen (DHT) and anti-androgen (F) individually or together. This study aims to investigate whether local modification of androgen actions has an impact on burn injury wound healing. In a full-thickness burn wound healing, mouse model, DHT/F-scaffold showed a significantly faster wound healing compared with F-scaffold or DHT-scaffold. Histology analysis confirmed that DHT/F-scaffold exhibited higher re-epithelization, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition. Dual release of DHT and F from PCL scaffolds promoted cell proliferation of human keratinocytes and alters the keratinocyte cell cycle. Lastly, no adverse effects on androgen-dependent organs, spleen and liver were observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated DHT plus F load PCL scaffolds accelerated burn wound healing when loading alone did not.

In this study, we examined the clinical efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for patients with COVID-19 in our hospital during the first wave of infections. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with COVID-19 who were treated with or without corticosteroid therapy at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Japan between February and April 2020. The primary outcome was improvement in the patients clinical course using a seven-category ordinal scale. We collected data on patient characteristics, treatment, and clinical course, and compared them between two groups: the steroid-using group and the non-steroid-using group. RESULTS: Between February and April 2020, 110 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. Despite poor conditions during admission into the steroid group, there were no statistical differences in clinical course between both groups, as measured using the scale. There were no statistical differences between the two groups in the number of days to fever resolution or negative polymerase chain reaction results.

Similarity between the data was statistically and qualitatively evaluated. RESULTS: In general, synthetic data closely matched original data for epidemic curves, patient characteristics, and outcomes. Synthetic data suppressed labels of zip codes with few total tests (mean=2.92.4; max=16 tests; 66% reduction of unique zip codes). Epidemic curves and monthly indicator counts were similar between synthetic and original data in a random sample of the most tested (top 1%; n=171) and for all unsuppressed zip codes (n=5,819), respectively. In small sample sizes, synthetic data utility was notably decreased. DISCUSSION: Analyses on the population-level and of densely-tested zip codes (which contained most of the data) were similar between original and synthetically-derived data sets. Analyses of sparsely-tested populations were less similar and had more data suppression. CONCLUSION: In general, synthetic data were successfully used to analyze geospatial and temporal trends.

While reversing this quiescence is an effective approach to reactivate latent HIV from T cells in culture, it can cause deleterious cytokine dysregulation in patients. As a key regulator of T-cell quiescence, FOXO1 promotes latency and suppresses productive HIV infection. We report that in resting T cells, FOXO1 inhibition impaired autophagy and induced ER stress, thereby activating two associated transcription factors: activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Both factors associate with HIV chromatin and were for HIV reactivation. Indeed, inhibition of PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), an ER stress sensor that can mediate the induction of ATF4, and calcineurin, a calcium-dependent regulator of NFAT, synergistically suppressed HIV reactivation induced by FOXO1 inhibition. Thus, our studies uncover a link between FOXO1, ER stress, and HIV infection that could be therapeutically exploited to selectively reverse T-cell quiescence and reduce the size of the latent viral reservoir.","output":"FOXO1 promotes HIV Latency by suppressing ER stress in T cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory and systemic disorder caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or novel Coronavirus (nCoV). To date, there is no proven curative treatment for this virus; as a result, prevention remains to be the best strategy to combat coronavirus infection (COVID-19). Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) has been proposed to play a role in coronavirus infection (COVID-19). However, there is no conclusive evidence on its impact on COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the present review aimed to summarize the available evidence regarding the association between Vitamin D levels and the risk of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A systematic literature search of databases (PUBMED/MEDLINE, Cochrane/Wiley library, Scopus, and SciELO) were conducted from May 15, 2020, to December 20, 2020. Studies that assessed the effect of vitamin D level on COVID-19/SARS-2 infection were considered for the review. The qualities of the included studies were evaluated using the JBI tools. Meta-analysis with a random-effects model was conducted and odds ratio with their 95%CI were reported. This systematic review and meta-analysis are reported according to the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. Results: The electronic and supplementary searches for this review yielded 318 records from which, only 14 of them met the inclusion criteria. The qualitative synthesis indicated that vitamin D deficient individuals were at higher risk of COVID-19 infection as compared to vitamin D sufficient patients. The pooled analysis showed that individuals with Vitamin-D deficiency were 80% more likely to acquire COVID-19 infection as compared to those who have sufficient Vitamin D levels (OR = 1.80; 95%CI: 1.72, 1.88). Begg's test also revealed that there was no significant publication bias between the studies (P = 0.764). The subgroup analysis revealed that the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection was relatively higher in the case-control study design (OR = 1.81). Conclusions: In conclusion, low serum 25 (OH) Vitamin-D level was significantly associated with a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. The limited currently available data suggest that sufficient Vitamin D level in serum is associated with a significantly decreased risk of COVID-19 infection.","output":"The Impact of Vitamin D Level on COVID-19 Infection: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been shown to have extensive effects on the cardiovascular system.

The patient had normal screening tests including electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram 4 months after his illness. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated epicardial and pericardial fibrosis of the right ventricle free wall and outflow tract and the pericardium over the anterior wall, 6 months following the initial infection. First abnormal ECG was recorded at month 7 following illness.

METHODS: This was a national cohort study of patients with early BC undergoing multidisciplinary team (MDT)-guided treatment recommendations during the pandemic, designated 'standard' or 'COVID-altered', in the preoperative, operative and post-operative setting. FINDINGS: Of 3776 patients (from 64 UK units) in the study, 2246 (59%) had 'COVID-altered' management. 'Bridging' endocrine therapy was used (n = 951) where theatre capacity was reduced. There was increasing access to COVID-19 low-risk theatres during the study period (59%). In line with national guidance, immediate breast reconstruction was avoided (n = 299). Where adjuvant chemotherapy was omitted (n = 81), the median benefit was only 3% (IQR 2-9%) using 'NHS Predict'. There was the rapid adoption of new evidence-based hypofractionated radiotherapy (n = 781, from 46 units). Only 14 patients (1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during their treatment journey.

As one example, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Emergency Management Agency faced overwhelming, temporally scattered, a priori uncertain, and correlated demands for medical supplies from different states. To better achieve their dual aims of equity and efficiency in such contexts, social planners intend to maximize the minimum fill rate across agents, where each agent's fill rate must be irrevocably decided upon its arrival. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence of demands, we establish upper bounds on both the expected minimum fill rate (ex-post fairness) and the minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness) achievable by any policy. Our bounds are parameterized by the number of agents and the expected demand-to-supply ratio, and they shed light on the limits of attaining equity in dynamic rationing. Further, we show that for any set of parameters, a simple adaptive policy of projected proportional allocation achieves the best possible fairness guarantee, ex post as well as ex ante. Our policy is transparent and easy to implement, as it does not rely on distributional information beyond the first conditional moments. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that this policy provides significant improvement over the class of non-adaptive target-fill-rate policies by characterizing the performance of the optimal such policy, which relies on full distributional knowledge. We obtain the performance guarantees of (i) our proposed adaptive policy by inductively designing lower-bound functions on its corresponding value-to-go, and (ii) the optimal target-fill-rate policy by establishing an intriguing connection to a monopoly-pricing optimization problem. Further, we extend our results to considering alternative objective functions and to rationing multiple types of resources. We complement our theoretical developments with a numerical study motivated by the rationing of COVID-19 medical supplies based on a projected-demand model used by the White House. In such a setting, our simple adaptive policy significantly outperforms its theoretical guarantee as well as the optimal target-fill-rate policy.","output":"Fair Dynamic Rationing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We analyze data from the fall 2020 pandemic response efforts at the University of Colorado Boulder, where more than 72,500 saliva samples were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using qRT-PCR.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether socio-economic factors are associated with acceptability of newborn screening to identify infants with sickle cell disease during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kisangani, DRC. METHODS: we conducted an observational study of mothers sensitized to neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborns with hemotypeSC(TM) (HT401RUO-USA). The study was carried out at the maternity wards in Kisangani from March 21(st) to June 30(th) 2020. Collected data were parity, educational level, age, socio-economic level, occupation, awareness and the reason for the denial of screening. RESULTS: out of 55.5% (273/492) of sensitized mothers, 107 (39.19%) accepted and 166 (60.80%) refused neonatal screening to detect sickle cell disease in their newborn. The reasons for refusal were lack of information (67.5%; 95% CI [59.8-74.5]), lack of money due to confinement (66.3%; 95% CI [58.5-73.4]), blood test to develop a vaccine for protection against COVID-19 (63.2%; 95% CI = [55.4-70.6]). Factors associated with the acceptability of screening were age > 35 years (p = 0.0009; ORa = 3.04; 95% CI = 1.57-5.87) and low socio-economic level (p = 0.0016; ORa = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.37-3.85).

H7 hemagglutinin (HA) plays a critical role in influenza entry and thus HA presents an attractive target for antivirals. Previous studies have suggested that the small molecule tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) inhibits the entry of influenza H3 HA by binding to the stem loop of HA and stabilizing the neutral pH conformation of HA, thereby disrupting the membrane fusion step. Based on amino acid sequence, structure and immunogenicity, H7 is a related Group 2 HA. In this work we show, using a pseudovirus entry assay, that TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry, as well as H3 HA-mediated entry, with an IC506 M. Using NMR, we show that TBHQ binds to the H7 stem loop region. STD NMR experiments indicate that the aromatic ring of TBHQ makes extensive contact with the H7 HA surface. Limited proteolysis experiments indicate that TBHQ inhibits influenza entry by stabilizing the H7 HA neutral pH conformation. Together, this work suggests that the stem loop region of H7 HA is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention and that TBHQ, which is a widely used food preservative, is a promising lead compound.","output":"Inhibition of Influenza H7 Hemagglutinin-Mediated Entry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Avian influenza A viruses exhibit a strong preference for using 2,3\\\\linked sialic acid as a receptor.

In the present study, we used the COVIDSeq protocol, which involves multiplex-PCR, barcoding, and sequencing of samples for high-throughput detection and deciphering the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. We used the approach on 752 clinical samples in duplicates, amounting to a total of 1536 samples which could be sequenced on a single S4 sequencing flow cell on NovaSeq 6000. Our analysis suggests a high concordance between technical duplicates and a high concordance of detection of SARS-CoV-2 between the COVIDSeq as well as RT-PCR approaches. An in-depth analysis revealed a total of six samples in which COVIDSeq detected SARS-CoV-2 in high confidence which were negative in RT-PCR. Additionally, the assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 in 21 samples and 16 samples which were classified inconclusive and pan-sarbeco positive respectively suggesting that COVIDSeq could be used as a confirmatory test. The sequencing approach also enabled insights into the evolution and genetic epidemiology of the SARS-CoV-2 samples. The samples were classified into a total of 3 clades.

Data were drawn from the incidents of domestic violence reported in newspapers. Data was analyzed using content analysis and three major themes, i.e., three principle components of RAT-motivated offender, suitable target, and absence of capable guardian-were drawn. Findings reveal that sources of motivation in domestic violence perpetrators during the lockdown were alcohol and unemployment. The symbolic value that perpetrators associated with women, lower inertia, visibility, and accessibility to the perpetrators made women suitable targets of domestic violence. Lastly, shortage of police force and travel restrictions on formal and informal sources resulted in the absence of capable guardians.

Although this looks promising, they still need to pass the test of challenge studies in animal models. As various models for SARS-CoV-2 are under testing phase, biotech companies have bypassed animal studies and moved to Phase I clinical trials. In view of the present outbreak, this looks a justified approach, but the problem is that in the absence of animal studies, we can never predict the outcomes in humans.

METHODS T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were obtained from 44 PDM patients and 32 HCs matched for age and handedness. Cortical thickness was compared in multiple locations across the continuous cortical surface, and subcortical volumes were compared on a structure-by-structure basis. Correlation analysis was then used to evaluate relationships between the clinical symptoms and abnormal brain structure in PDM. RESULTS PDM patients had significantly increased cortical thickness in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), insula (IN), primary/secondary sensory area (SI/SII), superior temporal cortex (STC), precuneus (pCUN) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Meanwhile, significantly decreased subcortical volumes of the caudate, thalamus and amygdala were found in PDM patients.

Racial and ethnic disparities in health care have been well documented in COVID-19 with respect to risk of infection and in-hospital outcomes once admitted, and here we assess disparities in those who access healthcare via telemedicine for COVID-19 . MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health record data of patients at New York University Langone Health between March 19th and April 30, 2020 were used to conduct descriptive and multilevel regression analyses with respect to visit type (telemedicine or in-person), suspected COVID diagnosis and COVID test results. RESULTS: Controlling for individual and community-level attributes, Black patients had 0.6 times the adjusted odds (95%CI:0.58-0.63) of accessing care through telemedicine compared to white patients, though they are increasingly accessing telemedicine for urgent care, driven by a younger and female population. COVID diagnoses were significantly more likely for Black versus white telemedicine patients. DISCUSSION: There are disparities for Black patients accessing telemedicine, however increased uptake by young, female Black patients. Mean income and decreased mean household size of Zip code were also significantly related to telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine access disparities reflect those in in-person healthcare access. Roots of disparate use are complex and reflect individual, community, and structural factors, including their intersection; many of which are due to systemic racism. Evidence regarding disparities that manifest through telemedicine can be used to inform tool design and systemic efforts to promote digital health equity.","output":"Telemedicine and Healthcare Disparities: A cohort study in a large healthcare system in New York City during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Upper respiratory tract is the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Forty five SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were enrolled, whose were divided in two groups: asymptomatic and symptomatic. Twenty healthy persons, SARS-CoV-2 negative were included as controls. Higher IFN-?3 expression was detected in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in comparison with controls (p = 0.0393). IFN-?3 expression was increased in symptomatic patients (p = 0.0405).

In the human immunodeficiency lentivirus 1 (HIV-1), dynamic G4s are located in the unique viral LTR promoter. Folding of HIV-1 LTR G4s inhibits viral transcription; stabilization by G4 ligands intensifies this effect. Cellular proteins modulate viral transcription by inducing/unfolding LTR G4s. We here expanded our investigation on the presence of LTR G4s to all lentiviruses. G4s in the 5-LTR U3 region were completely conserved in primate lentiviruses. A G4 was also present in a cattle-infecting lentivirus. All other non-primate lentiviruses displayed hints of less stable G4s. In primate lentiviruses, the possibility to fold into G4s was highly conserved among strains. LTR G4 sequences were very similar among phylogenetically related primate viruses, while they increasingly differed in viruses that diverged early from a common ancestor. A strong correlation between primate lentivirus LTR G4s and Sp1/NFB binding sites was found. All LTR G4s folded: their complexity was assessed by polymerase stop assay. Our data support a role of the lentiviruses 5-LTR G4 region as control centre of viral transcription, where folding/unfolding of G4s and multiple recruitment of factors based on both sequence and structure may take place.","output":"Conserved presence of G-quadruplex forming sequences in the Long Terminal Repeat Promoter of Lentiviruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Probiotics have been suggested as one solution to counter detrimental health effects by SARS-CoV-2, however, data so far is scarce.

COVID-19 has its origin in Wuhan, China, and spread to other provinces of China and subsequently to other countries resulting in a pandemic worldwide. The virus is extremely contagious and causes pneumonia and respiratory failure. Since its emergence, researchers around the world are trying to develop vaccines and find suitable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Objective: To give an overview of the various therapeutic agents for COVID-19 such as vaccines and drugs that are in preclinical stage or under different stages of clinical trials. Results: As per World Health Organization (WHO), there are 137 vaccines under development to date, out of which few vaccines have successfully completed preclinical studies and reached clinical trials. According to the present scenario, only one coronavirus vaccine (sputnik-V) has been approved by the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. Till date, there are no United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) approved drugs to treat COVID-19 patients. However, depending on patient's condition, different drugs such as antiviral agents like Remdesivir, antimalarial drugs like Hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics like Azithromycin and corticosteroids like Dexamethasone are being applied and some of them have proved to be effective up to a certain extent. Conclusion: Although several vaccines for COVID-19 are under development and various drugs have been tried for its treatment, an ideal drug candidate or a vaccine is still lacking.

Cholecystitis has been described in rare cases related to COVID-19, possibly in consequence of immune activation, but biliary disease from SARS-CoV-2 infection is not well described. We examined a case series of patients with both COVID-19 and cholecystitis at our institution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with a diagnosis of cholecystitis within 3 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection; looking at clinical, laboratory, and radiographic characteristics of this population. RESULTS: 30 individuals were identified with a diagnosis of cholecystitis within 3 months of diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most patients presenting with cholecystitis were female and obese (see Table 1). 14 individuals were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection during the same presentation as their cholecystitis diagnosis, usually as part of pre-operative screening. Of 16 individuals diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 prior to their cholecystitis presentation, a mean of 24 and 17 days elapsed between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cholecystitis symptom onset and radiographic diagnosis, respectively (see Figure 1). Most of these patients had mild respiratory disease, with only 9 developing an oxygen requirement, and only 3 requiring mechanical ventilation. While 17 patients were treated surgically for their cholecystitis, this did not appear to impact symptom resolution. Table 1. Patient Characteristics [Image: see text] Figure 1. Time between COVID-19 and Cholecystitis [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Cholecystitis may be an uncommon complication of COVID-19 disease.

To better understand how Spanish children have adapted to the stressful disruptions resulting from the pandemic outbreak, we examined the effects of child coping and its interactions with contextual stressors (pandemic and family related) on child adjustment, incorporating in our analysis a developmental perspective. Data was collected in April 2020, through parent-reports, during the acute phase of the pandemic and, temporarily coinciding with the mandatory national quarantine period imposed by the Spanish Government. A sample of 1,123 Spanish children (50% girls) aged 3 to 12 (Mage = 7.26; SD = 2.39) participated in the study. Results showed differences in the use of specific strategies by children in different age groups (i.e., 3C6, 7C9 and 10C12-year-olds). Despite the uncontrollable nature of the pandemic-related stressors, child disengagement coping was distinctively associated to negative outcomes (i.e., higher levels of behavioral and emotional difficulties), whereas engagement coping predicted psychosocial adjustment across all age groups. Moreover, interactively with child coping, parent fear of the future and parent dispositional resilience appear as relevant contextual factors to predict both negative and positive outcomes, but their effects seem to be age dependent, suggesting a higher contextual vulnerability for younger children.

The matheuristics hybridise the decomposition of each instance into some small-sized sub-instances with a variable neighbourhood search algorithm. The main advantages of these methods are their flexibility to incorporate many problem details (such as a step-wise demand for the PACU nurses) and to solve any large-scale problem.

Although kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have higher mortality than the general population, data on their risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are unknown. SUBJECT OF REVIEW: A recent single-center screening study from the UK (Transplantation. 2021 Jan 1;105(1):151C7) showed that 89 (10.4%) of 855 consecutive kidney transplant recipients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Risk factors for infection included a nonwhite background, diabetes, and a history of allograft rejection. Risk factors for mortality in individuals who developed COVID-19 were older age and receiving steroids. SECOND OPINION: This study shows that the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant recipients is similar to the one observed in the general population in the same area (13%), indicating that transplant recipients are not at increased risk of COVID-19. However, the investigators raise the interesting point that since transplant individuals were advised to shelter earlier than the general population, they may be in fact more susceptible. This statement is hard to substantiate, but the identification of specific risk factors for infection and poor outcomes is crucial to tailor strategies to prevent spread of the infection. This is particularly important, considering that kidney transplant recipients may be at increased risk of prolonged viral spread and in-host viral mutations, making them not just a particularly fragile population for COVID-19 but also a potentially major source of further contagions.","output":"Preventing Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Kidney Transplant Recipients: Where Should We Begin?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE The psychological status of cancer outpatients receiving anti-neoplastic treatment during the lockdown in a Italian non-COVID Cancer Center, was been investigated with the following aims: to measure the levels of post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression and anxiety; to compare patients with different cancer sites; to compare the anxiety and depression levels measured in this emergency period between cancer and non-cancer patients and between cancer patients before and after the emergency.

The need for no-contact and rapid measurement of body temperature during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency has led to the widespread use of thermal imaging cameras. However, the body temperature measurement is also disturbed by the environment factors, including ambient temperature, background light etc. When the ambient temperature is low, the temperature of the patient will also be low. It was difficult to screen the fever patients by using the absolute temperature criteria, and it often result in missing detection. In order to solve this problem, this paper proposed a method of screening COVID-19 symptom fever patients by the body temperature difference detection. The temperature difference detection method combined the temperature measurement of the infrared imaging camera and the visible camera face recognition. This method will eliminate environmental interference and equipment errors, to reduce the probability of the fever missed detection. ?

The Omicron variant is a recently emerged variant of concern and is now taking over the Delta variant. To characterize the potential antigenicity of the Omicron variant, we examined the distributions of SARS-CoV-2 nonself mutations (in reference to the human proteome) as 5 amino acid stretches of short constituent sequences (SCSs) in the Omicron and Delta proteomes. The number of nonself SCSs did not differ much throughout the Omicron, Delta, and Reference Sequence (RefSeq) proteomes but markedly increased in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Omicron spike protein compared to those of the Delta and RefSeq proteins. In contrast, the number of nonself SCSs decreased in non-RBD regions in the Omicron spike protein, compensating for the increase in the RBD. Several nonself SCSs were tandemly present in the RBD of the Omicron spike protein, likely as a result of selection for higher binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor (and hence higher infectivity and transmissibility) at the expense of increased antigenicity. Taken together, the present results suggest that the Omicron variant has evolved to have higher antigenicity and less virulence in humans despite increased infectivity and transmissibility.","output":"Nonself Mutations in the Spike Protein Suggest an Increase in the Antigenicity and a Decrease in the Virulence of the Omicron Variant of SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), has been identified as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2.

On the other hand, we still lack large manually segmented datasets that could be used for training machine learning-based models for fully automatic segmentation. In this work, we propose a new interactive and user-friendly tool for COVID-19 lesion segmentation, which works by alternating automatic steps (based on level-set segmentation and statistical shape modeling) with manual correction steps. The present software was tested by two different expertise groups: one group of three radiologists and one of three users with an engineering background. Promising segmentation results were obtained by both groups, which achieved satisfactory agreement both between- and within-group. Moreover, our interactive tool was shown to significantly speed up the lesion segmentation process, when compared to fully manual segmentation. Finally, we investigated inter-observer variability and how it is strongly influenced by several subjective factors, showing the importance for AI researchers and clinical doctors to be aware of the uncertainty in lesion segmentation results.","output":"Development and evaluation of a 3D annotation software for interactive COVID-19 lesion segmentation in chest CT"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: This study aimed to explore the clinical practice experience of nursing students during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.

We collected data by iterative work through in-depth interviews and observations and analyzed it using content analysis and dialogue between the authors to enhance interpretation. Results: Four themes emerged from the participants clinical practice experiences during the pandemic: increased uncertainty in clinical practice and daily life, reduced opportunities for practice experiences and networking, differences in the meaning of clinical practice, and new implications of clinical practice. Conclusion: Participants were experiencing clinical practice, including themselves and the surrounding world, under the strong influence of the COVID-19. Therefore, the development of practice guidelines that can be communicated quickly between institutions, students, and universities and cope flexibly with the pandemic alarm levels will reduce uncertainty in clinical practice and minimize changes in activities and networking.

Studies indicate that human factors such as situational awareness, team working, communication and a culture promoting safety contribute to avoidance of failure to rescue events. Understanding human factors is essential to developing work systems that mitigate barriers and facilitate prompt escalation of care. This qualitative evidence synthesis will identify and synthesise what is known about the human factors that affect escalation of care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid) and CINAHL, between database inception and 2018, for studies describing human factors affecting failure to rescue and/or care escalation.

Much effort has been devoted in the identification of major histocompatibility complex class II eptiopes from different tumor-associated antigens. Melan-A/MART-1 is expressed specifically in normal melanocytes and tumor cells of 75% to 100% of melanoma patients. Melan-A/MART-1 is considered as an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. In the past, several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II restricted epitopes have been identified and characterized, including Melan-A/MART-11-20 (HLA-DR11 restricted), Melan-A/MART-125-36 (HLA-DQ6 and HLA-DR3 restricted), Melan-A/MART-127-40 (HLA-DR1 restricted), Melan-A/MART-151-73 (HLA-DR4 restricted), Melan-A/MART-191-110 (HLA-DR52 restricted), and Melan-A/MART-1100-111 (HLA-DR1 restricted). Owing to the infrequent expression of the above HLA class II alleles in Asian populations, immunotherapy using these defined Melan-A/MART-1 peptides could potentially only benefit a very small percentage of Asian melanoma patients. In this study, we established several CD4 T-cell clones by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor by a peptide pool of 28 to 30 amino acid long peptides spanning the entire Melan-A/MART-1 protein. These CD4 T-cell clones recognized a peptide that is embedded within Melan-A/MART-121-50, in a HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted manner. Finally, we demonstrated that this epitope is naturally processed and presented by dendritic cells. HLA-DPB1*0501 is frequently expressed in Asian population (44.9% to 73.1%). Therefore, this epitope could provide a new tool and could significantly increase the percentage of melanoma patients that can benefit from cancer immunotherapy.","output":"Identification of an HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted Melan-A/MART-1 epitope recognized by CD4+ T lymphocytes: prevalence for immunotherapy in Asian populations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem worldwide. Several measures are taken when identified carriers of antibiotic resistant bacteria (such as MRSA) are admitted to a hospital: patients stay in an isolation room and healthcare workers have to put on personal protective equipment (PPE) before entering the isolation room. Previous research on experiences of isolated care shows that patients felt lonely, forgotten and stigmatized while healthcare personnel felt guilty for bundling their contact moments. Therefore, an innovation project has been set up to re-design the concept of an isolation room: the isolation room of the future. The isolation room of the future concentrates around providing enhancements for communication and interaction, comfort and accessibility and architecture and interior design, while taking into account the infection prevention regulations for isolation rooms in hospitals. The interior of the isolation room of the future consists of biophilic elements, including photo wallpaper, transparent walls, surfaces that mimic natural materials, and natural and dynamic light;creating a positive healing and working environment for patients, staff and visitors. Transparent walls also allow easy communication between patients and healthcare workers without the need for the PPE.

Furthermore, it is commonly presumed that public health graduates work in government, and investments in education would bolster this workforce. Methods: We aimed to describe the common occupations of Australian public health graduates, describe the heterogeneity of graduate destinations, describe the level of mismatch that graduates report, and compare these results with other fields of study. We used eight years of Australian graduate survey data (2008C2015) from the Graduate Destinations Survey, examining outcomes data from 8900 public health graduates from four levels of education. We compared occupation and industry heterogeneity, and level of occupational mismatch between public health graduates, and graduates from other fields of education. Results: Public health graduates report having a broad set of occupations in a broad set of industries after graduation, and this breadth is dissimilar to most health degrees. Furthermore, public health graduates tend to have average or lower-than-average rates of mismatch. Conclusions: Despite going into a broad set of occupations and industries, graduates from public health tend to report being well prepared given their education. Given that both occupation and industry outcomes are heterogeneous for graduates, an investment in public health education does not guarantee an increase in the governmental public health workforce.","output":"What Do Public Health Graduates Do and Where Do They Go?

Despite extreme isolation, we show that the movement of people amongst a large number of small but isolated communities has the effect of causing transmission to spread quickly. Significant movement between remote communities, and regional and urban centres allows for infection to quickly spread to and then among these remote communities. Our conclusions are based on two characteristic features of remote communities in Western Australia: (1) high mobility of people amongst these communities, and (2) relatively high proportion of travellers from very small communities to major population centres. In models of infection initiated in the state capital, Perth, these remote communities are collectively and uniquely vulnerable.

These water droplets can be stable in the environment and remain suspended in air for prolonged periods. Encounters between droplets may occur and droplet interactions should be considered. However, the previous studies focused on other physical phenomena (air flow, drag force, evaporation) for droplet transport and neglected droplet interactions. In this work, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the transport and fate of airborne droplets expelled by an asymptomatic person and considered droplet interactions. Droplet drag with turbulence for prediction of transport and fate of droplets indicated that the turbulence increased the transport of 1 m droplets, whereas it decreased the transport of 50 m droplets. In contrast to only considering drag and turbulence, consideration of droplet interactions tended to increase both the transport and fate. Although the length scale of the office is much larger than the droplet sizes, the droplet interactions, which occurred at the initial stages of release when droplet separation distances were shorter, had a significant effect in droplet fate by considerably manipulating the final locations on surfaces where droplets adhered. Therefore, it is proposed that when an exact prediction of transport and fate is required, especially for high droplet concentrations, the effects of droplet interactions should not be ignored.

A technology-enabled One Health (OH) surveillance program offers an opportunity for early detection and response as well as prevention of disease outbreaks in resource-limited settings. As an initial step toward developing the surveillance program, we aimed to identify at-risk groups of households for potential shared health challenges at the human-animal-environmental interface in a rural community of the Philippines. METHODS: A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in the municipality of Los Ba?os in proximity (63 kilometers south) to Metro Manila by enumerators living in the same community. Twenty-four enumerators conducted household interviews asking a) household characteristics including ownership of animals and crops; b) awareness, beliefs and knowledge about OH; c) family-level health practices related to sanitation, hygiene, and food safety; and d) risk factors for potential OH issues. All data collection and transferring process were streamlined using a mobile application. RESULTS: Of 6,055 participating households, 68% reported having one or more of gardens, farms, and animals for various reasons. While only 2% of the households have heard about OH, 97% believed they can get disease from animals, plants or the environment. A latent class analysis with nine risk factors for potential OH issues suggested that 46% of the households were at moderate to high risk for exposure to zoonotic pathogens and environmental contaminants. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that there are unaddressed threats to human, animal, and plant health. Given the importance of the interconnections between the health of humans, animals, and plants, further evaluations of the at-risk households would be necessary to mitigate potential shared health threats in the community.

Stage III MCC at presentation was significantly associated with worse DMFS (hazard ratio 4.87, P = 0.001) and stage IV disease with worse MSS (hazard ratio 6.30, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Regional LN metastasis is the most common first metastatic event in MCC, confirming the importance of nodal evaluation. Distant disease spread appears to have a predilection for certain sites. Understanding these patterns could help to guide surveillance strategies.","output":"Patterns of Metastasis in Merkel Cell Carcinoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Annual emissions from commercial aviation are forecast to reach 1820 MtCO2 by mid-century, where carbon-neutral growth would demand near full substitution of petroleum-based aviation fuels with alternative jet fuels (AJF). However, the lack of dedicated policies and harmonized regulations has been perceived by stakeholders within the air transport community as the major contributor to shortfalls in global production over the past decade (&lt;0.01% of the total aviation fuel demand). This research combines qualitative and mixed methods to study stakeholder perceptions by identifying and analyzing collective narratives on AJF (what matters, why does it and who says so) influencing the policy process at the ICAO. Q-method allowed to identify four metanarratives across participants, three of which have a distinctive weak sustainability approach to international aviations growth and one that is typically representative of a strong sustainability approach. This method also revealed a common ground of beliefs and understandings among stakeholders that could facilitate the discussion, negotiation and consensus of some of the multidimensional nuances inherent to the metanarratives analyzed. By classifying stakeholders salience based on their possession of power, legitimacy and urgency as dynamic and relational attributes to the ICAO, the authors suggest options to bring valuable expertise from low-salient and non-stakeholders into the formulation of policies on AJF through a variety of collaborative arrangements with medium and highly salient stakeholders. The role of AJF is further explored within the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, the flygskam movement in Europe, and the impending renewal of climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. ? 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","output":"Alternative jet fuels and climate geopolitics: What, why does it and who matters in the environmental policy-making process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The outbreak of COVID-19 posed a huge threat to human health and social stability.

The second wave in India lagged behind that in the Western world, due to different timing of seasons. There is scarce data about the differences between the two waves, for intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We present the data of 3,498 patients from 9 ICUs of western Maharashtra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected prospective data of hospitalized, RT-PCR confirmed, coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19) patients, from nine tertiary centers, after institutional ethics committee (IEC) approval. Then, we segregated and analyzed the data of patients admitted to the ICU, for comorbidities, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) score, ventilatory support, etc. The primary outcomes were ICU and hospital mortality. We also performed multivariable analysis for predictors of ICU mortality. RESULTS: Overall, there were 3,498 ICU patients. In the first wave, 1,921 patients needed ICU admission, while in the second wave, 1,577 patients. Patients in the second wave had significantly higher ICU (26.1 vs 13.4%, p <0.001) and hospital mortality (29.9 vs 18.2%, p <0.001) and need for ventilatory support of any type. More patients received steroids during the second wave. On multivariable regression, male gender, ICU admission during the second wave, increasing HRCT score, and need for intubation and mechanical ventilation were significant predictors of ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: ICU patients admitted during the two waves were of the similar age, but there were more females, and more patients had comorbidities during the second wave. The ICU and hospital mortality were significantly higher during the second wave. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Zirpe KG, Dixit S, Kulkarni AP, Pandit RA, Ranganathan P, Prasad S, et al.

METHODS The study cohort comprised 708 consecutive male patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (n = 551) or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (n = 157) between January 1999 and September 2012. Operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, and positive surgical margins frequency were compared between laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age or body mass index between the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients. Prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason sum and clinical stage of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients were significantly higher than those of the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients suffered significantly less bleeding (P < 0.05). The overall frequency of positive surgical margins was 30.6% (n = 167; 225 sites) in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group and 27.5% (n = 42; 58 sites) in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group. In the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group, positive surgical margins were detected in the apex (52.0%), anterior (5.3%), posterior (5.3%) and lateral regions (22.7%) of the prostate, as well as in the bladder neck (14.7%). In the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients, they were observed in the apex, anterior, posterior, and lateral regions of the prostate in 43.0%, 6.9%, 25.9% and 15.5% of patients, respectively, as well as in the bladder neck in 8.6% of patients. CONCLUSIONS Positive surgical margin distributions after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy are significantly different. The only disadvantage of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is the lack of tactile feedback. Thus, the robotic surgeon needs to take this into account to minimize the risk of positive surgical margins.","output":"Pitfalls of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a comparison of positive surgical margins between robotic and laparoscopic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly escalating pandemic that has spread to many parts of the world. As such, there is urgent need to identify predictors of clinical severity in COVID-19 patients. This may be useful for early identification of patients who may require life-saving interventions. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated whether malignancies are associated with a significantly enhanced odds of COVID-19 severity and mortality. METHOD: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, to May 26th, 2020 on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) to identify studies reporting data on cancers in patients with or without severe COVID-19 were included. The primary outcome of interest was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 severity, while the secondary outcome was the association between malignancies and COVID-19 mortality. Data were pooled into a meta-analysis to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for either outcome. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies (n = 4549 patients) were included. Overall, malignancies were found to be associated with significantly increased odds of COVID-19 severity (OR = 2.17; 95% CI 1.47C3.196; p < 0.001) and mortality (OR = 2.39; 95% CI 1.18C4.85; p = 0.016). No heterogeneity was observed for both outcomes (Cochran's Q = 6.558, p = 0.922, I(2) = 0% and Cochran's Q = 2.91, p = 0.71, I(2) = 0% respectively). CONCLUSION: Malignancies were significantly associated with a 2-fold increase in the odds of developing severe COVID-19 disease, as well as mortality. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings. These patients should be closely monitored for any signs of unfavorable disease progression.","output":"Cancer is associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severity and mortality: A pooled analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Visual acuity is a critical component of visual function assessment for all ages. Standardized vision testing protocols may help prevent testing inconsistencies resulting from variations in test administration and interpretation of different examiners. However, most vision assessments outside of research settings, including in doctors offices, rarely employ standardized protocols. Validated protocols such as the Early Treatment for Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) are frequently employed by vision researchers to ensure accurate and repeatable visual acuity measurements. METHODS: This study evaluates a desktop-based standardized vision testing algorithm (EyeSpy 20/20) specifically designed for use on mobile electronic platforms. Subjects were tested on a desktop version of the EyeSpy software for both the accuracy and duration of measurement of visual acuity and compared to a e-ETDRS chart in a randomized sequence. Children were recruited for this study and tested between two different visual acuity measurement systems. BlandCAltman analysis and correlation tests were done. RESULTS: Hundred and ten children were recruited for the study. The EyeSpy 20/20 visual acuity testing algorithm as tested with the desktop version was non-inferior to the gold standard e-ETDRS testing algorithm on a desktop platform, but statistically faster to implement when administered on the same electronic testing platform.

However, given the weak absorbance of traditional 20-40 nm spherical AuNPs, their sensitivity is low, which greatly limits the wide application of AuNP-based LFIA. With the rapid advances in materials science and nanotechnology, the synthesis of noble metal nanoparticles (NMNPs) has enhanced physicochemical properties such as optical, plasmonic, catalytic, and multifunctional activity by simply engineering their physical parameters, including the size, shape, composition, and external structure. Using these engineered NMNPs as an alternative to traditional AuNPs, the sensitivity of LFIA has been significantly improved, thereby greatly expanding the working range and application scenarios of LFIA, particularly in trace analysis. Therefore, in this review, we will focus on the design of engineered NMNPs and their demonstration in improving LFIA. We highlight the strategies available for tailoring NMNP designs, the effect of NMNP engineering on their performance, and the working principle of each engineering design for enhancing LFIA.

For this, MERS-CoV S engages the host cell protein dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) and the interface between MERS-CoV S and DPP4 has been resolved on the atomic level. Here, we asked whether naturally-occurring polymorphisms in DPP4, that alter amino acid residues required for MERS-CoV S binding, influence cellular entry of MERS-CoV. By screening of public databases, we identified fourteen such polymorphisms. Introduction of the respective mutations into DPP4 revealed that all except one (&#916;346-348) were compatible with robust DPP4 expression. Four polymorphisms (K267E, K267N, A291P and &#916;346-348) strongly reduced binding of MERS-CoV S to DPP4 and S protein-driven host cell entry, as determined using soluble S protein and S protein bearing rhabdoviral vectors, respectively. Two polymorphisms (K267E and A291P) were analyzed in the context of authentic MERS-CoV and were found to attenuate viral replication.

Forty-nine hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were enrolled in a prospective, observational, single-center study in Barcelona, Spain. Demographic, clinical, and analytical data at admission were registered. Plasma samples were collected within the first 48 h following hospitalization. Patients were stratified based on the severity of their evolution as moderate (N = 13), severe (N = 10), or critical (N = 26). A panel of 221 biomarkers was measured by targeted metabolomics in order to evaluate metabolic changes associated with subsequent disease severity. Our results show that obesity, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, as well as some analytical parameters and radiological findings, were all associated with disease severity. Additionally, ceramide metabolism, tryptophan degradation, and reductions in several metabolic reactions involving nicotinamide adenine nucleotide (NAD) at inclusion were significantly associated with respiratory severity and correlated with inflammation.

NAD+ levels decline with age and are also reduced in conditions associated with oxidative stress as occurs with hypertension, diabetes and obesity. These groups have also been observed to have high mortality following infection with COVID-19. Further consumption of NAD+ in a pre-existent depleted state is more likely to cause progression to the hyperinflammatory stage of the disease through its limiting effects on the production of SIRT1. This provides a unifying hypothesis as to why these groups are at high risk of mortality and suggests that nutritional support with NAD+ and SIRT1 activators, could minimise disease severity if administered prophylactically and or therapeutically.

Timing and severity of influenza seasons contribute to those patterns, especially among vulnerable populations such as patients with ESRD. However, the extent to which influenza-like illness (ILI), a syndrome comprising a range of potentially serious respiratory tract infections, contributes to mortality in patients with ESRD has not been quantified. METHODS We used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ESRD death data from 2000 to 2013. After addressing the increasing trend in deaths due to the growing prevalent ESRD population, we calculated quarterly relative mortality compared with average third-quarter (summer) death counts. We used linear regression models to assess the relationship between ILI data and mortality, separately for quarters 4 and 1 for each influenza season, and model parameter estimates to predict seasonal mortality counts and calculate excess ILI-associated deaths. RESULTS An estimated 1% absolute increase in quarterly ILI was associated with a 1.5% increase in relative mortality for quarter 4 and a 2.0% increase for quarter 1. The average number of annual deaths potentially attributable to ILI was substantial, about 1100 deaths per year. CONCLUSIONS We found an association between community ILI activity and seasonal variation in all-cause mortality in patients with ESRD, with ILI likely contributing to >1000 deaths annually.

Intense livestock production, increased travel, and changing climate have increased the risk of catastrophic animal losses due to infectious diseases. In the event of an outbreak, it is essential to properly manage the infected animals to prevent the spread of diseases. The most common disposal methods used during a disease outbreak include burial, landfilling, incineration and composting. Biosecurity, transportation logistics, public perception, and environmental concerns limit the use of some of these methods. During a disease outbreak, the large number of mortalities often exceeds the capacity of local rendering plants and landfills. Transporting mortalities to disposal and incineration facilities outside the production operation introduces biosecurity risks. Burying mortalities is limited by the size and availability of suitable sites and it has the risk of pathogen survival and contamination of groundwater and soil. Portable incinerators are expensive and have the potential to aerosolize infectious particles. Composting, on the other hand, has been recognized as a biosecure disposal method. Research showed that it eliminates bacterial pathogens such as Escherichia coli O157: H7, Salmonella spp., as well as viruses including highly pathogenic avian influenza, foot-and-mouth disease, Newcastle disease, and porcine epidemic diarrhea.

This is not only a health problem, but also a social problem that has attracted the attention of both hospitals and the government. Objective: This study aims to analyze the characteristics of abnormal death in physicians in Chinese hospitals from 2007 to 2020 and to investigate the relationship between abnormal death and physician workload, in order to provide information for policy makers and request improvement technologies. Methods: A mixed research method was used. In order to ensure accuracy and completeness, a relatively comprehensive search was conducted using multiple heterogeneous data sources on the abnormal death of physicians in Chinese hospitals from 2007 to 2020. The collected cases were then descriptively analyzed using the work-related overwork death risk concept framework and the deductive grounded theory approach. In addition, the workload of physicians was calculated between 2007 and 2019 based on three important workload indicators. Results: Between 2007 and 2020, 207 abnormal death events of physicians on the Chinese mainland were publicly reported. Among the 207 victims, the majority (~79%) died from overwork or sudden death. The number of victims who were men was 5.5 times higher than that of women, and victims were between the ages of 31C50 years. These physicians mainly belonged to the departments of surgery, anesthesiology, internal medicine, and orthopedics. Further analysis of the direct causes of death in cases of overwork death showed that 51 physicians (31.1%) died from cardiogenic diseases. Additionally, the per capita workload of physicians in China increased drastically by about 42% from 2007 to 2019, far exceeding physician workloads in Europe, Asia, and Australia (number of inpatients per physician in 2017: 72 vs. 55, 50, 45). The analysis revealed that there was a strong correlation between the number of abnormal deaths of physicians in China and the number of inpatients per physician (r = 0.683, P = 0.01). Conclusion: High-intensity working conditions may be positively correlated with the number of abnormal deaths among physicians.

Assessing potential drugs for safety and efficacy enables clinicians to make evidence-based treatment decisions and contributes to overall outbreak control. However, it is difficult to launch clinical trials in the unpredictable environment of an outbreak. We conducted a bibliometric systematic review for the 2009 influenza pandemic to determine the speed and quality of evidence generation for treatments. This informs approaches to high-quality evidence generation in this and future pandemics. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all clinical data (including clinical trial, observational and case series) describing treatment for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and ClinicalTrials.gov for research that aimed to enrol patients with the disease. RESULTS: Thirty-three thousand eight hundred sixty-nine treatment courses for patients hospitalised with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detailed in 160 publications. Most were retrospective observational studies or case series. Five hundred ninety-two patients received treatment (or placebo) as participants in a registered interventional clinical trial with results publicly available. None of these registered trial results was available during the timeframe of the pandemic, and the median date of publication was 213 days after the Public Health Emergency of International Concern ended. CONCLUSION: Patients were frequently treated for pandemic influenza with drugs not registered for this indication, but rarely under circumstances of high-quality data capture. The result was a reliance on use under compassionate circumstances, resulting in continued uncertainty regarding the potential benefits and harms of anti-viral treatment.

METHODS: A systematic review was performed including all studies investigating success regarding treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine. We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic billing records after telemedicine was implemented from 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020 and reviewed modifier 95 inclusion to determine the number of face-to-face and telemedicine visits, as well as breakdown of weekly telemedicine clinic visits by subspecialty. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies (25 prospective and 27 retrospective) with 45 801 patients were analyzed. A total of 13 studies were conducted in the United States and 39 in foreign countries. Patient management was successful via telemedicine in 99.6% of cases. Telemedicine visits failed in 162 cases, 81.5% of which were due to technology failure, and 18.5% of which were due to patients requiring further face-to-face evaluation or treatment. A total of 16 studies compared telemedicine encounters to alternative patient encounter mediums; telemedicine was equivalent or superior in 15 studies. From 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020, our department had 122 telemedicine visits (65.9%) and 63 face-to-face visits (34.1%). About 94.3% of telemedicine visits were billed using face-to-face procedural codes.

This pandemic changed the way organizations work, managers meet with employees, and employees communicate. An e-mail-based survey among computer users who use video chat software for remote working is employed in this study. Using 306 responses, structural equation modeling explores the relationship between privacy concerns, protection behavior, and antecedents. The technological changes induced due to Covid-19 influence privacy concerns and protection behavior. Privacy efficacy increases privacy concerns and protection behavior. Perceived vulnerability increases privacy concerns. Perceived effectiveness of organization software affects privacy concerns but does not affect protection behavior. There is a positive relationship between privacy concerns and protection behavior;however, this positive relation is negatively moderated by a propensity to trust. A finding of threat severity measure using Covid-19 factors concludes that both privacy concerns and protection behavior increased for online video chat software users. The theoretical model explicates 75% of variances in privacy concerns and 57% of variances in protection behavior. Every one-unit increase in Covid-19 induced changes regarding the work environment increases the privacy concern by 35%, and every one-unit increase in perceived effectiveness of organization software increases privacy concern by 22%.

Many contributors to bile acid synthesis and transport have previously been reported to be downregulated in patients with BA; yet, the driving factors of the abnormal bile acid synthesis and transport in regard to BA have not been previously studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS Wild type or Ig--/- mice were injected with salt solution (control) or rotavirus on day of life 0, and analyses were performed on day of life 14. The mRNA levels of bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors and liver microRNAs (miRNAs) were compared between groups. A mouse hepatocyte cell line was used to examine the effects of innate cytokines on miRNA levels and bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression and miRNAs on bile acid transporter/nuclear receptor expression. RESULTS BA mice had significantly increased mRNA expression of innate cytokines and miRNAs known to bind bile acid transporters/nuclear receptors (miRNAs -22-5p, -34a-5p, and -222-3p) and decreased mRNA expression of bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. In vitro, TNF- and IL-1 decreased BSEP and CYP7A1 while increasing miRNA-34a-5p and miRNA 222-3p. LXR, SHP, CYP7A1, NTCP, and MRP2 were decreased by miRNA-34a-5p, whereas miRNA-222-3p decreased NTCP and MRP4. TNF- and IL-1 increased expression of miRNAs 34a-5p and 222-3p and these miRNAs then decrease expression of multiple bile acid transporters and nuclear receptors. CONCLUSIONS Loss of bile acid transporters increases hepatotoxicity via bile acid retention.

Software SatScan was used for spatiotemporal scanning analysis to visualize the hot-spot areas of the epidemic. Results: The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 had obvious global autocorrelation and the partial autocorrelation results showed that incidence of COVID-19 had different spatial distribution at different times from December 8, 2019 to March 4, 2020. There was no significant difference in global autocorrelation coefficient from March 5, 2020 to April 8, 2020. The statistical analysis of spatiotemporal scanning identified two kinds of spatiotemporal clustering areas, the first class clustering areas included 10 prefectures, mainly distributed in Hubei, from January 13 to February 25, 2020. The secondary class clustering areas included 142 prefectures, mainly distributed in provinces in the north and east of Hubei, from January 23 to February 1, 2020. Conclusions: There was a clear spatiotemporal correlation in the distribution of the outbreaks in the early phase of COVID-19 epidemic (December 8, 2019-March 4, 2020) in China.

To stem the tide of this pandemic, there was acceleration of the development, testing and prelicensure approval for emergency use of some COVID-19 vaccine candidates. This led to raised public concern about their safety and efficacy, compounding the challenges of vaccine hesitancy. The onus of managing and administering these vaccines to a sceptical populace when they do become available rests mostly on the shoulders of healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, the vaccine confidence levels of HCWs become critical to the success of vaccination endeavours. This proposed study aims to estimate the level of vaccine confidence and the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine among future HCWs and their trainers at a specific university in Cape Town, South Africa, and to identify any vaccination concerns early for targeted intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This proposed study is a cross-sectional survey study. An online questionnaire will be distributed to all current staff and students of the Faculty of Medicine Health Sciences of Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. No sampling strategy will be employed. The survey questionnaire will consist of demographic questions (consisting of six items) and vaccine confidence questions (comprising six items in Likert scale format). Log binomial models will be employed to identify factors associated with vaccine confidence and intention. The strength of association will be assessed using the OR and its 95% CI.

This pathogen may survive in the environment for several months and is highly resistant to some disinfectants. Infection Transmission occurs via the faecalCoral route. Indirect contact is the most common route of infection, and FPV may be carried by fomites (shoes, clothing), which means indoor cats are also at risk. Intrauterine virus transmission and infection of neonates can occur. Disease signs Cats of all ages may be affected by FPV, but kittens are most susceptible. Mortality rates are high C over 90% in kittens. Signs of disease include diarrhoea, lymphopenia and neutropenia, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia, immunosuppression (transient in adult cats), cerebellar ataxia (in kittens only) and abortion. Diagnosis Feline panleukopenia virus antigen is detected in faeces using commercially available test kits. Specialised laboratories carry out PCR testing on whole blood or faeces. Serological tests are not recommended, as they do not distinguish between infection and vaccination. Disease management Supportive therapy and good nursing significantly decrease mortality rates. In cases of enteritis, parenteral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde or sodium hydroxide are effective. Vaccination recommendations All cats C including indoor cats C should be vaccinated. Two injections, at 8C9 weeks of age and 3C4 weeks later, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. A third vaccination at 16C20 weeks of age is recommended for kittens from environments with a high infection pressure (cat shelters) or from queens with high vaccine-induced antibody levels (breeding catteries). Subsequent booster vaccinations should be administered at intervals of 3 years or more.

METHODS: Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct effect of workstation characteristics, stress, and musculoskeletal symptoms to productivity and the indirect effect of psychological detachment to productivity. Data were gathered from a survey of employees working from home during the pandemic from different industries (n = 352). Multigroup analysis was also conducted to determine the effect of age, having a spouse, and having children less than 18 years old, to the model. RESULTS: Ergonomic suitability of the workstation (WES) has a significant effect on musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS) (? = -0.31, SE = 0.06; p < .001). Both workstation suitability (? = -0.24, SE = 0.03; p < .001) and workstation ergonomic suitability (? = -0.18, SE = 0.01; p < .01) inversely affect STR.

Here we report both anti-biofilm and wound-healing properties of the chitosan-immobilized Ficin. The proposed chitosan-adsorption approach allowed preserving ~90% of the initial total activity of the enzyme (when using azocasein as a substrate) with stabilization factor of 4.9, and ~70% of its specific enzymatic activity. In vitro, the chitosan-immobilized Ficin degraded staphylococcal biofilms, this way increasing the efficacy of antimicrobials against biofilm-embedded bacteria. In vivo, in the presence of Ficin (either soluble or immobilized), the S. aureus-infected skin wound areas in rats reduced twofold after 4 instead of 6a?days of treatment. Moreover, topical application of the immobilized enzyme resulted in a 3-log reduction of S. aureus cell count on the wound surfaces in 6a?days, compared to more than 10a?days required to achieve the same effect in control. Additional advantages include smoother reepithelisation, and new tissue formation exhibiting collagen structure characteristics closely reminiscent of those observed in the native tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that both soluble and immobilized Ficin appear beneficial for the treatment of biofilm-associated infections, as well as speeding up wound healing and microbial decontamination.","output":"Anti-biofilm and wound-healing activity of chitosan-immobilized Ficin"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Elective orthopaedic surgery has been severely curtailed because of coronavirus disease, 2019. There is scant scientific evidence to guide surgeons in assessing the protocols that must be implemented before resuming elective orthopaedic surgery safely after the second wave of the coronavirus disease, 2019. METHODS: A retrospective review of elective orthopaedic surgeries performed between May 15, 2020, and November 20, 2020, was conducted. A screening questionnaire was used, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoglobulin G and IgM antibodies testing were assessed in all admitted patients. Screening and testing data for coronavirus disease was reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: Of 592 patients tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during the study period, 21 (3.5%) tested positive. There were 2 patients (0.3%) with positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests, 3 (0.5%) with positive IgG and IgM antibodies, 13 (2.2%) with positive IgG antibodies, and 10 (1.7%) with positive IgM antibodies. Among these 21 patients, 20 (95.2%) were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that most elective orthopaedic surgery patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 are asymptomatic. In the second wave of coronavirus disease, 2019, universal testing of all patients should be strongly considered as an important measure to prevent clusters of in-hospital transmission of the disease.","output":"Challenges and responses of elective orthopaedic surgery during the second wave of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of infertility in Iran is higher than the world average.

While many of these deaths were due to COVID-19 infection, others have been attributed to strain on the overburdened health care system and delays in patients seeking medical care due to the pandemic. We sought to examine the overall mortality in individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) who received their care at our Sickle Cell Center in Bronx New York in 2020 and investigated whether the number and causes of death in 2020 differed from the previous 3 years. Methods: Death date was collected from electronic medical records (EMR) and death certificates. Clinical variables collected from EMR included age, gender, race, genotype, history of comorbidities, hydroxyurea use, and health care utilization in the 12 months prior to death date. To determine cause of death, two hematologists performed manual review of the EMR blinded from each other and deaths were categorized as due to: sudden death, cardiovascular causes, sepsis, stroke, acute organ failure (including multi organ failure syndrome), chronic organ failure, hemorrhage, and unknown when records of the death event were not available. A third hematologist served as a tie breaker in cases of disagreement. Patients were also categorized as having: 1) sepsis present or absent during the death event, 2) acute (new or newly worsened) renal or liver failure present or absent during the death event, and 3) COVID status at death (acute COVID, past COVID, no COVID, or unknown COVID status). Acute COVID infection was defined by a positive PCR swab during the hospitalization leading to death or in the prior two weeks. Past COVID infection was defined by a negative PCR swab during the hospitalization and a positive PCR swab and/or antibody test more than two weeks before the death event with documented resolution of symptoms. No COVID infection was defined by a negative PCR swab or antibody test documented in the EMR and no positive tests present or noted per patient report. Unknown COVID status was unknown if no testing was present in the EMR. To examine how 2020 decedents differed from decedents in the prior 3 years, we compared clinical variables using the Kruskal Wallis test for continuous variables and chi 2 tests for dichotomous variables. To examine differences between 2020 decedents between known COVID (acute or chronic) vs. no COVID, we repeated similar tests among the 2020 decedents only. Results: In the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, there were 9, 10, 8, and 22 patient deaths respectively. Compared with decedents in the prior 3 years, patients who died in 2020 were more likely to have acute liver failure during the hospitalization, were more likely to have history of stroke, and had more heme clinic visits in the prior 12 months. Otherwise, there was no difference in age, gender, genotype, hydroxyurea use, history of disease morbidity, hospital utilization in the prior 12 months, or sepsis before death (Table 1). Among the 22 who died in 2020, 3 had an acute COVID infection, five had past COVID, 8 had no COVID, and 6 had unknown COVID status. Among 2020 decedents, acute or past covid was associated with acute organ failure (p=0.02) and less hydroxyurea use (p=0.04). (Table 2). Conclusions: SCD deaths at our center more than doubled in 2020 compared to prior years, but fewer than half of the decedents had acute or prior COVID. Compared with prior years, 2020 decedents were more likely to have acute organ failure. This could be explained by COVID infection, delays in seeking care, or changes in care delivery during the COVID pandemic. This study emphasizes the need for further studies on the impact the pandemic had on the health of adults with SCD, as well as the need for prospective studies of patients with SCD who recover from COVID.

Atmospheric composition can influence cloud properties and might have a significant effect on the initiation of precipitation. This study investigated changes in precipitation patterns during COVID-19 lockdowns and compared them to patterns observed during the previous 19 years (2001 through 2019) across two regions of interest, the Hubei province in China and Northern Italy using a satellite-based precipitation dataset. Results indicated that overall rainfall averages were higher in the spring of 2020 with respect to their corresponding climatological means, with higher standard deviations especially in the more urbanized regions like Wuhan, China and Milan, Italy. Precipitation rates observed during the Spring of 2020 tend to fall outside of the climatological 25C75th percentile bounds. Similarly, the number of rainy pixels was in several cases in Spring 2020 higher than the climatological 75th percentile and sometimes even higher than the 95th one. These anomalies may be due to natural variations and may not be caused directly by the reduction in atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Nevertheless, our analysis proved that precipitation patterns during the lockdowns were on the extreme tails of the precipitation climatological distributions for both regions of interest. Lastly, decorrelation lags and distances in Northern Italy remained similar to their corresponding climatological values, whereas in the Hubei province some differences were observed, with the Spring 2020 spatial correlation variogram almost overlapping the climatological 5th percentile and with a decorrelation distance shorter than the climatological value.

RESULTS Of the 293 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in this study, 71 were excluded from the primary analysis (for race/ethnicity other than black non-Hispanic). Of the 222 hospitalized COVID-19 patients included in our analyses, 41.4% were female, 78.8% had pCVD, and 30.6% developed AKI during the admission. In multivariable analyses, pCVD (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.5-14.8, P=0.008) and AKI (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.3-5.5, P=0.006) were associated with increased odds of in-hospital cardiac events. AKI was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality (OR 8.9, 95% CI 3.3-23.9, P<0.0001).

We will include prospective and retrospective studies that assess sputum Gram stain in adults (aged 18 years) with CAP. Two reviewers will independently extract data and rate each studys validity with standard quality assessment tools. We will subsequently perform standard and latent-class random-effects model meta-analyses to quantitatively synthesize the diagnostic accuracy and yield. Finally, we will assess the totality of evidence by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for diagnostic tests and strategies.

This study aimed to evaluate the influence of an audio-mediated intervention for patient health education (PHE) on treatment compliance and treatment satisfaction among patients seeking prosthodontic treatment during the Covid pandemic. METHODS: A total of 666 patients (aged 40C70 years) who fulfilled the study criteria were treated for denture-associated disease. PHE for 5 different categories was performed using an educational audio (MP3) in the experimental group (Group E), and traditional methods (oral/verbal) in the control group (Group C). Patient/clinician satisfaction with the PHE program was evaluated with a pre-validated questionnaire, whereas treatment compliance and satisfaction were evaluated using a denture hygiene index (DHI) and a visual analog scale (VAS). Differences between qualitative variables were determined using the chi-square test, whereas continuous variables were assessed using an unpaired t-test. Differences were considered to be statistically significant at p  0.05. RESULTS: Patient satisfaction with PHE was significantly higher and differed in the Group E for two parameters: education method (80%), educational material (94%). For all parameters of procedural education, patient/clinician satisfaction was significantly higher for Group E [method (93%), material (85%), patient preparation (89%), personalized education (84%), program (93%)]. From three different ratings of disease education, 70% in Group E rated education as effective as compared to 41% in the Group C. Effectiveness of post treatment, education measured through DHI, revealed a lower hygiene score in Group E (m = 1.18) as compared to Group C (m = 2.92), with differences being significant.

The infarcts were caused by local arteriosclerosis of brain arteries, arterial emboli originating from the operative sites or myocardial infarctions, or by fat emboli, foreign body emboli or megakaryocytic capillary emboli in rare cases. Inflammatory disturbances were present in 17 cases and consisted of fungal or bacterial septicopyemic changes (12) or of glial nodules (5) as the substrate of a viral or autoimmunencephalitis (Bickerstaff). An incidental finding was Alzheimers disease in 37 cases (14% of the material) of elderly patients, often associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy but not as cause of death or cause of macroscopic brain hemorrhage.

The ORF2 sequence of the IAF-2897 strain of PCV2 has been cloned into a pCEP5 eucaryotic expression vector under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, downstream of a polyhistidine sequence tag. The recombinant plasmid was used in transfection experiments with human epithelial kidney 293 cells that were further tested, and positive expression of the viral nucleocapsid protein was confirmed by IFA and Western blotting. Strong, specific fluorescence was observed in the nuclei of transfected cells. Test specificity to PCV2 was verified with several related infectious agents. Sensitivity was compared to that of standard IFA using PCV2-infected cells by evaluating the reactivities of 44 field serum samples from pigs on farms with a porcine population suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. The recombinant nucleocapsid-based test was able to detect 15 more positive-testing pigs than the PCV2-based IFA.

Avoidance was associated with pain (? = 0.347). Reexperiencing was not associated with any physical health variable. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of COVID-19, the sense of threat symptoms in PTSD is most strongly related to somatic problems. Findings suggest that interventions addressing sense of threat symptoms might provide relief from somatization.","output":"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Persistent Somatic Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Sense of Threat"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 or the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become pandemic with its origin in Wuhan City of China Within few weeks, it became a global health threat involving more than 200 countries Though the main route of transmission is by respiratory droplets;trans-conjunctival aerosol infection is a known mode of disease transmission Patients with COVID-19 conjunctivitis have the transmissible virus in the tears Close contact during ophthalmic procedures has the risk of patient to ophthalmologist disease transmission Conjunctivitis may be the first symptom of COVID-19 In context to this and close proximity of an ophthalmologists and Health Care Workers (HCW) with the patient and the nature of work, standard infection protection measures guidelines are given by prominent health care societies","output":"Review of SARS-CoV-2 and Conjunctivitis: Ophthalmologists Be Safe"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the education of students attracts more and more attention, the task of graduation development prediction has gradually become a hot topic in academia and industry. The task of graduation development prediction aims to predict the employment category of students in advance via academic achievement data, which can help administrators understand students learning status and set up a reasonable learning plan. However, existing research ignores the potential impact of social relationships on students graduation development choices. To fully explore social relationships among students, we propose a Social-path Embedding-based Transformer Neural Network (SPE-TNN) for the task of graduation development prediction in this paper. Specifically, SPE-TNN is divided into the Social-path selection layer, the Social-path embedding layer, the Transformer layer, and the Multi-layer projection layer. Firstly, the Social-path selection layer is designed to find social relationships that impact graduation development and embed them into the students performance features through the Social-path embedding layer. Secondly, the Transformer layer is adopted to balance the weights of the students features. Finally, the Multi-layer projection layer is used to achieve the student graduation development prediction. Experimental results on the real-world datasets show that SPE-TNN outperforms the existing popular approaches.","output":"Social-path embedding-based transformer for graduation development prediction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Obesity and fatty liver steatosis are already considered metabolic risk factors which may aggravate the severity of COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the correlation between COVID-19 severity, obesity, and liver steatosis and fibrosis. 230 consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged between 15 and 84 years, admitted to a hospital devoted to COVID-19 patients, were enrolled in the study. COVID-19 severity was classified as severe versus non-severe based on admission to ICU. Obesity was assessed by Body Mass Index (BMI). CT-scan was used to check for the liver steatosis. Fibrosis-4 score was calculated. The study was conducted in March-May 2020. Obesity strongly and positively correlated with severe COVID-19 illness r: 0.760 (P<0.001). Hepatic steatosis had rather less of a correlation with COVID-19 severity r: 0.365 (P<0.001). Multivariable-adjusted association between hepatic steatosis or obesity, or both (as exposure) and COVID-19 severity (as the outcome) revealed increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness with obesity (Adjusted model I OR: 465.3, 95 % CI: 21.9-9873.3, P<0.001), with hepatic steatosis (Adjusted model I OR: 5.1, 95 % CI: 1.2-21.0, P<0.025), and with hepatic steatosis among obese patients (Adjusted model I OR: 132, 95 % CI: 10.3-1691.8, P<0.001). Obesity remained the most noticeable factor that strongly correlated with COVID-19 severity, more than liver steatosis. However, the risk to COVID-19 severity was greater in those with both factors: obesity and liver steatosis.

First, the Kantian roots of emancipation understood as the capacity of rational beings to act according to self-chosen ends are explained. It is shown that this conception of emancipation sets the realm of autonomous beings humans over the realm of heteronomous beings. Accounts of the ?humanisation of nature? are analysed as incomplete attempts to overcome this dualism. It is argued that the root of this incompleteness lies in the application of analytical rather than dialectical reason to the human?nature interaction. The Anthropocene is presented as the geological?historical moment when at the same time as nature is being humanised, humans are being made aware of themselves as animal. This gives way to a conception of Anthropocene emancipation which will be described in a fourth section. The article concludes with reflections on COVID-19 as a ?disease of the Anthropocene? and as an opportunity reflexively, and at unprecedented scale, to internalise our heteronomy and to live an emancipation fit for a terraforming species.","output":"Emancipation in the Anthropocene: Taking the dialectic seriously"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Community-based care for people with severe mental illness increasingly requires far-reaching cooperation between different domains.

The restrictions in daily life associated to COVID-19 pandemic had an impact in the quality of life of PCI and it might have affected the efficacy of the CS programs targeting this population.Research Objective:To analyse if there was a moderating effect of the pandemic on the efficacy of CS programs.Method:Participants were enrolled in a public memory clinic;213 PCI were assigned to two groups: 173 received CS treatment before the pandemic (PRECOVID) and 40 received CS during the pandemic (COVID). Pre and post assessments were carried out with the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), the clock-test and the brief Geriatric Depression Scale. The treatment consisted of 32 sessions of CS held twice a week during 4 months. No significant differences (p<.05) were found between groups at baseline in age (74.467.80 years), cognitive function (MMSE=23.433.30), gender (58% women) and the remaining variables.Preliminary results of the ongoing study:After treatment, both samples improved in depression (t = 4.56, p < .05), the COVID group improved in MMSE (t = -3.40, p < .05) and clock-test (t= -3.78, p < .05), the rest of the changes were not significant. Between group effect sizes favoured the COVID group intervention for MMSE (dc = 0.74) and the clock test (dc = 0.48). No between group differences were found for depression (dc = -0.48).Conclusions:Older people participating of CS during the pandemic benefited more from the treatment than those participating before the pandemic. This apparently contradictory result might be explained by the context of lack of social, emotional and cognitive stimulation associated to the restrictions inherent to social confinement. The continuity of CS care to PCI is essential in the context of generalised restrictions in daily life associated to COVID-19 pandemic and might play an important role in preventing cognitive loss and associated disabilities.","output":"Moderating effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the efficacy of cognitive stimulation.

Their modular structure, mostly annotated by sequence homology, is believed to determine substrate recognition and subcellular localization. Currently, a large proportion of known human USP sequences are not annotated either structurally or functionally, including regions both within and flanking their catalytic cores. To extend the current understanding of human USPs, we applied consensus fold recognition to the unannotated content of the human USP family. The most interesting discovery was the marked presence of reliably predicted ubiquitin\\\\like (UBL) domains in this family of enzymes. The UBL domain thus appears to be the most frequently occurring domain in the human USP family, after the characteristic catalytic domain. The presence of multiple UBL domains per USP protein, as well as of UBL domains embedded in the USP catalytic core, add to the structural complexity currently recognized for many DUBs. Possible functional roles of the newly uncovered UBL domains of human USPs, including proteasome binding, and substrate and protein target specificities, are discussed.

Indeed, in some patients, SARS-CoV-2 promotes a dysfunctional immune response that dysregulates the cytokine secretory pattern. Hypercytokinemia underlies the hyperinflammatory state leading to injury of alveolar epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells, as well as to lung infiltration sustained by neutrophils and macrophages. Within such a pathogenic context, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other cytokines/chemokines play a pivotal pro-inflammatory role. Therefore, cytokines and their receptors, as well as cytokine-dependent intracellular signalling pathways can be targeted by potential therapies aimed to relieve the heavy burden of cytokine storm. In particular, the anti-IL-6-receptor monoclonal antibody tocilizumab is emerging as one of the most promising pharmacologic treatments.

The official websites of anatomy departments may contribute to achieving this goal. Nevertheless, previous studies reported institutional or individual reluctance of departments or anatomists, respectively, due to an expectation of adverse publicity. This study aimed to investigate whether the official websites of Turkish anatomy departments provided information on body donation and analyzed the content of these websites. Websites of anatomy departments at 100 medical faculties were evaluated. Only 12 departments (12%) provided information on body donation with varying content. A thematic analysis of the information provided revealed five main themes. These were (1) legal aspects, (2) significance, (3) acceptance/rejection criteria, (4) availability, and (5) redirection. All departments (n = 12, 100%) outlined the legal aspects of body donation, 7 departments (58%) highlighted the significance of body donation, 7 departments (58%) provided contact information for potential donors, 5 departments (41%) covered acceptance/rejection criteria, and 3 departments (25%) provided a link to the official website of the Turkish Society of Anatomy and Clinical Anatomy. Thus Turkish anatomy departments were reluctant to provide information on body donation, and the content of provided information varied greatly among departments.

There is a significant association between CKD and more severe COVID-19 infection and a greater mortality rate than the general population. People living with end-stage CKD were classified as extremely clinically vulnerable and asked to shield at home. Since people living with CKD do not receive routine physical and emotional wellbeing support as part of routine NHS care, a home-based solution was developed to fill this urgent need. Methods: We partnered with online exercise platform Beam to co-design Kidney Beam (https://beamfeelgood.com/home), a kidney-specific digital health platform, which aimed to offer people living with CKD a way to improve physical and mental health through live and on demand movement classes and educational videos from multidisciplinary experts, all from their own home. The platform was free at point of access for all adults with CKD. A voluntary survey collecting demographic data was completed by participants on sign-up and upon completion of the 6-month pilot to establish whether participants were meeting current physical activity guidelines, to investigate perceptions of health, and collect usability feedback about the platform. Results: A total of 959 participants aged > 18 years from across the UK signed up to the platform within the 6-month time period. Of these, 71% were female, 50% were pre-dialysis and 32% had received a kidney transplant. A total of 1,105 on-demand classes and 829 live classes were completed. The pre-pilot survey was completed by 276 participants (29%), with 76 completing the post-pilot survey. The sample was representative of the baseline sign-ups. Responders to the survey had an 8% improvement in general health (change from perception of poor or fair health to good or very good health) by the end of the pilot. Additionally, 6% of responders reported an improvement in the perception of their emotional health. The pre-pilot survey revealed that only 31% of responders were achieving the recommended physical activity levels of > 150 minutes weekly moderate intensity activity, which had increased to 50% of post-pilot responders. Strength training on 2 days of the week was reported by 31% of responders pre-pilot, compared with 42% post-pilot. 96% of participants would recommend Kidney Beam to a friend, with the biggest reported benefits being that it was kidney-specific and delivered by specialist kidney healthcare professionals. Conclusion(s): The Kidney Beam pilot was a pragmatic programme of care, rapidly evolved to deliver vital physical activity and emotional wellbeing support to people living with CKD at a time of crisis. This platform has been funded for a further 12 months, whilst a randomised controlled trial to evaluate clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness is undertaken to help inform NHS commissioning of the programme. Impact: This has been granted funding for an RCT to evaluate clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness. If successful this will lead to the potential for NHS commissioning, as part of routine care.

Traditional partner services metrics evaluate the number of partners found and treated. We estimated the proportion of partners of syphilis patients not locatable for intervention. METHODS We reviewed records of early syphilis cases (primary, secondary, early latent) reported during 2015-2017 in seven jurisdictions (Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, New York City, and San Francisco). Among interviewed syphilis patients, we determined the proportion who reported named partners (with locating information), reported unnamed partners (no locating information), and did not report partners. For patients with no reported partners, we estimated their range of unreported partners to be between one and the average number of partners for patients who reported partners. RESULTS Among 29,719 syphilis patients, 23,613 (80%) were interviewed and 18,581 (63%) reported 84,224 sex partners (average=4.5; 20,853 (25%) named and 63,371 (75%) unnamed). An estimated 11,138 to 54,521 partners were unreported. Thus, 74,509 to 117,892 (of 95,362 to 138,745) partners were not reached by partner services (78-85%). Among interviewed patients, 71% reported 1 unnamed partner or reported no partners; this proportion was higher for men who reported sex with men [MSM] (75%), compared to men who reported sex with women only (65%), and women (44%).

Here, we used a golden Syrian hamster model to systematically evaluate the kinetics of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, following disease pathology, viral loads, antibody responses, and inflammatory cytokine expression in multiple organs. The kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and genomewide lung transcriptome was also compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised hamsters. We observed that the body weight loss was proportional to the SARS-CoV-2 infectious dose and lasted for a short time only in immunocompetent hamsters. Body weight loss was more prominent and prolonged in infected immunocompromised hamsters. While the kinetics of viral replication and peak live viral loads were not significantly different at low and high infectious doses (LD and HD), the HD-infected immunocompetent animals developed severe lung disease pathology. The immunocompetent animals cleared the live virus in all tested tissues by 12 days post-infection and generated a robust serum antibody response. In contrast, immunocompromised hamsters mounted an inadequate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response, and the virus was detected in the pulmonary and multiple extrapulmonary organs until 16 days post-infection. These hamsters also had prolonged moderate inflammation with severe bronchiolar-alveolar hyperplasia/metaplasia. Consistent with the difference in disease presentation, distinct changes in the expression of inflammation and immune cell response pathways and network genes were seen in the lungs of infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals. This study highlights the interplay between the kinetics of viral replication and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis at organ-level niches and maps how COVID-19 symptoms vary in different immune contexts. Together, our data suggest that the histopathological manifestations caused by progressive SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than individual measures of viral load, antibody response, and cytokine storm at the systemic or local (lungs) levels in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.","output":"Comprehensive analysis of disease pathology in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hamster models of SARS-CoV-2 infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article introduces the volume on New Actors and Contested Architectures in Global Migration Governance It presents the aims and scope of the volume, followed by an overview of international cooperation in global migration governance, migration management and advocacy for migrants We then discuss new actors and how they maintain, contest or even alter established architectures and assemblages, followed by a presentation of the articles included in the volume In conclusion, we reflect on the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may affect these dynamics","output":"New actors and contested architectures in global migration governance: continuity and change"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article presents the case for granting permanent residency to those experiencing significant risks throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to increase citizens' safety.

During the first year of the pandemic, affected countries implemented a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions to control virus transmission. In December 2020, countries started administering several authorised vaccines under a limited supply scenario. In this context, the aim of this study was to develop a SEIR-type continuous-time deterministic disease model, to determine the impact of interaction between different vaccination scenarios and levels of protection measures on disease incidence. For this, the model incorporates (i) a protection measure including low (self-protection), medium (mobility limitation), high (closure of indoor facilities), and very high (lockdown) protection levels, (ii) quarantine for confirmed cases, and (iii) vaccination rate and efficacy of four types of vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca, and Janssen). The model was verified and evaluated using the response timeline and vaccination strategies and rates in the Basque Country (N. Spain). Once the model performance was validated, different initial phase (when 30% of the population is vaccinated) vaccination scenarios were simulated, including (i) a realistic vaccine limited supply scenario and (ii) four potential full vaccine supply scenarios where a unique vaccine type is administered. Significant differences in disease prevalence and cumulative mortality were found between vaccination scenarios for low and medium-level protection measures. For high-level protection measures, any vaccine scenario is effective at limiting the virus transmission and disease mortality. The results obtained here may vary in further studies since there may be some unpredictable factors/covariates. With this in mind, the model here could be easily applied to other regions or countries, modifying the strategies implemented and initial conditions.","output":"Modelling the Effect of the Interaction between Vaccination and Nonpharmaceutical Measures on COVID-19 Incidence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Engagement of LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) in response to the uptake of certain particles modulates innate immune responses.

Additionally, investigations of prospective predictors of mask-wearing, COVID-19 symptoms, and viral testing remain wanting. PURPOSE: The present study examined prospective relations between demographic factors, personality traits, social cognitions and guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptoms, and viral testing in a U.S. sample (N = 500) during the initial surge of COVID-19 deaths in the United State between late March and early May 2020. METHODS: Guided by a disposition-belief-motivation framework, correlational analyses, and path models tested associations among baseline personality traits, guideline adherence social cognitions, health beliefs, guideline adherence and follow-up guideline adherence, mask-wearing, symptom counts, and 30-day viral testing. RESULTS: Modeling results showed greater baseline agreeableness, conscientiousness, and extraversion were associated with more frequent baseline guideline adherence. More liberal political beliefs, greater guideline adherence intentions, and more frequent guideline adherence at baseline predicted more frequent mask-wearing at follow-up. Sex (female), lower perceived health, and greater neuroticism at baseline predicted greater symptom counts at follow-up. Reports of viral testing were quite low (1.80%), yet were consistent with concurrent national reporting and limited availability of testing. CONCLUSIONS: Results show how inconsistencies and politicization of health policy communication were concomitant with the effects of individual-level political beliefs on mask-wearing during the initial surge. The results further clarify how personality traits related to social responsibility (i.e., agreeableness, conscientiousness) are associated with following new norms for prescribed behaviors and how symptom reporting can be as much a marker of perceived health as emotional stability.","output":"Spring 2020 COVID-19 Surge: Prospective Relations between Demographic Factors, Personality Traits, Social Cognitions and Guideline Adherence, Mask Wearing, and Symptoms in a U.S. Sample"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Burnout affects health care providers and leads to adverse consequences.

METHODS A prospective single-center cohort study of HTx recipients who received a 2-dose SARSCoV-2 mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech). Whole blood for anti-spike IgG (S-IgG) antibodies were drawn at days 21-26 and at days 35-40 after the first vaccine dose. Geometric mean titers (GMT) 50 AU/mL were interpreted positive. RESULTS Included were 42 HTx recipients at a median age of 61 (IQR 44, 69) years. Median time from HTx to the 1st vaccine dose was 9.1 (IQR 2.6, 14) years. Only 15% of HTx recipients demonstrated the presence of positive S-IgG antibody titers in response to the 1st vaccine dose (GMT 90 (IQR 54, 229) AU/mL). Forty-nine percent of HTx recipients induced S-IgG antibodies in response to either the 1st or the full 2-dose vaccine schedule (GMT 426 (IQR 106, 884) AU/mL).

Importantly, 36% of HTx recipients who were non-responders to 1st vaccine dose became S-IgG seropositive in response to the 2nd vaccine dose. DISCUSSION Approximately a half of HTx recipients did not generate S-IgG antibodies following SARSCoV-2 2-dose vaccine. The generally achieved protection from SARSCoV-2 mRNA vaccination should be regarded with caution in the population of HTx recipients.

The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed na?ve sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge.

The current study examined associations between COVID-19 anxiety, trait intolerance of uncertainty, and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty and ED pathology and compulsive exercise. METHOD Undergraduate participants (N = 295) completed a series of online questionnaires between March and April of 2020. RESULTS COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were associated with ED pathology, but not compulsive exercise. Additionally, both trait and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty moderated associations between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and ED pathology. COVID-19 anxiety was more strongly related to compulsive exercise and ED pathology for individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. DISCUSSION COVID-19 anxiety may increase risk for ED pathology and may be specifically important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise among individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty.

Spinal imaging in patients with acute low back pain poses risks from diagnostic evaluation of false-positive findings, patient labeling and anxiety, and unnecessary treatment (including spinal surgery). Watchful waiting advice has been an effective strategy to reduce some low-value treatments, and some evidence suggests a watchful waiting approach would be acceptable to many patients requesting diagnostic tests. METHODS: We will use key informant interviews of clinicians and focus groups with primary care patients to refine a theory-informed standardized patient-based intervention designed to teach clinicians how to advise watchful waiting when patients request low-value spinal imaging for low back pain. We will test the effectiveness of the intervention in a randomized clinical trial. We will recruit 8C10 primary care and urgent care clinics (~ 55 clinicians) in Sacramento, CA; clinicians will be randomized 1:1 to intervention and control groups. Over a 3- to 6-month period, clinicians in the intervention group will receive 3 visits with standardized patient instructors (SPIs) portraying patients with acute back pain; SPIs will instruct clinicians in a three-step model emphasizing establishing trust, empathic communication, and negotiation of a watchful waiting approach. Control physicians will receive no intervention. The primary outcome is the post-intervention rate of spinal imaging among actual patients with acute back pain seen by the clinicians adjusted for rate of imaging during a baseline period. Secondary outcomes are use of targeted communication techniques during a follow-up visit with an SP, clinician self-reported use of watchful waiting with actual low back pain patients, post-intervention rates of diagnostic imaging for other musculoskeletal pain syndromes (to test for generalization of intervention effects beyond back pain), and patient trust and satisfaction with physicians. DISCUSSION: This trial will determine whether standardized patient instructors can help clinicians develop skill in negotiating a watchful waiting approach with patients with acute low back pain, thereby reducing rates of low-value spinal imaging. The trial will also examine the possibility that intervention effects generalize to other diagnostic tests. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT 04255199.

METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study carried out in a thirty-eight-bed surgical and medical intensive care unit of a high complexity private hospital. Patients with respiratory failure admitted to the intensive care unit during March and April 2020 and the same months in 2019 were selected. We compared interventions and outcomes of patients without COVID-19 during the pandemic with patients admitted in 2019. The main variables analyzed were intensive care unit respiratory management, number of chest tomography scans and bronchoalveolar lavages, intensive care unit complications, and status at hospital discharge. RESULTS: In 2020, a significant reduction in the use of a high-flow nasal cannula was observed: 14 (42%) in 2019 compared to 1 (3%) in 2020. Additionally, in 2020, a significant increase was observed in the number of patients under mechanical ventilation admitted to the intensive care unit from the emergency department, 23 (69%) compared to 11 (31%) in 2019. Nevertheless, the number of patients with mechanical ventilation after 5 days of admission was similar in both years: 24 (69%) in 2019 and 26 (79%) in 2020. CONCLUSION: Intensive care unit protocols based on international recommendations for the COVID-19 pandemic have produced a change in non-COVID-19 patient management. We observed a reduction in the use of a high-flow nasal cannula and an increased number of tracheal intubations in the emergency department.

Several adjunctive infection prevention methods are in common use but their effectiveness in reducing healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections is unclear. In this review, recent advances regarding the effectiveness of several adjunctive infection prevention methods to reduce healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Training and education on hand hygiene guidelines, mandatory influenza vaccination for healthcare personnel, access to paid sick leave to reduce ill presenteeism, cohorting of patients with the same infection or clinical syndrome, neuraminidase inhibitor chemoprophylaxis during influenza outbreaks, and enhanced visitor restrictions in pediatric hospitals all have shown some degree of effectiveness in observational or quasi-experimental studies. SUMMARY: Most of the studies evaluating the effect of adjunctive infection prevention methods on healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections are observational or quasi-experimental and are often combined with other interventions. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the precise effectiveness or efficacy of these interventions and more controlled trials are needed. Multimodal infection prevention policies are likely to be most effective in reducing healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections.","output":"Beyond personal protective equipment: adjunctive methods for control of healthcare-associated respiratory viral infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Objetivo: Assess the impact of the lockdown measures on hospitalizations and emergency psychiatric care in a capital of a Brazilian state.

This study aimed to investigate attitudes, stressors and work outcomes among DAs from all over Germany at the peak of cases in spring 2020. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression. SETTING: Dental, maxillofacial surgery and orthodontic practices across Germany, April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Participants aged 18 years and above and currently working as DAs in Germany. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: A self-devised online questionnaire was employed comprising questions on SARS-CoV-2-related attitudes, stressors and work outcomes. Validated scales assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: Among 1481 participating DAs (median age 35 years, 98.4% female, 91.8% working in dental practices), major stressors were uncertainty about the pandemics temporal scope (97.9% agreement, n=1450), uncertainty about ones financial situation (87.8%, n=1301), uncertainty about how to act correctly (87.6%, n=1298) and thoughts about a possible infection during work (83.8%, n=1241).

Modern science and technologies have been called upon to redesign various processes in order to cope with this outbreak and the changes it has wrought. Even the world of education has been subject to severe disruption. To deal with the new situation, the students and teachers have been forced to change the way they customarily taught, learnt and interacted. The entire educational framework will have to be transformed from the traditional face-to-face or physical system to the virtual Moodle education system. The entire school system and higher education system in Sri Lanka are now called upon to confront these new challenges if they are to continue the learning and teaching processes. Fortunately, the higher education institutions have managed to find a quick remedy, by moving to online learning to overcome the difficult situation. Although many learning theories have been introduced to evaluate the learning processes in the physical classroom, the Gestalt learning theory is slightly different from the other theories. This is because the Gestalt theorists emphasize the need for whole perception, which can only be achieved by focusing on the entire learning process and making sense of things by thinking of them deeply. The process of thinking involved selecting, organizing, interpreting and creating meaning. This processing method is called 'insight learning'. Hence, this study is an attempt to assess the feasibility of developing insight learning in virtual learning. The data was collected through Google forms, and the conclusion is based on the more than 700 responses received from undergraduate students in the Faculty of Arts and Culture, Eastern University, Sri Lanka. The SPSS software was used to record and analyze data using factor analysis and descriptive statistics. The study shows that there are many factors that prove to be obstacles in the way of developing insight learning via an online learning system.

Development of AV drugs should be informed by a thorough understanding of viral structure and function as well as human biology. To maximize efficacy, minimize cost, and reduce development of drug-resistance, these drugs would ideally operate through a varied set of mechanisms at multiple stages throughout the course of infection. Due to their abundance and diversity, natural compounds are ideal for such comprehensive therapeutic interventions. Promising sources of such drugs are found throughout nature; especially remarkable are the algae, a polyphyletic grouping of phototrophs that produce diverse bioactive compounds. While not much literature has been published on the subject, studies have shown that these compounds exert antiviral effects at different stages of viral pathogenesis. In this review, we follow the course of viral infection in the human body and evaluate the AV effects of algae-derived compounds at each stage. Specifically, we examine the AV activities of algae-derived compounds at the entry of viruses into the body, transport through the body via the lymph and blood, infection of target cells, and immune response. We discuss what is known about algae-derived compounds that may interfere with the infection pathways of SARS-CoV-2; and review which algae are promising sources for AV agents or AV precursors that, with further investigation, may yield life-saving drugs due to their diversity of mechanisms and exceptional pharmaceutical potential.","output":"Viral inhibitors derived from macroalgae, microalgae, and cyanobacteria: A review of antiviral potential throughout pathogenesis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The COVID-19 pandemics greatest impact is among older adults.

They are known to be important recognition motifs not only in the context of blood transfusions, but also in infection and cancer development. SCOPE OF REVIEW: Current knowledge on the molecular background and the implication of histo-blood group glycans in the prevention and therapy of infectious and non-communicable diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, is presented. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Glycan-based histo-blood groups are associated with intestinal microbiota composition, the risk of various diseases as well as therapeutic success of, e.g., vaccination. Their potential as prebiotic or anti-microbial agents, as disease biomarkers and vaccine targets should be further investigated in future studies. For this, recent and future technological advancements will be of particular importance, especially with regard to the unambiguous structural characterization of the glycan portion in combination with information on the protein and lipid carriers of histo-blood group-active glycans in large cohorts. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Histo-blood group glycans have a unique linking position in the complex network of genes, oncodevelopmental biological processes, and disease mechanisms.

Outcome variables were SARS-CoV2 infection, severe COVID-19 and COVID-19 mortality occuring during the first wave of the pandemic. Demographical data, comorbidities, serum 25OHD levels and concomitant pharmacological treatments were collected as covariates. Associations between cholecalciferol or calcifediol use and outcome variables were analyzed using multivariate Cox proportional regression. RESULTS: Cholecalciferol supplementation (n = 108,343) was associated with slight protection from SARS-CoV2 infection (n = 4352 [4.0%] vs 9142/216,686 [4.2%] in controls; HR 0.95 [CI 95% 0.91C0.98], p = 0.004).

Demographic and clinical data for candidemia and colonized patients were prospectively recorded. Clinical and environmental isolates were subjected to phenotypic and molecular identification; antifungal susceptibility testing by broth microdilution method; PCR-sequencing of ERG11 and FKS1 for resistance mechanisms to triazoles and echinocandins, respectively; and molecular fingerprinting by short tandem repeat (STR) analyses. Seventy-one (17 candidemic and 54 colonized) patients including 26 with candiduria and seven environmental samples yielded C. auris. All isolates were identified as C. auris by Vitek2, MALDI-TOF MS, PCR amplification and/or PCR-sequencing of rDNA. Twelve candidemia and 26 colonized patients were admitted or exposed to HDU. Following outbreak recognition, an intensive screening program was instituted for new patients. Despite treatment of all candidemia and 36 colonized patients, 9 of 17 candidemia and 27 of 54 colonized patients died with an overall crude mortality rate of ~50%. Nearly all isolates were resistant to fluconazole and contained the Y132F mutation in ERG11 except one patients isolates, which were also distinct by STR typing. Only urine isolates from two patients developed echinocandin resistance with concomitant FKS1 mutations. The transmission of C. auris in this outbreak was linked to infected/colonized patients and the hospital environment.

METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnant patients who tested positive for SARS CoV-2 infection at any point in pregnancy and collected paired maternal and cord blood samples at the time of delivery. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assays were performed to measure maternal plasma and cord blood concentrations and neutralizing potency of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgA, and IgM antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Differences in concentrations according to symptomatic compared with asymptomatic infection and time from positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result to delivery were analyzed using nonparametric tests of significance. The ratio of cord to maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers was analyzed to assess transplacental transfer efficiency. RESULTS: Thirty-two paired samples were analyzed. Detectable anti-receptor-binding domain IgG was detected in 100% (n=32) of maternal and 91% (n=29) of cord blood samples. Functional neutralizing antibody was present in 94% (n=30) of the maternal and 25% (n=8) of cord blood samples. Symptomatic infection was associated with a significant difference in median (interquartile range) maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers compared with asymptomatic infection (log 3.2 [3.5-2.4] vs log 2.7 [2.9-1.4], P=.03). Median (interquartile range) maternal anti-receptor-binding domain IgG titers were not significantly higher in patients who delivered more than 14 days after a positive PCR test result compared with those who delivered within 14 days (log 3.3 [3.5-2.4] vs log 2.67 [2.8-1.6], P=.05). Median (range) cord/maternal antibody ratio was 0.81 (0.67-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate robust maternal neutralizing and anti-receptor-binding domain IgG response after SARS-CoV-2 infection, yet a lower-than-expected efficiency of transplacental antibody transfer and a significant reduction in neutralization between maternal blood and cord blood.

A public-health motif was exhibited in texts featuring a particular health official and offering the statements of such an official as a mechanism of reassurance. A concealment-of-information motif was exhibited in texts emphasizing the importance of the transparency of health officials, and in texts demonstrating ambivalence about information provided by socially-sanctioned sources.

It is supported by the presence of the horseshoe bat suspected to be the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 and by the scarcity of pork, due to African swine fever, diverting consumers to exotic animals of breeding sold in the markets. During this pandemic, several animal species were affected by SARS-CoV-2. Sporadic cases were first reported in pets (dogs and cats) infected by their owners, then in large feline species and apes infected in zoos by their nurses. The most significant human-to-animal transmission has occurred in mink farms, especially in the Netherlands and Denmark, requiring the euthanasia of several million animals, with mink in turn having contaminated men and stray or nomadic cats. The study of natural or experimental transmissions of SARS-CoV-2 has made it possible to identify the most receptive animal species: American minks and raccoon dogs, and to a lesser extent stray or nomadic cats, which could become an animal reservoir due to their sensitivity to this virus and their extending prolificacy. The European Commission decided on May 17, 2021 to strengthen the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infections in minks and other mustelids, as well as in raccoon dogs, highlighting stressing that the epidemiological assessment of the risk presented by the he appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in these susceptible species was a public health priority.","output":"[Covid-19 and the animal world, from a still mysterious origin towards an always unpredictable future]./ Rapport 21-11.

Identifying where poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry might help the government better plan how to disseminate avian influenza prevention and control recommendations. METHODS: In order to identify where backyard poultry raisers seek care for their ill poultry, we conducted in-depth and informal interviews: 70 with backyard poultry raisers and six with local poultry healthcare providers in two villages, and five with government veterinary professionals at the sub-district and union levels in two districts during JuneCAugust 2009. RESULTS: Most (86% [60/70]) raisers sought care for their backyard poultry locally, 14% used home remedies only and none sought care from government veterinary professionals. The local poultry care providers provided advice and medications (n = 6). Four local care providers had shops in the village market where raisers sought healthcare for their poultry and the remaining two visited rural households to provide poultry healthcare services. Five of the six local care providers did not have formal training in veterinary medicine. Local care providers either did not know about avian influenza or considered avian influenza to be a disease common among commercial but not backyard poultry. The government professionals had degrees in veterinary medicine and experience with avian influenza and its prevention. They had their offices at the sub-district or union level and lacked staffing to reach the backyard raisers at the village level. CONCLUSIONS: The local poultry care providers provided front line healthcare to backyard poultry in villages and were a potential source of information for the rural raisers. Integration of these local poultry care providers in the governments avian influenza control programs is a potentially useful approach to increase poultry raisers and local poultry care providers awareness about avian influenza.","output":"Where backyard poultry raisers seek care for sick poultry: implications for avian influenza prevention in Bangladesh"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inflammation and fibrosis are two pathological features of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

They are difficult to diagnose due to their low frequency and their often highly heterogeneous symptoms. Rare diseases have in general a high impact on the quality of life and life expectancy of patients, which are in general children or young people. The advent of high-throughput sequencing techniques has improved diagnosis in several different areas, from pediatrics, achieving a diagnostic rate of 41% with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and 36% with whole exome sequencing, to neurology, achieving a diagnostic rate between 47 and 48.5% with WGS. This evidence has encouraged our group to pursue a molecular diagnosis using WGS for this and several other patients with rare diseases. RESULTS: We used whole genome sequencing to achieve a molecular diagnosis of a 7-year-old girl with a severe panvascular artery disease that remained for several years undiagnosed. We found a frameshift variant in one copy and a large deletion involving two exons in the other copy of a gene called YY1AP1. This gene is related to Grange syndrome, a recessive rare disease, whose symptoms include stenosis or occlusion of multiple arteries, congenital heart defects, brachydactyly, syndactyly, bone fragility, and learning disabilities. Bioinformatic analyses propose these mutations as the most likely cause of the disease, according to its frequency, in silico predictors, conservation analyses, and effect on the protein product. Additionally, we confirmed one mutation in each parent, supporting a compound heterozygous status in the child. CONCLUSIONS: In general, we think that this finding can contribute to the use of whole genome sequencing as a diagnosis tool of rare diseases, and in particular, it can enhance the set of known mutations associated with different diseases.

Current influenza vaccines for poultry are expensive and subtype specific, and therefore there is an urgent need to develop a universal avian influenza vaccine. We have constructed a live bacterial vaccine against avian influenza by expressing a conserved peptide from the ectodomain of M2 antigen (M2e) on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (LL). Chickens were vaccinated intranasally with the lactococcal vaccine (LL-M2e) or subcutaneously with keyhole-limpet-hemocyanin conjugated M2e (KLH-M2e). Vaccinated and nonvaccinated birds were challenged with high pathogenic avian influenza virus A subtype H5N2. Birds vaccinated with LL-M2e or KLH-M2e had median survival times of 5.5 and 6.0 days, respectively, which were significantly longer than non-vaccinated birds (3.5 days). Birds vaccinated subcutaneously with KLH-M2e had a lower mean viral burden than either of the other two groups. However, there was a significant correlation between the time of survival and M2e-specific serum IgG. The results of these trials show that birds in both vaccinated groups had significantly (P < 0.05) higher median survival times than non-vaccinated birds and that this protection could be due to M2e-specific serum IgG.","output":"A Novel Lactococcal Vaccine Expressing a Peptide from the M2 Antigen of H5N2 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A Virus Prolongs Survival of Vaccinated Chickens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: New coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic socioeconomically affected the world.

PURPOSE: The current evidence regarding iodine-containing compounds and iodine allergy cross-reactivity is reviewed. SUMMARY: Iodine is an essential human nutrient found in the thyroid gland. It is used in the synthesis of the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyroxine. Patients who report having adverse reactions to iodine-containing substances are often labelled as having an \\"iodine allergy,\\" which can result in delays in care or patients being denied essential ICM or other iodine-containing drugs. A literature review was conducted to evaluate the evidence regarding iodine allergy and iodine-containing drugs.

After exclusion of 353 articles that did not meet all inclusion criteria, the remaining 81 articles were included in the review. The results of the literature review indicated that iodine has not been shown to be the allergen responsible for allergic reactions to iodinated contrast media, amiodarone, povidone-iodine, and other iodine-containing compounds.

Understanding the unique features for HBV-induced HCC can shed new light on the unmet needs in its early diagnosis and effective therapy. During decades of chronic hepatitis B, hepatocytes undergoing repeated damage and regeneration accumulate genetic changes predisposing to HCC development. In addition to traditional mutations in viral and cellular oncogenes, HBV integration into the cell chromosomes is an alternative genetic change contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis. A striking male dominance in HBV-related HCC further highlights an interaction between androgen sex hormone and viral factors, which contributes to the gender difference via stimulating viral replication and activation of oncogenes preferentially in male patients. Meanwhile, a novel circulating tumor biomarker generated by HBV integration shows great potential for the early diagnosis of HCC. These unique HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenic mechanisms provide new insights for the future development of superior diagnosis and treatment strategies. ABSTRACT: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is one of the important risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, accounting for around 50% of cases. Chronic hepatitis B infection generates an inflammatory microenvironment, in which hepatocytes undergoing repeated cycles of damage and regeneration accumulate genetic mutations predisposing them to cancer. A striking male dominance in HBV-related HCC highlights the influence of sex hormones which interact with viral factors to influence carcinogenesis. HBV is also considered an oncogenic virus since its X and surface mutant proteins showed tumorigenic activity in mouse models. The other unique mechanism is the insertional mutagenesis by integration of HBV genome into hepatocyte chromosomes to activate oncogenes. HCC survival largely depends on tumor stages at diagnosis and effective treatment. However, early diagnosis by the conventional protein biomarkers achieves limited success. A new biomarker, the circulating virusChost chimera DNA from HBV integration sites in HCC, provides a liquid biopsy approach for monitoring the tumor load in the majority of HBVCHCC patients. To maximize the efficacy of new immunotherapies or molecular target therapies, it requires better classification of HCC based on the tumor microenvironment and specific carcinogenic pathways. An in-depth study may benefit both the diagnosis and treatment of HBV-related HCC.","output":"Unique Features of Hepatitis B Virus-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Pathogenesis and Clinical Significance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen that can cause severe and deadly infections.

The use of ECMO to provide circulatory support arose from the development of the first membrane oxygenator by George Clowes in 1957, and subsequent incorporation into pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by Dorson and colleagues. The first successful application of ECMO in children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery was reported by Baffes et al. in 1970. For the ensuing nearly two decades, ECMO was performed sparingly and only in specialized centers with varying degrees of success. The formation of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) in 1989 allowed for the collation of ECMO-related data across multiple centers for the first time.

In fingolimod-treated patients, no SARS-CoV-2Cspecific T cells were detected after second (N = 12) and third (N = 9) vaccinations. DISCUSSION: In ocrelizumab-treated patients with MS, a third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination had no additive effect on the maximal T-cell response but did induce a boost response. In fingolimod-treated patients, no T-cell responses could be detected following both a second and third SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.","output":"Longitudinal T-Cell Responses After a Third SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis on Ocrelizumab or Fingolimod"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Linfection COVID-19 est une maladie mergeante qui peut tre grave, voire mme mortelle.

After staining, bacterial pathogens were recognized in the light microscope because of their size and could be cultivated in culture media. Viruses evaded this approach, as they are significantly smaller, and as obligate parasites are not able to multiply in cell culture media. Although some viral infections could be associated with specific cellular changes and certain depositions in the infected tissue around the turn of the century, e.g. Negri inclusion bodies in nerve cells during rabies, a specific diagnosis was only possible through the development of cell culture methods and modern molecular biology. Today, viral infections can be detected directly by determining the agents, individual viral proteins, or their genetic information, or other materials in the blood of infected people or animals by using appropriate methods. Direct detection of viruses is possible, with the exception of latent or persistent infection forms, only during the acute phase of the disease. In some cases, the pathogens are present in the infected organism only before the symptomatic phase, so the direct detection of the virus is frequently not successful. Therefore, infections or contact with pathogens is usually demonstrated in virus diagnostics indirectly by characterization of the developing specific immune response.","output":"Laboratory Methods for Detecting Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Coronavirus is a single-stranded RNA virus, causing an epidemic of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) worldwide in late 2019 Objectives: In addition to the clinical symptoms, laboratory diagnosis can greatly help diagnose the diseases;therefore, this study aimed to analyze laboratory parameters in patients with COVID-19 Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the laboratory data of 2563 patients with COVID-19 admitted to hospitals affiliated with Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences were extracted from hospital information systems (HIS) The data were recorded on Excel and analyzed through t-test, chi-squared, and Fisher's exact tests in SPSS 19 at the significance level of P &lt; 0 05 Results: Out of 2563 patients with a mean age of 55 1 +/- 16 7 years, 1409 (55%) were male, and 1154 (45%) were female with a mean age of 55 7 +/- 16 8, and 54 3 +/- 16 6 years, respectively As the most frequent clinical findings, ESR, CRP, and LDH were increased by 83 5%, 71%, and 69 3% of the patients, respectively Other research findings included lymphopenia, disturbed INR, abnormal SGOT, abnormal alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which were significantly higher in men than in women and was different between age groups Conclusions: Conducting simple, convenient, and inexpensive laboratory tests can be helpful in the diagnosis of COVID-19","output":"Laboratory Abnormalities in Patients with COVID-19 in Mazandaran Province, Iran"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severity of the recent pandemic and the absence of any specific medication impelled the identification of existing drugs with potential in the treatment of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We also assessed effects of educating patients about outcomes of their condition on their desire to have prompt surgery. Method: A prospective survey review was conducted at our plastic surgery trauma clinic. Patients included were those referred due to simple hand trauma. Any patients needing urgent admissions were excluded. An anonymous survey assessing patient perceptions before and after education about delay in surgery was distributed. Results: Of 100 patients, there were mixed expectations regarding trauma clinic;38% (n=38) expect an operation, 32% (n=32) expect no operation and 30% (n=30) expect either option. 90% (n=90) expect surgery within a week (50% n=50) or within a day (40% n=40);10% expect it (n=10) within a few weeks. After educating patients about no negative effects on their condition from surgical delay, 43% (n=17) fewer patients desired surgery within a day, and 8% (n=3) fewer patients desired surgery within a week. 190% (n=19) more patients were willing to have surgery within a few weeks. 79% (n=79) would rather come back at a guaranteed surgical slot than stay in hospital until a slot is available. 72% (n=72) considered knowledge about long-term outcomes associated with surgical delay to influence their decision more than anaesthetic type (12% n=12) and personal circumstances (16% n=16).

We, therefore, designed a nationwide survey to determine the main features of BC recipients and obtain a picture of the clinical use of BC for the first time in Italy, in order to understand BC demands better and identify specific fields in which to apply Patient Blood Management (PBM). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A nationwide survey of all Italian Blood Establishments working as Hospital Blood Banks (HBB) was performed. Data were collected through an online report form recording information on the number and geographic area of the responding HBB, year of birth and sex of the BC recipients, and clinical indications for every unit of RBC, platelets and plasma transfused in a 24-hour period. RESULTS: On the survey date, 153/237 (64.5%) of the HBB returned 4,356 forms, reporting 7,523 transfusions. The median and mean ages of the recipients were 73 (range, 0-106) and 67.5 years, respectively; 33.0% were >80 years old and 64.9% >65 years old, with no relevant differences between males and females. Overall, 6,309 RBC units were transfused to 3,850 recipients, 66.7% of them for a medical indication and 32.4% for a surgical indication. The commonest medical indication was acquired, non-cancer-related anaemia and more than 30% of the transfusions occurred in the Emergency Department. Five hundred and sixty platelet transfusions were given to 520 recipients, 62.7% of them for prophylaxis and 28.6% for bleeding before or during an invasive procedure or surgery or for thrombocytopenia. One hundred and ninety-four patients received 654 units of plasma, 71.1% of which were for therapeutic purposes in bleeding patients.

In this study, we investigated C1q binding and subsequent complement activation by anti-spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) specific antibodies produced following vaccination with either the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 or the inactivated vaccine BBIBP-CorV. Methods Serum samples were collected in the period July 2021-March 2022. Participants demographic data, type of vaccine, date of vaccination, as well as adverse effects of the vaccine were recorded. The serum samples were incubated with S protein RBD-coated plates. Levels of human IgG, IgM, and C1q, that were bound to the plate, as well as formed C5b-9, were compared between different groups of participants. Results A total of 151 samples were collected from vaccinated (n=116) and non-vaccinated (n=35) participants. Participants who received either one or two doses of BNT162b2 formed higher levels of anti-RBD IgG than participants who received BBIBP-CorV. The anti-RBD IgG formed following either vaccine bound C1q, but significantly more C1q binding was observed in participants who received BNT162b2. Subsequently, C5b-9 formation was significantly higher in participants who received BNT162b2, while no significant difference in C5b-9 formation was found between the non-vaccinated and BBIBP-CorV groups. Formation of C5b-9 was strongly correlated to C1q binding, additionally, the ratio of formed C5b-9/ bound C1q was significantly higher in the BNT162b2 group. Conclusion Anti-RBD IgG formed following vaccination can bind C1q with subsequent complement activation, the degree of terminal complement pathway activation differed between vaccines, which could play a role in in the protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines.

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of SD, ACD and AD on young children. Parts of questionnaires were filled in during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore we decided to check if the pandemic affected dermatology-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in our patients. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study approved by the local ethics committee of the Kiev City Clinical Dermatovenereologic Hospital parents of children with SD, ACD and AD from birth to 4 years old from the same department of dermatology were asked to fill in the dermatology-specific questionnaire the Infants and Toddlers Dermatology Quality of Life (InToDermQoL). Diagnoses were based on clinical manifestations and anamnesis. The study was carried out from 2018 till 2021. RESULTS: The InToDermQoL questionnaire was filled in by 176 parents of children with SD, ACD and AD. Mean total InToDermQoL scores were significantly higher in children with AD than in SD and ACD (P < 0.01). HRQoL of children with AD during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly worse than before pandemic (41.30  24.40 and 28.51  17.67 respectively, P = 0.02).

For this, cement (NA442 CEM II/B-L 42.5 N) and local sand were replaced at different proportions with lime in the formulation of mortar, the sand used whose mixture was relative to that of the sand (0/4) and (0/1) values of 65% and 35%, respectively. A number of tests were carried out on two types of mortar prepared with two different formulations. The first formulation, which included quicklime, was subjected to a simple treatment in order to obtain aerial lime and to understand the different formulation stages that were followed in the Ancient Egyptian times. Knowing that the objective was to revive the method of manufacturing works from the ancient era, thus using a variable rate of substitution (0%, 50% to 70%) of lime, limestone and gypsum to obtain the binder by also studying the stakes of this variation on the reduction of the quantity of cement in the mortar which consisted in the preparation of fourteen test series in order to converge on the impact of the experiments sought.

Compared with pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) after PD, it may be speculated that pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) is a risk factor for DGE, because it needs an anastomosis of the remnant pancreas to the back wall of the stomach. This study aimed to compare PG and PJ with regard to the incidence of DGE after PD. METHODS We performed a prospective open-label randomized clinical trial (RCT) including patients undergoing elective pancreaticoduodenectomy, who were randomly assigned PG or PJ the day before surgery. The primary endpoint was incidence of DGE. RESULTS The study included 60 patients (30 PG, 30 PJ), of whom seven were deemed unresectable, one was enucleated, and one was switched from PJ to PG during surgery according to the surgeon's decision. Thus, modified intention-to-treat analyses were performed in 27 PG patients and 26 PJ patients. DGE occurred in three patients in the PG group and six patients in the PJ group, which did not constitute a significant between-group difference (P = 0.42). In the PG group, two cases were ISGPS grade A DGE and one was grade C. In the PJ group, one case was grade A, two grade B, and three grade C. The two groups also did not significantly differ in the incidence of other morbidities or postoperative hospital stay.

Lately, the published COVID data comprised new variables that may influence the accuracy of the oil/gold prices forecasting models including the Stringency index, Reproduction rate, Positive Rate, and Vaccinations. In this study, Deep Autoencoders are introduced and combined with the well-known approach: Pearson Correlation Coefficient, PCC, analysis in selecting the key features that affect the accuracy of the forecasting models of gold and oil prices with respect to COVID-19 pandemic. We have utilized a hybrid approach of PCC along with a 2-Stage Stacked Autoencoder, SA, to extract the latent features which are then submitted to Neural Network, NN, regression model. The NN regressor has been trained using the Bayesian Regularization-backpropagation algorithm which provides a good generalization for small noisy datasets. The hybrid approach has yielded the minimum MSE values of 8.97 10?3 and 5.356 10?2 on the oil/gold validation set, respectively. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed approach has outperformed the ARIMA, ML based regression models in forecasting the oil/gold prices. In addition, the introduced framework has yielded lower Mean Absolute Error, MAE, than the Recurrent Neural Network, RNN, and the Principal Component Analysis, PCA, for dimension reduction.

This cross-sectional study aimed to identify the potentially modifiable risk factors for developing excess weight and determine the importance of developing certain habits to prevent childhood overweight and obesity. METHODS: The sample included 416 students between the ages of 12 and 14 (12.8  0.62) first-year high school students from Murcia in Spain. Data were collected on their lifestyle habits through the ENHASA questionnaire, and the somatometry of the participants was measured. Such data were studied through structural equation modeling and importance-performance map analyses. RESULTS: The modifiable risk factors that presented the greatest potency directly regarding when developing excess weight in adolescents were 'use of electronic devices' and 'not performing physical activity' (p < 0.001). 'Social and school environment' and 'diet' showed relationships but no significant differences with overweight or obesity. Globally, the lifestyle habit of the greatest importance for not being overweight was 'engagement in extracurricular physical activities'. On the other hand, the habits related to using new technologies in a sedentary way showed the best capacity for improvement. Therefore, it would be very efficient to focus on them to control excess weight.

Herein we describe an ACE2-lentivirus system and illustrate its utility for in vitro and in vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection models. Transduction of non-permissive cell lines with hACE2 imparted replication competence, and transduction with mACE2 containing N30D, N31K, F83Y and H353K substitutions, to match hACE2, rescued SARS-CoV-2 replication. Intranasal hACE2-lentivirus transduction of C57BL/6J mice permitted significant virus replication in lungs. RNA-Seq analyses illustrated that the model involves an acute inflammatory disease followed by resolution and tissue repair, with a transcriptomic profile similar to that seen in COVID-19 patients. Intranasal hACE2-lentivirus transduction of IFNAR-/- and IL-28RA-/- mice lungs was used to illustrate that loss of type I or III interferon responses have no significant effect on virus replication. However, their importance in driving inflammatory responses was illustrated by RNA-Seq analyses. We also demonstrate the utility of the hACE2-lentivirus transduction system for vaccine evaluation in C57BL/6J mice. The ACE2-lentivirus system thus has broad application in SARS-CoV-2 research, providing a tool for both mutagenesis studies and mouse model development. AUTHOR SUMMARY SARS-CoV-2 uses the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor to infect cells, but cannot infect mice because the virus cannot bind mouse ACE2 (mACE2). We use an ACE2-lentivirus system in vitro to identify four key amino acids in mACE2 that explain why SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect mice. hACE2-lentivirus was used to express hACE2 in mouse lungs in vivo, with the inflammatory responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection similar to those seen in human COVID-19. Genetically modified mice were used to show that type I and III interferon signaling is required for the inflammatory responses. We also show that the hACE2-lentivirus mouse model can be used to test vaccines. Overall this paper demonstrates that our hACE2-lentivirus system has multiple applications in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research.","output":"ACE2-lentiviral transduction enables mouse SARS-CoV-2 infection and mapping of receptor interactions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Genetic variation in total and differential white blood cell (WBC) counts, phagocytic capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL), virus induced interferon- (IFN-) production, mitogen induced proliferation and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production of mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro was studied in blood collected from 124 Yorkshire piglets, aged 8 weeks. The piglets were the offspring from 12 sires and 31 dams. Data from an earlier experiment, including 96 piglets of seven sires and 24 dams, were added when estimating heritabilities for Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The highest heritability (h(2)=0.870.41) was estimated for the total number of PMNL. Medium high heritabilities (h(2)=0.3?0.4) were estimated for the phagocytic capacity of PMNL, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production and the total number of WBC, while the heritability estimates were lower (h(2)=0.00?0.080.12) for the total number of lymphocytes, serum concentrations of Ig and IFN- production. Pronounced differences between litters from various dams were found for total number of lymphocytes, IFN- production, Con A induced proliferation and IL-2 production. The Con A induced proliferation was positively correlated (r=0.48, P<0.001) with the IL-2 production and both these parameters were correlated (r=0.44 and 0.37, respectively, P<0.001) to the virus induced IFN- production.

Questions were related to information about the cat and its behaviour and health, changes in the household due to the pandemic, and how the owner related to the cat. The survey was completed by 324 respondents from 25 different countries. The survey showed that keeping pet cats during the COVID-19 pandemic did not create problems for the owners, except some difficulties in acquiring veterinary care. The majority (67.3%) of respondents reported no changes in their cats behaviour. When behavioural changes were reported, they were mostly of a positive nature.

Traditional treatments for RA remain a challenging issue. For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have no therapeutic effects on joint destruction, and the prominent side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms. RA is characterized by recurrence and bone attrition. Therefore, regenerative medicine and the use of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (UC-MSC) therapies have recently emerged as potential options. UC-MSCs are multifunctional stem cells that are present in neonatal umbilical cord tissue and can differentiate into many kinds of cells, which have broad clinical application prospects in the tissue engineering of bone, cartilage, muscle, tendon, ligament, nerve, liver, endothelium, and myocardium. Moreover, UC-MSCs have advantages, such as convenient collection of materials and no ethical disputes; thus, these cells have attracted increasing attention from researchers. However, there are few clinical studies regarding UC-MSC therapy for RA. In this paper, we will review traditional drugs for RA treatment and then focus on UC-MSC therapy for RA, including preclinical and clinical UC-MSC applications for RA patients in the context of regenerative medicine. Finally, we will summarize the challenges and perspectives of UC-MSCs as a potential therapeutic strategy for RA.

However, previous studies essentially evaluated psychopathological symptoms and not the presence of positive mental health. Therefore, the first objective of the present research is to evaluate health-care professionals mental illness (i.e., anxiety and traumatic intensity) and positive mental health (i.e., well-being) using the Complete State Model of Health. Our second objective is to study the effect of Personal Protection Equipment availability on professionals mental health. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-two health-care professionals working in Spain in the first line of COVID-19 patient care participated in the study. To measure anxiety, traumatic intensity and well-being participants completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Davidson Trauma Scale, and the Mental Health Continuum-Short Form. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships between all scales. In order to test the two continua model of mental health, we used parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis. To analyze anxiety, traumatic intensity, and well-being differences between health-care professionals with and without Personal Protection Equipment availability we conducted different ANOVAS. To test our hypothesis regarding the moderating role of Personal Protection Equipment availability in the effect of mental illness on positive mental health, data were subjected to a hierarchical regression analysis. RESULTS: As in previous studies, health-care professionals showed high levels of anxiety and traumatic intensity. They also presented low levels of well-being indicators. According to our hypothesis, results of parallel analysis and exploratory factorial analysis indicated that the measures of mental illness and positive mental health loaded on separate but correlated factors. Finally, Personal Protection Equipment availability moderated the effects of state anxiety and traumatic intensity on professionals well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Health-care professionals mental illness and positive mental health reflect distinct continua, rather than the extreme ends of a single spectrum. Therefore, it is essential to measure both psychopathology and the presence of positive health to comprehensively evaluate professionals mental health.

As there was no evidence of impairment of national malaria control strategies, public health authorities attributed the surge to a temporal increase in gold mining activity in forested regions. However, systematic analysis of this association is lacking because of the difficulties associated with collecting reliable data for both malaria and mining. We aimed to investigate the association between the international gold price and Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission in Guyana between 2007 and 2019. We also aimed to evaluate the association between P falciparum cases and the El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation pattern, which has previously been suggested as a major driver of malaria. METHODS: We used national malaria surveillance data from Guyana to estimate the correlation over time between the international gold price and reported P falciparum infections in individuals who were likely to be involved in mining activities (ie, men and boys aged between 15 and 50 years who were living in mining regions) for each month between 2007 and 2019. We compared the estimates with those obtained from individuals who were unlikely to be directly involved in mining activities (ie, women, children aged 12 years and younger, and adults aged over 70 years) and estimates obtained from individuals living in non-mining regions. We also evaluated the correlation between P falciparum infections and the El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation pattern in the same subpopulations and time period. Lastly, we evaluated the performance of a statistical model formulated to estimate P falciparum infections in real time using the international gold price as the predictor variable. FINDINGS: The proportion of P falciparum malaria cases in temporary residents, which was used as a proxy for circulating individuals involved in gold mining, was highest during the years of peak gold price (ie, between 2008 and 2014). Cases of malaria in all demographic groups showed a strong positive correlation with the gold price, but only in regions with mining camps (088 [95% CI 084C089] for boys and men aged between 15 and 50 years and 080 [073C085] for the aggregated population of women, children aged 12 years and younger, and adults older than 70 years). The highest correlation occurred earlier in men and boys aged between 15 and 50 years, the demographic most likely to be miners, suggesting that transmission in mining camps is followed by infections in the community. On the basis of these findings, we were able to reliably forecast P falciparum malaria trends using only the gold price as the predictor variable. A 1% increase in gold price was associated with a 213% increase in P falciparum infections after 1 month in the mining populations, and with a 163% increase after 2 months in the non-mining populations. Lastly, La Ni?a climatic events showed an additional, smaller positive correlation with malaria transmission. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis provides evidence that the P falciparum malaria surge observed in Guyana between 2008 and 2014 was likely to have been driven mainly by an increase in gold mining, while climate factors might have contributed synergistically. We propose that the international gold price over time is a useful indicator of malaria trends. We conclude that the feasibility of malaria elimination in Guyana, and in other areas in the Amazon where malaria and gold mining overlap, should be evaluated against the challenges posed by rapidly rising gold prices.

Their emergence is thought to be driven largely by socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors(1C9), but no comparative study has explicitly analysed these linkages to understand global temporal and spatial patterns of EIDs. Here we analyse a database of 335 EID events (origins of EIDs) between 1940 and 2004, and demonstrate non-random global patterns. EID events have risen significantly over time after controlling for reporting bias, with their peak incidence (in the 1980s) concomitant with the HIV pandemic. EID events are dominated by zoonoses (60.3% of EIDs): the majority of these (71.8%) originate in wildlife (for example, severe acute respiratory virus, Ebola virus), and are increasing significantly over time. We find that 54.3% of EID events are caused by bacteria or rickettsia, reflecting a large number of drug-resistant microbes in our database. Our results confirm that EID origins are significantly correlated with socio-economic, environmental and ecological factors, and provide a basis for identifying regions where new EIDs are most likely to originate (emerging disease hotspots). They also reveal a substantial risk of wildlife zoonotic and vector-borne EIDs originating at lower latitudes where reporting effort is low. We conclude that global resources to counter disease emergence are poorly allocated, with the majority of the scientific and surveillance effort focused on countries from where the next important EID is least likely to originate.","output":"Global trends in emerging infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Case fatality rates (CFRs) and case recovery rates (CRRs) are frequently used to define health consequences related to a certain disease epidemics, as well as for COVID-19 outbreak. Objectives: This study aimed to compare various introduced methods and models for the calculation of CFR and CRR related to COVID-19 over a present period of time based on the recent global and national data. Methods: This analytical epidemiological study was conducted on the detail data from 210 countries and territories around the world on 17 April 2020. We used three different formulas to measure CFR and CRR, considering all possible scenarios. Results: We committed to show only 72 countries with more than 1000 cases of COVID-19. Overall, using first, second and third estimation models, the CFR were 6.22%, 21.20%, and 8.67%, respectively;similarly, the CRR were estimated as 23.21%, 78.86%, 32.23%, respectively. We have shown CFR vary so much from spatially depend on the methods of estimation which have been implemented and timing of cases reports, that is a lowest CFR of 0.31 in the Singapore, and a CFR of 98.82 in UK.

The N95 respirators are meant for single usage;however, they can be used after sterilization, considering the economy and shortfall in availability. At this juncture, the performance of the respirator after various types of sterilization and usage condition is required to be analyzed in detail. With this motto, this work has proceeded. The respirator?s filtration efficiency (FE), breathing resistance, and quality factor are evaluated for two face velocities (5.8  0.2 and 26.4  0.9 cm/s). Sterilization techniques used here are dry air oven heating at 70?80  3C for 30 and 60 min, gamma irradiation for cumulative dose 15 and 25 kGy, and soaking in liquid hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. The filtration performance and electrostatic surface charge density are used to determine the facemask?s efficacy after sterilization. The respirator?s physical, chemical, and morphological degradation were investigated using materials area density, microscopic analyses, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, EPR, and TGA analyses. The highest reduction in filtration efficiency is 29.36  0.49?36.08  1.78% after irradiation due to a reduction in the charge density (71?133%) of the respirator layers. However, the FE does not reduce significantly (0.39  0.52 to ?2.46  0.60) for dry air heat and H2O2 sterilization despite a change in charge density (0.4?53%), but there is no direct correlation with FE. Electrostatic charge measurement of the filtration layer is a crucial indicator of FE degradation. Hence, dry air heat and H2O2 soaking are found to be the most suitable sterilization methods. No significant degradation was observed on the physical, chemical, and morphological properties of respirators layers after sterilization.","output":"A detailed investigation of N95 respirator sterilization with dry heat, hydrogen peroxide, and ionizing radiation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In response to inflammatory insult, endothelial cells express cell adhesion molecules and TF (tissue factor), leading to increased adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and activation of coagulation. Enhanced coagulation could further exacerbate inflammation. Identifying key signaling molecule(s) that drive both inflammation and coagulation may help devise effective therapeutic strategies to treat inflammatory and thrombotic disorders. The aim of the current study is to determine the role of Gab2 (Grb2-associated binder2), which is known to play a crucial role in the signaling evoked by growth factors and antigen receptors, in inflammatory signaling pathways and its contribution to vascular dysfunction. APPROACH AND RESULTS: WT (wild type) and Gab2-silenced endothelial cells were treated with TNF (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IL (interleukin)-1, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Activation of key signaling proteins in the inflammatory signaling pathways and expression of cell adhesion molecules, TF, and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed. Gab2(?/)(?) and WT littermate mice were challenged with LPS or S pneumoniae (Streptococcus pneumoniae), and parameters of inflammation and activation of coagulation were assessed. Gab2 silencing in endothelial cells markedly attenuated TNF-induced, IL-1¨Cinduced, and LPS-induced expression of TF, cell adhesion molecules, and inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Gab2 silencing suppressed TNF-induced, IL-1¨Cinduced, and LPS-induced phosphorylation and ubiquitination of TAK1 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1) and activation of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and NF-B (nuclear factor kappa B). Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the Src kinase Fyn phosphorylates Gab2. Gab2(?/?) mice are protected from LPS or S pneumoniaeCinduced vascular permeability, neutrophil infiltration, thrombin generation, NET formation, cytokine production, and lung injury.

When corruption infiltrates global health, causes embezzlement of public health funds, malfunctioning medical equipment, fraudulent or ineffective health services such as expired medicines and fake vaccines that could have life-or-death consequences. A corrupt healthcare system, amid global health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, when resources are in constraint and trust is in high demand, can lead to devastating, though avoidable, health and economic consequences. It is imperative for policymakers, health experts, patients, caregivers, and global health funders to promptly acknowledge and address corruption in healthcare. The current pandemic generates an emergency and disorder state on health care systems across the globe, especially in low- and middleincome countries, where a weakening of control measures is evident, creating the perfect storm for corruption. This paper builds on existing research to examine processes that support essential stakeholder engagement in anti-corruption efforts. In this context, an extensive review of literature has been conducted by using various databases such as PubMed, Science direct, SCOPUS, Research Gate, and Google Scholar and a total of 45 articles and documents on corruption and COVID-19 were screened and selected by authors independently. To fill the knowledge gaps about the need for actions to be taken during a pandemic like COVID-19, we propose an anti-corruption grassroots movement that focuses on changing the social norms surrounding corruption in healthcare. By pushing forward a practice that normalizes conversations about corruption in everyday health practices and involving more stakeholders in the protection of public health resources, we argue that not only local health systems can become more resilient and resistant to corruption, but also global health initiatives can become more effective and efficient to improve individual and global health.","output":"The ignored pandemic of public health corruption: a call for action amid and beyond SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper studies how fiscal policy in the eurozone and the United States (US) affected banks loan loss provisioning during the COVID-19 crisis.

The results reveal that government support reduced banks provisioning expenses, particularly in the US, even after controlling for bank-specific and macroeconomic factors. The negative association between government support and loan loss provisions is almost exclusively driven by above-the-line support, and this association goes beyond a macroeconomic stabilization effect. Our results thus suggest that cash transfers directly improved banks credit risk and profitability, while loan guarantee schemes did not. We further discuss the policy implications of our analysis.

The imminent adoption of 5G networks worldwide and the future establishment of next-generation wireless networks will allow various applications, such as autonomous vehicles, connected robotics, and most recently, crowd monitoring for fighting infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. In this context, radio localization techniques have become an essential tool to provide solid performance for mobile positioning systems, through increased accuracy or less computational time. With this in mind, we propose a trilateration-based approach using machine learning (ML) and sequential least-square programming (SLSQP) optimization to estimate the outdoor position of mobile terminals in cellular networks. The ML technique employed is the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN). The optimization methods analyzed are NelderCMead (NM), genetic algorithms (GA), and SLSQP. Different environments (noise-free and noisy) and network scenarios (different numbers of base stations) are considered to evaluate the approaches. Numerical results indicate that the k-NN/SLSQP technique has similar accuracy compared to the k-NN/GA with eight generations. Both perform better than k-NN/NM in all scenarios and environments. When comparing computational times, our proposal is considerably more time-efficient. Aside from that, SLSQP computational time is less affected by network scenarios with more base stations in comparison with GA. That feature is significant considering the ultra-dense base station deployment forecasted for the next-generation cellular networks. ? 2021 Elsevier B.V.","output":"A cost-effective trilateration-based radio localization algorithm using machine learning and sequential least-square programming optimization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite the outstanding technological advances achieved in the last few decades, infectious diseases remain a major societal challenge.

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. Method: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. Results: Most countries digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individuals location databases, code scanning and individuals online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. Solutions: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). Conclusion: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics.

Electronic operating system, Cerner, was used to mine data relevant to each phone call. Outcome parameters audited include patient demographics, reasons for call, outcomes from call, faecal calprotectin levels in documented flares, time since last clinic appointment and time to next outpatient appointment. This project was locally registered with the hospitals clinical audit team.Results209 patients contacted the service between 4/1/2021 to 04/02/2021. We were able to interrogate notes for 199 patients. 55% (n=109) of patients had Crohns disease, 39% had ulcerative colitis and 6% had indeterminate colitis. 55% of patients were female (n=109) and median age was 32 years (youngest=18, oldest = 72). 90% ( n=179) of the phone calls were from patients and remaining phone calls were from GPs and allied health care professionals. 10% of patients needed more than one attempt to call them back. 26.6% (n= 53) of the phone calls were related to flares, 13.6% (n= 27) of the phone calls were directly related to COVID-19 and 13.6% (n= 27) were related to further guidance on treatment. 22.6% of the phone calls needed IBD sisters to chase investigations, liaise with secretaries to chase appointments and convey results of investigations.Phone calls directly related to COVID-19 include advice regarding shielding, implications for medications during periods of acute illness and advice regarding vaccinations.Of the 53 patients who had documented flare, 27 had a raised faecal calprotectin of >250ug/g. 28.1% (n= 56) phone calls resulted in telephone advice from IBD nurses and 14.1% (n= 28) needed escalation to a gastroenterology consultant or team.26% (n=51) of the patients were spoken to in an outpatient telephone clinic with in the last 4 weeks and 31% (n= 61) patients had an appointment coming up in the next 4 weeks.DiscussionSARS-CoV-2 pandemic has put additional pressures on the IBD advice line.

Younger median age is consistent with peak incident age but with aging population and increasing prevalence of IBD in this cohort, more need to be done to ensure that there are no barriers to older population accessing the helpline. As intended, significant proportion of the phone calls were related to disease flares, however IBD nurses were only able to offer advice to 28.1% of the patients. This highlights the need for strong adhoc clinician support to deal with complex patients and dedicated time for ongoing professional development for the IBD nurses. High volume of phone calls resulting in chasing investigations, conveying results and liaising with administrative team on behalf of patients necessitate better education about the IBD advice line. 57% of the patients who called had recently had a clinic appointment or was due one;with very little training given on running telephone clinics, one wonders about the clinical effectiveness of telephone clinics and whether the clinicians are able to address all of patients concerns during these appointments.During the COVID-19 pandemic, IBD advice line has been a valuable resource to patients.

RESULTS: Thirteen of the 17 people recruited completed the study and underwent cardiothoracic surgery. All components of the OCTOPuS intervention were used, but not all parts were used for all participants. Minor changes were made to the intervention as a result of feedback from the participants and healthcare professionals. Median (IQR) HbA(1c) was 10 mmol/mol (3, 13) lower prior to surgery than at baseline. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that it is possible to develop a clinical pathway to improve diabetes management prior to admission. The clinical and cost-effectiveness of this intervention will now be tested in a multicentre randomised controlled trial in cardiothoracic centres across the UK.

We used anonymized smartphone mobility measures in seven Canadian provinces to quantify the mobility level needed to suppress COVID-19 (mobility threshold), and the difference relative to current mobility levels (mobility gap). Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of weekly COVID-19 incidence from March 15, 2020 to January 16, 2021, among provinces with 20 COVID-19 cases in at least 10 weeks. The outcome was weekly growth rate defined as the ratio of current cases compared to the previous week. We examined the effects of average time spent outside the home (non-residential mobility) in the prior three weeks using a lognormal regression model accounting for province, season, and mean temperature. We calculated the COVID-19 mobility threshold and gap. Results Across the 44-week study period, a total of 704,294 persons were infected with COVID-19. Non-residential mobility dropped rapidly in the spring and reached a median of 36% (IQR: 31,40) in April 2020. After adjustment, each 5% increase in non-residential mobility was associated with a 9% increase in the COVID-19 weekly growth rate (ratio=1.09, 95%CI: 1.07,1.12). The mobility gap increased through the fall months, which was associated with increasing case growth.

As decision making in the context of epidemic mitigation is hard, reinforcement learning provides a methodology to automatically learn prevention strategies in combination with complex epidemic models. Current research focuses on optimizing policies w.r.t. a single objective, such as the pathogen's attack rate. However, as the mitigation of epidemics involves distinct, and possibly conflicting criteria (i.a., prevalence, mortality, morbidity, cost), a multi-objective approach is warranted to learn balanced policies. To lift this decision-making process to real-world epidemic models, we apply deep multi-objective reinforcement learning and build upon a state-of-the-art algorithm, Pareto Conditioned Networks (PCN), to learn a set of solutions that approximates the Pareto front of the decision problem. We consider the first wave of the Belgian COVID-19 epidemic, which was mitigated by a lockdown, and study different deconfinement strategies, aiming to minimize both COVID-19 cases (i.e., infections and hospitalizations) and the societal burden that is induced by the applied mitigation measures. We contribute a multi-objective Markov decision process that encapsulates the stochastic compartment model that was used to inform policy makers during the COVID-19 epidemic. As these social mitigation measures are implemented in a continuous action space that modulates the contact matrix of the age-structured epidemic model, we extend PCN to this setting. We evaluate the solution returned by PCN, and observe that it correctly learns to reduce the social burden whenever the hospitalization rates are sufficiently low. In this work, we thus show that multi-objective reinforcement learning is attainable in complex epidemiological models and provides essential insights to balance complex mitigation policies.","output":"Exploring the Pareto front of multi-objective COVID-19 mitigation policies using reinforcement learning"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: We assessed the usefulness of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR cycle thresholds (Ct) values trends produced by the LHUB-ULB (a consolidated microbiology laboratory located in Brussels, Belgium) for monitoring the epidemic's dynamics at local and national levels and for improving forecasting models. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Ct values produced from April 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021, were compared with national COVID-19 confirmed cases notifications according to their geographical and time distribution. These Ct values were evaluated against both a phase diagram predicting the number of COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care and an age-structured model estimating COVID-19 prevalence in Belgium. Results: Over 155,811 RT-PCR performed, 12,799 were positive and 7,910 Ct values were available for analysis. The 14-day median Ct values were negatively correlated with the 14-day mean daily positive tests with a lag of 17 days. In addition, the 14-day mean daily positive tests in LHUB-ULB were strongly correlated with the 14-day mean confirmed cases in the Brussels-Capital and in Belgium with coinciding start, peak, and end of the different waves of the epidemic. Ct values decreased concurrently with the forecasted phase-shifts of the diagram. Similarly, the evolution of 14-day median Ct values was negatively correlated with daily estimated prevalence for all age-classes. Conclusion: We provide preliminary evidence that trends of Ct values can help to both follow and predict the epidemic's trajectory at local and national levels, underlining that consolidated microbiology laboratories can act as epidemic sensors as they gather data that are representative of the geographical area they serve.","output":"Leveraging of SARS-CoV-2 PCR Cycle Thresholds Values to Forecast COVID-19 Trends"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As global supply chains become more developed and complicated, supplier quality has become increasingly influential on the competitiveness of businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic. Consequently, supplier selection is an increasingly important process for any business around the globe. Choosing a supplier is a complex decision that can result in lower procurement costs and increased profits without increasing the cost or lowering the quality of the product. However, these decision-making problems can be complicated in cases with multiple potential suppliers. Vietnam's textile and garment industry, for example, has made rapid progress in recent years but is still facing great difficulties as the supply of raw materials and machinery depends heavily on foreign countries. Therefore, it is extremely important for textile and garment manufacturing companies in Vietnam to implement an effective supplier evaluation and selection process. While multicriteria decision-making models are frequently employed to assist with supplier evaluation and selection problems, few of these models consider the problem under the condition of a fuzzy decision-making environment. The aim of this paper is to create a hybrid MCDM model using the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to assist the supplier selection process in the garment industry in a fuzzy decision-making environment. In this study, the FAHP method is used to evaluate the performance and the weight of each criterion. TOPSIS is then used to rank all potential suppliers. The proposed model is then applied to a real-world case study to demonstrate both the process of calculation as well as its real-world applicability. The results from the case study provide empirical evidence that the model is feasible. The proposed approach can also be used in combination with other MCDM models to better support decision makers and can be modified to be applied in similar supplier selection processes for different industries.","output":"Sustainable Supplier Selection Model in Supply Chains During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe healthcare challenge calling for an integrated approach in determining the clues for early non-invasive diagnostics of the potentially severe cases and efficient patient stratification.

Within each family we tune the parameter towards the threshold of black hole formation. The results for centered data agree with earlier work. Our key results are first, that close to the threshold of collapse the global peak in the curvature appears on the symmetry axis but away from the origin, indicating that in the limit they will collapse around disjoint centers. This is confirmed in three of the six families by explicitly finding apparent horizons around these large curvature peaks. Second, we find evidence neither for strict discrete-self-similarity nor for universal power-law scaling of curvature quantities.

Implementing VCPs requires considerable personnel and personal protective equipment resources. However, it is unknown whether VCPs are associated with reduced hospital-onset C difficile infection (HO-CDI) rates. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between VCPs and HO-CDI rates using simulation modeling. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This simulation study, conducted between July 27, 2020, and August 11, 2020, used an established agent-based simulation model of C difficile transmission in a 200-bed acute care adult hospital to estimate the association between VCPs and HO-CDI while varying assumptions about factors such as patient susceptibility, behavior, and C difficile transmission. The model simulated hospital activity for 1 year among a homogeneous, simulated adult population. INTERVENTIONS: No VCP use vs ideal use of VCPs under different hospital configurations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rate of HO-CDI per 10 000 patient-days according to the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions definition of HO-CDI. RESULTS: With use of the simulation model, the baseline rate of HO-CDI was 7.94 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.91-7.98 per 10 000 patient-days) with no VCP use compared with 7.97 per 10 000 patient-days (95% CI, 7.93-8.01 per 10 000 patient-days) with ideal VCP use. Visitor contact precautions were not associated with a reduction of more than 1% in HO-CDI rates in any of the tested scenarios and hospital settings. Independently increasing the hand-hygiene compliance of the average health care worker and environmental cleaning compliance by no more than 2% each was associated with greater HO-CDI reduction compared with all other scenarios, including VCPs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this simulation study, the association between VCPs and HO-CDI was minimal, but improvements in health care worker hand hygiene and environmental cleaning were associated with greater reductions in estimated HO-CDI. Hospitals may achieve a higher rate of reduction for HO-CDI by focusing on making small improvements in compliance with interventions other than VCP.","output":"Association of Visitor Contact Precautions With Estimated Hospital-Onset Clostridioides difficile Infection Rates in Acute Care Hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Radical parametrectomy is indicated in cases of undiagnosed early-stage invasive cervical carcinoma discovered after simple hysterectomy performed for a presumed benign disease process.

Globally, it is the second most common retinal disease that leads to blindness, slightly less common than cataracts. Therefore, there is a great need to avoid the silent growth of this disease using recently developed generative adversarial networks (GANs). OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to introduce a GAN technology for the diagnosis of eye disorders, particularly glaucoma. This paper illustrates deep adversarial learning as a potential diagnostic tool and the challenges involved in its implementation. This study describes and analyzes many of the pitfalls and problems that researchers will need to overcome to implement this kind of technology. METHODS: To organize this review comprehensively, articles and reviews were collected using the following keywords: (Glaucoma, optic disc, blood vessels) and (receptive field, loss function, GAN, Generative Adversarial Network, Deep learning, CNN, convolutional neural network OR encoder). The records were identified from 5 highly reputed databases: IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PubMed. These libraries broadly cover the technical and medical literature. Publications within the last 5 years, specifically 2015-2020, were included because the target GAN technique was invented only in 2014 and the publishing date of the collected papers was not earlier than 2016. Duplicate records were removed, and irrelevant titles and abstracts were excluded. In addition, we excluded papers that used optical coherence tomography and visual field images, except for those with 2D images. A large-scale systematic analysis was performed, and then a summarized taxonomy was generated. Furthermore, the results of the collected articles were summarized and a visual representation of the results was presented on a T-shaped matrix diagram. This study was conducted between March 2020 and November 2020. RESULTS: We found 59 articles after conducting a comprehensive survey of the literature. Among the 59 articles, 30 present actual attempts to synthesize images and provide accurate segmentation/classification using single/multiple landmarks or share certain experiences. The other 29 articles discuss the recent advances in GANs, do practical experiments, and contain analytical studies of retinal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Recent deep learning techniques, namely GANs, have shown encouraging performance in retinal disease detection. Although this methodology involves an extensive computing budget and optimization process, it saturates the greedy nature of deep learning techniques by synthesizing images and solves major medical issues. This paper contributes to this research field by offering a thorough analysis of existing works, highlighting current limitations, and suggesting alternatives to support other researchers and participants in further improving and strengthening future work.

Nineteen percent of HCWs committed the major breach, out of which 37.5% were done by house-keeping sanitation staff (p = 0.008 and RR 2.85; 95% CI of 1.313-6.19), followed by technicians (22.5%), nursing staff (16.7%) and resident doctors (6.5%). Conclusions Performing doffing using a real-time RADS system is associated with a relatively low incidence of a breach in biosafety compared with earlier studies using an onsite standard observer. Overall adherence of HCWs to the CDC guidelines of doffing PPE was satisfactory. This study highlights the importance of the RADS system during doffing of PPE in a health care setting amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Performance of Health Care Workers in Doffing of Personal Protective Equipment Using Real-Time Remote Audio-Visual Doffing Surveillance System: Its Implications for Bio-Safety Amid COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The ability to protect workers and healthcare professionals from infection by SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is of great concern. Hospitals, nursing homes and employers are adopting infection control strategies based on guidance from leading public health organizations such as the CDC, OSHA, FDA, and other government bodies. Certain hard surface disinfectants are effective against SARS-CoV-2 but are not suitable for use on skin or personal protective equipment (PPE) that comes into contact with skin. Furthermore, near-ubiquitous alcohol-based hand sanitizers are acceptable for use on skin, but they are not suitable for use on PPE. PPE, especially masks, are also commonly being used for longer durations than normal. There is a need for new products and techniques that can effectively disinfect PPE during wear time without having detrimental effects on surrounding skin. Clyraguard spray is a novel copper iodine complex designed to be used on non-critical PPE. Methods: In this study, the Clyraguard copper iodine complex was tested for its ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in solution. Results: These data indicate the product to be effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 titers in a time-dependent manner, with the virus being reduced below the detection limits within 30 minutes. Conclusions: These results suggest that Clyraguard may be an effective tool for mitigating cross-contamination of non-critical PPE that may come into contact with SARS-CoV-2.","output":"In vitro efficacy of a copper iodine complex PPE disinfectant for SARS-CoV-2 inactivation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study is to determine a development of humoral response after COVID-19 vaccination in persons with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (pwSPMS) on siponimod, compared to healthy controls (HC).

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study of household index cases reported from February 7-27, 2021. A propensity-score matched cohort was derived to calculate adjusted estimates. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A population-based cohort of all private households with index cases. We excluded cases in congregate settings, as well as households with one individual or with >1 case with the same earliest symptom onset date. EXPOSURE: VOC status, defined as either individuals confirmed as B.1.1.7 using whole genome sequencing or those that screened positive for the N501Y mutation using real-time PCR. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Household secondary attack rate, defined as the number of household secondary cases that occurred 1-14 days after the index case divided by the total number of household secondary contacts. RESULTS: We included 1,259 index VOC and non-VOC cases in the propensity score-matched analysis. The secondary attack rate for VOC index cases in this matched cohort was 1.31 times higher than non-VOC index cases (RR=1.31, 95%CI 1.14-1.49), similar to the unadjusted estimate. In stratified analyses, the higher secondary attack rate for VOC compared to non-VOC index cases was accentuated for asymptomatic index cases (RR=1.91, 95% CI 0.96-3.80) and presymptomatic cases (RR=3.41, 95%CI 1.13-10.26) CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides strong evidence of increased transmissibility in households due to VOCs and suggests that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission may be of particular importance for VOCs.

Here we examine the impact of Healthy Caregivers-Healthy Children (HC2) Phase 2, a child care center (CCC)-based obesity prevention intervention on changes in the CCC nutrition and physical activity environment over two school years. DESIGN This was a cluster randomized trial with 12 CCC receiving the HC2 intervention arm and 12 in the control arm. The primary outcome was change in the Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation (EPAO) tool over two school years (Fall-2015, Spring-2016 and Spring-2017). Changes in EPAO physical activity and nutrition score were analyzed via a (1) random effects mixed models and (2) mixed models to determine the effect of HC2 versus control.

PARTICIPANTS Intervention CCCs received (1) teachers/parents/children curriculum; (2) snack, beverage, physical activity, and screen time policies; and (3) menu modifications. RESULTS Two-year EPAO nutrition score changes in intervention CCCs were almost twice that of control CCCs. The EPAO physical activity environment scores only slightly improved in intervention CCCs versus control CCCs. Intervention CCCs showed higher combined EPAO physical activity and nutrition scores compared to control CCCs over the 2-year study period (=0.09, P=0.05).

METHODS: Acidic or neutral GLY vs. phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was topically applied to normal or wounded corneas of C57BL/6 mice. In unwounded corneas, goblet cells and corneal nerves were stained and quantitated. After wounding, corneas were fluorescein stained and photographed using a slit lamp. Mice also were infected with KEI 1025 or MDR9 and the protective effects of GLY pH evaluated comparatively. RESULTS: In the unwounded cornea, application of acidic or neutral GLY vs. PBS reduced the number of bulbar conjunctival goblet cells but did not alter corneal nerve density. Similar application of GLY to scarified corneas delayed wound closure. After KEI 1025 infection, none of the GLY vs. PBS-treated corneas perforated; GLY treatment also decreased plate count (neutral pH more effective) and reduced MPO and several cytokines. Similarly, for MDR9, GLY at either pH was protective and also enhanced the effects of moxifloxacin to which MDR9 is resistant. CONCLUSION: Acidic or neutral pH GLY decreased goblet cell number but had no effect on nerve density. After corneal wounding, GLY at either pH (1) delayed wound closure and, (2) after infection, decreased keratitis when used alone or in combination with moxifloxacin. Neutral pH did not alter the therapeutic effect of GLY and would be preferred if used clinically.","output":"Ocular Effects of Glycyrrhizin at Acidic and Neutral pH"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an attempt to properly address one of the greatest challenges for prison administrations around the world facing Covid-19, namely, to ensure regular communication between the inmates and their families, the Serbian Penal Administration, supported by German NGO Help e.V, procured the ICT equipment aimed at substituting the in-person visits.

The level of 25(OH)D was assessed from the saliva samples using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The children were divided into two groups: pre-pubertal (girls below 10 years and boys below 11 years) and pubertal individuals (girls above 10 years and boys above 11 years). RESULTS The 25(OH)D concentrations were higher in late spring (June) among pre-pubertal children than in the autumn (November-December) among pubertal children. The level of 25(OH)D was positively correlated with body cell mass (BCM,%) among all children (pubertal: R = 0.20, P = .044; pre-pubertal: R = 0.23, P = .041) and inversely associated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) among pubertal children of both sexes (R = -0.25; P = .031).

Here, we further confirmed the increased expression of IL-25 in CRSwNP and investigated potential contributors of IL-25 in CRSwNP epithelium. METHODS: Sixty CRSwNP, 25 CRSsNP and 15 healthy control tissues were examined for IL-25 expression and for the accompanying type 2 inflammatory cytokines. We then tested different respiratory virus infections on human nasal epithelial cells (hNECs) for their ability to trigger IL-25 expression. In addition, we subjected hNECs generated from CRSwNP tissues to pretreatment with recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-) prior to viral infection to evaluate IFN effects on IL-25 induction. RESULTS: We confirmed that significantly enhanced levels of IL-25 were observed in CRSwNP tissues, and that IL-25 expression correlated with type 2 inflammatory cytokine expression. In vitro, we observed significantly elevated IL-25 in hNECs infected with influenza A virus as early as 24 hours post-infection (hpi), regardless of tissue origin, and IL-25 correlated positively with viral load. While other respiratory viruses exhibited increasing trends of IL-25, these were not significant at the time-points tested. IFN- treatment of CRSwNP epithelium was found to exert bimodal effects, ie IFN- treatment alone induced moderate IL-25 expression, whereas IFN- pretreatment of hNECs before influenza infection significantly diminished IL-25 induction by active influenza virus infection. CONCLUSION: We have authenticated the observation of elevated IL-25 in CRSwNP, which is correlated with type 2 inflammatory cytokines. Notably, we identified influenza virus infection as a potential contributor of IL-25 in both control and CRSwNP epithelium during active infection. This IL-25 induction can be abated by IFN- pretreatment which ameliorated active influenza infection.

Therefore, this present study aimed to find the potential association between AVP serum level and inflammatory disorders in Covid-19. It has been observed by different recent studies that physiological response due to fever, pain, hypovolemia, dehydration, and psychological stress is characterized by activation release of AVP to counter-balance high blood viscosity in Covid-19 patients. In addition, activated immune cells mainly T and B lymphocytes and released pro-inflammatory cytokines stimulate discharge of stored AVP from immune cells, which in a vicious cycle trigger release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects that may inhibit AVP-induced hyponatremia and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Covid-19. In conclusion, release of AVP from hypothalamus is augmented in Covid-19 due to stress, high pro-inflammatory cytokines, high circulating AngII and inhibition of GABAergic neurons. In turn, high AVP level leads to induction of hyponatremia, inflammatory disorders, and development of complications in Covid-19 by activation of NF-B and NLRP3 inflammasome with release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

While systematic reviews can be completed rapidly, rapid reviews are usually a type of evidence synthesis in which components of the systematic review process may be simplified or omitted to produce information more efficiently within constraints of time, expertise, funding or any combination thereof. There is an absence of high-quality evidence underpinning some decisions about how we plan, do and share rapid reviews. We will conduct a modified James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership to determine the top 10 unanswered research questions about how we plan, do and share rapid reviews in collaboration with patients, public, reviewers, researchers, clinicians, policymakers and funders. Methods: An international steering group consisting of key stakeholder perspectives (patients, the public, reviewers, researchers, clinicians, policymakers and funders) will facilitate broad reach, recruitment and participation across stakeholder groups. An initial online survey will identify stakeholders perceptions of research uncertainties about how we plan, do and share rapid reviews. Responses will be categorised to generate a long list of questions. The list will be checked against systematic reviews published within the past three years to identify if the question is unanswered. A second online stakeholder survey will rank the long list in order of priority. Finally, a virtual consensus workshop of key stakeholders will agree on the top 10 unanswered questions. Discussion: Research prioritisation is an important means for minimising research waste and ensuring that research resources are targeted towards answering the most important questions. Identifying the top 10 rapid review methodology research priorities will help target research to improve how we plan, do and share rapid reviews and ultimately enhance the use of high-quality synthesised evidence to inform health care policy and practice.","output":"What are the most important unanswered research questions on rapid review methodology?

A third of hospitals use barcodes to verify doses during dispensing in the pharmacy and to verify ingredients when intravenous medications are compounded. More than 80% scan barcodes when restocking ADCs. Sterile workflow management technology is used in 21.3% of hospitals. Almost three-quarters of hospitals outsource some sterile preparations. Pharmacists can independently prescribe in 21.1% of hospitals. Pharmacist practice in ambulatory clinics in 46.2% of health systems and provide telepharmacy services in 28.4% of health systems. CONCLUSION: Pharmacists continue their responsibility in their traditional role in preparation and dispensing of medications. They have successfully employed technology to improve safety and efficiency in performance of these duties and have employed emerging technologies to improve the safety, timeliness, and efficiency of the administration of drugs to patients. As pharmacists continue to expand their role to all aspects of medication use, new opportunities highlighted in ASHP's Practice Advancement Initiative 2030 have been identified.","output":"ASHP national survey of pharmacy practice in hospital settings: Dispensing and administration-2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The most important question and concern in these circumstances of COVID-19 epidemic outspread is when will the pandemic end? Vaccination is the only solution to restore life to normalcy in the fastest and safest possible manner. Therefore, we have carried out a predictive analysis for realistic timescale estimates for overcoming the epidemic considering vaccination rate effect on the dynamics of COVID-19 control. In particular we discuss the worst affected large countries like India, Brazil and USA for estimating effect of vaccination rate in expediting the end of the COVID-19 epidemic. We analytically simulated the dynamic evolution of active cases of these countries in the last nine months using the modified SIR model and then included the effect of vaccination to forecast the proliferation dynamics. We hence obtained the transmission parameters, the variation in the reproduction numbers and the impact of the different values of the vaccination shots in the expected curves of active cases in the coming times to predicted the timescales of the end of the epidemic.","output":"Predictive analysis of COVID-19 eradication with vaccination in India, Brazil, and U.S.A"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster has been widely described in the context of different systemic autoimmune diseases but not dermatomyositis/polymyositis. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence, risk factors and herpes zoster outcomes in this population. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections in dermatomyositis/polymyositis patients was performed. The patients were followed at a tertiary center from 1991 to 2012. For the control group, each patient with herpes zoster was paired with two patients without herpes zoster. Patients were matched by gender and the type of myositis, age at myositis onset and disease duration. RESULTS: Of 230 patients, 24 (10.4%) had a histories of herpes zoster (19 with dermatomyositis and five with polymyositis, two-thirds female). The mean age of the patients with herpes zoster was 44.616.8 years. No difference between the groups was found regarding cumulative clinical manifestations. Disease activity, autoantibody, muscle and leukogram parameters were also comparable between the groups. No differences in immunosuppressive (alone or in association with other immunosuppressive therapies) or glucocorticoid (current use, medium dose and cumulative dose in the last two months) therapies were found between patients with and without herpes zoster. However, a higher proportion of patients in the herpes zoster group received chloroquine diphosphate compared to the control group. All of the patients received acyclovir; 58.3% of patients had postherpetic neuralgia and no cases of recurrence were reported. Furthermore, individuals who were taking high prednisone doses at the time of the herpes zoster diagnosis had reduced levels of postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chloroquine diphosphate could predispose patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis to developing herpes zoster, particularly women and dermatomyositis patients.","output":"Chloroquine diphosphate: a risk factor for herpes zoster in patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In the United States, family caregivers are the cornerstone of the support system for persons living with dementia (PLWD). This study examined how the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic challenged caregivers capacity to deliver long term care services and supports to PLWD. METHOD: Participants (expected N=40) in this qualitative study are family caregivers for PLWD who reside in either the community or a long\\\\term care facility. Family caregivers participate in semi\\\\structured, hour\\\\long telephonic interviews covering: (1) adequacy of caregiving supports; (2) social, emotional, physical, financial, and other effects of caregiving during the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the caregiver; and (3) effects of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on the person with dementia. Interviews are audio\\\\recorded, transcribed, and coded in NVivo. The University of Pennsylvania IRB approved this study. RESULTS: Preliminary results show that social distancing measures disrupted services and supports for PLWD (e.g., closure of adult day centers). Efforts to minimize the risk of COVID\\\\19 disease or death for the person with dementia increased caregiver work and feelings of burden. Many caregivers described making difficult tradeoffs. Some reduced their utilization of supports (e.g., forgoing having paid aides come into the home, limiting visits from other family members), but this has increased workload and limited opportunities for respite. Other caregivers reduced work hours or left the workforce entirely (e.g., because they deemed their risk of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 exposure on the job too high), but this has increased financial vulnerability and social isolation. A majority of caregivers expressed concern that social distancing has negatively affected the person in their care; many perceive a hastening of cognitive decline and feel their time with the person with dementia has been limited by the pandemic. Caregivers for long\\\\term care facility residents reported frustration with limited visitation opportunities as well as a perceived decrease in quality of care and lack of transparency. CONCLUSION: Our results will help characterize the impact of the COVID\\\\19 pandemic on PLWD and their caregivers.

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = ?.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores.

Our study aimed to evaluate the potential anti-CHIKV activity of memantine hydrochloride (mtnH), a drug from the class of the aminoadamantanes approved for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, as a possible drug to be repurposed to the treatment of Chikungunya fever. METHODS: MtnH antiviral activity against CHIKV was determined by infecting BHK-21 cells with CHIKV-nanoluc, a virus carrying the marker nanoluciferase reporter, in the presence or absence of mtnH at concentrations ranging from 500 to 1.45 M. The effective concentration of 50% inhibition (EC(50)) was calculated. Cell viability assay (determination of CC(50)) was also performed employing BHK-21 cells. Mutagenic assays were performed by the Salmonella Typhimurium/microsome assay (Ames test). RESULTS: MtnH presented a CC(50) of 248.4  31.9 M and an EC(50) of 32.4  4 M against CHIKV in vitro. The calculated selectivity index (SI) was 7.67. MtnH did not induce genetic mutation in Salmonella strains with or without an external metabolizing system.

The country has the necessary prerequisites for development, especially in the segment of medical resort. Sanatorium-and-health-resort services are in demand. The number of tourists who choose medical treatment and rehabilitation as the main purpose of their trip is growing. The rehabilitation program for those who have had COVID-19 became especially relevant. The majority of sanatoriums have developed a special treatment program for such clients, which is in high demand and is successfully implemented through tour operators and travel agencies as a special type of tourism. Little attention is paid to the marketing of medical tourism and consumer segmentation. The analysis of this area and the identification of the target tourism segment are complicated by the lack of statistics and methods for assessing the target clients of medical tourism. The study aims to develop a methodology for identifying the target clients of medical tourism by evaluating Internet statistics data on the medicine and tourism segments and identifying the corresponding average characteristics of medical tourist. To identify the characteristics inherent in the target clients of medical tourism, it is proposed to analyze characteristics of the medical and tourist website visitors.

Automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 from medical imaging enables precise medication, helps to control community outbreak, and reinforces coronavirus testing methods in place. While there exist several challenges in manually inferring traces of this viral infection from X-ray, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can mine data patterns that capture subtle distinctions between infected and normal X-rays. To enable automated learning of such latent features, a custom CNN architecture has been proposed in this research. It learns unique convolutional filter patterns for each kind of pneumonia. This is achieved by restricting certain filters in a convolutional layer to maximally respond only to a particular class of pneumonia/COVID-19. The CNN architecture integrates different convolution types to aid better context for learning robust features and strengthen gradient flow between layers. The proposed work also visualizes regions of saliency on the X-ray that have had the most influence on CNNs prediction outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in deep learning to learn custom filters within a single convolutional layer for identifying specific pneumonia classes.

No study to date has assessed whether a priori defined covariates; type of hospital setting and year of study publication, influence the relationship between delirium and mortality. This is also the first study to examine the longitudinal trend of delirium-associated mortality over recent decades, to analyse the trajectory of our efforts in combating this disease. METHODS MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, were searched from January 1981 to May 2018 for English-language primary articles. Rigorous title and abstract screen and full-text screen were conducted independently by two reviewers. This paper adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data was extracted independently by one reviewer using standardised data-collection sheets, with a separate reviewer verifying for accuracy. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Unadjusted effect sizes and event counts were analysed with a random effects model in primary meta-analysis and meta-regression, whereas a mixed effect model was used in secondary sub-group analysis. Mortality data at longest follow-up and cumulative mortality (hospital mortality combined with mortality at longest follow-up) data were analysed. RESULTS As part of a larger project, 446 of 6790 articles were retrieved, including 71 studies that measured mortality. Our results demonstrate that elderly inpatients with delirium had significantly greater odds of mortality (OR 3.18 [95%CI: 2.73, 3.70]) compared to non-delirious controls. Patients with delirium in the ICU had the highest odds for mortality (OR: 7.09 [95%CI: 3.60, 14.0]); double the risk compared to the average. Curiously, despite advancements in delirium research, delirium associated in-hospital odds of mortality has not changed in 30 years. CONCLUSION This is the largest meta-analysis to confirm the association between delirium and mortality, in older (age  65) hospital inpatients. The current meta-analysis highlights the significant odds of mortality after an episode of delirium, and these odds are much higher for ICU patients. However, in contrast to other medical conditions that have seen a decrease in associated mortality over the past few decades, delirium associated mortality remains unchanged.

Patients were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Baseline characteristics (including age, race, education, menopausal status, and baseline fractures) were comparable between the raloxifene and bisphosphonate groups. More women on raloxifene completed the study compared with those on bisphosphonate (50.2% versus 37.5%; P < 0.001). Patients also took raloxifene for a longer period than bisphosphonate (median, 356 versus 348 days; P = 0.011). Compared with those taking bisphosphonate, significantly fewer patients taking raloxifene discontinued the study because of stopping treatment (5.7% versus 10.1%, P = 0.017) or changing treatment (2.8% versus 9.7%, P < 0.001).

There are no uniform criteria in this setting and it has been proposed that fibrinolysis may be the strategy of choice during lockdown. The aim is to present our experience and safety in maintaining the guidelines based STEMI reperfusion strategy. METHODS AND PURPOSE: Retrospective study comparing patients treated for STEMI during the period of lockdown in Spain (03/15/2020 to 05/31/2020) and patients with STEMI treated in the same period of the previous year (2019). RESULT: We included 73 patients from the pre-COVID period versus 67 patients from the lockdown. Baseline characteristics are showed in table 1. There were no significant differences neither in the choice of reperfusion strategy (fibrinolysis or primary percutaneous coronary intervention) nor in the occurrence of complications. Independently of the reperfusion strategy, there was not a significant increase on reperfusion times (table 1). There were no significant differences in complications during admission. In our experience, PPCI achieved similar in-hospital and 30-day mortality, as compared with fibrinolysis during the COVID-19 lockdown (Image 1).

But little is known about the true frequency of DVT in patients who attend emergency department (ED) and are diagnosed with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence, risk factors, clinical characteristics and outcomes of DVT in patients with COVID-19 attending the ED before hospitalization. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all COVID patients diagnosed with DVT in 62 Spanish EDs (20% of Spanish EDs, case group) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 outbreak. We compared DVT-COVID-19 patients with COVID-19 without DVT patients (control group). Relative frequencies of DVT were estimated in COVID and non-COVID patients visiting the ED and annual standardized incidences were estimated for both populations. Sixty-three patient characteristics and four outcomes were compared between cases and controls. RESULTS: We identified 112 DVT in 74 814 patients with COVID-19 attending the ED [1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23C1.80]. This relative frequency was similar than that observed in non-COVID patients [2109/1 388 879; 1.52; 95% CI, 1.45C1.69; odds ratio (OR) = 0.98 [0.82-1.19]. Standardized incidence of DVT was higher in COVID patients (98,38 versus 42,93/100,000/year; OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 2.03C2.38). In COVID patients, the clinical characteristics associated with a higher risk of presenting DVT were older age and having a history of venous thromboembolism, recent surgery/immobilization and hypertension; chest pain and desaturation at ED arrival and some analytical disturbances were also more frequently seen, d-dimer >5000 ng/mL being the strongest. After adjustment for age and sex, hospitalization, ICU admission and prolonged hospitalization were more frequent in cases than controls, whereas mortality was similar (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.77C2.45).

The current study aimed to explore the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 complicated by hypertension. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 110 discharged patients with COVID-19 at Wuhan Fourth Hospital in Wuhan, China, from January 25 to February 20, 2020. All study cases were grouped according to whether they had a history of hypertension. Then, a subgroup analysis for all hypertensive patients was carried out based on whether to take ACEI or ARB drugs. The mean age of 110 patients was 57.7 years (range, 25C86 years), of which 60 (54.5%) were male patients. The main underlying diseases included hypertension [36 (32.7%)] and diabetes [11 (10.0%)]. Compared with the non-hypertensive group, the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the hypertensive group (average value, 0.96  10(9)/L vs 1.26  10(9)/L), and analysis of clinical outcomes showed that the crude mortality rate was higher in the hypertensive group [7/36 (19.4%) vs 2/74 (2.7%)]. Patients treated with ACEI or ARB, compared with the control group, were younger (average age, 58.5 years vs 69.2 years), but there was no statistical difference in the crude cure rate [10/15 (66.7%) vs 15/21 (71.4%)] and the crude mortality rate [2/15 (13.3%) vs 5/21 (23.8%)]. In conclusions, the COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had a significantly lower lymphocyte count on admission. The elderly and comorbidities such as hypertension may together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. Taking ACEI or ARB drugs may not change the prognosis of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.","output":"Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with hypertension on reninCangiotensin system inhibitors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract The ubiquitinCproteasome system has been recognized as fundamental toward protein turnover in eukaryotic cells. The system comprises the ubiquitin conjugation machinery consisting of an enzyme cascade of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, the deubiquitinases (DUBs) and the proteasome, a multisubunit protease complex acting through an N-terminal threonine protease mechanism. A number of natural product inhibitors of the proteasome have been studied in detail and these inhibitors and their derivatives have been highly valuable in developing our understanding of this system. These efforts culminated in the successful development of bortezomib as a pharmacological agent used clinically as a cancer therapeutic in the treatment of multiple myeloma. This review is focused on natural product inhibitors of the enzymes involved in intracellular ubiquitin conjugation (ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, ubiquitin ligase E3) and ubiquitin deconjugation (DUBs). Members of both of these enzyme systems have been proposed as pharmacological targets for cancer therapy and several other diseases. Furthermore compounds with activities toward enzymes from the analogous ubiquitin-like (Ubl) protein families have been identified for SUMO and NEDD8. To date natural product inhibitors have been described for members of each of these protein families and were isolated from plant, fungal, animal, and microbial sources. Insights into the mechanism of action of natural products and their derivatives will enhance our understanding of this complex system and will improve our ability to rationally design novel inhibitors. The increased availability of assays and research tools for the study of protein ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and Ubl proteins will contribute to the discovery of more potent and selective compounds. We expect that these studies will stimulate development of further potential pharmacological agents in this area.","output":"Chapter 6 Natural Product Inhibitors of Ubiquitin Conjugation and Deconjugation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global burden of infectious diseases and the increased attention to natural, accidental, and deliberate biological threats has resulted in significant investment in infectious disease research.

METHODS: We assessed if and to what extent the European Union policy assurances were upheld in trade negotiations. Our assessment was made using three process tracing informed tests. The tests examined: i) what was covered in negotiation proposals of services and investment chapters, ii) if treatment of health services differed from treatment of another category of services (audiovisual services) with similar EU Treaty considerations, and iii) if other means of general exceptions, declarations or emphases on right to regulate could have resulted in the same outcome. RESULTS: Our analysis shows that the European Union had sought to secure policy space for publicly funded health services for services chapter, but not for investment and investment protection chapters. In comparison to audiovisual services, exceptions for health services fall short from those on audiovisual services. There is little evidence that the same outcome could have been achieved using other avenues.

Many studies have shown that in comparison with open hernia repair, laparoscopic repair results in less pain and a shorter convalescence. However, postoperative pain remains a concern. One possible cause of postoperative pain in the early postoperative phase is strain or cough on removal of the endotracheal tube. Use of a supraglottic airway (SGA) device helps to avoid such complaints. We evaluated postoperative pain after TAPP repair using the SGA for general anesthesia. METHODS We evaluated the postoperative pain in 146 patients with inguinal hernia repaired by TAPP in our hospital between May 2013 and May 2016. A total of 144 adult patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II who underwent needlescopic TAPP surgery were randomly allocated to one of two groups of 72 patients: group A (SGA), in which the patient's airway was secured with an appropriately sized I-gel, and group B (endotracheal tube), in which the airway was secured under laryngoscopy. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the groups regarding patient background, postoperative hospital stay, and operation time, and TAPP was performed safely in all cases. In the analysis of postoperative pain, the mean Numerical Rating Scale score of peak pain in group A was significantly less than that of group B (2.10  2.05 vs 2.90  2.65; p = 0.043). In group A, the percentage of patients who had an NRS score of 0 was 51.4% 30 min after surgery, 62.5% after 6 h and 68.1% at POD1, and compared to group B, the NRS scores were significantly higher at POD1 (p = 0.003), and the level of postoperative pain in group A tended to decrease earlier than that in group B. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study are the first to show that an SGA device can reduce postoperative pain after laparoscopic surgery.","output":"A randomized clinical study on postoperative pain comparing between the supraglottic airway device and endotracheal tubing in transabdominal preperitoneal repair (TAPP)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. Starting in December 2019 from China, the first cases were officially announced on February 19 in Qom city, Iran. As of April 3, 2020, 206 countries have reported a total of 932166 cases with 46764 deaths. Along with China, USA, Italy, Spain, and Germany, Iran has been suffering the hardest burden of COVID-19 outbreak. Worse still, countries like Iran are struggling with the double burden of political sanctions to provide lifesaving medical equipment and medicines to combat the emergency. METHODS: Using systematic document content analysis and through the lenses of health policy triangle, this article aims to compare the policies and strategies that Iran is adopting, with the experience and recommendations of China and WHO to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: Iran has formulated contextual-based policies to combat COVID-19 outbreak before and after virus entrance. Insufficient whole-government, whole-society approach in managing the outbreak, inadequate lifesaving and protective equipment, and delayed decisive governance are the biggest challenges in policy making to combat COVID-19. COVID-19 policies are a public health concern and require professional advocacy attempts through appropriate inter-sectoral collaboration and whole-government coalitions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is an unfolding outbreak; hence, policy learning is crucial to formulate appropriate policies and implement them accordingly.

Major surgical societies advised using non-operative management of appendicitis and suggested against laparoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Multicenter, observational study investigating the outcomes of patients undergoing appendectomy in the two months of March-April 2019 vs. March-April 2020. The primary outcome was the number of appendectomies performed during each of the two months, classified according to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) score. Secondary outcomes were the type of surgical technique employed (laparoscopic vs. open), and the complication rates. Results: 1541 patients with acute appendicitis underwent surgery during the two study periods. 1337 (86.8%) patients met the study inclusion criteria. 546 (40.8%) patients underwent surgery for acute appendicitis in 2020 and 791 (59.8%) in 2019. Patients with complicated appendicitis operated in 2019 were 76 (9.6%) vs. 87 (15.9%) in 2020 (p = 0.001). An increase in the number of post-operative complications was found in 2020 (15.9%) compared to 2019 (9.6%) (p < 0.001). The following determinants increased the likelihood of complication occurrence: undergoing surgery during 2020 (+ 67%), having a unit AAST (+ 26%) increase, having waited for surgery > 24 h (+ 58%), being the surgeon aged > 40 years (+ 47%), undergoing open surgery (+ 112%) and being converted to open surgery (+ 166%). Conclusions: In Italian hospitals, in March and April 2020, the number of appendectomies has drastically dropped.

High ESG-rated companies have lower exposure to systematic risk factors and low expected cost of capital, leading to higher valuations in a DCF model framework. They are typically more transparent, particularly with respect to their risk exposures, risk management and governance standards and have better long-term vision. The paper finds that higher Alpha can be harvested by restricting investment exposure to the ESG theme combined with various style characteristics, as they display low systematic and idiosyncratic tail risks. It shows that an ESG overlay on such factor-based strategies, particularly on multi-factor, value and low volatility in that order, reduces both systematic and idiosyncratic risks further. ESG overlay on quality factor provides the highest return among ESG target indices, however, the underlying quality factor provides even higher excess return.

The enhanced transmissibility could be attributed to one or more factors: higher stability on surfaces or within droplet nuclei suspended in air, increased maximal viral load or higher probability of infection. The relative importance of these factors on the transmission was examined using a validated stochastic-jump-continuous hybrid model. The transmissibility was quantified in terms of the household secondary attack rate (hSAR) which is the probability of transmission from an infected individual to a susceptible one in a household. We find that an increase in either the maximal viral load or the probability of infection is consistent with the observed hSAR of the variants. Specifically, in order to reach the relative increase in the hSAR of 40%, 55%, and 87% reported for the Epsilon, Alpha, and Delta variants (respectively), the maximal viral load should increase by 56%, 78%, and 125%, respectively. Alternatively, the probability of infection should increase by 34%, 53%, and 193%, respectively. Contrary to these results, even a dramatic increase in environmental stability increases hSAR by no more than 10%.","output":"Increased transmissibility of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is driven either by viral load or probability of infection rather than environmental stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Small bowel atresia has quite an incidence in infants particularly in males.

On further examination, it was seen that the abdominal distension was mostly central & there was hyperperistaltic bowel sounds on auscultation. The infant also had scoliosis. There was decreased appetite & features of dehydration. Diagnosed by USG(W/A), infantogram & X-Ray plain picture abdomen. DISCUSSION The mortality from the atresia of ileum is greater owing to the incidence of early perforation. Infants may present with features discussed above. They usually present during the 1st week of life but majority of the babies presenting late have significant mortality. Early surgical intervention with excision of the dilated bowel segment with anastomosis of the proximal (normal caliber bowel) to the distal part of the bowel has been seen to have been associated with decreased morbidity & mortality.

Purpose: to compare results of different methods of EF assessment: visual estimation (visual EF), manual and fully automated analysis. Methods: 28 consecutive pediatric patients were enrolled. This cohort of previously healthy patients was screened at our Center for cardiac evaluation within 6 months after an asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic COVID19 infection. All they were in sinus rhythm. Optimized apical 4- and 2- chamber views were collected for each patient using Canon Aplio i900. Off-line EF assessment was first evaluated visually by pediatric cardiologists with experience in echocardiography, then performed by both fully automated analysis (AI) using two different methods (Automatic Simpson -AI Simpson- and Wall Motion Tracking -AI WMT-) and pediatric cardiologists through manual tracing of endocardial border (Manual Simpson and Manual WMT respectively). Operators were blinded to the AI analysis. To measure intraobserver variability, evaluations of 16 patients' datasets were performed twice by both operators and AI. Results: Patients' demographic data were: age 9,8+/-4,7 years;males 22 (78%);height 134,3+/- 34,9 cm;weight 41,8+/-28,7 kg;BSA 1,2+/-0,4 mq, HR 85+/-15/min. The time taken for off-line analysis was 0.3-0.7 minutes, 1-1.5 minutes, 1-3 minutes and 3-4 minutes, respectively for AI WMT, AI Simpson, Manual WMT and Manual Simpson. As expected, visual EF showed high intraobserver variability and a poor reproducibility (ICC 43%). AI analysis revealed a good to excellent reproducibility (ICC from 80% to 99%, depending on the method used). WMT methods had the best reproducibility both for manual tracing of endocardial border and fully automated analysis (Table 1). The comparison between different methods (Table 2) showed a good agreement between AI Simpson and AI WMT (mean bias 2,9, from -3,2 to 9,0, ICC 86%). A moderate correlation was found between different methods of AI analysis while only poor correlation was found between manual Simpson and manual WMT (Table 2). Conclusion(s): Automatic Simpson and Wall Motion Tracking are two different fully automated methods which can be used for left ventricular function assessment. AI reproducibility is high for both methods, higher for WMT.

Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to identify optimal day and radiographic score for the prediction of respiratory distress, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess significant predictive factors for intubation or tracheostomy. Among 35 patients (22 men, 13 women; median age: 48 years), 25 demonstrated abnormal opacity on CXR (MERS pneumonia), whereas no abnormality was detected in 10 patients (MERS upper respiratory tract infection). Seven patients required ventilator support (intubation group) and three of them eventually expired. The average incubation period was 5.4 days (standard deviation, 2.8; range, 2C11).

In the early days of laparoscopic surgery, capacitive coupling, associated with hybrid trocars, was thought to be the major cause of laparoscopic electrosurgery injuries. Modern laparoscopy has reduced capacitive coupling, and now insulation failure is thought to be the main cause of electrosurgical complications. The aim of this study was (1) to determine the incidence of insulation failures, (2) to compare the incidence of insulation failure in reusable and disposable instruments, and (3) to determine the location of insulation failures. METHODS At four major urban hospitals, reusable laparoscopic instruments were checked for insulation failure using a high-voltage porosity detector. Disposable L-hooks were collected following laparoscopic cholecystectomy and similarly evaluated for insulation failure. Instruments were determined to have insulation failure if 2.5 kV crossed the instrument's insulation to create a closed loop circuit. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact or chi(2) analysis (*denotes significance set at p < 0.05). RESULTS Two hundred twenty-six laparoscopic instruments were tested (165 reusable). Insulation failure occurred more often in reusable (19%; 31/165) than in disposable instruments (3%; 2/61; *p < 0.01). When reusable sets were evaluated, 71% (12/17) were found to have at least one instrument with insulation failure. Insulation failure incidence in reusable instruments was similar between hospitals that routinely checked for insulation failure (19%; 25/130) and hospitals that do not routinely check for insulation failures (33%; 7/21; p = 0.16). Insulation failure was most common in the distal third of the instruments (54%; 25/46) compared to the middle or proximal third of the instruments (*p < 0.05). CONCLUSION One in five reusable laparoscopic instruments has insulation failure; a finding that is not altered by whether the hospital routinely checks for insulation defects. Disposable instruments have a lower incidence of insulation failure. The distal third of laparoscopic instruments is the most common site of insulation failure.","output":"Insulation failure in laparoscopic instruments."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Brain dural arteriovenous fistulas(bDAVFs) are anomalous connections between dural arteries and cerebral veins or sinuses. Cerebral venous thrombosis(CVT) often precedes or coincides with bDAVFs and is considered a risk factor for these vascular malformations. Recently, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia causing CVTs has been associated with COVID-19 vaccines. Concurrently with the start of massive vaccination in our region, we have observed a fivefold increase in the average incidence of bDAVFs. Objective To raise awareness of the potential involvement of COVID-19 vaccines in the pathogenesis of bDAVF. Methods A retrospective review of demographic, clinical, radiological, COVID-19 infection and vaccination data of patients diagnosed with bDAVFs between 2011-2021 was conducted. Patients were divided into two cohorts according to their belonging to pre- or post-COVID-19 vaccination times. Cohorts were compared for bDAVFs incidences and demographic and clinical features. Results Twenty-one bDAVFs were diagnosed between 2011- 2021, 7 of which were diagnosed in 2021. The mean age was 57.7 years, and 62% were males. All cases except one were treated;of them, 85% were exclusively managed with surgery. All treated cases were successfully occluded. The incidence in 2021 was significantly higher than that in the prevaccination period (1.72 vs 0.35/100,000/year;p=0.036;95%Confidence Interval=0.09-2.66). Cohorts were not different in age, sex, hemorrhagic presentation, dural sinus thrombosis or presence of prothrombotic or cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion The significant increase in the incidence of bDAVF following general vaccination policies against COVID-19 observed in our region suggests a potential correlation between these two facts.

The use of human lung tissue is one solution for the study of such novel respiratory pathogens. We hypothesized that a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissue allows for the in vitro study of the inter-individual heterogeneity of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus providing a bridge between studies with cell lines and studies in animal models. We generated a cryobank of tissues from 16 donors, most of whom had risk factors for severe illness from COVID-19. Cryopreserved tissues preserved 90% of cell viability and contained heterogeneous populations of metabolically active epithelial, endothelial, and immune cell subsets of the human lung. Samples were readily infectible with HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus strains, and demonstrated comparable susceptibility to infection. In contrast, we observed a marked donor-dependent heterogeneity in the expression of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFN in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Treatment of tissues with dexamethasone and the experimental drug, N-hydroxycytidine, suppressed viral growth in all samples, whereas chloroquine and remdesivir had no detectable effect. Metformin and sirolimus, molecules with predicted antiviral activity, suppressed viral replication in tissues from a subset of donors. In summary, we developed a novel system for the in vitro study of human SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human lung tissue from a library of donor tissues. This model may be useful for drug screening and for understanding basic mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis. Importance The current biological systems for the study of COVID-19 are in vitro systems that differ from the human lung in many respects, and animal hosts to which the virus is not adapted. We developed another alternative for studying pathogenesis and drug susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in a cryopreserved bank of human lung tissues. We consider the importance of this work to relate to the practical use of this culture system as a repeatable and scalable approach that allows for the study of an important infection in relevant tissues. The tissue bank highlights the heterogeneous response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and treatment, which allows researchers to investigate why treatments work in some donors but not others.","output":"In vitro infection of human lung tissue with SARS-CoV-2: Heterogeneity in host defense and therapeutic response"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the face of the COVID-19 outbreak, military healthcare teams were deployed to London to assist the London Ambulance Service t transfer ventilated patients between medical facilities.

Serum, SF, and synovial biopsy samples were collected from the OA group preoperatively, whereas samples were collected once from control dogs. A blinded veterinary pathologist graded synovial biopsies. Serum and SF analyses were performed using xMAP technology. General linear regression was used for statistical comparisons of serum biomarkers, and mixed linear regression for SF biomarkers and temporal concentration changes. The overall discriminative ability was quantified using area under curve (AUC). Spearmans correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between synovial histology grades and the biomarkers. Samples from 62 dogs in the OA group and 50 controls were included. The MMP-2 and MMP-3 concentrations between the OA and control groups were not significantly different, and both with an AUC indicating a poor discriminative ability.

The mRNA vaccines for SARS-CoV2 have proven highly effective and are currently used to vaccinate all age groups against COVID-19. Despite their high efficacy in clinical trials, there is limited data on the impact of age, sex, and side effects on vaccine-induced immune responses. Methods. We here studied the development of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein RBD domain antibodies after two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine in 118 healthy volunteers and correlated their immune response with age, sex, and side effects reported after the vaccinations. Findings. Our findings show a robust immune response to the Spike proteins RBD region after the first and the second vaccination dose. However, we also saw a decline of antibody levels at 6 weeks versus 1 week after the second dose, suggesting a waning of the immune response over time. Regardless of this, the antibody levels at 6 weeks after the second dose remained significantly higher than before the vaccination, after the first dose, or in COVID-19 convalescent individuals. We found a decreased vaccination efficacy but fewer adverse events in older individuals, and that mRNA vaccination is less efficient in older males whereas the detrimental impact of age on vaccination outcome is abolished in females at 6 weeks after the second dose. Interpretation. The Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine induces a strong immune response after two doses of vaccination but older individuals develop fewer side effects and decreased antibody levels at 6 weeks. The waning of anti-viral antibodies in particular in older male individuals suggests that both age and male sex act as risk factors in the immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine. Funding.

The diagnostic work-up included a CT-scan of the thorax, revealing bilateral sub-segmental pulmonary embolism. An echocardiogram showed a dilated right ventricle with poor systolic function and a large multi-lobar thrombus. Forty-eight hours after initiation of treatment with therapeutic anticoagulation the thrombus was no longer seen on the echocardiogram. DISCUSSION: This case confirms the high risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 infection as has been described in recent literature. It demonstrates the severity of the coagulopathy given the presence of both bilateral sub-segmental pulmonary embolism and right ventricular thrombus, despite treatment with prophylactic anticoagulation.

All patients were followed up for 2 years or until death. Survival rates, complications caused by catheter placement, and the probability of malfunction-free catheter survival were compared between the groups. RESULTS Catheter malfunction was the most frequent mechanical complication, found in 31 patients (14.4%), who experienced 38 malfunctions. Only 2 episodes of catheter malfunction were found in the MO-S group, representing a rate significantly less than those in the TO-S and TO-C groups (both p < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier curves for malfunction-free PD catheter survival showed a significantly different malfunction-free probability for the various groups (p = 0.009). After 2 years of follow-up, 136 patients (63.0%) survived with their initial PD catheter. The initial catheter survival rate was 76.8% in the MO-S group. Kaplan-Meier curves for initial catheter survival showed that the highest survival rate was found in the MO-S group (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The modified open surgery technique is a reliable method for catheter placement.","output":"A modified open surgery technique for peritoneal dialysis catheter placement decreases catheter malfunction."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 pandemic, is rapidly evolving. Due to the limited efficacy of vaccination in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and continuous emergence of variants of concern (VOC), including the currently most prevalent Delta variant, orally bioavailable and broadly efficacious antiviral drugs are urgently needed. Previously we showed that adenosine analogue 69-0 (also known as GS-441524), possesses potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Herein, we report that esterification of the 5-hydroxyl moieties of 69-0 markedly improved the antiviral potency.

Recently, numbers of epidemiological studies have illustrated that climate conditions and air pollutants are associated with the COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide. Researches also suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in fecal and wastewater samples. These findings provided the possibility of preventing and controlling the COVID-19 pandemic from an environmental perspective. With this review, the main purpose is to summarize the relationship between the atmospheric and wastewater environment and COVID-19. In terms of the atmospheric environment, the evidence of the relationship between atmospheric environment (climate factors and air pollution) and COVID-19 is growing, but currently available data and results are various. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze their associations to provide constructive suggestions in responding to the pandemic. Recently, large numbers of studies have shown the widespread presence of this virus in wastewater and the feasibility of wastewater surveillance when the pandemic is ongoing. Therefore, there is an urgent need to clarify the occurrence and implication of viruses in wastewater and to understand the potential of wastewater-based epidemiology of pandemic.

This protein is primarily regulated by the androgen receptor, and this mechanism may partly explain the disproportionate burden of disease among males. We hypothesized that the use of androgen modulation therapies (AMT) such as 5-a-reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may affect inpatient outcomes among hospitalized men with COVID-19. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective analysis in a large urban hospital system, hospitalized males with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and/or prostate cancer was identified from February to June 2020. Men were then stratified by use of specific AMT (ADT or 5- ARI). Baseline patient and hospital characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and multivariable regression models were used to explore the association of AMT with inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and other ICU outcomes (ICU admission, ICU Length of Stay, Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Intubation, and ARDS). RESULTS: A total of 396 inpatients were identified, with 130 (32.8%) having prior use of AMT. Of these, a large majority used 5-ARI (n=122, 93.8%). Mean (SD) age of patients was higher for those using AMT (76.5 (10.7) vs. 71.1 (11.8) years;p<0.001). No significant differences were identified in AMT use by race, body mass index, smoking status, or Charlson Comorbidity Index. Despite adjustment for these factors, AMT use was not associated with ICU admission, ventilation status, length of ICU stay, or length of hospital stay. However, a non-significant trend of decreased mortality was identified with the use of AMT (adjusted OR: 0.56;95% CI: 0.29e1.02;p=0.06) (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analysis suggests that AMT does not appear to improve inpatient outcomes among hospitalized males with COVID-19. The non-significant trend of decreased inpatient mortality, however, may be attributed to insufficient power. Future research with large sample sizes may uncover potential benefits of androgen modulation on COVID19 pathogenesis and outcomes.","output":"Exploring the association of androgen modulation therapy among men hospitalized with covid19: A retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Zoonotic diseases are the infectious diseases that can be transmitted to human beings and vice versa from animals either directly or indirectly. These diseases can be caused by a range of organisms including bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi. Viral diseases are highly infectious and capable of causing pandemics as evidenced by outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, West Nile, SARS-Corona, Nipah, Hendra, Avian influenza and Swine influenza. EXPALANTION: Many viruses affecting equines are also important human pathogens. Diseases like Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Western equine encephalitis (WEE), and Venezuelan-equine encephalitis (VEE) are highly infectious and can be disseminated as aerosols. A large number of horses and human cases of VEE with fatal encephalitis have continuously occurred in Venezuela and Colombia. Vesicular stomatitis (VS) is prevalent in horses in North America and has zoonotic potential causing encephalitis in children. Hendra virus (HeV) causes respiratory and neurological disease and death in man and horses. Since its first outbreak in 1994, 53 disease incidents have been reported in Australia. West Nile fever has spread to many newer territories across continents during recent years. It has been described in Africa, Europe, South Asia, Oceania and North America. Japanese encephalitis has expanded horizons from Asia to western Pacific region including the eastern Indonesian archipelago, Papua New Guinea and Australia. Rabies is rare in horses but still a public health concern being a fatal disease. Equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans but many scientists have mixed opinions. Equine viral diseases of zoonotic importance and their impact on animal and human health have been elaborated in this article. CONCLUSION: Equine viral diseases though restricted to certain geographical areas have huge impact on equine and human health. Diseases like West Nile fever, Hendra, VS, VEE, EEE, JE, Rabies have the potential for spread and ability to cause disease in human. Equine influenza is historically not known to affect humans but some experimental and observational evidence show that H3N8 influenza virus has infected man. Despite our pursuit of understanding the complexity of the vector-host-pathogen mediating disease transmission, it is not possible to make generalized predictions concerning the degree of impact of disease emergence. A targeted, multidisciplinary effort is required to understand the risk factors for zoonosis and apply the interventions necessary to control it.","output":"Zoonotic Viral Diseases of Equines and Their Impact on Human and Animal Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Serological SARS-CoV-2 assays have an important role in guiding the pandemic response. This research aimed to compare the performance of 2 antinucleocapsid assays. METHODS: Serum from 49 HCWs was analysed at baseline and 6 months using the Abbott diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the Roche Diagnostics Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody assay. RESULTS: At baseline, 14/49 participants (29%) demonstrated antibody reactivity using the Abbott assay. At 6 months, 4/14 participants (29%) continued to demonstrate reactivity. A total of 14/49 (29%) participants had detectable antibodies at baseline using the Roche assay. In total, 13/14 (93%) of participants demonstrated antibody reactivity at 6 months. The Abbott assay showed a statistically significant difference in the signal-to-threshold values of baseline reactive samples when repeated at 6 months (p = 0.001). This was not seen with the Roche assay (p = 0.51).

An audit on an acute geriatric ward in November 2018, found that over a third of patients medically fit (PMF) to sit out remained in bed all day. Therefore, a service development initiative was undertaken, addressing the misconception that keeping elderly patients in bed is safe, when in fact, unintentional harm results. METHOD: In a root cause analysis, four main reasons for bedrest were identified: risk aversion, unknown function, widespread bed is safe culture and lack of equipment. The project tasked getting PMF out of bed each day and was audited daily from November 2018 to present, involving all members of the multi-disciplinary team (MDT) and using a plan, do, study, act approach. RESULTS: Initially, the project showed an increase in percentage of PMF sitting out each day, but this subsequently decreased with winter pressures. However, for a whole year (February 2019CFebruary 2020) a sustained and significant improvement was achieved (64.3%C89.7%). The pre-COVID19 period (FebruaryCMarch 2020) saw fluctuations in PMF sitting out. Data collection halted during the COVID19 peak, although observationally most patients remained in bed. Auditing resumed from June 2020 (COVID19 recovery phase) which showed a steady increase in PMF out of bed, with recent figures surpassing pre-COVID19 levels (97.8%). CONCLUSION: Cultural change takes time to embed and needs persistent reviewing by a dedicated and engaged MDT. Improvements were made through more accessible doctors advice, better MDT education and communication, daily feedback of data and sourcing additional equipment. Disruption to working patterns over the COVID19 period made this unachievable and the project lost impetus.

METHODS: Through REDCap, 212 intensive care unit employees were surveyed with validated screening tools for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and alcohol misuse. The use and perceived effectiveness of hospital initiatives were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 212 surveys were evaluated. Among respondents, 54% experienced mild anxiety, more than 50% screened positive for mild depression, and 37% screened positive for posttraumatic stress disorder. Most employees (74.5%) were aware of at least 1 resource; 37% knew of the COVID-19 newsletter, one of the top resources highlighted in the survey.

They are able to infect many host, such as mammals or birds. Whereas CoVs were identified 1930s, they became known again in 2003 as the agents of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The spike protein is thought to be essential in the process of CoVs entry, because it is associated with the binding to the receptor on the host cell. It is also involved in cell tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor recognition is the crucial step in the infection. CoVs are able to bind a variety of receptors, although the selection of receptor remains unclear. Coronaviruses were initially believed to enter cells by fusion with the plasma membrane. Further studies demonstrated that many of them involve endocytosis through clathrin-dependent, caveolae-dependent, clathrin-independent, as well as caveolae-independent mechanisms. The aim of this review is to summarise current knowledge about coronaviruses, focussing especially on CoVs entry into the host cell. Advances in understanding coronaviruses replication strategy and the functioning of the replicative structures are also highlighted.

As a free service to strengthen a debilitated national hospital supply chain, the platform connected community organizations (as hospitals) with donors (individuals). From concepts and techniques that addressed information flows in healthcare logistics and supply chain management, several input-oriented data envelopment analyses were conducted to find the efficiencies for each of the 75 hospitals serviced by the website in terms of donors, individual items requested, total quantity of items requested, number of requested individual items that received a pledged, and average days a request pended to fulfillment. Results from the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique found that hospitals on the platform made requests that exceeded optimal quantities of inputs from donors. Further, hospital requests aggregated at the city-level stood unanswered an average of 14.39 days for inefficiently served cities. Findings from the analyses produced three recommendations to improve the web-based emergency response system service efficiency.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO), the prototype of heme-containing peroxidases, exists in neutrophils and monocytes. MPO has a broad spectrum of microbial killing. The difficulty of producing MPO at a large scale hinders its study and utilization. This study aimed to overexpress recombinant human MPO and characterize its microbicidal activities in vitro and in vivo. A human HEK293 cell line stably expressing recombinant MPO (rMPO) was established as a component of this study. rMPO was overexpressed and purified for studies on its biochemical and enzymatic properties, as well as its microbicidal activities. In this study, rMPO was secreted into culture medium as a monomer. rMPO revealed enzymatic activity similar to that of native MPO. rMPO, like native MPO, was capable of killing a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including Gram-negative and -positive bacteria and fungi, at low nM levels. Interestingly, rMPO could kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making it very useful for treatment of nosocomial infections and mixed infections. The administration of rMPO significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of murine lung infections induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In animal safety tests, the administration of 100 nM rMPO via tail vein did not result in any sign of toxic effects. Taken together, the data suggest that rMPO purified from a stably expressing human cell line is a new class of antimicrobial agents with the ability to kill a broad spectrum of pathogens, including bacteria and fungi with or without drug resistance. IMPORTANCE Over the past 2 decades, more than 20 new infectious diseases have emerged. Unfortunately, novel antimicrobial therapeutics are discovered at much lower rates. Infections caused by resistant microorganisms often fail to respond to conventional treatment, resulting in prolonged illness, greater risk of death, and high health care costs. Currently, this is best seen with the lack of a cure for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To combat such untreatable microorganisms, there is an urgent need to discover new classes of antimicrobial agents. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) plays an important role in host defense. The difficulty of producing MPO on a large scale hinders its study and utilization. We have produced recombinant MPO at a large scale and have characterized its antimicrobial activities. Most importantly, recombinant MPO significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality of murine pneumonia induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Our data suggest that recombinant MPO from human cells is a new class of antimicrobials with a broad spectrum of activity.","output":"Recombinant Myeloperoxidase as a New Class of Antimicrobial Agents"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In April 2020, artists Isabel Burr Raty, Louise Mackenzie, Robertina ?ebjani? and Karolina ?yniewicz were invited by Dalila Honorato to develop research on the theme of Staying in Touch: post-coronavirus art curating as part of the collaborative digital art residency Braiding Friction Working remotely across Slovenia, the UK, Poland, Belgium, Greece, USA and Portugal the group developed a speculative fiction in which art is the virus and art practitioners act as frontline workers Braiding historical and contemporary art, architectural and bio-art practices, the group developed potential futures for post-pandemic art spaces, resulting in a fictional account of a series of art exhibitions that coincide with a pandemic event The research was synthesised in the form of a pseudo-documentary premiered by the Creative Europe project BioFriction on 23rd July 2020 This article presents the transcript of the pseudo-documentary Staying in Touch (Honorato, Mackenzie, ?yniewicz, Burr Raty, ?ebjani? and Tavares 2020, 00:00:00 to 00:47:55), set in 2039: an ergodic narrative constructed as a self-ethnographic role-playing exercise by its contributors, where alter-egos Vess L, Arri Val, K-130, Soladite Carnelian and Anise Neuchatel reflect on their curatorial practices before, during and after the pandemic Whilst the narrative draws from many academic and contemporary influences, any references to historical events, real people or real locales are used fictitiously Other names, characters, places or incidents are the product of the authors imagination, and any resemblance to actual events or locales or persons, living or dead, is entirely coincidental Staying in Touch was edited by Pavel Tavares with the support of Cultivamos Cultura and included cameo appearances by artists Marta de Menezes, Yann Marussich and Adam Zaretsky At its core, this work is a case study of artistic research and the possibilities of interactive engagement during the COVID-19 lockdown ? 2021, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya All rights reserved","output":"Staying in touch: Case study of artistic research during the COVID-19 lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND For a long time, DC conductance has been the most important parameter in electrodermal routine measurements. However, DC current flow polarizes the electrodes, electrolyzes the skin, disturbs the measurement of conductance by possible varying electromotive forces (EMFs) in the circuit, and impedes the registration of the skin endosomatic DC potential. METHODS We therefore present a measuring system where DC current was replaced by a small AC current in a monopolar system, enabling the DC potential and AC conductance to be measured simultaneously at the same skin site. RESULTS We have also found examples of skin potential (SP) response waveforms with diphasic sharp edges not appearing in the conductance waveforms. The potential responses were found to be more robust with respect to movement artifacts, and the instrumentation could discern whether the indifferent electrode actually was on an inactive skin site.

We aimed to describe the clinical epidemiology and associated risk factors for RVIs among symptomatic preterm infants 32 weeks up to 2 years of life. METHODS: We performed a data linkage analysis of clinical and hospital laboratory databases for preterm infants born at KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, Singapore, from 2005 to 2015. RVI episodes during initial admission and subsequent hospital readmissions were included. RESULTS: Of 1854 infants in the study, 270 (14.5%) infants were diagnosed with at least 1 RVI. A total of 285 (85.3%) episodes were diagnosed postdischarge, with the highest risk for RVIs being from 3 to 5 months of age. The incidence of RVI in this population was 116 per 1000 infant-years and respiratory syncytial virus was the main overall causative pathogen. Infants with RVIs were more likely to be born at 27 weeks gestational age (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2C2.3), to have received postnatal steroids (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.0C2.1), and to be diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2C2.4). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of RVIs is high in preterm infants in the tropics, affecting >1 of 10 infants born at 32 weeks gestation before 2 years of age.

Group-based Pain Management Programs have been viewed as significant treatments aiding patients with self-management of chronic pain. The onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the beginning of 2020, widely eliminated the in-person Group-based Pain Management Programs. The exploration of therapeutic contextual factors such as the therapeutic alliance and group dynamics in telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs appears warranted for which reason the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was developed. METHODS The therapeutic alliance and group dynamics items in the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire were developed from an extensive literature review and underwent examination of content validity, internal consistency, reliability, and validity through telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs. RESULTS Content validity of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was established in five separate stages and the psychometrics of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire was found to be very good with high internal consistency and reliability (r = 0.85-0.97) and the ability of the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire to differentiate between high and low scorers on the SF-36 emotional well-being measure. DISCUSSION The examination of therapeutic contextual factors via telehealth Group-based Pain Management Programs using the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire appears possible in view of the very good psychometric properties described above. Investigation of therapeutic contextual factors through the Therapeutic Group Context Questionnaire may provide greater insight into the role that these factors may have in telehealth programs and their impact on pain outcomes.

However, the recurrence risk after embolization mandates closer follow-up than surgical clip ligation. Currently, there is no reliable system for predicting aneurysm sac thrombosis. An aneurysm embolization grade (AEG) reported previously by the senior author (EMD) has been proposed as a tool for predicting the durability of aneurysm occlusion based on hemodynamic characteristics. Here, we present our internal validity results. METHODS AEG and Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) scores were prospectively assigned to all aneurysms coiled from June 2008 to June 2011. The prospectively assigned AEG and RROC scores from the cerebral angiograms were collected for data analysis and validity assessment of the AEG system. 110 consecutive patients who had aneurysm coil embolization were included in this study. RESULTS The post-coiling AEG significantly predicted follow-up angiographic filling characteristics. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the follow-up AEG for those initially scored 'A' (complete obliteration) was significantly better than the contrast-flow groups. Significant differences were also noted between contrast-stasis and contrast-flow groups. A pairwise comparison between RROC scores demonstrated that only the RROC Type 1 could be used to predict follow-up occlusion durability. Stent placement in wide-neck aneurysms had no effect on initial AEG, RROC, or long-term occlusion durability. Packing density significantly predicted initial AEG and RROC, but had no effect on long-term occlusion. CONCLUSIONS The AEG system is uniquely based on angiographic filling characteristics of the aneurysm, and this study demonstrated its high predictive value for determining aneurysm sac thrombosis. Assigning an AEG to the aneurysm can guide the neurointerventionalist in discussions with the patient regarding the probability of aneurysm recurrence and potential need for retreatment.","output":"Aneurysm embolization grade: a predictive tool for aneurysm recurrence after coil embolization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We study the estimation and prediction of the risk measure Value at Risk for cryptocurrencies.

The World Health Organization, as well as several other national agencies, are still working on different clinical approaches to implement the most relevant treatment in MERS-CoV infection. We compared innate and adaptive immune responses of two patients infected with MERS-CoV to understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the response and propose potential therapeutic approaches. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) of the first week and sera of the first month from the two patients were used in this study. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) was performed after extraction of RNA from BAL cells of MERS-CoV infected patients and control patients. BAL supernatants and sera were used to assess cytokines and chemokines secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The first patient died rapidly after 3 weeks in the intensive care unit, the second patient still recovers from infection. The patient with a poor outcome (patient 1), compared to patient 2, did not promote type-1 Interferon (IFN), and particularly IFN, in response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) from MERS-CoV. The absence of IFN, known to promote antigen presentation in response to viruses, impairs the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response. This response is mediated by IL-12 and IFN that decreases viral clearance; levels of both of these mediators were decreased in patient 1. Finally, we confirm previous in vitro findings that MERS-CoV can drive IL-17 production in humans. Host recognition of viral dsRNA determines outcome in the early stage of MERS-CoV infection.

AIMS The integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship of sevoflurane in both adults and children was reviewed using compartment models. We wished to delineate age-related changes in both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. METHODS The bispectral index and sevoflurane endtidal concentration were continuously measured in 50 patients, aged 3-71 years, scheduled for minor surgery. During maintenance of anesthesia and after stable bispectral index values of 60-65 were obtained, the inspired concentration of sevoflurane was increased to 5 vol % for 5 minutes or until BIS 40 and then decreased. Data were analyzed using mammillary compartments with nonlinear mixed effects population modeling. The covariate effects of age and size were investigated. RESULTS A three-compartment PK model adequately described sevoflurane pharmacokinetics. Size standardization using allometry explained clearance and volume changes with age. The equilibration half-time (1.48 minutes) increased with age, but could be predicted using allometry in those under 40 years. The effect site concentration eliciting half the maximum response at age 40 years was 1.3% (95%CI 1.22, 1.42) decreased with age from 1.6% at 3 years to 1.1% at 70 years.

However, the roles of pyroptosis-related (PR) genes (PRGs) in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) remain elusive. In the present study, we constructed a novel PR risk signature through the lasso regression analysis. The risk signature was greatly conducive to PAAD prognostic assessment. PR risk score was identified as an independent prognostic factor and could distinguish the prognostic differences of most clinical subgroups. Meanwhile, it could improve the traditional prognostic models based on TNM-staging. Next, its prognostic value was also tested in five validation cohorts. Using CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA algorithms, the effects of PR risk signature on tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) were explored. High PR risk suppressed antitumor immune through decreasing the infiltrating levels of CD8 T and NK cells. The genomic information and histological expression of risk PRGs were uncovered by USCA and HPA databases. Somatic mutation, methylation alteration, and homozygous CNV of eight PRGs barely occurred in PAAD samples. As for therapeutic correlation, PR risk score may not predict the efficacy of PD-1/L1 inhibitors and was weakly associated with multiple drug susceptibilities. Finally, the biofunctions of toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) in pancreatic cancer (PC) cells were investigated through qPCR, MTT, colony formation, and Transwell assays.

Although recent semi-supervised learning algorithms may alleviate the problem of annotation scarcity, limited real-world CT images still cause those algorithms producing inaccurate detection results, especially in real-world COVID-19 cases. Existing models often cannot detect the small infected regions in COVID-19 CT images, such a challenge implicitly causes that many patients with minor symptoms are misdiagnosed and develop more severe symptoms, causing a higher mortality. In this paper, we propose a new method to address this challenge. Not only can we detect severe cases, but also detect minor symptoms using real-world COVID-19 CT images in which the source domain only includes limited labeled CT images but the target domain has a lot of unlabeled CT images. Specifically, we adopt Network-in-Network and Instance Normalization to build a new module (we term it NI module) and extract discriminative representations from CT images from both source and target domains. A domain classifier is utilized to implement infected region adaptation from source domain to target domain in an Adversarial Learning manner, and learns domain-invariant region proposal network (RPN) in the Faster R-CNN model.

Mortality in the preceding year or years is used to calculate the expected number of deaths, which is then compared with the actual number of deaths in 2020. We calculated weekly age- and sex-specific mortality rates for 93.1% of the Italian municipalities for the years 2015-2019 and for the first 26 weeks in 2020. We assumed the mortality experience during 2015-2019 as the reference period to calculate standardised mortality ratios. Furthermore, in order to compare the mortality experience of males and females, we calculated sex- and age- specific weekly direct standardised mortality rates and differences between the observed and expected number of deaths. We observed considerable changes in the demographics in the Italian population between the years 2015 and 2020, particularly among people 60 years and older and among males. The population is aging and the proportion of elderly males has increased, which was not reflected adequately in previous estimates of excess mortality. Standardized excess mortality results show that in Italy between the 8th and 26th weeks in 2020, there were 33,035 excess deaths, which is only 643 fewer deaths than the official COVID-19 death toll for this time period. A comparative increase in the mortality rates was observed in March among both sexes, but particularly for males. Comparisons with recently published data show considerably higher excess deaths, but these data were either not covering the complete country or did not account for age and sex. Neglecting the demographic changes in a region, even over a short time span, can result in biased estimates.","output":"Gender specific excess mortality in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic accounting for age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has motivated a myriad of studies and proposals on how economic policy should respond to this colossal shock. But in this debate it is seldom recognized that the health shock is not entirely exogenous. Its magnitude and dynamics themselves depend on economic policies, and the explicit or implicit incentives those policies provide. To illuminate the feedback loops between medical and economic factors we develop a minimal economic model of pandemics. In the model, as in reality, individual decisions to comply (or not) with virus-related public health directives depend on economic variables and incentives, which themselves respond to current economic policy and expectations of future policies. The analysis yields several practical lessons: because policies affect the speed of virus transmission via incentives, public health measures and economic policies can complement each other, reducing the cost of attaining desired social goals;expectations of expansionary macroeconomic policies during the recovery phase can help reduce the speed of infection, and hence the size of the health shock;the credibility of announced policies is key to rule out both self-fulfilling pessimistic expectations and time inconsistency problems. The analysis also yields a critique of the current use of SIR models for policy evaluation, in the spirit of Lucas (1983).","output":"Economic policy incentives to preserve lives and livelihoods"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The application of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) to intermediate-risk patients is a controversial issue. Of concern, neurological injury in this group remains poorly defined. Among high-risk and inoperable patients, subclinical injury is reported on average in 75% undergoing the procedure. Although this attendant risk may be acceptable in higher-risk patients, it may not be so in those of lower risk. METHODS AND RESULTS Forty patients undergoing TAVI with the Edwards SAPIEN-XT? prosthesis were prospectively studied. Patients were of intermediate surgical risk, with a meanstandard deviation Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.12.5% and a EuroSCORE II of 4.82.4%; participant age was 827 years. Clinically apparent injury was assessed by serial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale assessments, Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA), and with the Confusion Assessment Method. These identified 1 (2.5%) minor stroke, 1 (2.5%) episode of postoperative delirium, and 2 patients (5%) with significant postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Subclinical neurological injury was assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences preprocedure and at 31 days postprocedure. This identified 68 new DWI lesions present in 60% of participants, with a medianinterquartile range of 13 lesions/patient and volumes of infarction of 2419 L/lesion and 89218 L/patient. DWI lesions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in early cognition (mean MoCA -3.51.7) without effect on cognition, quality of life, or functional capacity at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Objectively measured subclinical neurological injuries remain a concern in intermediate-risk patients undergoing TAVI and are likely to manifest with early neurocognitive changes.

We assessed performance and safety of induced sputum (IS) collection in this population, embedded in a prospective study evaluating respiratory cryptosporidiosis in Malawian children with diarrheal disease. Methods We assessed sputum quality and correlation with detection of cryptosporidium, and evaluated safety and adverse events in 162 children. Results Among 159 stool specimens tested, 34 (21%, 95% CI 15.0 - 28%) were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. There were 160 IS and 161 nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens collected. The majority of IS specimens 122/147 (83%) were clear in appearance, and 132/147 (90%) were of good quality. Among the respiratory specimens tested, 10 (6.3%, 95% CI 2.5 - 10) IS and 4 (3% (95% CI 0 - 5)) NP were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. When stool cryptosporidium PCR was the gold standard, IS PCR sensitivity was higher (29 %, 95% CI 22 - 37) compared to NP PCR (12%, 95% CI 7 - 17) for detection of Cryptosporidium spp. One (0.4%) adverse event occurred, a drop in oxygen saturations at 30-minute post procedure evaluation. Consciousness - level, median respiratory rate and oxygen saturations were unchanged, before or after IS. Conclusions IS provides good quality specimens, is more sensitive than NP specimens for diagnosis of respiratory cryptosporidiosis, and collection can be done safely in children hospitalized with diarrheal disease.","output":"Performance and safety of induced sputum procedure in young children in Malawi: a prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this Letter to the Editor supportive data were presented to a recent paper published in this journal reporting the involvement of TRP channels in COVID-19 pneumonia and its role for new therapies. Since gene expression of TRP channels was found in human lung tissues the protein was not being reported so far. TRP channels are supposed to be involved in the pulmonary inflammation and its symptoms such as fever, cough and others. Here, TRPC6 was investigated in tissues of normal human lungs and of SARS-Cov-2 infected lungs in a preliminary study. Tissue was obtained post mortem from anatomical body donations during dissections and during pathological dissections (13 normal, 4 COVID-19 pneumoniae) and processed for immunohistochemistry. In normal lungs TRPC6 was found in the ciliated epithelium, in the wall of larger lung vessels and in the alveolar septa. In COVID-19 pneumonia the distribution of TRPC6 was different. Inflammatory lesions, cellular infiltrates, hyaline membranes and fibrosis were labelled intensively as well as dilated capillaries. These observations are from four patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.The observations do not elucidate the molecular mechanisms but support the view that TRPC6 channels are involved in normal physiology of normal human lungs and in COVID-19 pneumonia.

However, little is known about the epidemic dynamics in different age groups during these periods. We used the daily number of coronavirus 2019 cases (by date of symptom onset) reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance Network among individuals aged 15C19 years through 65C69 years. For each age group g, we computed the proportion PrE(g) of individuals in age group g among all reported cases aged 15C69 years during the pre-lockdown period (1?10 March 2020) and the corresponding proportion PrL(g) during two lockdown periods (initial: 25 March?3 April; strengthened: 8C17 April 2020). For each lockdown period, we computed the proportion ratios PR(g) = PrL(g)/PrE(g). For each pair of age groups g(1), g(2), PR(g(1))>PR(g(2)) implies a relative increase in the incidence of detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in the age group g(1) compared with g(2) for the lockdown period vs. the pre-lockdown period. For the initial lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 50C54 years (PR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.12,1.30) and 55C59 years (PR = 1.19; 1.11,1.27). For the second lockdown period, the highest PR values were in age groups 15C19 years (PR = 1.26; 0.95,1.68) and 50C54 years (PR = 1.20; 1.09,1.31). Our results suggest that different outbreak control measures led to different changes in the relative incidence by age group. During the initial lockdown period, when non-essential work was allowed, individuals aged 40C64 years, particularly those aged 50C59 years, had a higher relative incidence compared with the pre-lockdown period. Younger adults/older adolescents had an increased relative incidence during the later, strengthened lockdown.

Chronic Mg deficiency may result in increased oxidative stress and low-grade inflammation, which may be linked to several age-related diseases, including higher predisposition to infectious diseases. Mg might play a role in the immune response being a cofactor for immunoglobulin synthesis and other processes strictly associated with the function of T and B cells. Mg is necessary for the biosynthesis, transport, and activation of vitamin D, another key factor in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. The regulation of cytosolic free Mg in immune cells involves Mg transport systems, such as the melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 channel, the solute carrier family, and the magnesium transporter 1 (MAGT1). The functional importance of Mg transport in immunity was unknown until the description of the primary immunodeficiency XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with Mg defect, EpsteinCBarr virus infection, and neoplasia) due to a genetic deficiency of MAGT1 characterized by chronic EpsteinCBarr virus infection. This and other research reporting associations of Mg deficit with viral and bacterial infections indicate a possible role of Mg deficit in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its complications.

The World Health Organization has issued public advice to create awareness by providing people knowledge to prevent/protect them from COVID-19. Hence, the present study was planned to assess knowledge of prevention and its practical use amongst samples from the Saudi Arabian population. It can be used to bring awareness among the masses not only in expanding their knowledge about COVID-19 but also on how to enforce a practicing behavior in relation to the prevention of COVID-19. The study is among the pioneer studies on the issue related to knowledge and practice of the prevention of COVID-19 among Saudis and foreign nationals residing in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVE: The prime objective of this study is to examine the existence of knowledge among the Saudi and non-Saudi nationals about COVID-19 and its impact on their behavior to practice the protocols to prevent the disastrous infection of COVID-19. This study has also examined how the residents in Saudi Arabia react to the methods and protection measures adopted by the government for their dominions to eradicate the spread of COVID-19. METHODS: The study used a survey-based methodology and data was collected from Saudi nationals as well as expatriates living and working in five different regions of Saudi Arabia. Non-probability snowball sampling was used to reach and select the population of the current study. A self-designed, structured, and validated questionnaire was electronically distributed among the respondents. SPSS version 21 was used to analyze the data of the current study. RESULTS: Out of the 443 respondents, 356 respondents (84%) knew they had to wash their hands for 20 seconds and did this as well, 303 respondents (75%) knew that sneezing or coughing into the arm/elbow can prevent the spread of COVID-19 and were doing this as well, 357 respondents (82%) knew that COVID-19 can be transferred by shaking hands and avoided this, 333 respondents (79%) knew that they had to maintain a safe distance of at least one meter and kept this distance, 315 respondents (76%) knew that touching one's face can transfer the virus and avoid this, and 414 respondents (95%) knew that staying at home can decrease the chances of getting infected. The relationship between different regions and most of the knowledge-based and practice-based questions was significant (pa??<a??0.05). CONCLUSION: Results reveal that there is a significant relationship between knowledge and practice, but the strength of association is weak. It was found that knowledge and practice of COVID-19 was followed differently in the five regions of Saudi Arabia and the level of education of the respondents influenced their choice of practice to protect themselves from the effects of COVID-19. The study has contributed in the body of literature by examining the inter-relationship between knowledge and practice and their use in prevention of COVID-19 among the Saudi population.","output":"Knowledge and practice regarding prevention of COVID-19 among the Saudi Arabian population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To discuss the learning curve of laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy (LADG) with lymph node dissection and the oncological results and long-term outcomes of different periods in the learning stage. PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred twenty-four patients with gastric cancer who received LADG with lymph node dissection from January 2004 to December 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. They were divided into three groups (A-C) according to different operative date: 41 were in Group A (early), 41 in Group B (middle), and 42 in Group C (laer). There were no significant statistical differences among the three groups with respect to age, gender, early/advanced gastric cancer, Union for International Cancer Control stage, and lymph node dissection. Then the following items were compared in these groups: operative time, blood loss, number of lymph nodes harvested, postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and long-term survival. RESULTS The operative time in Group A (235.050.3 minutes) was significantly longer than in Groups B (201.739.6 minutes) and C (199.044.7 minutes), but there was no significant difference between Groups B and C.

This study explores resident and faculty perceptions regarding the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on technical skill decay of surgical and anesthesia residents. We hypothesized that many residents perceived that their technical abilities diminished due to a short period of interruption in their training. DESIGN: An IRB-exempt, web-based cross-sectional survey distributed to residents and faculty SETTING: Two large academic tertiary medical centers, North Shore University Hospital and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, of the Northwell Health System in New York. PARTICIPANTS: General surgery, anesthesiology, plastic surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, orthopedic surgery, oral maxillofacial surgery, urology, podiatry residents and faculty. RESULTS: All residents reported a significant impact on their training. Residents (82%) and faculty (94%) reported a significant reduction in case volumes due to the COVID pandemic (p<0.05). 64% of residents reported a reduction in technical skills, and 75% of faculty perceived a decrease in resident technical skills. Residents were concerned about fulfilling ACGME case requirements, however faculty were more optimistic that residents would achieve level-appropriate proficiency by the conclusion of their training. Both residents and faculty felt that resident critical care skills improved as a result of redeployment to COVID-19 intensive care units (66% and 94%). Additionally, residents reported increased confidence in their ability to care for critically ill patients and positive impact on professional competencies. CONCLUSIONS: Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on residency training are multi-dimensional. The majority of surgical and anesthesia residents perceived that their technical ability diminished as a result of skill decay, whereas other skillsets improved.

In the first 24 hours, she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for severe respiratory failure and positive protein chain reaction-PCR in nasal exudate. She needed intubation for ten days. In the first 48 hours outside the ICU, she developed an acute confusional syndrome (hyperactive delirium). Neurological examination showed temporal-spatial disorientation and incoherent fluent speech. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized hypovoltaic activity. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed a bilateral and symmetrical increase in the supratentorial white matter's signal intensity, with a discrete thickening of both temporal lobes, with a slight increase in signal intensity and a sequence of normal diffusion. The lumbar puncture showed no changes (glucose 71 mg/dL, protein 30 mg/dL, 1 leukocyte). Within 72 hours of starting symptoms, she was neurologically asymptomatic. Our final diagnosis was an inflammatory encephalopathy related to a SARS-CoV2 infection.","output":"Encephalopathy in severe SARS-CoV2 infection: Inflammatory or infectious?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Several models have been developed to predict mortality in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but only a few have demonstrated enough discriminatory capacity. Machine learning algorithms represent a novel approach for the data-driven prediction of clinical outcomes with advantages over statistical modeling. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based score-the Piacenza score-for 30-day mortality prediction in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: The study comprised 852 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, admitted to the Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital in Italy from February to November 2020. Patients' medical history, demographics, and clinical data were collected using an electronic health record. The overall patient data set was randomly split into derivation and test cohorts. The score was obtained through the na?ve Bayes classifier and externally validated on 86 patients admitted to Centro Cardiologico Monzino (Italy) in February 2020. Using a forward-search algorithm, 6 features were identified: age, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, temperature, previous stroke, and gender. The Brier index was used to evaluate the ability of the machine learning model to stratify and predict the observed outcomes. A user-friendly website was designed and developed to enable fast and easy use of the tool by physicians. Regarding the customization properties of the Piacenza score, we added a tailored version of the algorithm to the website, which enables an optimized computation of the mortality risk score for a patient when some of the variables used by the Piacenza score are not available. In this case, the na?ve Bayes classifier is retrained over the same derivation cohort but using a different set of patient characteristics. We also compared the Piacenza score with the 4C score and with a na?ve Bayes algorithm with 14 features chosen a priori. RESULTS: The Piacenza score exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95% CI 0.74-0.84, Brier score=0.19) in the internal validation cohort and 0.79 (95% CI 0.68-0.89, Brier score=0.16) in the external validation cohort, showing a comparable accuracy with respect to the 4C score and to the na?ve Bayes model with a priori chosen features; this achieved an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83, Brier score=0.26) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.86, Brier score=0.17), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that a customizable machine learning-based score with a purely data-driven selection of features is feasible and effective for the prediction of mortality among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.","output":"A Machine Learning Approach for Mortality Prediction in COVID-19 Pneumonia: Development and Evaluation of the Piacenza Score"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This studys aim is to investigate the role of e-governance in combating COVID-19 by integrating the implications of the ChinaCPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Animal data and human studies have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase the expression of ACE2. ACE2 is an enzyme found in the heart, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and lung and is a coreceptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2), the virus responsible for COVID-19. Therefore, one can speculate that discontinuing ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy may lead to decreased ACE2 expression, thereby attenuating the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, and mitigating the disease progression of COVID-19. However, several studies have also shown that ACE2 exhibits reno- and cardioprotection and preserves lung function in acute respiratory distress syndrome, which would favor ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy. This article is to examine and summarize the 2 opposing viewpoints and provide guideline recommendations to support the use or discontinuation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with COVID-19.","output":"Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers in Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019: Friend or Foe?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research question: The COVID-19 pandemic created a crisis rife with complexity and ethical dilemmas for sport organizations.

Suboptimal care of a patient in our emergency department (ED) needing IHT to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) identified improvement opportunities. We describe implementing a novel checklist (Briefing ED-to-ICU Transport To Exit Ready: BETTER) for improving the IHT safety of pediatric ED patients admitted to the pediatric ICU. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team used the Model for Improvement to create a key driver diagram and process map. An evidence-based IHT checklist was implemented on July 23, 2019 after multiple plan-do-study-act checklist revisions. The specific aim was a 80% checklist completion rate for 6 months and maintaining that rate for 6 months. An anonymous, voluntary survey of ED nurses and physicians, 9 months postimplementation, evaluated perceived improvements in IHT safety. The outcome measure was the proportion of IHT-related incident reports, per ED-to-pediatric ICU admission, comparing baseline (2-year preimplementation) and intervention (1-year postimplementation) periods. Balancing measures included a quantitative assessment for any throughput measure delays and a survey question on perceived delays. RESULTS: From July 23, 2019 to July 22, 2020, 335 (84%) of 400 ED-to-ICU admissions had completed IHT checklists. Ninety percent of survey respondents (84% response rate) agreed that the checklist improved IHT safety. The incident report rate was lower in the intervention period (0.5% versus 2.3%; P = 0.03), with special cause improvement on T-chart analysis. Balancing measures did not indicate any delays secondary to checklist implementation.

METHODS DVT evaluation was performed by noninvasive venous ultrasonography. We retrospectively reviewed 88 Japanese patients (88 knees) receiving primary unilateral TKA, who had no preoperative DVT. We examined the influence of the following four factors on postoperative DVT: (1) patient factors (age, sex, body height, body weight, and body mass index), (2) surgical factors (operation time, bleeding amount, avascularization time, and anesthesia method), (3) postoperative factors (bleeding amount, period to ambulation, period of venous foot pump use, and ratio of graduated compression stocking use), and (4) DVT conditional factors (location, length, number of vein branches, and the presence of >5 mm vasodilatation). RESULTS The total prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was 62.5% (55 of the 88 patients). Among the 55 VTE patients, the rates of distal and proximal DVT were 96.4% and 3.6%, respectively. Bilateral DVT was found in 34.5%, while unilateral DVT on the surgical and nonsurgical sides were 52.7% and 12.7%, respectively. Asymptomatic pulmonary embolism was 1.8%. DVT was exacerbated in five patients (11.9%), of whom three showed additional thrombus formation. The remaining two patients had thrombus elongation or propagation from distal to proximal veins. In comparisons between thrombus-unresolved and -resolved groups within the sixth postoperative month, statistical significances were found in the incidence of bilateral DVT (50.0% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.02) and unilateral DVT (43.8% vs. 76.9%, p = 0.02). On the other hand, operation time (107.0  17.3 min vs. 94.5  11.9 min, p = 0.01) and avascularization time (99.8  17.6 min vs. 88.0  11.5 min, p = 0.01) in bilateral DVT patients were significantly longer than in unilateral ones.

The objectives of this online survey that included both national and international families were to capture changes in access to healthcare and educational services for individuals with IDDs that occurred shortly after restrictions were initiated and to survey families on resources that could improve services for these individuals. METHODS This was an online survey for caregivers of individuals with (1) a genetic diagnosis and (2) a neurodevelopmental diagnosis, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder or epilepsy. The survey assessed (1) demographics, (2) changes in access to educational and healthcare services and (3) available and preferred resources to help families navigate the changes in service allocation. RESULTS Of the 818 responses (669 within the USA and 149 outside of the USA), most families reported a loss of at least some educational or healthcare services. Seventy-four per cent of parents reported that their child lost access to at least one therapy or education service, and 36% of respondents lost access to a healthcare provider. Only 56% reported that their child received at least some continued services through tele-education. Those that needed to access healthcare providers did so primarily through telemedicine. Telehealth (both tele-education and telemedicine) was reported to be helpful when available, and caregivers most often endorsed a need for an augmentation of these remote delivery services, such as 1:1 videoconference sessions, as well as increased access to 1:1 aides in the home.

This chapter discusses various nonparenteral routes of administration. The oral route of administration is the most preferred and patient compliant method of them all. Transdermal, buccal, and pulmonary routes are also discussed. We have developed novel technologies using nanoparticles and microparticles to deliver vaccines by the oral and transdermal route of administration. These new technologies enable the formulation of vaccine particles containing vaccine antigens, without loss of their biological activity during the formulation process. Also, multiple antigens, targeting ligands and adjuvants can all be encapsulated within the same particle. When administered orally, these particles are designed to withstand the acidic environment of the stomach and are targeted to the Peyers patches and the gut-associated mucosal immune system. Because these vaccines are particulate in nature, they are readily taken up by phagocytic antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as M cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the Peyers patches of the intestines, resulting in a strong immune response and antibody production. Of particular interest is the fact that the particles release the antigen in a slow and sustained manner over a prolonged time period, intracellularly into APCs, resulting in strong mucosal and systemic immunity after oral administration, without the need for added adjuvants that are typically present in current vaccine preparations. Because no needles are required for oral vaccines, this method of vaccine delivery is inexpensive and suitable for mass vaccination in the developing world as well as for the developed world. This chapter discusses studies conducted on a wide array of vaccines, including infectious disease vaccines and cancer vaccines. This method of vaccine delivery enables the delivery of a wide spectrum of vaccines for prophylactic and therapeutic use, including oral and transdermal vaccines for cancer such as human papillomavirus, melanoma, ovarian, breast, and prostate with encouraging results.

We aimed to evaluate the potential interventions against COVID-19 from the socioeconomic perspective, including improvement in education and intelligence. Methods: With a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach using summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis, univariable analysis was adopted to evaluate the total causal effects of genetically determined education attainment and intelligence on COVID-19 outcomes. Multivariable analysis was performed to dissect the potential mechanisms. Results: Genetic predisposition to higher education attainment by 1 SD (4.2 years) was independently associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 severity (OR = 0.508 [95% CI: 0.417C0.617]; p < 0.001). Genetically higher education attainment also lowered the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (0.685 [0.593C0.791]; p < 0.001), but the association was attenuated after adjustment for beta estimates of intelligence in multivariable analysis. Genetically higher intelligence was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization (0.780 [0.655C0.930]; p = 0.006), with attenuation of association after adjustment for education attainment. Null association was observed for genetically determined education attainment and intelligence with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: Education may act independently and jointly with intelligence in improving the COVID-19 outcomes. Improving education may potentially alleviate the COVID-19-related health inequality.","output":"Education Attainment, Intelligence and COVID-19: A Mendelian Randomization Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare prevalence and risk factors of somatization (SOM) between health care workers and non-health care workers during COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: From 14 February to 29 March 2020, an online survey was performed in both 605 health care workers and 1151 non-health care workers. Based on the somatization dimension score of the Symptom Checklist-90, participants were divided into non-SOM group and SOM group. RESULTS: Health care workers had higher prevalence rate of SOM (p < 0.001) than non-health care workers, with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.22C2.36, p = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in non-health care workers, the risk factors of SOM included other ethnicities, insomnia, and suicide, while in health care workers, the risk factors included working 6C8 h per day, and working 10 h per day during COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that both non-health care workers and health care workers have a relatively high prevalence of somatization. However, the related factors for somatization in both groups are significantly different, showing that medical service-related factors are associated with somatization in health care workers, while demographic and clinical factors are associated with somatization in non-health care workers.","output":"Comparison of prevalence and risk factors of somatization between Chinese health care workers and non-health care workers during COVID-19 outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The health workforce is an integral component of the healthcare system. Comprehensive, high-quality data on the health workforce are essential to identifying gaps in health service provision, as well as informing future health workforce and health services planning, and health policy. While many data sources are used in Australia for these purposes, the quality of the data sources with respect to relevance, accessibility and accuracy is not clear. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review aims to identify and appraise publicly available data sources describing the Australian health workforce. The review will include any data source (eg, registry, administrative database and survey) or document reporting a data source (eg, journal article, report) on the Australian health workforce, which is publicly available and describes the characteristics of the workforce. The search will be conducted in 10 bibliographic databases and the grey literature using an iterative process. Screening of titles and abstracts will be undertaken by two investigators, independently, using Covidence software. Any disagreement between investigators will be resolved by a third investigator. Documents/data sources identified as potentially eligible will be retrieved in full text and reviewed following the same process. Data will be extracted using a customised data extraction tool. A customised appraisal tool will be used to assess the relevance, accessibility and accuracy of included data sources. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The scoping review is a secondary analysis of existing, publicly available data sources and does not require ethics approval. The findings of this scoping review will further our understanding of the quality and availability of data sources used for health workforce and health services planning in Australia. The results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences targeted at health workforce and public health topics.","output":"Availability and quality of publicly available health workforce data sources in Australia: a scoping review protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Genetic disposition is considered critical for identifying subjects at high risk for disease development. Investigating disease-causing and high and low expressed genes can support finding the root causes of uncertainties in patient care. However, independent and timely high-throughput next-generation sequencing data analysis is still a challenge for non-computational biologists and geneticists. RESULTS: In this manuscript, we present a findable, accessible, interactive, and reusable (FAIR) bioinformatics platform, i.e., GVViZ (visualizing genes with disease-causing variants). GVViZ is a user-friendly, cross-platform, and database application for RNA-seq-driven variable and complex gene-disease data annotation and expression analysis with a dynamic heat map visualization. GVViZ has the potential to find patterns across millions of features and extract actionable information, which can support the early detection of complex disorders and the development of new therapies for personalized patient care. The execution of GVViZ is based on a set of simple instructions that users without a computational background can follow to design and perform customized data analysis. It can assimilate patients transcriptomics data with the public, proprietary, and our in-house developed gene-disease databases to query, easily explore, and access information on gene annotation and classified disease phenotypes with greater visibility and customization. To test its performance and understand the clinical and scientific impact of GVViZ, we present GVViZ analysis for different chronic diseases and conditions, including Alzheimers disease, arthritis, asthma, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis, and multiple cancer disorders. The results are visualized using GVViZ and can be exported as image (PNF/TIFF) and text (CSV) files that include gene names, Ensembl (ENSG) IDs, quantified abundances, expressed transcript lengths, and annotated oncology and non-oncology diseases. CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize that automated and interactive visualization should be an indispensable component of modern RNA-seq analysis, which is currently not the case. However, experts in clinics and researchers in life sciences can use GVViZ to visualize and interpret the transcriptomics data, making it a powerful tool to study the dynamics of gene expression and regulation. Furthermore, with successful deployment in clinical settings, GVViZ has the potential to enable high-throughput correlations between patient diagnoses based on clinical and transcriptomics data.

The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility of our evolution to a virtual format and report program attitudes toward the changes. METHODS: On March 15, 2020, due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) our institution restricted mass gatherings. We immediately transitioned all lectures to a virtual platform. The cancellation of elective surgeries in April 2020 then created the need for augmented resident education opportunities. We responded by creating additional lectures and implementing a daily conference itinerary. To evaluate the success of the changes and inform the development of future curriculum, we surveyed residents and faculty regarding the changes. Classes and faculty answers were compared for perception of value of the online format. RESULTS: Pre-COVID-19, residency-wide educational offerings were concentrated to one half-day per week. Once restrictions were in place, our educational opportunities were expanded to a daily schedule and averaged 16.5 hours/week during April. Overall, 41/63 residents and 25/94 faculty completed the survey. The majority of residents reported an increased ability (56%) or similar ability (34.1%) to attend virtual conferences while 9.9% indicated a decrease. Faculty responses indicated similar effects (64% increased, 32% similar, 4% decreased). PGY-1 residents rated the changes negatively compared to other trainees and faculty. PGY-2 residents reported neutral views and all other trainees and faculty believed the changes positively affected educational value. Comments from PGY1 and 2 residents revealed they could not focus on virtual conferences as it was not \\"protected time\\" in a classroom and that they felt responsible for patient care during virtual lectures. A majority of both residents (61%) and faculty (84%) reported they would prefer to continue virtual conferences in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The necessity for adapting our academic offerings during the COVID-19 era has afforded our program the opportunity to recognize the feasibility of virtual platforms and expand our educational offerings. The majority of participants report stable to improved attendance and educational value.

Specifically, we investigated predictors of personal self-protection (compliance to protect the self against infection) and group-protection behaviours (compliance for reasons of solidarity in protecting people in risk groups). Results indicate that self- and group-protection result from different psychological processes: Whereas personal self-protection seems to be a form of coping with personal anxieties (epistemic and existential needs, personal threat), group protection is an intergroup phenomenon that is enabled by identification with a collective goal (common identity), the perception that society is capable of dealing with the virus (group efficacy), and concern for people in risk groups.

Infrapopliteal (IP) occlusions are common in CLI, and successful limb salvage may require restoration of arterial flow in the distribution of a chronically occluded vessel. We sought to describe the procedural characteristics and outcomes of patients with IP occlusions who underwent endovascular intervention for treatment of CLI. METHODS All patients with IP interventions for treatment of CLI from 2006 to 2012 were included. Angiographic and procedural data were compared between patients who underwent intervention for IP occlusions vs IP stenosis. Restenosis was determined by Doppler ultrasound imaging. Limb salvage was the primary end point of the study. Additional end points included primary patency, primary assisted patency, secondary patency, occlusion crossing success, procedural success, and amputation-free survival. RESULTS A total of 187 patients with CLI underwent interventions for 356 IP lesions, and 77 patients (41%) had interventions for an IP occlusion. Patients with an intervention for IP occlusion were more likely to have zero to one vessel runoff (83% vs 56%; P < .001) compared with interventions for stenosis. Compared with IP stenoses, IP occlusions were longer (118  86 vs 73  67 mm; P < .001) and had a smaller vessel diameter (2.5  0.8 vs 2.7  0.5 mm; P = .02). Wire crossing was achieved in 83% of IP occlusions, and the overall procedural success for IP occlusions was 79%. The overall 1-year limb salvage rate was 84%. Limb salvage was highest in the stenosis group, slightly lower in the successful occlusion group, and lowest in the failed occlusion group (92% vs 75% vs 58%, respectively; P = .02). Unsuccessfully treated IP occlusions were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of major amputation (hazard ratio, 5.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.89-17.7) and major amputation or death (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-6.63).

This study examined emerging adults (N = 195, Mage = 20.58, SD = 3.98) multidimensional personality profiles in relation to the extent that they hold a positive outlook on their future at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quantitative and brief narrative measures of future outlook were collected. Hierarchical cluster analysis and Latent Profile Analysis revealed two clear personality profiles, labeled Reflectors (n = 106) and Forgers (n = 89). Forgers demonstrated robust personality characteristics indicative of psychologically pushing forward through pandemic-related challenges. Reflectors demonstrated more pandemic reactivity including higher stress but also more psychological integration of the pandemic experience into their sense of self. In terms of future outlook, Forgers reported a positive and expansive outlook on the future across multiple measures. In contrast, Reflectors held more negative, restricted views of what future life might hold.

However, quantitative research on medical oncology telehealth use shows conflicting results on patient satisfaction, whereas qualitative data are sparse. Our qualitative study aimed to identify the factors influencing patient acceptability of video visits for medical oncology care before and at the onset of the expansion of telehealth because of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between November 2019 and April 2020 with 20 patients who participated in a telehealth visit with a medical oncology provider at Thomas Jefferson University. RESULTS: Of the 20 participants, 13 (65%) were female and 15 (75%) were White, with a mean (standard deviation) age of 60.5 years (11.8). Patients identified convenience, anxiety, COVID-19, and provider preference as positively influencing the acceptability of video visits; however, some patients noted limitations in provider connection, physical examinations, and visit length as disadvantages. Regarding receipt of serious or bad news, some preferred video visits for privacy, immediacy of results, news processing, and family comfort. Others preferred in-person encounters for provider support and the ability to receive written information and in-person referrals. CONCLUSION: Patient-perceived factors influencing general acceptability, appropriateness of serious and bad news delivery, and future uses of telehealth were unique to each individual, but shared common themes.

In particular, there is still a lack of treatment strategies for the group of elderly and frail patients, who are frequently not capable of receiving standard therapy regimens. Despite comprising the majority of lung cancer patients, this group is underrepresented in clinical trials. This applies also to elderly and frail patients suffering from unresectable stage III NSCLC, who are unfit for chemotherapy, and, therefore, cannot receive the standard therapy comprising of radiochemotherapy and the recently approved subsequent durvalumab consolidation therapy. These patients often receive radiotherapy only, which raises the concern of undertreatment. The TRADE-hypo trial aims at optimizing treatment of this patient group by combining radiotherapy with concomitant durvalumab administration, thereby employing the immune-promoting effects of radiotherapy, and determining safety, feasibility, and efficacy of this treatment. METHODS/ DESIGN: In this prospective phase II clinical trial, durvalumab therapy will be combined with either conventionally fractionated (CON-group) or hypofractionated (HYPO-group) thoracic radiotherapy. A safety stop-and-go lead-in phase will assess safety of hypofractionated radiotherapy with respect to severe pneumonitis in small patient cohorts before opening full enrollment. Tumor tissue, blood and stool samples will be collected before and during the study period to investigate the immunological mechanisms responsible for checkpoint inhibitor efficacy and immune-promoting effects of radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Preclinical data suggests that irradiation-induced immunogenicity can be further increased if applied in a hypofractionated setting, potentially boosting the expected synergistic effect with immune checkpoint inhibition in restoring the immune anti-tumor response. If proven safe and efficient, a hypofractionated radiation schedule can provide a considerably more practicable option for the patient.

Explicit representations of genetic interactions often fail to capture complex interdependencies among genes, limiting the analytic power of such methods. Here we propose an extension of gene set enrichment analysis to a latent feature space reflecting PPI network topology, called gene set proximity analysis (GSPA). Compared with existing methods, GSPA provides improved ability to identify disease-associated pathways in disease-matched gene expression datasets, while improving reproducibility of enrichment statistics for similar gene sets. GSPA is statistically straightforward, reducing to classical gene set enrichment through a single user-defined parameter. We apply our method to identify novel drug associations with SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. Finally, we validate our drug association predictions through retrospective clinical analysis of claims data from 8 million patients, supporting a role for gabapentin as a risk factor and metformin as a protective factor for COVID-19 hospitalization.","output":"Gene set proximity analysis: expanding gene set enrichment analysis through learned geometric embeddings (preprint)/ en"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is currently a global threat to health and economies Therapeutics and vaccines are in rapid development;however, none of these therapeutics are considered as absolute cure, and the potential to mutate makes it necessary to find therapeutics that target a highly conserved regions of the viral structure Results: In this study, we characterized an essential but poorly understood coronavirus accessory X4 protein, a core and stable component of the SARS-CoV family Sequence analysis shows a conserved ~ 90% identity between the SARS-CoV-2 and previously characterized X4 protein in the database QMEAN Z score of the model protein shows a value of around 0 5, within the acceptable range 0C1 A MolProbity score of 2 96 was obtained for the model protein and indicates a good quality model The model has Ramachandran values of  = ? 57o and  = ? 47o for -helices and values of  = ? 130o and  = + 140o for twisted sheets Conclusions: The protein data obtained from this study provides robust information for further in vitro and in vivo experiment, targeted at devising therapeutics against the virus Phylogenetic analysis further supports previous evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 is positioned with the SL-CoVZC45, BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018B and the RS4231 Bat SARS-like corona viruses [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics is the property of Egyptian Society of Human Genetics and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus X4-like accessory protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic caused by COVID-19 affects our lives in all aspects.

Occupational and non-occupational potential predictors of disease were surveyed for the HCWs included in this study. Results: Among 1925 personnel in the hospital, 1732 were included to the study with the response rate of 90%. Overall seroprevalence was 15% at the end of 2020, before vaccinations started.

The rapid transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and its ability to spread in humans have prompted the development of new approaches for its treatment. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for life cycle propagation and Spike (S)-protein for attachment to the host cell surface receptors. The virus enters the human body with the assistance of a key functional host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 primed by transmembrane serine protease 2 which are putative targets for drug development.

The identification of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) challenged the preexisting paradigm of how inflammation ends. Rather than a passive process, the resolution of inflammation relies on the active production of SPMs, such as Lipoxins (Lx), Maresins, protectins, and Resolvins. LXA4 is an SPM that exerts its action through ALX/FPR2 receptor. Stable ALX/FPR2 agonists are required because SPMs can be quickly metabolized within tissues near the site of formation. BML-111 is a commercially available synthetic ALX/FPR2 receptor agonist with analgesic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Based on that, we aimed to determine the effect of BML-111 in a model of UVB-induced skin inflammation in hairless mice. We demonstrated that BML-111 ameliorates the signs of UVB-induced skin inflammation by reducing neutrophil recruitment and mast cell activation. Reduction of these cells by BML-111 led to lower number of sunburn cells formation, decrease in epidermal thickness, collagen degradation, cytokine production (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, TGF, and IL-10), and oxidative stress (observed by an increase in total antioxidant capacity and Nrf2 signaling pathway), indicating that BML-111 might be a promising drug to treat skin disorders.","output":"The Lipoxin Receptor/FPR2 Agonist BML-111 Protects Mouse Skin Against Ultraviolet B Radiation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), continue to have socioeconomic as well as health implications worldwide.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Cancer pts afferent to Medical Oncology-1-Unit of Regina Elena National-Cancer-Institute in Rome were considered eligible for vaccination if they were receiving systemic immunosuppressive antitumor treatment, or received it in the last 6 months, or having an uncontrolled advanced disease. The Pfizer-BNT162b2 vaccine was proposed to all candidates by phone contact or during a scheduled visit. Reasons of refusal were collected by administrating a 6-items-multiple-choice questionnaire. RESULTS From March 1st to 20th,2021, out 914 eligible pts 102 refused vaccination (11.2%,95%CI9.1-13.2). The most frequent (&gt;10%) reasons reported were concerns about vaccine-related adverse events (48.1%), negative interaction with concomitant antitumor therapy (26.7%) and the fear of allergic reaction (10.7%). The refusal rate (RR) after March 15th (date of AstraZeneca-AZD1222 suspension) was more than doubled compared to the RR observed before (19.7%vs8.6%,OR2.60,95%CI1.69-3.99,p&lt;0.0001)(Fig.1B).

It was first defined in 1992 and remains a difficult to treat entity with a mortality rate of 37%. We describe a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and CAPS presenting with simultaneous multi-organ injuries who was successfully managed with triple therapy including cyclophosphamide. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old female presented to her local hospital with chest pain and worsening vision. She had a background of SLE, triple antibody-positive APS (previous DVT, pregnancy loss and strokes), hypertension, a metallic mitral valve, a previous myocardial infarction and pre-existing visual impairment due to a prior intra-cerebral bleed related to anticoagulation. Examination revealed a faint malar rash, cortical blindness and long tract neurological signs. Her ECG showed ischaemic changes and the admission troponin was significantly raised (3773ng/L). An echocardiogram showed new left ventricular dysfunction and a subsequent cardiac MRI was in keeping with coronary artery disease. Investigations showed an acute kidney injury, newly deranged liver function tests and a raised INR (>11, with no bleeding). Complement was normal with a low dsDNA titre. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and a protein creatinine ratio measured 176mg/mmol. MRI diffusion weighted brain imaging showed acute bilateral occipital and left fronto-parietal infarcts. She had symptoms of a lupus flare with arthralgia and a butterfly facial rash. COVID-19 PCR tests were negative and she had not been recently vaccinated. She was diagnosed with CAPS and transferred to St Thomas hospital intensive care. On arrival, she received 1mg intravenous vitamin K followed by triple therapy for CAPS: an unfractionated heparin infusion, oral prednisolone 40mg daily, 5 days of plasma exchange and, given her background of SLE, she was treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide (according to the EUROLUPUS regimen). Intravenous methylprednisolone was avoided due to a previous hypertensive encephalopathy reaction. She responded rapidly. Her troponin fell from a peak of 5054 to 294ng/L, her creatinine settled at a new baseline (232umol/L) and her liver function normalised. She was switched back to warfarin due to her metallic valve and started on aspirin for cardiovascular secondary prevention. She required physical and occupational therapy due to her strokes but recovered well. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: According to the 2003 criteria, CAPS can be classified as definite when there is evidence of: 3 organs involved, development of manifestations simultaneously or within a week, confirmation by imaging and/or histopathology of small vessel occlusion and positive antiphospholipid antibodies. Probable CAPS is when 3 out of the 4 criteria are present. In this case, three organs were confirmed to be involved with imaging showing cerebral and cardiac ischaemia. Her creatinine rose from a base of 190 to 289umol/L coupled with a high protein creatinine ratio confirming renal involvement. A Budd-Chiari syndrome was also suspected due to deranged liver function tests and INR, though imaging performed after therapy did not confirm this. A biopsy of any of these four organs was not feasible given the severity of her presentation and coagulopathy. There are no randomised controlled trials but data from the CAPS registry guides treatment and management follows a logical approach: anticoagulation to treat thrombosis, glucocorticoids for inflammation and plasma exchange (or IVIG) to remove the circulating autoantibodies. Triple therapy was associated with a reduced mortality compared to no treatment (28.6% versus 75%, respectively). Following analyses from the CAPS registry we also chose to treat with cyclophosphamide, which is associated with improved survival in patients with SLE. This decision was based on the clinical features of an SLE flare as opposed to serological grounds. There have been reports of rituximab and eculizumab being used successfully in CAPS, though generally as a last resort. As complement activation is seen in animal models of antiphospholipid syndrome thrombosis and rituximab is often used in refractory SLE, they may prove to be promising agents for refractory CAPS. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: 1. Prompt recognition and early treatment is vital in managing CAPS. 2. Triple therapy with anticoagulation, glucocorticoids and plasma exchange / IVIG is associated with better survival in CAPS. 3. Cyclophosphamide is associated with better survival in patients with CAPS and concomitant SLE.","output":"O23 A series of catastrophic events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The Tropheryma whipplei causes acute gastroenteritis to neuronal damages in Homo sapiens.

METHODS: Multivariable analysis of clinical and serological parameters in 103 confirmed COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors 28 days or more following symptom resolution was performed. Mixed-effects regression models with piecewise linear trends were used to characterize serial antibody responses in 10 convalescent plasma recipients with severe COVID-19. RESULTS: Donor antibody titres ranged from 0 to 1 : 3892 (anti-receptor binding domain (RBD)) and 0 to 1 : 3289 (anti-spike). Higher anti-RBD and anti-spike titres were associated with increased age, hospitalization for COVID-19, fever and absence of myalgia (all P < 0.05).

But criticism has been swift and widespread, if sometimes spurious, with detractors attacking the award of loans to wealthy celebrities such as Kanye West, politically connected donors such as the Kushner family, and large corporations such as Shake Shack and Ruths Chris Steakhouse.In this Article, we conduct one of the first empirical studies of the central component of the largest financial bailout in U.S. history. We examine quantitative data released by the Small Business Administration to answer various competing claims about the effect of the PPP. Critics have accused the program of being administered as a partisan political tool for the presidents reelection, as a corrupt slush fund for cronies of the Trump administration, and as an incompetent waste of money on undeserving recipients. We test these hypotheses to evaluate the distribution of funds and whether the disbursement materially suffered from politics, corruption, or waste. We find that the lending process not only suffered from high-profile failures, it failed to target the neediest areas, particularly early on. Other studies present mixed findings on whether the PPP successfully protected paychecks. We conclude that critical data does not yet exist, as the PPPs greatest weakness was in failing to reach businesses unable to survive long enough to apply for or to receive loans.Accordingly, we call for a start to the process of theorizing a model for future programs to fund economic crises, which avoids the worst mistakes of the PPP. In 2008 and 2020, the U.S. government engaged in massive transfers of money from the federal fisc to corporations and, on both occasions, the task was cobbled together during an emergency, with predictable failures and shortcomings. We consider successful economic responses and how they might guide more effective, fair, and efficient models for providing emergency economic funding in the future. We may soon need one to address the continuing financial devastation from COVID-19 itself.","output":"Funding Crises: An Empirical Study of the Paycheck Protection Program"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Between 2014 and 2016, Switzerlands access to some of the EU funding was limited after a referendum against mass immigration was accepted and the country refused to sign the free movement accord to the EUs newest member, Croatia. It is well documented that Switzerland has suffered from a drop in participation, funding and a decrease in consortium lead positions. However, there is no account of the consequences on institutional level. We therefore aimed at describing the immediate- and longer-term impact of the partial association status to the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and to identify key strategies for minimizing institutional damage during a limited access period to a key regional funding source. A quantitative analysis of the institutes grants database, from 2007 to 2019, did not show any clear trends related to the partial association status of Switzerland for funding and projects awarded. The qualitative outcomes changed along the timeline assessed; whereas in 2014 a range of negative effects were stated by Swiss TPH researchers, a survey conducted in 2019 with Swiss TPH applicants and project partners to Horizon 2020, revealed that most project leaders felt that the partial association did neither affect their external partners willingness to collaborate nor Swiss TPHs role in the proposal or consortium. On the other hand, the institutional strategic goal of taking on consortia leads was delayed by several years as a direct consequence of the partial association. Also, the exclusion from European research networks and the lack of consultation of expertise by the European partner institutions was widely seen as damaging. A policy of favouring long-term partnerships over ad-hoc collaborations, along with constant and trustful communication, as immediate mitigation measure, helped averting some of the reputational and access damage. Moreover, the Swiss TPH business model based on a three-way strategy of research, education and services has proven highly viable allowing to build a large pool of potential funding sources internationally, resulting in relative resilience in terms of income lost.","output":"The consequences of compromising the EUs free movement of persons principle on Swiss research: how to survive constrained access to regional funding"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2018, the government of the Republic of Korea (ROK), South Korean life science companies, and a group of international funders led by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched a new and innovative funding agency to support neglected-disease research and development (R&D).

One of many special features on chickens is the presence of a compact and simple major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Despite its simplicity, the chicken MHC maintains the essential counterpart genes of the mammalian MHC, allowing for a strong association to be detected between the MHC and resistance or susceptibility to infectious diseases. This association has been widely studied for several poultry infectious diseases, including infectious bronchitis. In addition to the MHC and its linked genes, other non-MHC loci may play a role in the mechanisms underlying such resistance. It has been reported that innate immune responses, such as macrophage function and inflammation, might be some of the factors driving resistance or susceptibility, consequently influencing the disease outcome in an individual or a population. Information about innate immunity and genetic resistance can be helpful in developing effective preventative measures for diseases such as infectious bronchitis, to which a systemic antibody response is often not associated with disease protection. In this review, we summarize the importance of the chicken MHC in poultry disease resistance, particularly to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) infections and the role played by innate immunity and inflammation on disease outcome. We highlight how future studies focusing on the MHC and non-MHC genes can potentially bring clarity to observed resistance in some chicken B haplotype lines.","output":"The Chicken MHC: Insights into Genetic Resistance, Immunity, and Inflammation Following Infectious Bronchitis Virus Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Summary Virological studies were made on 94 flocks of fowls suffering from respiratory disease.

While the proton channel function of M2 has been extensively studied, the mechanism by which M2 conducts membrane scission is still not well understood. Previous fluorescence and electron microscopy studies indicated that M2 tetramers concentrate at the neck of the budding virus in the host plasma membrane. However, molecular evidence for this clustering is scarce. Here, we use 19F solid-state NMR to investigate M2 clustering in phospholipid bilayers. By mixing equimolar amounts of 4F-Phe47 labeled M2 and CF3-Phe47 labeled M2 and measuring F-CF3 cross peaks in 2D 19F19F correlation spectra, we show that M2 tetramers form nanometer-scale cluster in lipid bilayers. This clustering is stronger in cholesterol-containing membranes and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) membranes than in cholesterol-free phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol membranes. The observed correlation peaks indicate that Phe47 sidechains from different tetramers are less than ~2a?nm apart. 1H19F correlation peaks between lipid chain protons and fluorinated Phe47 indicates that Phe47 is more deeply inserted into the lipid bilayer in the presence of cholesterol than in its absence, suggesting that Phe47 preferentially interacts with cholesterol. Static 31P NMR spectra indicate that M2 induces negative Gaussian curvature in the PE membrane. These results suggest that M2 tetramers cluster at cholesterol- and PE-rich regions of cell membranes to cause membrane curvature, which in turn can facilitate membrane scission in the last step of virus budding and release.","output":"Clustering of tetrameric influenza M2 peptides in lipid bilayers investigated by 19F solid-state NMR"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A link between vitamin D deficiency and susceptibility to infectious diseases was suggested over a hundred years ago.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine associations between theory-based behavioral predictors of intention to wear a face covering and actual wearing of a face covering in public. METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional panel survey of U.S. adults conducted in May and June 2020 (N = 1,004) were used to test a theory-based behavioral path model. We (a) examined predictors of intention to wear a face covering, (b) reported use of cloth face coverings, and (c) reported use of other face masks (e.g., a surgical mask or N95 respirator) in public. RESULTS: We found that being female, perceived importance of others wanting the respondent to wear a face covering, confidence to wear a face covering, and perceived importance of personal face covering use was positively associated with intention to wear a face covering in public. Intention to wear a face covering was positively associated with self-reported wearing of a cloth face covering if other people were observed wearing cloth face coverings in public at least \\"rarely\\" (aOR = 1.43), with stronger associations if they reported \\"sometimes\\" (aOR = 1.83), \\"often\\" (aOR = 2.32), or \\"always\\" (aOR = 2.96).

Rat heart mitochondria were also isolated from a subset of rats for analysis of mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition. Compared to the vehicle controls, rat hearts isolated from nicotine-administered rats exhibited poorer left ventricular function that worsened over the course of I/R. Coronary flow rate was also severely impaired in the nicotine groups at baseline and this worsened after I/R. Nicotine administration significantly increased mitochondrial ROS production and permeability transition relative to the vehicle controls. Interestingly, pre-incubation of isolated mitochondria with ROS scavengers (superoxide dismutase and mitoTEMPO) significantly abolished nicotine-induced increase in mitochondria permeability transition in isolated rat heart mitochondria. Overall, our data showed that prolonged nicotine administration enhances myocardial susceptibility to I/R injury in rats and this is associated with mitochondrial-ROS-driven increase in mitochondrial permeability transition.","output":"Impact of Prolonged Nicotine Administration on Myocardial Function and Susceptibility to Ischaemia-Reperfusion Injury in Rats"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and a target for disease prevention. However, the relationship between ACE2 expression and its clinical implications in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain unknown. Here, we explored the location and expression of ACE2, and its correlation with gender, age and cigarette smoke (CS), in a CS-exposed mouse model and 224 non-malignant lung tissues (125 non-smokers, 81 current smokers and 18 ex-smokers) by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, the correlations of ACE2 with CS-induced oxidative stress-related markers, hypoxia inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) were investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays identified the cause of ACE2 overexpression in human primary lung epithelial cells. We demonstrated that ACE2 was predominantly overexpressed on the apical surface of bronchial epithelium, while reduced in alveolar epithelium, owing to the dramatically decreased abundance of alveolar type II pneumocytes in CS-exposed mouse lungs. Consistent with this, ACE2 was primarily significantly overexpressed in human bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells in smokers regardless of age or gender. Decreased ACE2 expression was observed in bronchial epithelial cells from ex-smokers compared with current-smokers, especially in those who had ceased smoking for more than 10 years. Moreover, ACE2 expression was positively correlated with the levels of HIF-1&#945;, iNOS, and 4-HNE in both mouse and human bronchioles. The results were further validated using a public available dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our previous integrated data from Affymetrix U133 Plus2.0 microarray (AE-meta). Finally, our results showed that HIF-1&#945; transcriptionally upregulates ACE2 expression. Our results indicate that smoking-induced ACE2 overexpression in the apical surface of bronchial epithelial cells provide a route by which SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells, which supports clinical relevance in attenuating the potential transmission risk of COVID-19 in smoking populations by smoking cessation.

Synthesis of the available studies significantly strengthens the quality of evidences for public health practice. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection using available evidences. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. Two experienced review authors (MA and DBK) were systematically searched international electronic databases for studies. We performed meta-analysis using R statistical software. The overall weighted proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course infection was computed. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were presented using forest plot. Egger's tests were used to assess publication bias, and primary estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assure the robustness of the result. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, in the meta-analysis, a total of 6,071 COVID-19 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among the included studies ranged from 1.4% to 78.3%.

PRESENTATION OF CASE: 42-year-old male patient admitted to the emergency department for presenting abdominal pain located in the epigastrium for 4 days, melenic evacuations and syncope on one occasion. Two years prior to admission, the patient underwent a single anastomosis bypass for grade III obesity. Gastric bypass mini revision surgery was performed an antecolic and antegastric gastrointestinal anastomosis was made with a 3 cm latero-lateral anastomosis; an intestinal-intestinal anastomosis was performed 60 cm from the gastric anastomosis The length of the biliopancreatic loop (120 cm) and the feeding loop (60 cm) are reviewed. DISCUSSION: Performing an en bloc resection of the anastomosis is essential since bile reflux is one of the irritation mechanisms of the anastomosis but not the only one. The size of the gastric pouch directly influences the frequency of marginal ulcers, so during the OAGBP revision, the gastro-jejunal junction must be resected to remodel it, reducing the size of the gastric reservoir that allows to perform the new anastomosis in less inflamed tissue. Roux-en-Y reconstruction should be performed once the length of the biliopancreatic loop is verified and it does not exceed 150 cm and a short alimentary loop to avoid nutritional complications. Complications arising from bariatric procedures are varied, infrequent in well-trained surgeons, but severe in inexpert hands, leading to an increase in mortality rates.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a vital enzyme of coronavirus replication/transcription complex whereas the main protease acts on the proteolysis of replicase polyproteins. Among 76 prescription antiviral drugs, four drugs (Raltegravir, Simeprevir, Cobicistat, and Daclatasvir) that are previously used for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola, and Marburg virus show higher binding energy and strong interaction with active sites of the receptor proteins. To explore the dynamic nature of the interaction, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is performed on the selected protein-drug complexes and apo-protein. Binding free energy of the selected drugs is performed by MM/PBSA. Besides docking and dynamics, partial least square (PLS) regression method is applied for the quantitative structure activity relationship to generate and predict the binding energy for drugs. PLS regression satisfactorily predicts the binding energy of the effective antiviral drugs compared to binding energy achieved from molecular docking with a precision of 85%.

Delays in presentation and diagnosis may lead to more advanced disease and worse patient outcomes. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on patients (pts) with melanoma (mel). Methods: A single-institution, retrospective comparison of pts with newly diagnosed invasive mel or metastatic recurrence prior to (pre-cohort, n = 246) and after (post-cohort, n = 246) declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 11, 2020. 492 pts were evaluated between March 1, 2019 and January 12, 2021. Key variables collected included demographics, pathology, stage at diagnosis, surgical management, receipt of adjuvant or systemic therapy, and follow up. Categorical variables were compared using the two-sided Fisher's exact test, continuous variables were compared using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, and survival endpoints were evaluated with the Kaplan-Meier method. This study was exempt from review by the IRB. Results: 200 (81.3%) pts presented with early-stage disease and 46 (18.7%) pts presented with metastatic disease in the postcohort, compared to 209 (85%) and 37 (15%) pts in the pre-cohort, respectively. In the post-cohort there was a significant decrease in stage I pts (28.5% vs 40.7%, p = 0.006), a significant increase in stage III pts (30.5% vs 21.1%, p = 0.023), and a significant increase in pts with metastatic recurrence (7.7% vs 3.3%, p = 0.046) compared to the pre-cohort. There was also a significant increase in pts with brain metastases (BM) in the post-cohort (6.5% vs 1.6%, p = 0.010). For pts with early-stage disease, there was a significant increase in median Breslow depth (2.0 vs 1.4 mm, p = 0.047) and mitotic rate &gt; 1 (78.1% vs 66%, p = 0.008) in the post-cohort. There were trends toward increased ulceration, lymphovascular/perineural invasion, and microsatellite presence. Pts receiving adjuvant therapy in the post-cohort were significantly more likely to receive oral targeted therapy (37.6% vs 27.5%) compared to IV immunotherapy (62.4% vs 72.5%), p = 0.034, perhaps reflecting an attempt to minimize in-person visits. There was not a significant difference between the 2 groups in the type of systemic therapy administered in the metastatic setting. Median progression-free and overall survival were not reached due to a limited number of events in each arm. Conclusions:There was a significant decrease in pts with stage I mel along with a significant increase in pts with stage III mel, metastatic recurrence, and BMs presenting to our institution during the pandemic. Findings are likely related to delays from both the patient (to avoid interaction with the healthcare system - including primary care, dermatology, and oncology) and from the system itself, with some clinics potentially evaluating pts in a limited capacity. These data reaffirm the importance of early detection and evaluation of melanoma.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on staging at presentation of patients with invasive melanoma"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 prevention and control demand a reduction in crowd gathering, which has a significant impact on traditional teaching and offline case-based learning (CBL).

METHODS We retrospectively reported data of 60 consecutive cases of robotic-assisted colpo-/cervicosacropexy for advanced multicompartmental prolapse using a standardized suturing design. We placed three non-absorbable stitches on the cervix or three absorbable stitches on the apex of the vaginal vault, six long-term absorbable stitches on the anterior vaginal wall deep to the basis of the vesical trigone, six similar posterior stitches with the deeper row of sutures down to the levator ani plane and three non-absorbable stitches on the sacral promontory as the cranial support for Y-shaped polypropylene mesh. RESULTS Median operative time was 188  43 min. All the procedures were successfully performed using a Da Vinci Si platform in a three-arm configuration, and no conversion to open or traditional laparoscopic surgery was needed. The length of hospital stay was 1.2  1.7 days, and no readmission within 30 postoperative days was reported. At a follow-up of 12 and 24 months, no case of extrusion or exposure of the mesh occurred, and the retreatment rate was 6.7%. CONCLUSIONS Our suturing technique is safe and effective, with negligible risk of complications and good medium-term results. It is plausible that robotic systems may facilitate precise, accurate and reproducible placement of the stitches, thereby favoring wider diffusion of minimally invasive treatment of advanced prolapse.","output":"Technical features, perioperative and anatomical outcomes of a standardized suturing pattern for robotic sacrocolpopexy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Weight gain is a frequent problem in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Cimicifuga racemosa (CR) is a popular treatment option for menopausal symptoms. The aim of this review was to investigate whether there is scientific evidence that CR causes weight gain. We searched our database for medically confirmed, spontaneous adverse events regarding weight gain, literature for case reports and randomized controlled trials. Thirty cases in total were spontaneously reported in 15 years. The causality was not considered certain/likely in any of the cases. A nurse (consumer) assessed the causality as possible. Only one case was published in the literature. However, no change in body fat composition was reported, and the causality seems unlikely. Of the 31 identified studies, 17 were double-blind placebo-controlled, five were double-blind reference-controlled and nine were open reference-controlled. In total, 1839 women were treated with CR for up to 12 months. Two studies reported weight gain as an adverse event; however, no significant differences in weight changes were observed between the groups. One case of weight gain (about 2 kg) was reported, but the authors did not specify in which treatment group. In conclusion, this study provides no scientific evidence that the use of Cimicifuga racemosa causes weight gain in menopausal women.","output":"Weight gain in menopause: systematic review of adverse events in women treated with black cohosh."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In late December, 2019, patients presenting with suspected of viral pneumonitis due to an non-identified microbial agent were reported in Wuhan, China A novel coronavirus was subsequently identified as the causative pathogen, provisionally named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) As of Jan 26, 2020, more than 2000 cases or more of 2019-nCoV infection have been confirmed, most of which involved people living in or visiting Wuhan, and human-to-human transmission has been confirmed","output":"Infection with a novel corona virus (2019-nCoV): the present risk and the challenge: a brief review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 causes the pandemic of COVID-19 and no effective drugs for this disease are available thus far. Due to the high infectivity and pathogenicity of this virus, all studies on the live virus are strictly confined in the biosafety level 3 (BSL3) laboratory but this would hinder the basic research and antiviral drug development of SARS-CoV-2 because the BSL3 facility is not commonly available and the work in the containment is costly and laborious. In this study, we constructed a reverse genetics system of SARS-CoV-2 by assembling the viral cDNA in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector with deletion of the spike (S) gene. Transfection of the cDNA into cells results in the production of an RNA replicon that keeps the capability of genome or subgenome replication but is deficient in virion assembly and infection due to the absence of S protein. Therefore, such a replicon system is not infectious and can be used in ordinary biological laboratories. We confirmed the efficient replication of the replicon by demonstrating the expression of the subgenomic RNAs which have similar profiles to the wild-type virus. By mutational analysis of nsp12 and nsp14, we showed that the RNA polymerase, exonuclease, and cap N7 methyltransferase play essential roles in genome replication and sgRNA production. We also created a SARS-CoV-2 replicon carrying a luciferase reporter gene and this system was validated by the inhibition assays with known anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.

Therefore, cancer patients have been greatly affected by this health emergency and, due to their vulnerability to COVID-19, oncologic patient visits have been often delayed or canceled leading to possible under-treatment. Different solutions can be adopted for reducing travels to cancer screening centers and the overall impact of cancer screening visits. As a consequence, it has been recommended that, when possible, the follow-up visits for cancer patients treated with oral anticancer drugs could be performed telematically. Furthermore, many patients refuse hospital visits, even if necessary, because of fear of contagion. Moreover, in some regions in Italy even the very first non-urgent visits have been postponed with the consequent delay in diagnosis, which may negatively affect disease prognosis. For these reasons, new approaches are needed such as the telemedicine tool. Throughout organized and appropriate tools, it would be possible to manage patients visits and treatments, to avoid the dangerous extension of waiting lists when the standard activities will resume.

People with risk factors for or pre-existing cardiovascular disease may be at greater risk. OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities associated with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19 in a variety of settings, including the community, care homes and hospitals. We also assessed the nature and rate of subsequent cardiovascular complications and clinical events in people with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: We conducted an electronic search from December 2019 to 24 July 2020 in the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, covid-19.cochrane.org, ClinicalTrials.gov and EU Clinical Trial Register. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included prospective and retrospective cohort studies, controlled before-and-after, case-control and cross-sectional studies, and randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We analysed controlled trials as cohorts, disregarding treatment allocation. We only included peer-reviewed studies with 100 or more participants, and excluded articles not written in English or only published in pre-print servers. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened the search results and extracted data. Given substantial variation in study designs, reported outcomes and outcome metrics, we undertook a narrative synthesis of data, without conducting a meta-analysis. We critically appraised all included studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist for prevalence studies and the JBI checklist for case series. MAIN RESULTS: We included 220 studies. Most of the studies originated from China (47.7%) or the USA (20.9%); 9.5% were from Italy. A large proportion of the studies were retrospective (89.5%), but three (1.4%) were RCTs and 20 (9.1%) were prospective. Using JBI's critical appraisal checklist tool for prevalence studies, 75 studies attained a full score of 9, 57 studies a score of 8, 31 studies a score of 7, 5 studies a score of 6, three studies a score of 5 and one a score of 3; using JBI's checklist tool for case series, 30 studies received a full score of 10, six studies a score of 9, 11 studies a score of 8, and one study a score of 5 We found that hypertension (189 studies, n = 174,414, weighted mean prevalence (WMP): 36.1%), diabetes (197 studies, n = 569,188, WMP: 22.1%) and ischaemic heart disease (94 studies, n = 100,765, WMP: 10.5%) are highly prevalent in people hospitalised with COVID-19, and are associated with an increased risk of death.

This discontinuous RNA synthesis step is based on the complementarity between the transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs) at the leader region and those preceding each gene in the nascent minus-strand RNA. Furthermore, the template switch requires the physical proximity of RNA genome domains located between 20,000 and 30,000 nucleotides apart. In this report, it is shown that the efficacy of this recombination step is promoted by novel additional long-distance RNA-RNA interactions between RNA motifs located close to the TRSs controlling the expression of each gene and their complementary sequences mapping close to the 5' end of the genome. These interactions would bring together the motifs involved in the recombination process. This finding indicates that the formation of high-order RNA structures in the CoV genome is necessary to control the expression of at least the viral N gene. The requirement of these long-distance interactions for transcription was shown by the engineering of CoV replicons in which the complementarity between the newly identified sequences was disrupted. Furthermore, disruption of complementarity in mutant viruses led to mutations that restored complementarity, wild-type transcription levels, and viral titers by passage in cell cultures. The relevance of these high-order structures for virus transcription is reinforced by the phylogenetic conservation of the involved RNA motifs in CoVs.","output":"Long-distance RNA-RNA interactions in the coronavirus genome form high-order structures promoting discontinuous RNA synthesis during transcription."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The immune system rapidly responds to intracellular infections by detecting MHC class I restricted T-cell epitopes presented on infected cells. It was originally thought that viral peptides are liberated during constitutive protein turnover, but this conflicts with the observation that viral epitopes are detected within minutes of their synthesis even when their source proteins exhibit half-lives of days. The DRiPs hypothesis proposes that epitopes derive from Defective Ribosomal Products (DRiPs), rather than degradation of mature protein products. One potential source of DRiPs is premature translation termination. If this is a major source of DRiPs, this should be reflected in positional bias towards the N-terminus. By contrast, if downstream initiation is a major source of DRiPs, there should be positional bias towards the C-terminus. Here, we systematically assessed positional bias of epitopes in viral antigens, exploiting the large set of data available in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We show a statistically significant degree of positional skewing among epitopes; epitopes from both ends of antigens tend to be under-represented. Centric-skewing correlates with a bias towards class I binding peptides being over-represented in the middle, in parallel with a higher degree of evolutionary conservation.","output":"Positional Bias of MHC Class I Restricted T-Cell Epitopes in Viral Antigens Is Likely due to a Bias in Conservation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"According to the World Health Organization forecasts, AntiMicrobial Resistance (AMR) is expected to become one of the leading causes of death worldwide in the following decades.

As a viral respiratory illness, its presentation can be very similar to other respiratory diseases. Therefore, it is essential to have a high degree of suspicion for superimposed bacterial and fungal infections. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old male with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with fever, sudden shortness of breath, cough, and diffuse chest discomfort. Upon arrival his blood pressure was 155/76 mmhg, heart rate 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 22, with temperature of 101.9 F. The patient's Covid-19 PCR nasopharyngeal swab resulted positive. Imaging showed moderate to severe bilateral lung ground-glass infiltrates and consolidation pattern and a 1.9 cm, left upper lobe cavitary lesion. No prior imaging was available for review. Patient was treated with supplemental oxygen, antibiotic therapy for community acquired pneumonia, Remdicivir, and convalescent plasma therapy. Given low suspicion for active TB, steroid therapy was continued. Patient's QuantiFERON gold resulted positive, and he was found to have positive coccidioides IgG, but the complement fixation titer was negative on the day of admission. Three AFB samples, serum (1-3)-beta-D-Glucan assay and Aspergillus assay resulted negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed. Serum coccidioides antibody complement fixation and immunodiffusion results were made available after the patient's passing, which showed positive for IgG and IgM with titers 1:256. Bronchoalveolar lavage cultures revealed Coccidioides Posadasii and Immitis. DISCUSSION: Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as valley fever, is caused by dimorphic fungi of the Coccidioides family, which is endemic to California, south-central Washington, and northern Mexico. Pulmonary Coccidioides has a similar clinical presentation to Covid-19 infection and seldom, associated with cavitary lesions. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath are the most common presenting symptoms. Radiographic findings vary with COVID -19 showing bilateral peripheral ground glass opacifications with or without consolidations. Among the bacterial co-infections, streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Due to lengthy wait periods for many laboratory studies to be resulted, it is challenging to distinguish co-infection cases. Reactivation of coccidiodes has been seen in patients with HIV, and patients on chemo and immunotherapy despite antifungal prophylaxes. CONCLUSIONS: Given nonspecific radiological findings of Covid-19 infection that are seen with other causes of pneumonia and its uncertain and similar clinical course to other respiratory infections, it is crucial to have a high degree of suspicion for superimposed bacterial and fungal infections.

Studies have also shown multiple other functions of these proteins such as in cell signalling, transcription and immune response. Deregulation of these proteins leads to devastating consequences, such as cancer, Alzheimers disease and other life threatening diseases suggesting their potential importance in life processes. HSPs exist in multiple isoforms, and their biochemical and functional characterization still remains a subject of active investigation. In case of viral infections, several HSP isoforms have been documented to play important roles with few showing pro-viral activity whereas others seem to have an anti-viral role. Earlier studies have demonstrated that HSP40 plays a pro-viral role whereas HSP70 inhibits HIV-1 replication; however, clear isoform-specific functional roles remain to be established. A detailed functional characterization of all the HSP isoforms will uncover their role in cellular homeostasis and also may highlight some of them as potential targets for therapeutic strategies against various viral infections.

The pooled proportion or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each analysis to explore the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and coinfection, as well as to assess the sex of SARS-CoV-2-infected children. RESULTS: We obtained data from 14 eligible studies with 410 patients for the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection was 40.45% (95% CI, 24.04-56.85), while coinfection was 10.14% (95% CI, 3.97-16.30), of which Mycoplasma pneumonia (50%; 95% CI, 28.24-71.76) and influenza virus or parainfluenza virus (22.76%; 95% CI, 4.76-40.77) were the most common pathogens.

METHODS: All 36 adolescents with PFP from the HAPPi Kneecaps! study were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. We used a descriptive qualitative methodology underpinned by a relativist framework to investigate adolescents perspectives on participating in the trial. Inductive thematic analysis was used to examine patterns regarding how each adolescent experienced the HAPPi Kneecaps! study within their social, cultural, and historical contexts. RESULTS: 14 out of 36 HAPPi Kneecaps! participants provided consent and participated in interviews (12 females; mean [SD] age 14.9 [2.4] years). Overall, most adolescents responded positively when discussing their experience, such as improvements in their knee pain and satisfaction with how the study was run. Major themes that were generated from the analysis and feedback were: (1) shoe inserts require little effort to use; (2) perceptions of the program were generally positive; (3) participation in the trial could be made easier; (4) warm weather matters; and (5) life happens. CONCLUSION: Adolescents with PFP who participated in the HAPPi Kneecaps! study found that shoe inserts were easy to wear. Most adolescents experienced an improvement in their symptoms and enhanced participation in sport and exercise. Adolescents with PFP prefer an option for warmer climates (e.g. flip flops or sandals), access to online logbooks, and clinicians who are easily accessible.

Information was gathered on the results of image quality tests recommended by the reports of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, and those additionally undertaken by medical physics departments. The assessment of efficacy considers the frequency with which a test result breaches the remedial level or other relevant threshold where applicable. The third quartile of those results exceeding the remedial level or threshold is used to estimate the severity of such a breach in terms of potential impact on patient dose and image quality. A risk assessment approach is then used to recommend to what degree, if any, the test should be included in an on-going test regimen. Data was analysed from 469 testing sessions to 337 unique fluoroscopy units throughout the UK. Across all tests, the rate with which the remedial level was exceeded varied from 0 - 10.6%, with severity ranging from little or none to major degradation to image quality or significant increase on population dose. Where possible, the data has also been used to produce representative ranges for the results of image quality tests. These could be useful as an up to date comparator for those sites considering the purchase of or commissioning new equipment. Overall the results indicate a wide range for the efficacy of those tests undertaken at present; this can be used to review local test protocols and to inform future changes to national guidance in the UK. The results also highlight some tests where measurement technique varies significantly throughout the UK, making any valid comparison difficult. This may indicate a need for further guidance on how best to undertake these tests.","output":"IPEM Topical Report: An evidence and risk assessment based analysis of the efficacy of quality assurance tests on fluoroscopy units - part II; image quality."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The case of 70-year-old man with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) carrying t(11;14) translocation that relapsed as nodal lymphoma combining MCL and classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) 9 years after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (auto-PBSCT) is reported. Lymph nodes contained two separate areas of MCL and cHL-like components. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like cells were accompanied by a prominent histiocyte background.

During spore formation in Gram-positive bacteria, a transport system called the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex also assembles in the double membrane that surrounds the forespore following its endocytosis by the mother cell. The presence of RBM domains in some of the SpoIIIA proteins led to the hypothesis that they would assemble into rings connecting the two membranes and form a conduit between the mother cell and forespore. Among them, SpoIIIAG forms homo-oligomeric rings in vitro but the oligomerization of other RBM-containing SpoIIIA proteins, including SpoIIIAH, remains to be demonstrated. In this work, we identified RBM domains in the YhcN/YlaJ family of proteins that are not related to the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex. We solved the crystal structure of YhcN from Bacillus subtilis, which confirmed the presence of a RBM fold, flanked by additional secondary structures. As the protein did not show any oligomerization ability in vitro, we investigated the structural determinants of ring formation in SpoIIIAG, SpoIIIAH and YhcN. We showed that in vitro, the conserved core of RBM domains alone is not sufficient for oligomerization while the -barrel forming region in SpoIIIAG forms rings on its own. This work suggests that some RBMs might indeed participate in the assembly of homomeric rings but others might have evolved toward other functions.","output":"Structural insights into ring-building motif domains involved in bacterial sporulation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Communication skills are an essential instrument for building a sustainable patient-doctor-relationship for future doctors.

Up to now, the curriculum consists of four parts in which students repeatedly practise their communication skills in curricular and extracurricular courses. Several formats help to teach an integrated learning of communication and physical examination skills. Assessment of communication skills is also performed. Curricular implementation is accompanied by concomitant evaluation. Results: Three parts of the curriculum already have taken place. Students report an increase in communication skills. Students rate the units as instructive and helpful. The assessment of communication skills occurs in two clinical practical examinations (OSCEs). Together with summative assessment a formative feedback was implemented. Students judge this practice as highly positive. Discussion: The curriculum is part of undergraduate medical education in Leipzig. It would be beneficial to add another simulated patient encounter, as well as interprofessional units. Student questionnaires will be evaluated and results will help to develop the curriculum.

This study aimed to investigate the treatment outcomes, antibiotic use and its resistance pattern among neonatal sepsis patients attending a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. We also aimed to identify the factors affecting mortality in neonatal sepsis patients. METHODS: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in the pediatric wards of the Bahawal Victoria Hospital, Bahawalpur, Pakistan. All eligible neonatal sepsis patients who were registered at the study site from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019 were included in the study. The data collection form included information on patients characteristics, antibiotic use and its sensitivity pattern, laboratory and microbiological data, and final treatment outcomes. Treatment outcomes included, discharged (with treatment success), leave against medical advice (LAMA), discharged on request (DOR) and death. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used to find the independent factors associated with death. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among the total 586 patients, 398 (67.9%) were male, 328 (56%) were preterm, 415 (70.8%) were diagnosed with early onset sepsis, 299 (51%) were born with low birth weight. Most of the patients (n = 484, 82.6%) were treated with amikacin+cefotaxime at the start of treatment. Culture was positive in 52 (8.9%) patients and the most commonly identified bacteria included, Klebsiella species (n = 19, 36.5%) followed by E. coli (n = 15, 28.5%) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 8, 15.4%). The identified bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the antibiotics initiated at the start of the treatment, while resistance against piperacillin+tazobactam, imipenem, vancomycin and linezolid was very low. Just under half of the patients (n = 280, 47.8%) successfully completed the treatment (i.e., discharged with treatment success), while 123 (21%) patients died during treatment. In multivariable binary logistic regression, the factors which still remained significantly associated with neonatal death included, preterm delivery (AOR 9.59; 95% CI 4.41, 20.84), sub-optimal birth weight (AOR 5.13; 95% CI 2.19, 12.04), early onset sepsis (AOR 2.99; 95% CI 1.39, 6.41) and length of hospital stay (AOR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67, 0.88). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate associated with sepsis was high in our study cohort. The bacterial isolates showed high level of resistance against the antibiotics started as the empiric therapy.

The most effective surveillance system consists of doing massive tests. Nonetheless, many countries cannot afford this class of health campaigns due to limited resources. Thus, a transmission model is a viable alternative to study the dynamics of the pandemic. The most used are the Susceptible, Infected and Removed type models (SIR). In this study, we tackle the population estimation problem of the A-SIR model, which takes into account asymptomatic or undetected individuals. By means of an algebraic differential approach, we design a model-free (no copy system) reduced-order estimation algorithm (observer) to determine the different non-measured population groups. We study two types of estimation algorithms: Proportional and Proportional-Integral. Both shown fast convergence speed, as well as a minimal estimation error. Additionally, we introduce random fluctuations in our analysis to represent changes in the external conditions and which result in poor measurements. The numerical results reveal that both model-free estimators are robust despite the presence of these fluctuations. As a point of reference, we apply the classical Luenberger type observer to our estimation problem and compare the results. Finally, we consider real data of infected individuals in Mexico City, reported from February 2020 to March 2021, and estimate the non-measured populations. Our work's main goal is to proportionate a simple and therefore, an accessible methodology to estimate the behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic from the available data, such that the competent authorities can propose more adequate health politics.","output":"An algorithm for the robust estimation of the COVID-19 pandemic's population by considering undetected individuals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Service robots are integrating more and more into our daily lives to help us with various tasks.

In this paper, we present a lifelong ensemble learning approach based on multiple representations to address the few-shot object recognition problem.

To facilitate lifelong learning, each approach is equipped with a memory unit for storing and retrieving object information instantly. The proposed model is suitable for open-ended learning scenarios where the number of 3D object categories is not fixed and can grow over time. We have performed extensive sets of experiments to assess the performance of the proposed approach in offline, and open-ended scenarios.

AHNE usually involves the subcortical white matter but not the cortical grey matter. This study describes the disruptive effects of AHNE associated with SARS-CoV-2 on cognitive function in a previously healthy and sound middle-aged woman resulting from alterations in cortical areas involved in the cognitive network. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old previously healthy woman with a history of inter-state travel developed a flu-like illness, followed by acute, steadily progressive cognitive impairment. She was admitted in a comatose state after a first tonic-clonic seizure. Blood tests were non-informative. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was indicative of AHNE. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed mild lymphocytosis with normal protein and normal glucose but an elevated IgG index. After testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, she was administered steroids. Treatment was ineffective, and the patient died. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is a potential central nervous system (CNS) pathogen, which may manifest as AHNE. These patients may present with generalized tonic-clonic seizures and frontal dysexecutive syndrome, with cognitive impairment being the presenting feature of neuro-coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The patient described in this report is unique for acute-onset and isolated cognitive impairments due to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the absence of clinical or radiological respiratory manifestations.

Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA.

To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2. Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets.

The vulnerability of the paediatric population, combined with the potentially dangerous context of intensive care, makes Paediatric Intensive Care Units services of particular complexity in matters of safety, where there is a greater likelihood of incidents with serious consequences. It is agreed that research on the topic of PS should start with the measuring of different types of harm that exist in the contexts, to identify high-risk areas and define priorities. For this, it is necessary to resort to a multiplicity of valid, reliable and specific measurement instruments and to learn their advantages and limitations. The objective of this review will be to identify and map in scientific literature the instruments for measuring incidents related to patient safety applicable in the context of paediatric intensive care. METHODS This review will cover studies and documents that refer to all measurement instruments used in the field of patient safety in a context of paediatric intensive care. Quantitative, qualitative, or mixed nature published studies, as well as grey literature, produced in the last 5 years and relevant to the topic will be included, in Portuguese, English or Spanish languages. The sources of information include several databases (such as MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, JBI Databases) and sources relevant to grey literature. Two reviewers will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. The extracted data, after being organised in the extraction table, will be mapped in a descriptive and logical way, taking into account the defined review questions.

In addition, the normalized [13C]bicarbonate signal in fasted untreated animals is dose independent across a 10-fold range, highlighting that PEPCK and pyruvate carboxylase are not saturated and that hepatic gluconeogenesis can be directly probed in vivo with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate.","output":"[13C]bicarbonate labelled from hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate is an in vivo marker of hepatic gluconeogenesis in fasted state"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The objective of our work is to demonstrate in a large cohort of patients with cricotracheal stenosis that resection of long airway segments could be performed with no increased risk of postoperative complications.

Thirty-eight patients were treated. Primary etiologies of cricotracheal stenosis were prolonged intubation and tracheostomy. All had Grade III-IV stenosis. Only one patient had postoperative revision surgery for anastomosis-based disease. All patients with tracheostomy (n = 29) were successfully decannulated. Complications occurred in five patients. These included acute airway obstruction requiring emergency tracheostomy through the anastomosis, a tracheal dehiscence, laryngeal edema with airway obstruction, superficial wound infections, neck abscesses, and transient vocal cord immobility.

CAB+RPV LA is a novel, long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART) currently in development and is administered intramuscularly monthly or every 2 months by a healthcare provider. COVID-19 and the resultant restrictions on access to some clinical trial sites presents challenges to the continuous delivery (implementation fidelity) of CAB+RPV LA during a pandemic. METHODS: Descriptive analyses were conducted using aggregated data from ongoing CAB+RPV LA clinical trials (LATTE-2, ATLAS, ATLAS-2M, FLAIR, POLAR, and CUSTOMIZE) to evaluate impact of COVID-19 on LA dosing. Data through 15 July 2020 were aggregated, categorized, and summarized to show trends. Data collection is continuously ongoing. RESULTS: As of 15 July 2020, 1831 participants are currently on CAB+RPV LA across these clinical studies. As of 15 July, 113 (6%) participants had injection visits that were impacted by COVID-19. LA dosing was interrupted in 51 (45%) participants due to clinic closure or staffing constraints, 9 (8%) for self-quarantine, 11 (10%) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, and 42 (37%) for other reasons. Among participants impacted, 64 (58%) were from N. America, 29 (26%) Europe, 14 (13%) S. Africa, and 3 (3%) Latin America. Majority of participants were male (87, 79%), white (74, 65%), with median age 35 years. Mitigation strategies included short-term oral therapy with CAB+RPV (78, 69%), short-term standard of care ART (28, 25%), and rescheduling of LA injections (6, 5%). Although some are still receiving oral therapy, current median duration of oral therapy has been 45 days. To date, 65 (58%) have restarted LA and viral load data collection is ongoing. No suspected or confirmed virologic failure was observed for any participant impacted by COVID-19 to date. CONCLUSION: In the midst of the global pandemic, no treatment interruptions were seen across the ongoing CAB+RPV LA clinical studies. Missed visits were manageable and successfully mitigated, primarily by temporary transition to oral therapy with no resultant virologic failure or emerging resistance through 15 July 2020. CAB+RPV LA is a new HIV-1 treatment modality that has demonstrated implementation fidelity across clinical studies during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is known to be expressed on type II pneumocytes. As a counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS and acute lung injury. The affinity of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 for human ACE2 (hACE2) largely determines the degree of clinical symptoms after infection by SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have shown that regulating the ACE2/RAS system is effective in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-induced ARDS and acute lung injury. Since ACE2 is the host cell receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, regulating the ACE2/RAS system may alleviate ARDS and acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.

Two recently published studies relating to adamantane binding of the M2 ion channel using X-ray crystallography and solution NMR have reignited interest in the potential use of adamantanes in combating the spread of influenza A. However, these two studies propose different binding sites for the adamantane drugs with the X-ray M2/amantadine structure favoring an ion channel pore-binding model and the solution NMR M2/rimantadine structure suggesting the existence of a lipid-facing binding pocket. We conducted a series of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments designed to accurately measure the affinity of amantadine and rimantadine to M2 ion channels embedded in 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-phosphocholine (DMPC) liposomes. We find that this class of drug is capable of binding M2 with two different affinities in the order of 10(-4) and 10(-7) M, suggesting that both proposed binding sites are feasible. Furthermore, by examining drug binding to M2 mutant constructs (V27A, S31N, and D44A), it was possible to probe the location of the two binding sites. We show that a high-affinity binding site corresponds to the M2 ion channel pore whereas the secondary, low-affinity binding site can be attributed to the lipid face of the pore. These SPR results are in excellent agreement with the most recent solid-state NMR study of amantadine-bound M2 in lipid bilayers and provide independent support that the ion channel pore-binding site is responsible for the pharmacological activity elicited by the adamantane drugs.","output":"Coexistence of two adamantane binding sites in the influenza A M2 ion channel."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Brain metastases are a most disturbing situation for breast cancer patients as there is basically no adequate treatment available. Any potential drug formulation has to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and specific to metastatic brain tumors without causing unacceptable adverse effects. Here, we developed transferrin-functionalized chimeric polymersomes carrying siRNA against polo-like kinase 1 (Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1) for treating brain metastatic MDA-MB 231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) xenografts in mice. To facilitate the loading of siPLK1, chimaeric polymersomes (CPs) were designed with spermine in the watery core and transferrin-binding peptide (TBP) at the surface, enabling attachment of transferrin after the siRNA loading step and thereby circumventing interference of transferrin with siRNA loading. Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1 encapsulating 3.8 wt% siRNA had a mean size of about 50 nm and a neutral zeta potential in phosphate buffer (PB). By virtue of the presence of transferrin, Tf@TBP-CPs demonstrated greatly (ca. 5-fold) enhanced internalization in MDA-MB 231 cells and transcytosis in the endothelial (bEnd.3) monolayer model in vitro as well as markedly improved accumulation in the orthotopically xenografted MDA-MB 231 tumor in the brain in vivo compared with control CPs lacking transferrin, supporting that transferrin mediates efficient BBB penetration and high specificity towards MDA-MB 231 cells. As a result, Tf@TBP-CPs-siPLK1 effectively inhibited tumor progression and prolonged the lifespan of the mice significantly.

METHODS: Protein kinase D1 expression in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues from 172 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent surgical resection were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Based on the total immunohistochemical score, protein kinase D1 expression was classified as protein kinase D1 high expression (further divided into protein kinase D1 high+++, protein kinase D1 high++, and protein kinase D1 high+ expressions) and protein kinase D1 low expression. Clinical characteristics of patients with non-small cell lung cancer were acquired from the database. Accumulating disease-free survival and overall survival were calculated based on patients' relapse/survival status. RESULTS: Protein kinase D1 expression was increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent tissues (P < .001). Tumor protein kinase D1 high expression correlated with poorer pathological differentiation (P = .041), increased tumor size (P = .003), the presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .001), and elevated tumor, nodes and metastases stage (P < .001). Besides, both accumulating disease-free survival and overall survival were decreased in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high expression compared to patients with tumor protein kinase D1 low expression (P = .010 for disease-free survival and P = 0.005 for overall survival). Moreover, they were lowest in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high+++ expression, followed by patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high++ expression, then patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high+ expression, and highest in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 low expression (P < .001 for disease-free survival and P = .001 for overall survival). Notably, higher tumor protein kinase D1 expression was an independent predictive factor for decreased disease-free survival (P = .001) and overall survival (P = .004).

The reasons remain to be fully elucidated. Objective: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. Results: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Yes, using a combination of three different models we can predict the impact of delaying access to treatment by 6 and 12 months on the probability of conception leading to live birth in women of different age groups with different categories of infertility. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Increased age and duration of infertility can prejudice the chances of success following IVF, but couples with unexplained infertility have a chance of conceiving naturally without treatment whilst waiting for IVF. The worldwide suspension of IVF could lead to worse outcomes in couples awaiting treatment, but it is unclear to what extent this could affect individual couples based on age and cause of infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A population based cohort study based on national data from all licensed clinics in the UK obtained from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority Register. Linked data from 9589 women who underwent their first IVF or ICSI treatment in 2017 and consented to the use of their data for research were used to predict livebirth numbers. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Three prediction models were used to estimate the chances of livebirth associated with immediate treatment versus a delay of 6 and 12 months in couples about to embark on IVF or ICSI. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We estimated that a 6-month delay would reduce livebirths by 0.4%, 2.4%, 5.7%, 9.5% and 11.8% in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, while corresponding values associated with a delay of 12 months were 0.9%, 4.9%, 11.9%, 18.8% and 22.4%, respectively. In women with known causes of infertility, worst case (best case) predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years varied between 31.6% (35.0%), 29.0% (31.6%), 23.1% (25.2%), 17.2% (19.4%) and 10.3% (12.3%) for tubal infertility and 34.3% (39.2%), 31.6% (35.3%) 25.2%(28.5%) 18.3% (21.3%), and 11.3% (14.1%) for male factor infertility. The corresponding values in those treated immediately were 31.7%, 29.8%, 24.5%, 19.0% and 11.7% for tubal factor and 34.4%, 32.4%, 26.7%, 20.2% and 12.8% in male factor infertility. In women with unexplained infertility the predicted chances of livebirth after a delay of 6 months followed by one complete IVF cycle were 41.0%, 36.6%, 29.4%, 22.4% and 15.1% in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively, compared to 34.9%, 32.5%, 26.9%, 20.7% and 13.2% in similar groups of women treated without any delay. The additional waiting period, which provided more time for spontaneous conception, was predicted to increase the relative number of babies born by 17.5%, 12.6%, 9.1%, 8.4% and 13.8%, in women aged <30, 30-35, 36-37, 38-39 and 40-42 years, respectively. A 12-month delay showed a similar pattern in all subgroups. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Major sources of uncertainty include the use of prediction models generated in different populations and the need for a number of assumptions. Although the models are validated and the bases for the assumptions are robust, it is impossible to eliminate the possibility of imprecision in our predictions. Therefore, our predicted live birth rates need to be validated in prospective studies to confirm their accuracy. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A delay in starting IVF reduces success rates in all couples. For the first time, we have shown that while this results in fewer babies in older women and those with a known cause of infertility, it has a less detrimental effect on couples with unexplained infertility, some of whom conceive naturally whilst waiting for treatment. Post COVID 19, clinics planning a phased return to normal clinical services should prioritise older women and those with a known cause of infertility.

The study provides an insight into biomolecular interactions to understand the inhibitory mechanism and the spatial orientation of the tested ligands and further, identification of key amino acid residues within the substrate-binding pocket that can be applied for structure-based drug design. In this regard, we carried out molecular docking studies of chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), remdesivir (RDV), GS441524, arbidol (ARB), and natural product glycyrrhizin (GA) using AutoDock 4.2 tool. To study the drug-receptor complex's stability, selected docking possesses were further subjected to molecular dynamics studies with Schrodinger software. The prediction of ADMET/toxicity properties was carried out on ADMET Prediction?. The docking studies suggested a potential role played by CYS145, HIS163, and GLU166 in the interaction of molecules within the active site of COVID-19 M(pro). In the docking studies, RDV and GA exhibited superiority in binding with the crystal structure of M(pro) over the other selected molecules in this study. Spatial orientations of the molecules at the active site of M(pro) exposed the significance of S1CS4 subsites and surrounding amino acid residues.

While some SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals present as asymptomatic, others exhibit mild symptoms that may include fever, cough, chills, and unusual symptoms like loss of taste and smell and reddening in the extremities (e.g., \\"COVID toes\\", suggestive of microvessel damage). Still others alarm healthcare providers with extreme and rapid onset of high-risk indicators of mortality that include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ hypercoagulation, hypoxia and cardiovascular damage. Researchers are quickly refocusing their science to address this enigmatic virus that seems to unveil itself in new ways without discrimination. As investigators begin to identify early markers of disease, identification of common threads with other pathologies may provide some clues. Interestingly, years of research in the field of radiation biology documents the complex multi-organ nature of another disease state that occurs after exposure to high doses of radiation: the acute radiation syndrome (ARS). Inflammation is a key common player in COVID-19 and ARS, and drives the multi-system damage that dramatically alters biological homeostasis. Both conditions initiate a cytokine storm, with similar pro-inflammatory molecules increased and other anti-inflammatory molecules decreased. These changes manifest in a variety of ways, with a demonstrably higher health impact in patients having underlying medical conditions. The potentially dramatic human impact of ARS has guided the science that has identified many biomarkers of radiation exposure, established medical management strategies for ARS, and led to the development of medical countermeasures for use in the event of a radiation public health emergency. These efforts can now be leveraged to help elucidate mechanisms of action of COVID-19 injuries.

Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in retinal organoids, as it is shown to infect different retinal lineages, such as retinal ganglion cells and photoreceptors. SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids also induces the expression of several inflammatory genes, such as interleukin 33, a gene associated with acute COVID-19 disease and retinal degeneration. Finally, we show that the use of antibodies to block the ACE2 receptor significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of retinal organoids, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infects retinal cells in an ACE2-dependent manner.

A 66-year-old female presented to our hospital with a 3-day history of fever with coughing, white sputum, runny nose and dizziness. She had contacted with a COVID-19 patient, her daughter-in-law who was diagnosed with COVID-19 two days before. Chest CT showed typical COVID-19 CT imaging. She was diagnosed with COVID-19 by positive nucleic acid test. The second case was a 50-year-old male with a 2-day history of fever and dry coughing. He denied having been to Wuhan. Chest CT also showed typical COVID-19 CT imaging. He accepted COVID-19 nucleic acid test using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of his throat swab sampling 7 times and the test results remained controversial. Eventually, he was diagnosed with COVID-19 after 5 days.

By using representational similarity analysis (RSA), this study examined information representation in the VWFA at the individual level and the modulatory effect of reading task. Twenty-four subjects were scanned while performing the explicit (i.e., the naming task) and implicit (i.e., the perceptual task) reading tasks. Activation analysis showed that the naming task elicited greater activation in regions related to phonological processing (e.g., the bilateral prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal cortex), while the perceptual task recruited greater activation in visual cortex and default mode network (e.g., the bilateral middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, and the right middle temporal gyrus). More importantly, RSA also showed that task modulated information representation in the bilateral anterior occipitotemporal cortex and VWFA. Specifically, ROI-based RSA revealed enhanced orthographic and phonological representations in the bilateral anterior fusiform cortex and VWFA in the naming task relative to the perceptual task. These results suggest that lexical representation in the VWFA is influenced by the demand of phonological processing, which supports the interactive account of the VWFA.","output":"Task modulates the orthographic and phonological representations in the bilateral ventral Occipitotemporal cortex"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is a multisystemic condition that presents with different signs and symptoms.

Patients self-collected a midturbinate nasal flocked swab from their right nostril following written instructions. A second swab was then collected by an HCW from the left nostril. Swabs were tested for influenza A and B viruses by real-time reverse transcriptionCpolymerase chain reaction, and percent concordance between collection methods was determined. RESULTS: Of the 72 paired specimens analyzed, 25 were positive for influenza A or B RNA by at least one of the collection methods (34.7% positivity rate). When the 14 patients who had prior health care training were excluded, the qualitative agreement between collection methods was 94.8% (55 of 58). Two of the 58 specimens (3.4%) from patients without health care training were positive only by HCW collection, and 1 of 58 (1.7%) was positive only by patient self-collection. A total of 53.4% of patients (31 of 58) preferred the self-collection method over the HCW collection, and 25.9% (15 of 58) had no preference.

Lack of resources, both human and material, amplifies the likelihood of contamination in these facilities where a single employee can contaminate dozens of residents and colleagues. Improving the dissemination of and adhesion to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines is therefore essential. Serious games have been shown to be effective in developing knowledge and in increasing engagement, and could motivate nursing home employees to change their IPC practices. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the impact of Escape COVID-19, a serious game designed to enhance knowledge and application of IPC procedures, on the intention of nursing home employees to change their IPC practices. METHODS: We will carry out a web-based randomized controlled trial following the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth) guidelines and incorporating relevant elements of CHERRIES (Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys). Participants will be randomized to either the control or the serious game (intervention) group. First, both groups will be asked to answer a questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge. The control group will then receive a quick reminder of the current national guidelines and links to IPC guidelines for health care professionals, while the other group will play the game. Both groups will then have to answer a second questionnaire designed to assess their willingness to change their IPC practices after having followed their respective material. After completing this questionnaire, they will be granted access to the material presented to the group they were not assigned to and receive a course completion certificate. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants willing to change their IPC practices according to group. Secondary outcomes will include the analysis of specific questions detailing the exact changes considered by the participants. Factors associated with participant willingness or reluctance to change behavior will also be assessed. Attrition will also be assessed at each stage of the study. RESULTS: The study protocol has been presented to our regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01262), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research.

Missing values occur because of various factors like missing completely at random, missing at random or missing not at random. All these may result from system malfunction during data collection or human error during data pre-processing. Nevertheless, it is important to deal with missing values before analysing data since ignoring or omitting missing values may result in biased or misinformed analysis. In literature there have been several proposals for handling missing values. In this paper, we aggregate some of the literature on missing data particularly focusing on machine learning techniques. We also give insight on how the machine learning approaches work by highlighting the key features of missing values imputation techniques, how they perform, their limitations and the kind of data they are most suitable for. We propose and evaluate two methods, the k nearest neighbor and an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on the random forest algorithm. Evaluation is performed on the Iris and novel power plant fan data with induced missing values at missingness rate of 5% to 20%.

Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted.

In addition, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during chemotherapy induces drug resistance and severe intestinal side effects. In this study, silica-installed ROS scavenging nanoparticles (siRNP) with 50-60 nm in diameter were employed to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of CPT. The solubility of CPT was significantly improved by incorporating it into the core of the nanoparticle, forming CPT-loaded siRNP (CPT@siRNP). The anticancer activity of CPT@siRNP against colorectal cancer cells (C-26) in vitro was significantly improved as compared to free CPT through higher efficiency of intracellular internalization and induction of apoptosis. Owing to its antioxidant properties, CPT@siRNP reduced cytotoxicity to normal endothelial cells, which was in sharp contrast to the high toxicity of free CPT. Oral administration of CPT and CPT@siRNP to the C-26 tumor-bearing mice exhibited antitumor activity, accompanied by effective suppression of tumor growth. Although CPT treatment suppressed tumor progression, it caused severe side effects, including intestinal damage and significant bodyweight loss. Interestingly, such noticeable side effects were not observed in the mice treated with CPT@siRNP, and the effect of tumor growth inhibition tended to be similar to or higher than that of CPT treatment. The results obtained in this study indicate that CPT@siRNP is a potential therapeutic nanomedicine for the treatment of colon cancer. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Here we employed silica-containing antioxidant nanoparticle (siRNP) as promising oral delivery nanocarrier of campothecine (CPT) to treat colon cancer. The design of siRNP via covalent conjugation of antioxidant nitroxide radicals and the silanol groups in the polymer backbone contributes to a significant increase in the absorption of hydrophobic drug molecules inside the core and enhances the stability of nanoparticles in the gastrointestinal environment for oral drug delivery. CPT-loaded siRNP (CPT@siRNP) significantly improved solubility of CPT. As compared to free CTP, the CPT@siRNP treatment showed a significantly higher toxicity to colon cancer cell, inhibition of cancer cell migration, and induction of apopotosis. With the antioxidant feature, siRNP also significantly suppressed the intestinal side effects caused by CPT treatment in tumor-bearing mouse model.","output":"A silica-based antioxidant nanoparticle for oral delivery of Camptothecin which reduces intestinal side effects while improving drug efficacy for colon cancer treatment."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The knowledge of hagiography and hagiotherapy still plays an important role in the history of science, especially when focusing on specific aspects of history.

We aimed to further expand theoretical and practical knowledge in bioinformatics-driven virome studies by focusing on short, virus-like DNA sequences in metagenomic data. Analyses of datasets obtained from different sample types (terrestrial, animal and human related samples) and origins showed that coronavirus-like sequences have existed in host-associated and environmental samples before the current COVID-19 pandemic. In the analyzed datasets, various Betacoronavirus-like sequences were detected that also included SARS-CoV-2 matches. Deepening analyses indicated that the detected sequences are not of viral origin and thus should not be considered in virome profiling approaches. Our study confirms the importance of parameter selection, especially in terms of read length, for reliable virome profiling.

Quantitative detection performance of the model was compared with three radiological residents with two experienced radiologists reading reports as reference standard by assessing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. RESULTS: Of 96 patients, 88 had pneumonia lesions on CT images and 8 had no abnormities on CT images. For per-patient basis, the algorithm showed superior sensitivity of 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95, 1.00) and F1 score of 0.97 in detecting lesions from CT images of COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

The median volume of lesions calculated by algorithm was 40.10 cm(3). An average running speed of 20.3 s  5.8 per case demonstrated the algorithm was much faster than the residents in assessing CT images (all p < 0.017). The deep learning algorithm can also assist radiologists make quicker diagnosis (all p < 0.0001) with superior diagnostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm showed excellent performance in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CT images compared with resident radiologists. KEY POINTS: ? The higher sensitivity of deep learning model in detecting COVID-19 pneumonia were found compared with radiological residents on a per-lobe and per-patient basis. ? The deep learning model improves diagnosis efficiency by shortening processing time. ? The deep learning model can automatically calculate the volume of the lesions and whole lung.

Some body postures function as amplifiers, a class of signals that increase the detection likelihood of other signals. While foraging on the ground, bonobos (Pan paniscus) can adopt different crouching postures exposing more or less of their genital area. To our knowledge, their potential functional role in the sociosexual life of bonobos has not been assessed yet. Here we show, by analysing more than 2,400 foraging events in 21 captive bonobos, that mature females adopt a rear-exposing posture (forelimb-crouch) and do so significantly more often when their anogenital region is swollen than during the non-swollen phase. In contrast, mature males almost completely avoid this posture. Moreover, this strong difference results from a diverging ontogeny between males and females since immature males and females adopt the forelimb-crouch at similar frequencies. Our findings suggest that the forelimb-crouch posture may play a communicative role of amplification by enhancing the visibility of female sexual swellings, a conspicuous signal that is very attractive for both males and females. Given the high social relevance of this sexual signal, our study emphasizes that postural signalling in primates probably deserves more attention, even outside of reproductive contexts.","output":"Foraging postures are a potential communicative signal in female bonobos"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, has affected Israel along with most other nations during the current global pandemic.

Past evidence shows that the relationship between anxiety and depression with coronary artery disease can be bidirectional. There is a paucity of literature on the association of levels of anxiety and depression with the number of coronary arteries involved in coronary artery disease. Methods This study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital to find the level of anxiety and depression in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization and their association with the numbers of the major coronary artery involved. Patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in the Department of Cardiovascular Science of a tertiary care hospital in India from May 2020 to December 2020 were considered for inclusion in the study. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed based on the combination of clinical, ECG, echocardiography, or biomarker parameters in various combinations. These patients were further subjected to coronary angiogram to know the extent of stenosis and the number of coronary vessels involved in the disease. The level of anxiety and depression was measured by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) during the period of admission and at least 24 hours after diagnosis and at least 12 hours before cardiac catheterization. The data was entered into SPSS software version 22.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.) for statistical analysis. Chi-square test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for the interpretation of data and find an association between severity of anxiety and depression with the number of major coronary vessels involved. Results Anxiety was seen in 83.3% of the patients with 31.5% having severe anxiety. Depression was found in 77.8% with 38.9% suffering from severe depression. The anxiety and depression scores of HADS were significantly higher in those with triple-vessel disease compared to the double-vessel or single-vessel disease. Conclusion Screening and management of anxiety and depression is an essential part of the care of patients with coronary artery disease.

Silenced circFAM120B experiments were performed to assess its effects on OS in vitro cancer phenotypes and in vivo tumor growth. Then, bioinformatics analyses were used to predict circFAM120B target microRNAs (miRNAs) and associated genes. RESULTS CircFAM120B and the transcription factor, PTBP1 were elevated in OS tissue and cell lines, while miR-1205 was poorly expressed. Silenced circFAM120B significantly suppressed in vitro OS cell proliferation and invasion, and inhibited in vivo tumor growth. CircFAM120B also appeared to function as an miR-1205 sponge, as miR-1205 bound to PTBP1. Interestingly, overexpressed PTBP1 (or miR-1205 inhibition) reversed the inhibitory effects mediated by circFAM120B downregulation in OS cells.

Material and Methods12 professional singers (10 of the Bavarian Radio-Chorus and two freelancers, 7 females and 5 males) were asked to sing the melody of the ode of joy of Beethovens 9th symphony \\"Freude schoner Gotterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium\\" in D-major without masks and afterwards with five different singers masks, all distinctive in their material and proportions. Every task was conducted after inhaling the basic liquid from an e-cigarette. The aerosol dispersion was recorded by three high-definition video cameras during and after the task. The cloud was segmented and the dispersion was analyzed for all three spatial dimensions. Further, the subjects were asked to rate the practicability of wearing the tested masks during singing activities using a questionnaire. ResultsConcerning the median distances of dispersion, all masks were able to decrease the impulse dispersion of the aerosols to the front. In contrast, the dispersion to the sides and to the top was increased. The evaluation revealed that most of the subjects would reject performing a concert with any of the masks. ConclusionAlthough, the results exhibit that the tested masks could be able to reduce the radius of aerosol expulsion for virus-laden aerosol particles, there are more improvements necessary to enable the practical implementations for professional singing.","output":"The effect of singers masks on the impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis and supportive treatments are essential to patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, the current study aimed to determine different patterns of syndromic symptoms and sensitivity and specificity of each of them in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in suspected patients.

METHODS: In this study, the retrospective data of 1,539 patients suspected of COVID-19 were obtained from a local registry under the supervision of the officials at Shahroud University of Medical Sciences, Shahroud, Iran. A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was carried out on syndromic symptoms, and the associations of some risk factors and latent subclasses were accessed using one-way analysis of variance and Chi-square test. RESULTS: The LCA indicated that there were three distinct subclasses of syndromic symptoms among the COVID-19 suspected patients.

METHODS: PubMed, SciELO, Google Scholar and DOAJ were browsed. KEYWORDS: \\"mask and (SARS or Cov)\\" (1 August 2019 to 12 April 2020). INCLUSION CRITERIA: original research. PRISMA criteria were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-one works were selected. Identified topics: effectiveness of protective equipment/devices (PE) (n = 3), universal wearing of facemasks plus other protective measures in the community (n = 3), impact of infection control measures on hospitals and epidemiological tracing (n = 3), development of new PE (n = 2), sanitisation of facemasks (n = 4), clinical guidance (n = 4) and questionnaires (n = 2). DISCUSSION: It seems that the effectiveness of PE, namely facemasks, is not fully known. Universal wearing of facemasks may be simultaneously recommended with other protective measures. Nosocomial and community infections seem to be preventable. New PE, methods of facemask sanitisation and clinical guidance are emerging, but caution is recommended regarding their adoption, revision and monitoring by international boards and institutions.

MEASURES Three outcome measures operationalised compliance with public health guidelines at T2: self-reported adherence (behavioural), agreement and opposition (attitudinal). At T1, demographics, perceived distress (PHQ-4, crisis of meaning), resources (self-control, meaningfulness), locus of control, conspiracy mentality and social media use were assessed. At T2, situational variables were added (person at risk, infection of close person, fear of infection, COVID-19 stress). Temporal shifts from T1 to T2 were examined as complementary information. RESULTS An attitude-behaviour gap at T2 was identified, as agreement with and opposition to the guidelines were only modestly correlated with adherence to them. Measures of personal concern (fear of infection, person at risk) were associated with both adherence and positive attitudes towards the measures. COVID-19 stress and conspiracy mentality predicted negative attitudes, but not adherence. Age predicted adherence positively, social media use negatively.

In response, public-health authorities in many countries have advocated for a strategy of using the vaccines to limit morbidity and mortality while permitting unchecked SARS-CoV-2 spread (\\"learning to live with the disease\\"). The feasibility of this strategy is critically dependent on the infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19. An expectation exists, both in the lay public and in the scientific community, that future waves of the virus will exhibit decreased IFR, either due to viral attenuation or the progressive buildup of immunity. In this work, we examine the basis for that expectation, assessing the impact of virulence on transmission. Our findings suggest that large increases in virulence for SARS-CoV-2 would result in minimal loss of transmission, implying that the IFR may be free to increase or decrease under neutral evolutionary drift. We further examine the effect of changes in the IFR on the steady-state death toll under conditions of endemic COVID-19. Our modeling suggests that endemic SARS-CoV-2 implies vast transmission resulting in yearly US COVID-19 death tolls numbering in the hundreds of thousands under many plausible scenarios, with even modest increases in the IFR leading to an unsustainable mortality burden. Our findings thus highlight the critical importance of enacting a concerted strategy (involving for example global access to vaccines, therapeutics, prophylactics and nonpharmaceutical interventions) to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission, thereby reducing the risk of catastrophic outcomes.

Online polls performed without sound scientific rigour do not yield representative results. Yet, both inside and outside Belarus it is of great importance to obtain precise estimates of the ratings of all candidates. These ratings could function as reliable proxies for the election's outcomes. We conduct an independent poll based on the combination of the data collected via Viber and on the streets of Belarus. The Viber and the street data samples consist of almost 45000 and 1150 unique observations respectively. Bayesian regressions with poststratification were build to estimate ratings of the candidates and rates of early voting turnout for the population as a whole and within various focus subgroups. We show that both the officially announced results of the election and early voting rates are highly improbable. With a probability of at least 95%, Sviatlana Tikhanouskaya's rating lies between 75% and 80%, whereas Aliaksandr Lukashenka's rating lies between 13% and 18% and early voting rate predicted by the method ranges from 9% to 13% of those who took part in the election. These results contradict the officially announced outcomes, which are 10.12%, 80.11%, and 49.54% respectively and lie far outside even the 99.9% credible intervals predicted by our model.

Antibody therapeutics hold enormous promise for the treatment of COVID-19. In March 2020, the Chinese Antibody Society, in collaboration with The Antibody Society, initiated the \\"COVID-19 Antibody Therapeutics Tracker\\" (\\"Tracker\\") (https://chineseantibody.org/covid-19-track/) program to track the antibody-based COVID-19 interventions in preclinical and clinical development globally. The data are collected from the public domain and verified by volunteers on an ongoing basis. Here, we present exploratory data analyses and visualization to demonstrate the latest trends of COVID-19 antibody development, based on data for over 150 research and development programs and molecules included in the \\"Tracker\\" as of 8 August 2020. We categorized the data mainly by their targets, formats, development status, developers and country of origin. Although details are limited in some cases, all of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody candidates appear to target the viral spike protein (S protein), and most are full-length monoclonal antibodies. Most of the current COVID-19 antibody therapeutic candidates in clinical trials are repurposed drugs aimed at targets other than virus-specific proteins, while most of these virus-specific therapeutic antibodies are in discovery or preclinical studies. As of 8 August 2020, eight antibody candidates targeting the SARS-CoV-2 S protein have entered clinical studies, including LY-CoV555, REGN-COV2, JS016, TY027, CT-P59, BRII-196, BRII-198 and SCTA01. Ongoing clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies will help define the utility of these antibodies as a new class of therapeutics for treating COVID-19 and future coronavirus infections.","output":"COVID-19 antibody therapeutics tracker: a global online database of antibody therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 has triggered an ongoing global pandemic whereby infection may result in a lethal severe pneumonia-like disease designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths have been reported worldwide, and there are currently no medical countermeasures available to prevent or treat the disease. The purported development of a vaccine could require at least 1-4 years, while the typical timeline from hit finding to drug registration of an antiviral is >10 years. Thus, repositioning of known drugs can significantly accelerate the development and deployment of therapies for COVID-19. To identify therapeutics that can be repurposed as SARS-CoV-2 antivirals, we developed and initiated a high-throughput cell-based screen that incorporates the essential viral papain-like protease (PLpro) and its peptide cleavage site into a luciferase complementation assay to evaluate the efficacy of known drugs encompassing approximately 15,000 clinical-stage or US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved small molecules.

Rex1 promoter-Red Fluorescence Protein reporter ESC were tested by RNAseq after 72hr exposures to control stress hyperosmotic sorbitol under stemness culture (NS) to quantify stress-forced differentiation (SFD) transcriptomic programs. Control ESC cultured with stemness factor removal produced normal differentiation (ND). Bulk RNAseq transcriptomic analysis showed significant upregulation of two genes involved in Covid-19 cell uptake, Vimentin (VIM) and Transmembrane Serine Protease 2 (TMPRSS2). SFD increased the hepatitis A virus receptor (Havcr1) and the transplacental Herpes simplex 1 (HSV1) virus receptor (Pvrl1) compared with ESC undergoing ND. Several other coronavirus receptors, Glutamyl Aminopeptidase (ENPEP) and Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 (DPP4) were upregulated significantly in SFD>ND. Although stressed ESC are more susceptible to infection due to increased expression of viral receptors and decreased resistance, the necessary Covid-19 receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2, was not expressed in our experiments. TMPRSS2, ENPEP, and DPP4 mediate Coronavirus uptake, but are also markers of extra-embryonic endoderm (XEN), which arise from ESC undergoing ND or SFD. Mouse and human ESCs differentiated to XEN increase TMPRSS2 and other Covid-19 uptake-mediating gene expression, but only some lines express ACE2. Covid-19 susceptibility appears to be genotype-specific and not ubiquitous. Of the 30 gene ontology (GO) groups for viral susceptibility, 15 underwent significant stress-forced changes. Of these, 4 GO groups mediated negative viral regulation and most genes in these increase in ND and decrease with SFD, thus suggesting that stress increases ESC viral susceptibility. Taken together, the data suggest that a control hyperosmotic stress can increase Covid-19 susceptibility and decrease viral host resistance in mouse ESC. However, this limited pilot study should be followed with studies in human ESC, tests of environmental, hormonal, and pharmaceutical stressors and direct tests for infection of stressed, cultured ESC and embryos by Covid-19.","output":"Stress Decreases Host Viral Resistance and Increases Covid Susceptibility in Embryonic Stem Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: We performed an audit to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic-related delay in the diagnosis of major cancers at a Pathology Unit of a Secondary Care Hospital Network in Italy.

Anesthesiologists frequently perform virus-aerosolizing procedures, such as intubation and extubation, that place them at increased risk of infection. We sought to determine how the initial COVID-19 outbreak affected members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia (SPA) on both personal and professional levels. Specifically, we examined the potential effects of gender and age on personal stress, burnout, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression, assessed job satisfaction, and explored financial impact. METHODS: After receiving approval from the SPA Committees for Research and Quality and Safety, and the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board, we emailed a questionnaire to all 3,245 SPA members. The survey included 22 questions related to well-being and 13 questions related to effects of COVID-19 on current and future practice, finances, retirement planning, academic time and productivity, and clinical and home responsibilities. To address low initial response rates and quantify nonresponse bias, we sent a shortened follow-up survey to a randomly selected subsample (n=100) of SPA members who did not respond to the initial survey. Response differences between the two cohorts were determined. RESULTS: A total of 561 (17%) members responded to the initial questionnaire. Because of COVID-19, 21.7% of respondents said they would change their clinical responsibilities and 10.6% would decrease their professional working time. Women were more likely than men to anticipate a future COVID-19-related job change (OR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.63, P = 0.011), perhaps because of increased home responsibilities (OR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.74 to 4.00, P <0.001). Additionally, 14.2% of respondents planned to retire early and 11.9% planned to retire later. Women and non-whites had higher likelihoods of burnout on univariate analysis (OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.94, P = 0.026 and OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.08 to 3.04, P = 0.017, respectively) and 25.1% of all respondents felt socially isolated. In addition, both changes in retirement planning and future occupational planning were strongly associated with total job satisfaction scores (both P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the personal and professional lives of pediatric anesthesiologists, albeit not equally, as women and non-whites have been disproportionately impacted. The pandemic has significantly affected personal finances, home responsibilities, and retirement planning, reduced clinical and academic practice time and responsibilities, and increased feelings of social isolation, stress, burnout, and depression/anxiety.","output":"The effects of COVID-19 on pediatric anesthesiologists: A survey of the members of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is the most informative pandemic in history.

METHODS: Modeling of the lag between diagnosis and death is done by using two classes of macroscopic analytical methods: the correlation-based methods based on Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlation coefficients, and the logarithmic methods of two types. Also, we apply eight weighted average methods to smooth the time series before calculating the distance. We consider five lags with the least distance. All the computations are conducted on Matlab R2015b. RESULTS: The length of hospitalization for the fatal cases in the USA, Italy, and Germany are 2C10, 1C6, and 5C19 days, respectively. Overall, this length in the USA is two days more than in Italy and five days less than in Germany. CONCLUSION: We take the distance between the diagnosis and death as the length of hospitalization. There is a negative association between the length of hospitalization and the case fatality rate. Therefore, the estimation of the length of hospitalization by using these macroscopic mathematical methods can be introduced as an indicator to scale the success of the countries fighting the ongoing pandemic.","output":"Comparing Length of Hospital Stay during COVID-19 Pandemic in the USA, Italy, and Germany"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are appreciable players in gene expression regulation in human cells.

However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3  4 analysis of variance.

The portal of entry for the virus is peptidase ACE2, a major key player of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), resulting in severe lung injury. Although COVID-19 mainly manifests as an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there is increasing evidence of neurological symptoms in patients infected by COVID-19. Yet, there is limited understanding of how COVID-19 impacts the central nervous system (CNS). We speculate that such neurological symptoms maybe a consequence of a dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with our central hypothesis that the neurological effects of SARS CoV-2 are driven by chronic hypoxic stress-impaired ACE2 at the BBB. METHODS An in-vitro human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) BBB model was used in the study. Such model was exposed to various levels of hypoxia (1,5 and 10%) for up to 24 hours. In addition, normoxic cells were treated with Angiotensin II (AngII) or Angiotensin 1-7 (degradation by product of AngII by ACE2). Changes in the barrier function was assessed using TEER, permeability to fluorescein and tight junction staining. Changes in ACE2 and MasR expression was assessed by immunofluorescence, whereas ACE2 shedding and HIF-1 alpha expression was assessed by ELISA. RESULTS Mild (10%) hypoxia was sufficient to induce the loss of barrier function. Secretion of ACE2 under hypoxia followed a biphasic pattern, with highest levels at 5% and 10%. Ang II and Ang1-7 had little effect on the barrier function under normoxic condition. The hypoxic exposure induced shedding of the membrane bound ACE2 and molecular mechanism of hypoxic exposure in regulation of ACE2 occurs in a HIF1- dependent manner. DISCUSSION Our preliminary data suggest that our human model of the BBB responds to hypoxia and express critical components of RAAS. Both ACE2 and MasR negatively respond to mild hypoxia followed by a decreased barrier function with no changes in tight junction complex. Such loss was correlated with increased ACE2 shedding in HIF1- dependent manner. We are currently investigating role of Ang 1-7 in rescuing barrier function under hypoxic stress.","output":"Assessing the effects of COVID-19-induced hypoxia and ACE2 signaling on the human blood-brain barrier in-vitro."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE To describe the specific features of the contact history of probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing.

That is accomplished by means of their enzyme activity. Recently, membrane-bound peptidases have also been shown to act as receptors, receiving signals from as yet undefined ligands and transducing them into the cell interior. By using either or both of these mechanisms, peptidases interact with fundamental cellular functions: growth, differentiation, activation and death. This study addressed the effects of a T-cell derived cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-) on the activity of aminopeptidase N (APN), an ectoenzyme processing several signal peptides. Cells of a myelo-monocytic cell line HL-60 were used as a model system, and APN was assayed at the levels of mRNA, its membrane marker CD13, and the enzyme activity. Regulation of CD13/APN by IFN- was found at all three levels. The direction of regulation was time-dependent: an initial down-regulation seen 24 and 48 hrs after the onset of treatment with IFN- was replaced by an up-regulation after 72 and/or 96 hrs. Up-regulation of CD13/APN observed after 96 hrs was preceded by an up-regulation of APN mRNA reaching its maximum after 72 hrs. The IFN--induced regulation of APN was due to membrane aminopeptidase N, since it could be completely abrogated by an APN blocking antibody WM-15. The delayed up-regulation of CD13/APN (observed after 72 and/or 96 hrs), required de novo protein synthesis as it could be abrogated by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Possible role of endogenous (IFN--induced) TGF- in mediating CD13/APN up-regulation could be excluded, since no TGF- was found in supernatants of IFN- treated HL-60 cells. Thus, our data show regulation of CD13/APN on cells of myelo-monocytic origin by a T-cell derived cytokine, IFN-.

Some aspects of this therapy are still unknown, including the optimal timing of administration. OBJECTIVE: This observational study aimed to compare the 90-day mortality in two cohorts of patients when the drug was administered within the first 10 days from onset of symptoms or after day 11. METHODS: Patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who had received tocilizumab were divided into two groups according to when the medication was administered. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, clinical improvement on a 6-item scale by day 6, biomarker improvement by day 6, radiological image improvement by day 10 and SaO2 quotient by day 6. The results in the two groups were compared. Additionally, adverse events relating to tocilizumab were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients were analysed. Both groups were epidemiologically comparable. The results obtained in the primary efficacy variable of the study (90-day mortality) showed a statistically significant difference in the subgroups according to the time of administration of tocilizumab (18.6% vs 5.0%, p=0.048). There was clinical improvement in 24.1% of patients at 6 days, with similar behaviour in both subgroups. No statistically significant differences were found in the percentage of patients who achieved radiological improvement at 10 days or in the other inflammatory parameters, with the exception of significant reductions in lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein. Administration of tocilizumab was not associated with relevant adverse events. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first report of data regarding the timing of administration of tocilizumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. A strategy involving tocilizumab administration after 10 days from onset of symptoms may decrease mortality. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm this emerging hypothesis.","output":"Does timing matter on tocilizumab administration?

METHODS: A cross sectional online survey measured the individual profile, the learning experience in the last academic year and the perceived competences of the first COVID-19 new nursing graduates in two Italian universities. Details relating to employment status and place of employment (Covid-19 versus non-COVID-19 units) one month after graduation were also collected and the data compared with those reported by a similar cohort of new graduates pre-pandemic in 2018C2019. All those who graduated in November 2020 and attended their third year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic were eligible. The online survey included individual, nursing programme and first working experience variables alongside the Nurse Competence Scale (NCS).

CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the first COVID-19 new graduate generation had been employed in COVID-19 units without clinical experience and transition programmes, imposing an ethical debate regarding (a) the role of education in graduating nurses in challenging times with limited clinical placements; and (b) that of nurse managers and directors in ensuring safe transitions for new graduates. Despite the profound clinical placement revision, the first COVID-19 new graduate generation reported competences similar to those of the pre-COVID-19 generation, suggesting that the pandemic may have helped them to optimise the clinical learning process.

Based on relapsing/remitting nature of post-COVID symptoms, the following integrative classification is proposed: potentially infection related-symptoms (up to 4-5 weeks), acute post-COVID symptoms (from week 5 to week 12), long post-COVID symptoms (from week 12 to week 24), and persistent post-COVID symptoms (lasting more than 24 weeks). The most important topic is to establish the time reference points. The classification also integrates predisposing intrinsic and extrinsic factors and hospitalization data which could promote post-COVID symptoms.

One particularly relevant decision-making phenomenon is the prominence effect, where decision-makers base their decisions on the most prominent attribute of the object at hand (e.g., health concerns) rather than weigh all the attributes together. This bias diminishes when the decision-making mode inhibits heuristic processes. In this study, we tested the prominence of health vs. economic concerns across two decision-making modes - choice (prone to heuristics) and matching (mitigates heuristics) - during the peak of the COVID-19 in the UK using Tversky et al.'s classic experimental paradigm. We added to the classic experimental design a priming condition. Participants were presented with two casualty-minimization programs, differing in lives saved and costs: program X would save 100 lives at the cost of 55-million-pound sterling, whereas program Y would save 30 lives at the cost of 12-million-pound sterling. Half of the participants were required to choose between the programs (choice condition). The other half were not given the cost of program X and were asked to determine what the cost should be to make it as equally attractive as the program Y. Participants in both groups were primed for either: a) economic concerns; b) health concerns; or c) control (no priming). Results showed that in the choice condition, unless primed for economic concerns, health concerns are more prominent. In the matching condition, on the other hand, the prominence of health concerns did not affect decision-makers, as they all \\"preferred\\" the cheaper option.

In this study, we have aimed to delineate CAD-specific epigenetic signatures by investigating the methylation and expression of 11 candidate genes i.e. ABCG1, LIPC, PLTP, IL-6, TNF-, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, F2RL3, FGF2, P66 and TGFBR3. The methylation-specific PCR and qRT-PCR were used to assess the methylation status and the expression of candidate genes, respectively. CAD patients showed the upregulation of IL-6, TNF-, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, F2RL3, FGF2, P66, and TGFBR3. Hypomethylation of CDKN2A loci was shown to increase risk for CAD by 1.79-folds (95% CI 1.22-2.63). Classification and regression tree (CART) model of gene expression showed increased risk for CAD with F2RL3 > 3.4-fold, while demonstrating risk reduction with F2RL3 < 3.4-fold and IL-6 < 7.7-folds. This CAD prediction model showed the excellent sensitivity (0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.00), specificity (0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.92), positive predictive value (0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.84), and negative predictive value (0.99, 95% CI 0.94-1.00) with an overall accuracy of 92.8% (95% CI 87.0-94.1%). Folate and B12 deficiencies were observed in CAD cases, which were shown to contribute to hypomethylation and upregulation of the prime candidate genes i.e. CDKN2A and F2RL3. Early onset diabetes was associated with IL-6 and TNF- hypomethylation and upregulation of CDKN2A. The expression of F2RL3 and IL-6 (or) hypomethylation status at CDKN2A locus are potential biomarkers in CAD risk prediction. Early epigenetic imprints of CAD were observed in early onset diabetes.

This study is the first to assess its mental health impact across the lifespan in the United States in adolescents, adults, and health care workers. METHODS: We recruited 4909 participants through an online survey advertising on Facebook and Instagram to assess exposure to COVID-19 and psychiatric symptoms from April 27 to July 13. We also recruited through the University of Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and other health care systems around Pittsburgh. The primary outcomes were clinically significant depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, suicidal ideation or behavior, and grief reactions since COVID-19. RESULTS: Adolescents were significantly more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of depression (55% vs. 29%; &#967;2 = 122, df = 1; p < .001), anxiety (48% vs. 29%; &#967;2 = 73; df = 1; p < .001), PTSD (45% vs. 33%; &#967;2 = 12; df = 1; p < .001), suicidal ideation or behavior (38% vs. 16%; &#967;2 = 117; df = 1; p < .001), and sleep problems (69% vs. 57%; &#967;2 = 26; df = 1; p < .001) compared to adults. The rates of intense grief reactions among those who lost someone to COVID-19 was 55%. Loneliness was the most common predictor across outcomes and higher number of hours spent on social media and exposure to media about COVID-19 predicted depression symptoms and suicidal ideation or behavior in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased rates of clinically significant psychiatric symptoms.

Complex fistulae include those after failed repair attempts, radiotherapy, measuring  2 cm, located in the trigone, or with concomitant ureteric strictures or fistulae. We aimed to describe a technique for the robotic repair of a complex VVF using a vaginal cuff flap. METHODS A 56-year-old woman with a history of ovarian debulking surgery and radiotherapy underwent repair for VVF and rectovaginal fistula. In lithotomy, cystoscopy was performed for fistulous tract cannulation. Port placement, extensive adhesiolysis, and robot docking followed. The vaginal apex was dissected, the VVF excised, and the bladder closed. The rectum was separated from the posterior vaginal wall, the rectovaginal fistula excised, and the rectum closed. A vaginal cuff flap was harvested and interposed between the bladder and the vagina. RESULTS Operative time was 9 h, estimated blood loss was 300 cc, and no intraoperative complications occurred. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8. Further management included 37 sessions in a hyperbaric chamber and a transvesical endoluminal bladder closure 10 months after the initial surgery.

Nanobodies (single-domain antibodies, VHH) are the smallest antibody-based fragments possessing ideal molecular imaging properties, such as high target specificity and rapid background clearance. We developed a novel anti-PSMA Nanobody (JVZ-007) for targeted imaging and therapy of PCa. Here, we report on the application of the (111)In-radiolabeled Nanobody for SPECT/CT imaging of PCa. METHODS A Nanobody library was generated by immunization of a llama with 4 human PCa cell lines. Anti-PSMA Nanobodies were captured by biopanning on PSMA-overexpressing cells. JVZ-007 was selected for evaluation as an imaging probe. JVZ-007 was initially produced with a c-myc-hexahistidine (his) tag allowing purification and detection. The c-myc-his tag was subsequently replaced by a single cysteine at the C terminus, allowing site-specific conjugation of chelates for radiolabeling. JVZ-007-c-myc-his was conjugated to 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (p-SCN-DTPA) via the lysines, whereas JVZ-007-cys was conjugated to maleimide-DTPA via the C-terminal cysteine. PSMA targeting was analyzed in vitro by cell-binding experiments using flow cytometry, autoradiography, and internalization assays with various PCa cell lines and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). The targeting properties of radiolabeled Nanobodies were evaluated in vivo in biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging experiments, using nude mice bearing PSMA-positive PC-310 and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors. RESULTS JVZ-007 was successfully conjugated to DTPA for radiolabeling with (111)In at room temperature. (111)In-JVZ007-c-myc-his and (111)In-JVZ007-cys internalized in LNCaP cells and bound to PSMA-expressing PDXs and, importantly, not to PSMA-negative PDXs and human kidneys. Good tumor targeting and fast blood clearance were observed for (111)In-JVZ-007-c-myc-his and (111)In-JVZ-007-cys. Renal uptake of (111)In-JVZ-007-c-myc-his was initially high but was efficiently reduced by coinjection of gelofusine and lysine. The replacement of the c-myc-his tag by the cysteine contributed to a further reduction of renal uptake without loss of targeting. PC-310 tumors were clearly visualized by SPECT/CT with both tracers, with low renal uptake (<4 percentage injected dose per gram) for (111)In-JVZ-007-cys already at 3 h after injection. CONCLUSION We developed an (111)In-radiolabeled anti-PSMA Nanobody, showing good tumor targeting, low uptake in nontarget tissues, and low renal retention, allowing excellent SPECT/CT imaging of PCa within a few hours after injection.","output":"A Novel 111In-Labeled Anti-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Nanobody for Targeted SPECT/CT Imaging of Prostate Cancer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A surveillance system that uses census tract resolution and the SaTScan prospective space-time scan statistic detected clusters of increasing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 test percent positivity in New York City, NY, USA.

ObjectiveEvaluate the immune response to COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in healthcare workers (HCWs) who recovered from a SARS-CoV-2 infection. DesignMulticentric observational prospective cohort study of HCWs with a PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection designed to evaluate the dynamics of T and B cells immune responses to primary infection and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination over 12 months. ParticipantsUnvaccinated HCWs with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were selected based on the presence or absence of symptoms at infection and serostatus at enrollment. Age- and sex-matched adults not infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to vaccination were included as naive controls. ExposureVaccination with Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Immunity score (zero to three), before and after vaccination, based on anti-RBD IgG ratio, serum capacity to neutralize live virus and IFN-{gamma} secretion capacity in response to SARS-CoV-2 peptide pools above the positivity threshold for each of the three assays. We compared the immunity score between groups based on subjects symptoms at diagnosis and/or serostatus prior to vaccination. ResultsNone of the naive participants (n=14) showed a maximal immunity score of three following one dose of vaccine compared to 84% of the previously infected participants (n=55). All recovered individuals who did not have an immunity score of three were seronegative prior to vaccination, and 67% had not reported symptoms resulting from their initial infection. Following one dose of vaccine, their immune responses were comparable to naive individuals, with significantly weaker responses than those who were symptomatic during infection. Conclusions and RelevanceIndividuals who did not develop symptoms during their initial SARS-CoV-2 infection and were seronegative prior to vaccination present immune responses comparable to that of naive individuals. These findings highlight the importance of administering the complete two-dose primary regimen and following boosters of mRNA vaccines to individuals who experienced asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. KEY POINTS QuestionIs a single dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine sufficient to induce robust immune responses in individuals with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection? FindingsIn this cohort of 55 health care workers previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, we show that the absence of symptoms during initial infection and negative serostatus prior to vaccination predict the strength of immune responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Lack of symptoms and a negative serostatus prior to vaccination leads to immune responses comparable to naive individuals.

Using an integrated approach to assess nasopharyngeal immunity, we identify a local mucosal defect in type 2 cytokines, mucus production and a selective local IgA deficiency in HSCT-treated SCID patients with genetic defects in IL2RG/GC or JAK3. These patients have a reduction in IgA-coated nasopharyngeal bacteria and exhibit microbial dysbiosis with increased pathobiont carriage.

Sentiment analysis is an approach that can assist in this regard as it categorizes sentiments of reviews into positive and negative results. In this study, we perform experiments for the worlds big six companies and classify their employees reviews based on their sentiments.

RV-SGDC is a combination of logistic regression, support vector machines, and stochastic gradient descent. We combined these models under a majority voting criteria. We also used other machine learning models in the performance comparison of RV-SGDC.

Organisms of Arctic and Antarctic oceans are prolific sources of natural products, exhibiting wide structural diversity and remarkable bioactivities for human applications. Chemical skeletons belonging to terpene families are the most commonly found compounds, whereas cytotoxic antimicrobial properties, the capacity to prevent infections, are the most widely reported activities from these environments. This review firstly summarizes the regulations on access and benefit sharing requirements for research in polar environments. Then it provides an overview of the natural product arsenal from Antarctic and Arctic marine organisms that displays promising uses for fighting human disease. Microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, and macroorganisms, such as sponges, macroalgae, ascidians, corals, bryozoans, echinoderms and mollusks, are the main focus of this review. The biological origin, the structure of terpenes and terpenoids, derivatives and their biotechnological potential are described.

STUDY DESIGN A prospective observational study. METHODS One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients underwent FA or F/I. After application of the exclusion criteria, 67 patients (28 underwent FA, 39 underwent F/I) were included in the study. During angiography, SpO2 was measured by using a pulse oximeter and recording each second. The arm-to-retina circulation time (ARCT) was measured on the angiography video images. Latency time was defined as the time from intravenous injection of the dye to observation of a 3% decrease in the SpO2 reading, and variation SpO2, as the difference between baseline SpO2 and the lowest SpO2 value. RESULTS The mean variation SpO2 was - 1.0  0.6 during FA, and - 6.1  1.5 during F/I. Variation SpO2 was within 2% during FA and > 3% during F/I. No corresponding changes were observed in the other vital signs or subjective symptoms. The mean latency time was 33.3  6.4 s. Latency time was positively correlated with the ARCT in the F/I group (rs = 0.766, P < .001). CONCLUSION Reductions in SpO2 readings were identified during F/I, but not during FA.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying cognitive student engagement in distance learning has been a challenge in higher education institutions. In this study, we implemented a non-self-report method assessing students heart rate data to identify the cognitive engagement during active learning activities. Additionally, as a supplementary tool, we applied a previously validated self-report method. This study was performed in distance learning lessons on a group of university students in Bogota, Colombia. After data analysis, we validated five hypotheses and compared the results from both methods. The results confirmed that the heart rate assessment had a statistically significant difference with respect to the baseline during active learning activities, and this variance could be positive or negative. In addition, the results show that if students are previously advised that they will have to develop an a new task after a passive learning activity (such as a video projection), their heart rate will tend to increase and consequently, their cognitive engagement will also increase.

In addition, pulses are affordable and shelf-stable. The combination of these factors, an elevated consumer interest in plant-based diets, and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased purchasing of pulses and even empty grocery store shelves. Although pulses have many associated benefits, some consumers are hesitant to regularly eat pulses, claiming concerns of abdominal discomfort or a lack of knowledge on how to best prepare pulses. To capitalize on increased consumer interest and purchasing of pulses, now is the time for outreach efforts that address these concerns and the positive outcomes associated with pulses, thereby promoting public and environmental health. Consumers must actively decide to add pulses to their grocery lists and incorporate them into their regular eating patterns. Motivation to adopt new eating habits is essential because knowledge alone does not result in behavior change.

The lack of herd immunity against this virus and the possibility of viral spread from asymptomatic individuals is still a major challenge for the prevention of viral transmission. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of the virus in different bodily secretions as a potential source of viral spread among patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. STUDY DESIGN: Cross Sectional Study. METHODS: The study included 38 COVID-19 patients with a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result for SARS-CoV-2, obtained from the combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples. Saliva, tear, and cerumen samples were taken from the patients within 72 hours of the first RT-PCR test. SARS-CoV-2 N1 and N2 gene regions were studied with single-step RT-PCR in all samples. RESULTS: Among the studied samples, the highest positivity rate was in saliva (76.3%) followed by tears (55.3%) and cerumen (39.5%). Viral load in saliva was also significantly higher compared to tears and cerumen (P < .001), while there was no significant difference between tears and cerumen. Higher viral load in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swab samples was associated with higher viral load in tears, but not in saliva or cerumen. Half of the saliva, tear, and cerumen samples obtained from asymptomatic patients contained SARS-CoV-2 genome.

Methods: Three foreign databases were used: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. A search was performed using the following search terms: COVID-19, coronavirus, NCOV, physicians, doctors, residents, and burnout. Four rounds of review were performed to enhance the consistency of quality assessment. The Joanna Briggs Institute checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies was used to assess the quality of the eligible studies. Results: A total of 465 studies were identified, of which 32 were selected. The quality assessment determined that 19 studies met the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria and had a low risk of bias. The most common tool used to measure physician burnout in the 32 studies was the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Conclusion: This study systematically evaluated the literature on physician burnout. However, the generalizability of our findings to Korean physicians may be limited.

METHODS We performed a systematic literature search in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science up to June 2019 for studies directly comparing FP-CT with either CTP or MRP in vivo. Methodological quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Data on diagnostic accuracy was extracted and pooled if possible. RESULTS We found 11 studies comparing FP-CT with CTP and 5 studies comparing FP-CT with MRP. Most articles were pilot or feasibility studies, focusing on scanning and contrast protocols. All patients studied showed signs of cerebrovascular disease. Half of the studies were animal trials. Quality assessment showed unclear to high risks of bias and low concerns regarding applicability. Five studies reported on diagnostic accuracy; FP-CT shows good sensitivity (range 0.84-1.00) and moderate specificity (range 0.63-0.88) in detecting cerebral blood volume (CBV) lesions.

However, the deliberate and accidental introduction of invasive alien plants (IAPs) in the Anthropocene majorly due to the global international trade perturbed the homeostasis of our biosphere. IAPs are considered as one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation. The pervasive threats of IAPs to environmental sustainability and biosecurity are further exacerbated under the COVID-19 pandemic. The environmental disturbances resulting from IAPs can be attributed to several mechanisms/hypothesis (e.g., novel weapon (NW), enemy release (ER), and evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA), efficient reproductive attributes, and phenotypic plasticity, etc.) deployed by IAPs. Nevertheless, the interrelationship of IAPs with environmental degradation and restoration remain elusive especially in terms of ecological sustainability. Moreover, there is a dearth of studies which empirically assess the synergies of IAPs spread with other anthropogenic disturbances such as climate and land-use change. In this context, the present review is aimed to depict the impacts of IAPs on environment and also to assess their role as drivers of ecosystem degradation. The restoration prospects targeted to revitalize the associated abiotic (soil and water) and biotic environment (biodiversity) are also discussed in detail. Furthermore, the effects of IAPs on socio-economy, livelihood, and plant-soil microbe interactions are emphasized. On the other hand, the ecosystem services of IAPs such as associated bioresource co-benefits (e.g., bioenergy, phytoremediation, biopolymers, and ethnomedicines) can also be vital in sustainable management prospects. Nevertheless, IAPs-ecological restoration interrelationship needs long-term pragmatic evaluation in terms of ecological economics and ecosystem resilience. The incorporation of hybrid technologies, integrating modern scientific information (e.g., biorefinery: conversion of IAPs feedstock to produce bioenergy/biopolymers) with traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) can safeguard the environmental sustainability in the Anthropocene. Importantly, the management of IAPs in concert with circular economy principles can remarkably help achieving the target of UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN-Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.","output":"Environmental Degradation by Invasive Alien Plants in the Anthropocene: Challenges and Prospects for Sustainable Restoration"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"English Abstract: This study has two main research objectives. First, the study evaluates the possibility of cooperation between Korea and China and proposes a number of cooperative projects, based on Chinaa?s cooperation with ASEAN, which is mainly strengthened through bilateral initiatives, particularly in the sustainable environment sector. Second, under the New Southern Policy, this study derives cooperation strategies for ASEAN in the field of environmental sustainability. Keeping the COVID-19 pandemic that is sweeping the entire world and the emerging security trend of prioritizing state sovereignty in mind, we actively seek to address human security concerns in major governmental policies, prioritizing human life and dignity. While the New Southern Policy puts an emphasis on humanity, the goal of a sustainable environment a which has a direct impact on human life a has not been properly established in the policy. As Koreaa?s past ASEAN policy was focused on economic profit and market acquisition, it is now crucial to build trust in the relationship with ASEAN through a human-centered approach, and to expand cooperation across broader areas. The outcome of this study will prepare measures to promote cooperation with ASEAN, which is an important component of the New Southern PolicyThe major content of this study is as follows. Chapters 2 and 3 respectively analyze the overview and outcome of China-ASEAN environmental cooperation, and the overview and outcome of Korea-ASEAN environmental cooperation after 2010. Specifically, Chapter 2 describes Chinaa?s strategy with regard to environmental cooperation with ASEAN, and summarizes the overview of ASEAN cooperation and the major cooperation mechanisms. Based on these, this study identifies the outcomes and limitations of China-ASEAN environmental cooperation. The outcomes of China-ASEAN environ- mental cooperation include the launching and operation of the China- ASEAN Environmental Cooperation Center, reaching an agreement and adopting a policy concerning green development, operating the China-ASEAN Environmental Information Sharing Platform, establishing Lancang-Mekong Sustainable Infrastructure and Green Investment and Financing, and fostering active technological cooperation and human resources exchanges with ASEAN. Despite the above mentioned outcomes of China-ASEAN cooperation in the sustainable environment sector, there still remain a number of limitations in this cooperation. First of all, overseas projects based on the Chinaa?s Belt and Road Initiative follow low socio-environmental guidelines, or lack mandatory regulations. For these reasons, the lack of environmental consideration in the process of building the infrastructure has caused environmental pollution and destruction in the recipient countries, provoking the continued opposition of local communities. In addition to the complaints about environmental pollution and destruction, overseas projects are funded by Chinese capitals, laborers, companies. This does not bring much in the form of tangible benefits to the governments and nations involved in the Chinaa?s Belt and Road Initiative, resulting in a backlash among those recipient countries. In addition, there is a considerable gap between China and ASEAN countries in terms of their views on environmental sustainability, and China lacks the capacity to provide environmental assistance. In addition, the financial assistance required for performing ASEAN cooperation is insufficient in China.Chapter 3 presents an overview of Korea-ASEAN cooperation in the area of environmental sustainability, the major cooperation mechanisms, and ODA status in relation to the New Southern Policy. Based on this, it examines the outcomes and limitations of the current status of Korea- ASEAN environmental cooperation. The ROK government has been strengthening the cooperation with ASEAN by hosting 2019 ASEAN- Republic of KOREA Commemorative Summit. The ROK government are also currently operating the New Framew rk for the ASEAN-ROK Cooperation Fund(2017-2020) and ASEAN-Korea Environmental Cooperation Project(AKECOP) across all ASEAN-Korea sectors including environmental cooperation. However, ASEAN-Korea Environmental Cooperation has limitations. For instance, this cooperation lacks strategies that integrate mid-term and long-term plans, and it is not implemented strategically from a mid-toalong-term perspective. In addition, the foundation for cooperation with individual ASEAN countries is relatively poor. The ASEAN cooperation tends to focus only on a few specific countries, including Vietnam. There are lack of consideration for mainstreaming environmental sustainability in the New Southern Policy.Based on this discussion, Chapter 4 presents a SWOT analysis on the current status of ASEAN-China environmental cooperation to explore implementation strategies for Korea-China cooperation and the New Southern Policy. On the basis of this analysis, this study proposes an implementation strategy for Korea-China cooperation and the New Southern Policy in the area of environmental sustainability. Some of the main strengths identify through the SWOT analysis for South Korea are;a favorable public opinion compared to China, ASEAN being our second-largest trade partner and our third-largest investment market (as of 2018), the establishment of the new ASEAN initiative, our active cooperation with ASEAN in the environmental sector, and the relatively richer ODA experience compared to China. The weaknesses are;the lack of organization and a mid-to-long-term plan for the ASEAN-Korea Environmental Cooperation, relatively smaller-scale assistance compared to China and Japan, the relatively poor channels with individual ASEAN countries and unbalanced cooperation and lack of consideration to mainstream environmental sustainability. Opportunity factors have been identified as;the emergence of production and consumption hubs as an alternative to the Chinese market, the agreement of Korea-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement, continued efforts to integrate the ASEAN Economic and Social Community in the region, the governmenta?s strong will for sustainable development following economic growth, and an increased preference for Korea owing to the Hallyu(Korean Wave). Finally, the threats are identified as;intensifying competition due to Chinese expansion to the ASEAN region, high political instability in certain countries, and the lack of governance capacity of ASEAN countries. Based on this SWOT analysis, the environmental sustainability sector for Korea-China cooperation would be the Smart Green City project that combines ICT-based environment and infrastructure. Furthermore, viable strategies under the New Southern Policy are;the human-centered human security approach along with economic consideration, discovering major cooperation priorities in the sustainable environment sector, mainstreaming environmental sustainability in the New Southern Policy, establishing a responsible organization and strategy for the ASEAN-Korea Environmental Cooperation, strengthening Koreaa?s soft power through environmental cooperation, increasing community awareness through bonding with civil society, and establishing a multilateral environmental cooperation system.The final chapter, Chapter 5, describes the main conclusion and limitations of this study.

Two complementary generalization properties of CNNs, translation invariance and equivariance, are particularly useful in detecting manifested abnormalities associated with pulmonary disease, regardless of their spatial locations within the image. However, these properties also come with the loss of exact spatial information and global relative positions of abnormalities detected in local regions. Global relative positions of such abnormalities may help distinguish similar conditions, such as COVID-19 and viral pneumonia. In such instances, a global attention mechanism is needed, which CNNs do not support in their traditional architectures that aim for generalization afforded by translation invariance and equivariance. Vision Transformers provide a global attention mechanism, but lack translation invariance and equivariance, requiring significantly more training data samples to match generalization of CNNs. To address the loss of spatial information and global relations between features, while preserving the inductive biases of CNNs, we present a novel technique that serves as an auxiliary attention mechanism to existing CNN architectures, in order to extract global correlations between salient features.","output":"Pulmonary Disease Classification Using Globally Correlated Maximum Likelihood: an Auxiliary Attention mechanism for Convolutional Neural Networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 is an acute respiratory infection accompanied by pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has affected millions of people globally. To date, there are no highly efficient therapies for this infection. Probiotic bacteria can interact with the gut microbiome to strengthen the immune system, enhance immune responses, and induce appropriate immune signaling pathways. Several probiotics have been confirmed to reduce the duration of bacterial or viral infections. Immune fitness may be one of the approaches by which protection against viral infections can be reinforced. In general, prevention is more efficient than therapy in fighting viral infections. Thus, probiotics have emerged as suitable candidates for controlling these infections. During the COVID-19 pandemic, any approach with the capacity to induce mucosal and systemic reactions could potentially be useful. Here, we summarize findings regarding the effectiveness of various probiotics for preventing virus-induced respiratory infectious diseases, especially those that could be employed for COVID-19 patients.

Structural determinants included race/ethnicity, poverty, insurance status, education, population and household density. We examined which factors were associated with positivity rates, using a 5% test positivity threshold, with spatial analysis and spatial regression. RESULTS: Between 1 March and 30 June 2020 there were 843,440 SARS-CoV-2 tests and 86,383 diagnoses reported, for an overall positivity rate of 10.2% within the study area. Communities with high proportions of Latino/a residents, those living below the federal poverty line and with high household densities had higher crude positivity rates. Age- adjusted diagnosis rates were significantly associated with the proportion of Latino/as, individuals living below the poverty line, population, and household density.

As of July 20, 2020, eligible participants (18 years old, HIV-negative, not on PrEP, not in an HIV vaccine trial, living in Ottawa, no bleeding disorders) could register via www.GetaKit.ca to order kits. OUTCOMES: In the first 6 weeks, 637 persons completed our eligibility screener; 43.3% (n = 276) were eligible. Of eligible participants, 203 completed a baseline survey and 182 ordered a test. These 203 participants were an average of 31 years old, 72.3% were white, 60.4% were cis-male, and 55% self-identified as gay. Seventy-one percent (n = 144) belonged to a priority group for HIV testing. We have results for 70.9% (n = 129/182) of participants who ordered a kit: none were positive, 104 were negative, 22 were invalid, and 2 preferred not to say; 1 participant reported an unreadiness to test. IMPLICATIONS: Our results show that HIV self-testing is a pandemic-friendly strategy to help ensure access to sexual health services among persons who are good candidates for HIV testing. It is unsurprising that no one tested positive for HIV thus far, given the 0.08% positivity rate for HIV testing in Ottawa.

To expand current information on genetic characterization of the first agricultural communities of the southern Calchaqu Valleys, we present and discuss the first mitochondrial ancient DNA information obtained on samples dated to ca. 3,600-1,900 years before present from the Cajn Valley, Catamarca Province. Reproducible mtDNA hypervariable region 1 (HVR-1) sequences were obtained in seven individuals. Mitochondrial HVR-1 haplotypes were assigned to three of the four founding haplogroups, D1 (57.1%), C1 (28.5%), and B2 (14.2%), with absence of A2. Our results show that the Cajn Valley sample, with predominance of D1 and C1, differs from that commonly observed in ancient and modern Andean populations, which usually show a high prevalence of haplogroup B2. The fact that the Cajn Valley and Pampa Grande (Salta Province, Argentina) share a prevalence of haplogroup D1 could provide additional evidence to support possible genetic affinities between the valleys and the eastern sub-Andean region during the Formative Period in Northwest Argentina, expanding the archaeological evidence of contact between both populations.

Our objective was to evaluate the early effects of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3/27/2020-4/10/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). RESULTS: Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: median age was 43 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate personal protective equipment (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p = 0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p = 0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included the degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values <0.01). CONCLUSION: The perceived degree of interference with clinical practice along with personal concerns about COVID-19 were significantly associated with both anxiety and depression among oncology physicians in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.

B. burgdorferi has a limited biosynthetic and metabolic capacity; the linchpin connecting central carbohydrate and lipid metabolism is at the interconversion of glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, catalyzed by GpsA and another glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GlpD. Using a broad metabolomics approach, we found that GpsA serves as a dominant regulator of NADH and glycerol-3-phosphate levels in vitro, metabolic intermediates that reflect the cellular redox potential and serve as a precursor for lipid and lipoprotein biosynthesis, respectively. Additionally, GpsA was required for survival under nutrient stress, regulated overall reductase activity and controlled B. burgdorferi morphology in vitro. Furthermore, during in vitro nutrient stress, both glycerol and N-acetylglucosamine were bactericidal to B. burgdorferi in a GlpD-dependent manner.

Treatment options are limited, and most of the affected cats die or are euthanized. Anecdotally, doxycycline has been used to treat FIP-affected cats, but there are currently no data to support or discourage such treatment. The aim of this study was to establish whether doxycycline inhibits replication of FIPV in vitro. The virus was cultured in Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells with various concentrations of doxycycline (0 to 50 g/mL). The level of FIPV in cultures was determined by virus titration and FCoV-specific reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Cell viability was also monitored. There was no difference in the level of infectious virus or viral RNA between doxycycline-treated and untreated cultures at 3, 12- and 18-hours post-infection. However, at 24 h, the growth of FIPV was inhibited by approximately two logs in cultures with >10 g/mL doxycycline. This inhibition was dose-dependent, with inhibitory concentration 50% (IC(50)) 4.1 g/mL and IC(90) 5.4 g/mL. Our data suggest that doxycycline has some inhibitory effect on FIPV replication in vitro, which supports future clinical trials of its use for the treatment of FIP-affected cats.","output":"In Vitro Effects of Doxycycline on Replication of Feline Coronavirus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The results of surgical procedures for weight loss are often described in terms of the percentage of excess weight lost. Expressing outcomes using the mean and standard deviation might not adequately describe the clinical experience. This could in part be because the use of the mean +/- standard deviation assumes a normal or random distribution of outcomes. It has been our perception that the weight loss results after gastric bypass are relatively normally and tightly distributed around the mean, making it relatively predictable. However, we have found that the results after adjustable gastric banding are more highly variable. In fact, there appears to be 2 groups of patients after this restrictive operation. One group, that is able to work well and does not struggle much against the restriction, accepts the limits that it imposes, and another group, that does not easily learn to deal with the restriction and hence mal-adapts. METHODS To evaluate the validity of our clinical perception, we undertook an analysis of the distribution of weight loss by the percentiles of excess weight lost. All patients with follow-up of > or =1 years after gastric bypass or adjustable banding were evaluated for this analysis. The demographics and percentage of excess weight loss were evaluated. The distribution of the percentage of excess weight loss in 10% increments was evaluated. RESULTS Both groups were similar with respect to the mean patient age. However, the patients in the gastric bypass group had had a significantly greater mean preoperative body mass index and were more likely to be women. As expected, the weight loss of the gastric bypass patients fell in a normal single-peak distribution for < or =5 years of follow-up. The data from the adjustable gastric band patients at 1 year demonstrated a normal single-peak distribution, with a longer rightward tail. At 2 and 3 years postoperatively, the data from the band patients had a 2-peaked curve. CONCLUSION The initial weight loss results after gastric banding are less predictable than those after gastric bypass. A similar analysis of long-term outcomes might be enlightening and assist in making clinical decisions.","output":"Frequency distribution of weight loss percentage after gastric bypass and adjustable gastric banding."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since December 2019, multiple cases of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been reported in Wuhan in China's Hubei Province, a disease which has subsequently spread rapidly across the entire country.

However, the use of face masks among children, especially those aged younger than 3 years, is debated, and the US Centers for Disease Control and American Academy of Physicians recommend the use of face mask only among individuals aged 3 years or older. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the use of surgical facial masks among children is associated with episodes of oxygen desaturation or respiratory distress. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted from May through June 2020 in a secondary-level hospital pediatric unit in Italy. Included participants were 47 healthy children divided by age (ie, group A, aged 24 months, and group B, aged >24 months to 144 months). Data were analyzed from May through June 2020. INTERVENTIONS: All participants were monitored every 15 minutes for changes in respiratory parameters for the first 30 minutes while not wearing a surgical face mask and for the next 30 minutes while wearing a face mask. Children aged 24 months and older then participated in a walking test for 12 minutes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Changes in respiratory parameters during the use of surgical masks were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 47 children, 22 children (46.8%) were aged 24 months or younger (ie, group A), with 11 boys (50.0%) and median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 12.5 (10.0-17.5) months, and 25 children (53.2%) were aged older than 24 months to 144 months or younger, with 13 boys (52.0%) and median (IQR) age 100.0 (72.0-120.0) months.

Despite surgical intervention being the more common treatment for patients suffering ACL ruptures, current management is based on limited and generally low-quality evidence. We describe a statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the ACL SNNAP randomised controlled trial, which aims to investigate the necessity of surgical management in patients with ACL injuries. METHODS/DESIGN: ACL SNNAP is a pragmatic, multi-centre, superiority, parallel-group randomised controlled trial in participants with a symptomatic non-acute ACL deficient knee. Participants are allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either non-surgical management (rehabilitation) or surgical management (reconstruction) with the aim of assessing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness. The primary outcome of the study is the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS4) at 18 months post-randomisation. The KOOS4 score at 18 months will be evaluated using a linear regression model adjusting for recruitment centre and baseline KOOS4 scores, allowing for intra-centre correlation. A secondary analysis of the primary outcome will be carried out using an area under the curve (AUC) approach using treatment estimates obtained from a mixed model using baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months post-randomisation outcome data. Secondary outcomes will be measured at 18 months and will include return to activity/level of sport participation, intervention-related complications, the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, all 5 individual subscales of the KOOS questionnaire, the ACL-QOL score, expectations of return to activity and cost-effectiveness of the interventions. Missing primary outcome data will be investigated through a sensitivity analysis. Full details of the planned methods for the statistical analysis of clinical outcomes are presented in this paper.

We report on the deployment of emergency services for cardiovascular events in a defined region in western Germany during the government-imposed lock-down period. METHODS: We examined 5799 consecutive patients who were treated by emergency services for cardiovascular events during the Covid-19 pandemic (January 1 to April 30, 2020), and compared those to the corresponding time frame in 2019. Examining the emergency physicians records provided by nine locations in the area, we found a 20% overall decline in cardiovascular admissions. RESULTS: The greatest reduction could be seen immediately following the government-imposed social restrictions. This reduction was mainly driven by a reduction in discretionary admissions for dizziness/syncope (-53%), heart failure (-38%), exacerbated COPD (-28%) and unstable angina (-23%), while unavoidable admissions for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and stroke were unchanged. There was a greater decline in emergency admissions for patients 60 years. There was also a greater reduction in emergency admissions for those living in urban areas compared to suburban areas. CONCLUSIONS: During the Covid-19 pandemic, a significant decline in hospitalization for cardiovascular events was observed during the government-enforced shutdown in a predefined area in western Germany. This reduction in admissions was mainly driven by discretionary cardiovascular events (unstable angina, heart failure, exacerbated COPD and dizziness/syncope), but events in which admission was unavoidable (CPR, STEMI and stroke) did not change.","output":"Hospital admissions during Covid-19 lock-down in Germany: Differences in discretionary and unavoidable cardiovascular events"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIMS: : Heart failure (HF) and coronary artery disease (CAD) are independent predictors of death in patients with COVID-19.

The study was a systematic prospective data collection according to a pre-specified protocol. All-cause mortality during hospitalization was the outcome measure. Mean duration of hospitalization was 33 days. Mortality was 11% in the total population and 7.4% in the group without evidence of HF or CAD (reference group). Mortality was 11.6% in the group with CAD and without HF (odds ratio [OR]: 1.6, p=0.120), 15.5% in the group with HF and without CAD (OR: 2.3, p=0.032), and 35.6% in the group with CAD and HF (OR: 6.9, p<0.0001). The risk of mortality in patients with CAD and HF combined was consistently higher than the sum of risks related to either disorder, resulting in a significant synergistic effect (p<0.0001) of the two conditions.

In Italy, like in other countries, old male individuals, with one or more comorbidity, are the most susceptible group, and show, consequently, the highest mortality, and morbidity, including lethal respiratory distress syndrome, as the most common complication. In addition, another extraordinary peculiarity, that is a surprising resistance to COVID-19, characterizes some Italian nonagenarians/centenarians. Despite having the typical COVID-19 signs and/or symptoms, such exceptional individuals show a surprising tendency to recover from illness and complications. On the other hand, long-lived people have an optimal performance of immune system related to an overexpression of anti-inflammatory variants in immune/inflammatory genes, as demonstrated by our and other groups.

Using RNA sequencing, we characterized the differentially-expressed genes and pathways associated with changes occurring at the nasal epithelium following infection. We used in vitro differentiated human nasal epithelial cell culture model derived from seven different donors who had no concurrent history of viral infections. Statistical analysis highlighted strong transcriptomic signatures significantly associated with 24 and 48 h after infection, but not at the earlier 8-h time point. In particular, we found that the influenza infection induced in the nasal epithelium early and altered responses in interferon gamma signaling, B-cell signaling, apoptosis, necrosis, smooth muscle proliferation, and metabolic alterations. These molecular events initiated at the infected nasal epithelium may potentially adversely impact the airway, and thus the genes we identified could serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for influenza infection and associated disease management.","output":"RNA Sequencing of H3N2 Influenza Virus-Infected Human Nasal Epithelial Cells from Multiple Subjects Reveals Molecular Pathways Associated with Tissue Injury and Complications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Different aspects related to globalization together with the great capacity of the arthropod vectors to adapt to a changing world favour the emergence and reemergence of numerous infectious diseases transmitted by them.

Research purpose: The purpose of the research was to determine how prepared IOPs are to counsel employees during the pandemic and how responsive they are to provide counselling. Motivation for the study: It is not clear to what extent such counselling is being practised by IOPs in the workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research approach/design and method: A qualitative approach was used to gain an understanding of registered South African IOPs experiences of workplace counselling, particularly during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Main findings: Regarding preparedness, we found that IOPs are ill-prepared to counsel in the workplace. Preparedness was influenced by participants counselling education, skills and knowledge;experience;convictions about counselling;and psychological and organisational preparedness. Whilst some IOPs did engage in more counselling during the COVID-19 pandemic, most reverted to mitigating actions such as referrals, wellness management, equipping managers and change initiatives. Practical/managerial implications: The results of this study indicate that, under pandemic conditions, there is an increased need for counselling practices within the workplace and that IOPs should explore the ways in which they could play a more active role in such counselling.

With no cure or effective treatment currently insight, it is vital that factors are identified which will help prevent or delay both age-related and pathological cognitive decline and dementia. Observational data have suggested that hearing loss is a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia, but no conclusive evidence from randomised controlled trials is currently available. METHODS The HearCog trial is a 24-month, randomised, controlled clinical trial aimed at determining whether a hearing loss intervention can delay or arrest the cognitive decline. We will randomise 180 older adults with hearing loss and mild cognitive impairment to a hearing aid or control group to determine if the fitting of hearing aids decreases the 12-month rate of cognitive decline compared with the control group. In addition, we will also determine if the expected clinical gains achieved after 12 months can be sustained over an additional 12 months and if losses experienced through the non-correction of hearing loss can be reversed with the fitting of hearing aids after 12 months. DISCUSSION The trial will also explore the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to the control arm and the impact of hearing aids on anxiety, depression, physical health and quality of life. The results of this trial will clarify whether the systematic correction of hearing loss benefits cognition in older adults at risk of cognitive decline.

CASE REPORT A 63-year-old woman with a past medical history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission while on maintenance therapy with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, obinutuzumab, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing over 12 weeks and persistently tested seronegative for immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SARS-CoV-2 IgG chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay technology. During this time, the patient experienced waxing and waning of symptoms, which included fever, myalgia, and non-productive cough, but never acquired severe respiratory distress. She was admitted to our hospital on illness day 88, and her symptoms resolved after the administration of convalescent plasma. CONCLUSIONS As the understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, we can currently only speculate about the occurrence of chronic infection vs. reinfection. The protective role of antibodies and their longevity against SARS-CoV-2 remain unclear. Since humoral immunity has an integral role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, various phase 3 vaccine trials are underway.

In this study, a combined long core model was designed to study the seepage characteristics of supercritical CO2 displacement. Moreover, the stability of permanent storage of cushion gas layers formed by supercritical CO2 injection has been systematically studied. The research results showed that in the supercritical temperature and pressure range of CO2, the front edge of CO2 displacement can form a relatively stable seepage zone. Supercritical CO2 displacement can achieve a high gas-storage rate and stable CO2 storage. At the same time, the recovery rate of remaining natural gas has been significantly improved. As the injection pressure increased, supercritical CO2 inhibited the reverse diffusion of natural gas molecules. Therefore, the breakthrough of the supercritical CO2 displacement front under a high pressure lagged behind. However, due to the increase in the density difference of gas molecules, the forward diffusion of supercritical CO2 has been enhanced. Temperature will not significantly affect the displacement and storage effects of supercritical CO2 in gas reservoirs. The increase in injection pressure and reasonable control of the injection rate can delay the breakthrough of supercritical CO2 displacement. These measures are conducive to the stable storage of CO2 and the improvement of remaining natural gas recovery. The implementation of CO2 geological storage is suitable for the later stage of gas reservoir depletion development. The high-density gravitational heterogeneity of supercritical CO2 enables the injected CO2 to form a stable high-density cushion gas layer in the gas reservoir, which can achieve stable CO2 storage for more than 100 years.","output":"Experimental Analysis and Numerical Simulation of the Stability of Geological Storage of CO2: A Case Study of Transforming a Depleted Gas Reservoir into a Carbon Sink Carrier"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT Disaster management protocols are applicable to pandemics as they fall under biological category of disasters [1,2] Capacity development for effective response and recovery [3] is critical to disaster preparedness The alarming pace at which pandemics spread demands continuous assessment and monitoring of disaster response capacity Absence of a metric to assess pandemic disaster response capacity calls for identification of measurable indicators of capacity to gauge it Through a literature review on different assessment frameworks in the realm of disaster management across the globe;six categories of indicators for capacity development from a generic disaster preparedness perspective were drawn Questionnaire Surveys among 151 expert respondents ascertained the relative weightings and criticality of indicators Measurable indicator attributes were identified through key informant interviews, and a metric was modelled as a linear function of these variables To arrive at a fewer set of measurable, manageable and actionable critical indicators sensitive to the pandemic context, model reduction was performed through l2 norm-based sensitivity analysis and using coefficient of variation on pertinent data from 123 districts of India Results show that critical attributes are number of relief and health service personnel, road density, percentage literacy, efficacy of operational procedures and active NGOs A case study of Kerala state in India is presented to demonstrate the results The authors formulate a tool-kit with measurable critical indicators to assess pandemic preparedness of a region;applicable to wider contexts;which would help sensitize decision makers on the capacity of emergency management systems to handle a pandemic","output":"CRITICAL indicators for assessment of capacity development for disaster preparedness in a pandemic context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aims: One of the major ethical challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic comes in the form of fair triage decisions for critically ill patients in situations where life-saving resources are limited.

Structural Equation Modeling was used to model simultaneous paths of relationships and test direct and indirect effects. RESULTS: Stress, including financial hardship, was higher compared with before the crisis. The majority of children had regular mealtimes and irregular snack times. Higher COVID-19-specific stress was associated with more non-nutritive use of food and snacks (e.g. emotional and instrumental feeding), but also more structure and positive interactions (e.g. eating with or engaging with child around mealtimes). Higher COVID-19-specific stress was also associated with greater child intake frequency of sweet and savory snacks, with some evidence for mediation by snack parenting practices.

Vascular dysfunction, one of the earliest indicators of cardiovascular disease (CVD), has been reported in adults who have recovered from COVID-19. To date, no studies have investigated the underlying mechanisms of persistent COVID-19-associated vascular dysfunction. Additionally, physical activity (PA) status has not been accounted for when examining vascular function in COVID-19 recovered (CR) adults. PURPOSE To directly quantify nitric oxide (NO)-dependent vasodilation in the microcirculation in adults who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using the skin as a model circulation, we hypothesized that CR adults would have impaired NO-mediated vasodilation compared to appropriate controls, and PA would be positively associated with NO-dependent vasodilation in CR. METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study including: 10 (5M/5W, 24  4yrs) healthy control (HC) adults who were unvaccinated for COVID-19, 11 (4M/7W, 25  6yrs) healthy vaccinated (HV) adults, and 12 (5M/7W, 22  3yrs) CR (19  14 weeks post-diagnosis) adults. COVID-19 symptoms severity (survey) and PA (accelerometer) for 7 days prior to the experimental visit were assessed. A standardized 39C local heating protocol was used to induce eNOS-dependent vasodilation, quantified via perfusion (intradermal microdialysis) of 15 mM NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester during the plateau of the heating response. Red blood cell flux was measured (laser-Doppler flowmetry) and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC = flux/mmHg) was expressed as a percentage of maximum (28mM sodium nitroprusside + 43C). All data are means  standard error. RESULTS The local heating plateau (HC: 61  20 %CVCmax , HV: 60  19 %CVCmax , CR: 67  19 %CVCmax , p=0.80) and NO-dependent vasodilation (HC: 77  9%, HV: 71  7%, CR: 70  10%, p=0.36) were not different among groups. In the CR group neither peak symptom severity (25  12 AU) nor time since diagnosis correlated with NO-dependent vasodilation (R2 =0.21, p=0.13 and R2 =0.17, p=0.19, respectively). PA was not different among groups (see Table). PA did not correlate with the NO-dependent vasodilation in CR (sedentary: R2 <0.01, p=0.89; light: R2 =0.04, p=0.63; moderate-to-very vigorous: R2 =0.35, p=0.16). CONCLUSION Otherwise healthy young adults who have had COVID-19 did not have impaired NO-dependent cutaneous vasodilation. Additionally, in this cohort of CR adults, symptomology and physical activity was not related to microvascular function. As such, investigations in adults who have had more severe COVID-19 cases are necessary. Discovering the underlying mechanisms linking SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiovascular consequences are important for identifying additional treatment strategies for long haul COVID-19.","output":"Nitric Oxide-dependent Cutaneous Vasodilation is not Altered in Adults Following SARS-CoV-2 Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has been an unprecedented global health challenge.

Our lessons learned in designing and implementing the series can inform design of other global health virtual knowledge networks. The continued and expanded use of adapted virtual communities of practice and other learning networks for the IPC community can serve as a valuable tool for addressing COVID-19 and other infectious disease threats.","output":"Building a Virtual Global Knowledge Network during COVID-19: The Infection Prevention and Control Global Webinar Series"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quantitative skills are becoming central to the undergraduate and graduate curriculum in ecology and evolutionary biology. While previous studies acknowledge that students perceive their quantitative training to be inadequate, there is little guidance on best practices. Moreover, with the recent COVID-19 sudden transition to online learning, there is even less guidance on how to effectively teach quantitative ecology online. Here, I synthesize a prescription of pedagogical best practices for teaching quantitative ecology online based on a broad review of the literature on multiple quantitative disciplines. These best practices include the following: (1) design and implement the class to meet learning goals using online strategies specifically; (2) create an open, inclusive, and welcoming online environment that promotes a sense of learning community; (3) acknowledge the diversity of talents and learning strategies; (4) use real-world examples and assessments; (5) account for gaps in knowledge; (6) emphasize the modeling cycle process; (7) focus on developing ideas rather than tools or procedures; (8) if needed, introduce computational tools thoroughly before combining them with mathematical or statistical concepts; (9) evaluate the course constantly; and (10) put your heart and soul into the class. I hope these practices help fellow instructors of quantitative ecology facing similar challenges in providing our students with the knowledge and skills needed to meet the challenges of the future.","output":"Teaching quantitative ecology online: An evidence-based prescription of best practices"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Analyses of pandemic preparedness policies revealed weaknesses in control systems of European nations. This reinforces the need to support countries in their endeavours to prevent and contain pandemics. A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) was applied to a generic plan to identify weaknesses in pandemic management policies, in order to develop recommendations for improving national pandemic management systems. Policy components considered in our analysis are command and control, early case detection and disease surveillance, and community containment management. The main critical areas identified in national pandemic control were: communication systems among all institutions and levels involved in pandemic management, guidelines and regulations describing how key personal and institutions should operate during a pandemic, training and dissemination of information to health care personnel involved in outbreak management. The HACCP analysis highlighted the need for agreed communication structures, clear division of responsibilities and harmonised policy guidelines at all levels of pandemic management.

Transportation modes also shiftedin particular, travel by car became more rare while bicycling saw a resurgence. Given that a typical year sees the most severe bicycle crashes in peak commuter traffic, the shift toward bicycle travel that occurred in 2020 will likely have been accompanied by unique changes in rider behavior (e.g., where and when they choose to ride) as well as the frequency and severity of vehicle-bicycle crashes. METHODS: The current study compared weekday bicycle traffic and crashes in Arlington, VA from MarchCDecember 2020 with the same period from years prior, 2013C2019. Bicycle traffic data were obtained from 16 embedded counters placed throughout the study area, in both off-road trails and on-road bike lanes. RESULTS: We found that 2020 midday traffic nearly doubled compared to the year before, increasing from an average of 68 riders per hour to 120 (+76%). By contrast, morning traffic fell from an average of 87 riders per hour to just 45 (?49%). Change in evening traffic depended on the location of the counters: more evening bicycles were counted on off-road, multi-use trails (+6%) but fewer on on-road lanes (?27%). The changes to 2020 bicycle traffic patterns were also associated with a 28% reduction in bicycle injury crash rate per counted cyclist. CONCLUSION: The reduced crash risk observed in 2020 was likely due in part to the reduction of morning, on-road bicycle travel, which past research has found to be particularly dangerous for riders. Conversely, the availability of multi-use off-road trails seems to have been a protective factor against bicycle-motor vehicle crash risk in the face of greater bicycle travel volume.","output":"Weekday bicycle traffic and crash rates during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines some of the issues for research needs from information systems and information technology researchers, elicited as part of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We hypothesized that people higher in agentic grandiose narcissism would help during the COVID-19 quarantine for egoistic reasons and that communal grandiose narcissists would help because they care for the people in the community. Because vulnerable narcissists tend to self-protect, we expected them to be less helpful overall and report helping to either make themselves feel better or avoid social disapproval. We found supporting evidence such that agentic grandiose narcissists reported helping in a greater number of ways because they were motivated by self-promotion while communal narcissists helped in more ways because they were motivated by concern for others. Vulnerable narcissists reported doing less to help others and a lack of concern for others. Further, we found that the extent to which grandiose narcissists communicated more frequently about their various helping efforts was associated with increased state grandiose narcissism.

There is limited information about prognostic markers that could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with a poor prognosis. Serum levels of the immune activation marker neopterin has shown to be of prognostic value in patients with SARS. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum neopterin is associated with the severity of COVID-19. Methods We included 34 patients with confirmed COVID-19 between March 3 and March 30, 2020. Fifteen patients had mild disease and did not require hospitalization, whereas 19 patients developed severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care. Concentrations of serum neopterin, tryptophan, and kynurenine were measured at and repeatedly after inclusion. Results We found a more than two-fold higher mean concentration of neopterin in severely ill patients (mean value 42.0 nmol/L (SD 18.2)) compared to patients with mild symptoms (16.9 nmol/L (SD 11.0)). All of the severe cases had elevated neopterin concentrations (>9.1 nmol/L) at the initial sampling with values ranging from 17.2 to 86.7 nmol/L. In comparison, 10 of 15 patients with mild disease had neopterin levels above 9.1 nmol/L, with concentrations in the range from 4.9 to 31.6 nmol/L. Neopterin levels gradually decreased during the course of COVID-19, but severe cases maintained elevated levels for a longer period. Moreover, lower levels of tryptophan and higher levels of kynurenine, indicating an increased tryptophan catabolism, were seen in the group with severe cases. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that serum neopterin levels are associated with the severity of COVID-19. Our findings suggest that neopterin could be used as a prognostic marker, but further studies are needed to elucidate how it can be used in clinical praxis.","output":"Serum neopterin levels in relation to mild and severe COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Measure effect of late-afternoon communication and patient planning (CAPP) rounds to increase early electronic discharge orders (EDO). METHODS: We enrolled 4485 patients discharged from six subspecialty medical services. We implemented late-afternoon CAPP rounds to identify patients who could have morning discharge the subsequent day. After an initial successful implementation of the intervention, we identified lack of sustainability. We made changes with sustained implementation of the intervention. This is a before-after study of a quality improvement intervention. PROGRAM EVALUATION: Primary measures of intervention effectiveness were percentage of patients who received EDO by 11 am and patients discharged by noon. Additional measure of effectiveness were percent of patients admitted to the correct ward, emergency department (ED)-to-ward transfer time compared between intervention and nonintervention periods. We compared the overall expected LOS and the average weekly discharges to assess for comparability across the control and intervention time periods. We used the readmission rate as balancing measure to ensure that the intervention was not have unintended negative patients consequences. RESULTS: Expected length of stay based upon discharge diagnosis/comorbidities and readmission rates were similar across the intervention and control time periods. The average weekly discharges were not statistically significant. Percentage of EDO by 11 am was higher in the first intervention period, second intervention period and combined intervention periods (28.9% vs. 21.8%, P < 0.001) compared with the respective control periods. Percent discharged before noon increased in the first intervention period, second intervention period and for the combined intervention periods (17 vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the percent admitted to the correct ward and ED-to-ward transfer time. CONCLUSION: Afternoon CAPP rounds to identify early patient discharges the following day led to increase in EDO entered by 11 am and discharges by noon without an adverse change in readmission rates and LOS.","output":"Late-afternoon communication and patient planning (CAPP) rounds: an intervention to allow early patient discharges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Although the use of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has spread rapidly, most procedures employ additional needlescopic instruments to ensure safety and shorten the operation time. Therefore, on the basis of results obtained in our department, the present study was conducted to reevaluate the current state of needlescopic surgery (NS) to improve the cosmetic results and postoperative quality of life of patients and to reduce cost and degree of stress on surgeons. METHODS Between May 1998 and February 2011, we performed NS in 202 patients. The diagnoses included gallbladder diseases in 151 patients, spontaneous pneumothorax in 11, thyroid tumor and axillary lymph node metastases in 10 patients each, splenic cyst and appendicitis in 4 patients each, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and postoperative abdominal wall hernia in 3 patients each, primary aldosteronism and hepatic cyst in 2 patients each, and adhesional bowel obstruction and gastric stromal tumor in 1 patient each. Under general anesthesia, one 12-mm and tow or three 2- or 3-mm ports were introduced into the operative field. The specimen was retrieved via the 12-mm wound using a plastic bag. RESULTS The operations were completed in all patients without the need to convert to an open procedure. In 8 (5.3%) of the 151 cholecystectomies, a change to 5-mm instruments was required. There were no perioperative complications. Pertinent technical points included avoidance of direct organ mobilization to minimize injury, rotation of the operating table and utilization of organ gravity to create a better operative field, minimum use of needlescope to ensure safe maneuvering, and improvement of the bi-hand technique.

Shielding and social distancing have negatively impacted the delivery of routine care for COPD patients, which should be maintained to avoid further deterioration. We aimed to review the literature about the key toolkits of non-pharmacological treatments of COPD patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we focused on smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, and telehealth delivery approaches during the COVID-19 crisis. Smoking cessation services are important to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially in people with chronic lung disease; the pandemic, in one way or another, has helped to enhance people's motivation to quit smoking. Also, tele-rehabilitation is considered as effective as conventional pulmonary rehabilitation in controlling symptoms of disease, promoting physical activity, and enhancing self-management of COPD. Tele-rehabilitation offers flexibility and it could be the dominant mode for providing a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. Finally, the use of telehealth (TH) modes has trended during the pandemic. Consensus about the effectiveness of TH in reducing exacerbation events is still inconclusive. In the context of COPD, further clinical research must concentrate on understanding attitudes, behaviours, and motivations towards smoking cessation. Further recommendations include gauging the feasibility of a long-term tele-rehabilitation programme in large COPD populations, designing more COPD-related mobile apps, and evaluating the feasibility of tele-rehabilitation in clinical practice.","output":"Key toolkits of non-pharmacological management in COPD: during and beyond COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mist evaporation cooling (MEC) is increasingly used as a low-energy means to improve thermal comfort in hot environments.

Also, to describe the functional and cognitive trajectory after the first episode of MDD. METHODS A total of 52 studies were included in our systematic review. 32 studies compared cognition between First Episode of Depression (FED) and controls, 11 studies compared cognition between Recurrent Depression (RD) and FED, 10 compared global functioning between RD and FED, 4 studies assessed cognition in FED over time, and 2 studies assessed global functioning in FED over time. RESULTS The majority of studies (n=22/32, 68.8%) found that FED subjects performed significantly worse than controls on cognitive tests, with processing speed (n=12) and executive/working memory (n=11) being the most commonly impaired domains. Seven out of 11 studies (63.6%) found that RD performed significantly worse than FED, with verbal learning and memory being the most commonly impaired domain (n=4). Most studies (n=7/10, 70%) did not find a significant difference in global functioning between RD and FED. In 3 of 4 longitudinal studies assessing cognition, subgroup analyses were used instead of directly assessing cognition in FED over time while the remaining study found significant cognitive declines over time in FED when compared to controls. The two longitudinal studies assessing functional trajectory found that functioning significantly improved over time, possibly due to the improvement of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION There is strong evidence that cognitive impairment is present during the first episode of depression, and individuals with multiple episodes display greater cognitive impairment than individuals with a single episode. Future studies aimed at identifying predictors of cognitive and functional impairment after the first episode of depression are needed to describe the functional and cognitive trajectory of individuals with the first episode of MDD over time.","output":"Functional and cognitive impairment in the first episode of depression: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human coronaviruses are known respiratory pathogens associated with a range of respiratory illnesses, and there are considerable morbidity and hospitalisation amongst immune-compromised individuals of all age groups.

Plasma derived immune globulin (IG) products, which are used in pregnancy for various indications, may contain procoagulant impurity activated coagulation factor XI (FXIa). Procoagulant IG products have been associated with increased thrombogenicity but their effect in pregnancy is unknown. METHODS: Late pregnant (gestation days 17C20) or early lactation (days 1C3) and control female mice were treated with IGs supplemented with human FXIa then subjected to ferric chloride (FeCl(3)) vessel injury. Occlusion of blood vessel was assessed by recording blood velocity in the femoral vein for 20 min using doppler ultrasound laser imaging. FXIa dose was selected by the ability to increase thrombin generation in mouse plasma in vitro. RESULTS: FXIa produced robust thrombin generation in mouse plasma ex vivo. Following FeCl(3) injury, pregnant and non-pregnant mice receiving IG + FXIa exhibited faster reduction of blood velocity in femoral vein compared to IG alone or untreated controls. In vitro, thrombin generation in plasma samples collected after thrombosis in FXIa-treated animals was elevated and could be reduced by anti-FXI antibody.

The clinical use of SCs in nerve regeneration strategies is hindered by the necessity of removing a healthy nerve to obtain the therapeutic cells. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can be chemically differentiated towards a SC-like phenotype (dASCs), and represent a promising alternative to SCs. Their physiology can be further modulated pharmacologically by targeting receptors for neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine (ACh). In this study, we compare the ability of rat dASCs and native SCs to produce NGF in vitro. We also evaluate the ability of muscarinic receptors, in particular the M2 subtype, to modulate NGF production and maturation from the precursor (proNGF) to the mature (mNGF) form. For the first time, we demonstrate that dASCs produce higher basal levels of proNGF and mature NGF compared to SCs. Moreover, muscarinic receptor activation, and in particular M2 subtype stimulation, modulates NGF production and maturation in both SCs and dASCs. Indeed, both cell types express both proNGF A and B isoforms, as well as mNGF. After M2 receptor stimulation, proNGF-B (25 kDa), which is involved in apoptotic processes, is strongly reduced at transcript and protein level. Thus, we demonstrate that dASCs possess a stronger neurotrophic potential compared to SCs.

Objective The goals of this study are to report the load and variety of emergent/urgent neurosurgical cases after implementing the Battle Plan at an academic tertiary referral center during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these variables to previous practice at the same institution. Methods The clinical data of all patients who underwent a neurosurgical intervention between March 23, 2020 and April 20, 2020 was obtained from a prospectively maintained database. Data of the control group was retrospectively collected from the medical records to compare the types of surgeries/interventions performed by the same neurosurgical service before the COVID-19 pandemic started. Results Ninety-one patients underwent emergent, urgent and essential neurosurgical interventions over a 4-week period during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient screening at teleclinics identified 11 urgent surgical cases.

Methods: Between July 2017 and July 2019, 18 patients with partial ACL injury were admitted. There were 10 males and 8 females, with an average age of 40.5 years (range, 22-57 years). There were 5 cases on the left knee and 13 cases on the right knee. Forteen cases had a clear history of trauma or sports injury, and 4 cases had no obvious cause. The time from injury to operation was 1-6 months (median, 3 months). Partial ligament was sutured using WALANT technique under arthroscopy. The operation time, total hospital stay, and postoperative hospital stay were recorded. Lachman test and anterior drawer test were performed to evaluate the knee joint stability after treatment, and Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores were used to evaluate the knee function. Five-point Likert scaling were used to evaluate postoperative patient satisfaction. Results: The operation time was 30-100 minutes (mean, 64.2 minutes). The total hospital stay was 2-12 days (mean, 4.5 days). Postoperative hospital stay was 1-4 days (mean, 1.8 days). All incisions healed by first intention after operation, and no surgery-related complications occurred. All patients were followed up 12-36 months (mean, 19.1 months). Lachman test and anterior drawer test were negative after operation. Lysholm score and IKDC score at 6 and 12 months after operation were significantly higher than those before operation, and at 12 months after operation were higher than those at 6 months after operation, the differences were significant ( P<0.05). At last follow-up, according to five-point Likert scaling of patient satisfaction, 7 cases were very satisfied, 10 cases were relatively satisfied, and 1 case was general. The total patient satisfaction rate was 94.4% (17/18). MRI scan showed the good ligament tension. Conclusion: Using WALANT technique to repair partial ACL injuries under arthroscopy can retain the patient's own ligament tissue to the maximum extent and achieve satisfactory short-term effectiveness.","output":"[Effectiveness of partial anterior cruciate ligament suture repair with wide awake local anesthesia no tourniquet technique]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper discusses the fiscal impact of the COVID-19 crisis across levels of government. It contrasts the composition of revenues and expenditures of different levels of government and their main institutional differences. For revenues, an error correction model is used to estimate the short-term elasticities of different levels of government, showing that subnational governments (SNGs) revenues are less sensitive to economic downturns than central governments, mostly because SNGs tend to rely more on recurrent taxes on immovable property. For expenditures, central governments are often responsible for the bulk of expenditure on social protection, while SNGs have a higher investment-to-revenue ratio. The combination of these differences of expenditure assignment with the substantial budget and borrowing constraints that SNGs face creates a tendency towards pro-cyclicality at the subnational level and counter-cyclicality at the central level. Furthermore, in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, in order for SNGs to have the fiscal capacity for necessary measures to tackle the outbreak, central governments supported SNGs mostly through intergovernmental grants. As a consequence, central governments have absorbed most of the shock.

The aim of this study is to assess whether teaching echocardiography to preclinical medical students using an e-learning software (ELS) is practical and appropriate. METHODS From 2017 to 2019, 1084 second-year medical students at Indiana University School of Medicine were introduced to echocardiography by using the ELS. In 2017 and 2018 students had a postcourse survey to assess echocardiography appropriateness and cardiology learning. Students in 2018 and 2019 were assessed for any association between the use of the ELS and learning cardiology by comparing examination scores. RESULTS In 2017-2018, 127 students responded to the survey (18% response rate). In 2017, 79% of responders and in 2018, 89% reported that introducing echocardiography to medical students is appropriate. In 2017, 78% and in 2018, 87% reported that it improved the understanding of cardiology. Student ELS usage was high for 2017-2018 (93% and 70%) but dropped in 2019 (30%). In 2018 and 2019, students who used ELS did statistically significantly better on the examination (total scores 84% vs. 82% (P = .008) in 2018; 84% vs. 81% (P = .002) in 2019). CONCLUSIONS Many 2nd year medical students felt learning echocardiography with ELS was appropriate and enhanced their learning cardiology. Using echocardiography to help learn cardiology appears to be supported with an association of ELS usage and improved examination scores. Our study suggests that echocardiography learning can and probably should begin in medical school.","output":"Introducing echocardiography to medical students: A novel echocardiography E-Learning experience."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine SARS-CoV-2-antibody prevalence in pediatric healthcare workers (pHCWs). DESIGN: Baseline prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG was assessed in a prospective cohort study from a large pediatric healthcare facility. Prior SARS-CoV-2 testing history, potential risk factors and anxiety level about COVID-19 were determined. Prevalence difference between emergency department (ED)-based and non-ED-pHCWs was modeled controlling for those covariates. Chi-square test-for-trend was used to examine prevalence by month of enrollment. RESULTS: Most of 642 pHCWs enrolled were 31-40years, female and had no comorbidities. Half had children in their home, 49% had traveled, 42% reported an illness since January, 31% had a known COVID-19 exposure, and 8% had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. High COVID-19 pandemic anxiety was reported by 71%. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was 4.1%; 8.4% among ED versus 2.0% among non-ED pHCWs (p < 0.001). ED-work location and known COVID-19 exposure were independent risk factors. 31% of antibody-positive pHCWs reported no symptoms. Prevalence significantly (p < 0.001) increased from 3.0% in April-June to 12.7% in July-August. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG prevalence was low in pHCWs but increased rapidly over time.

Little is known about the impact on the cardiovascular system, and the incidence and consequences of new onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) in infected patients remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze the cardiovascular outcomes of patients with new-onset AF and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. METHODS This observational study analyzed a sample of 160 consecutive patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. A group with new-onset AF (n = 12) was compared with a control group (total: n = 148, sinus rhythm: n = 118, previous AF: n = 30). New-onset AF patients were significantly older and hypertensive, as well as presenting more frequently with a history of acute coronary syndrome and renal dysfunction. This group showed a higher incidence of thromboembolic events (41.7% vs. 4.1%; p < 0.001), bleeding (33.3% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.005), a combined endpoint of thrombosis and death (58.3 vs. 19.6%, p = 0.006) and longer hospital stays (16.4 vs. 8.6 days, p < 0.001), with no differences in all-cause mortality. RESULTS In multivariate analysis, adjusted by potential confounding factors, new-onset AF demonstrated a 14.26 odds ratio for thromboembolism (95% confidence interval 2.86-71.10, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS New-onset AF in COVID-19 patients presumably has a notable impact on prognosis. The appearance of new-onset AF is related to worse cardiovascular outcomes, considering it as an independent predictor of embolic events.

Governments have taken drastic measures to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, and the development of safe and efficacious vaccine candidates is being accelerated. The possibility of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement with coronavirus vaccines has been flagged as a potential safety concern, and, despite the urgent need, should be thoroughly assessed as vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are being tested. AREA COVERED: We review the in vivo evidence suggesting a theoretical risk of disease enhancement after vaccination with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates. We also identify knowledge gaps that need to be filled to maximize the chance of developing a safe vaccine and minimize the risk of encountering disease enhancement in vaccinated individuals after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. EXPERT OPINION: We compile and propose avenues to investigate the risk of vaccine-mediated disease enhancement both during pre-clinical and early clinical development. While the pressing need for a vaccine against COVID-19 (and future epidemic coronaviruses) cannot be ignored, we advocate to keep safety at the center of the debate.

This may have been attributable to the spread of the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. This paper documents real-time analysis that aimed to investigate the association between changes in the proportion of positive cases that were S-gene positive, an indicator of the Delta variant against a background of the previously predominant Alpha variant, and the estimated time-varying Rt at the level of upper-tier local authorities (UTLA). Method: We explored the relationship between the proportion of samples that were S-gene positive and the Rt of test-positive cases over time from the 23 February 2021 to the 25 May 2021. Effective reproduction numbers were estimated using the EpiNow2 R package independently for each local authority using two different estimates of the generation time. We then fit a range of regression models to estimate a multiplicative relationship between S-gene positivity and weekly mean Rt estimate. Results: We found evidence of an association between increased mean Rt estimates and the proportion of S-gene positives across all models evaluated with the magnitude of the effect increasing as model flexibility was decreased. Models that adjusted for either national level or NHS region level time-varying residuals were found to fit the data better, suggesting potential unexplained confounding. Conclusions: Our results indicated that even after adjusting for time-varying residuals between NHS regions, S-gene positivity was associated with an increase in the effective reproduction number of COVID-19. These findings were robust across a range of models and generation time assumptions, though the specific effect size was variable depending on the assumptions used. The lower bound of the estimated effect indicated that the reproduction number of Delta was above 1 in almost all local authorities throughout the period of investigation.","output":"Estimating the increase in reproduction number associated with the Delta variant using local area dynamics in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective Search for socio-psychological antecedents for the individuals belief in conspiracy theories of the origin of the pandemic Revealing the dynamics of Internet users attitudes to the coronavirus pandemic in March-early June 2020 Background As part of the study of the psychological mechanisms of the impact of the pandemic on the individual and society, an increasingly urgent task is to clarify the socio-psychological prerequisites of belief in conspiracy theories of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the relationship between attitudes towards the pandemic and the involvement of the individual in the use of social media Study design The paper presents the results of two online surveys conducted in March-April and May-June 2020 to study the dynamics of Russians belief in conspiracy theories of the origin of the CO-VID-19, taking into account involvement in social media and gender differences Participants The first study involved 668 people (78 2% women) aged 17 to 80 years (M=30;SD=12 7);the second survey involved 986 people (56 9%  men) aged 18 to 76 years (M=36 63;SD=10 2) The survey geography covered various regions of Russia Measurements The basic tool in both studies was developed by T A Nestik questionnaire Attitude towards the epidemiological threat The first study additionally measured the social axioms (SAS), moral foundations (MFQ), belief in the justice of the world and trust in social institutions The second study additionally measured involvement in social media communications Results The 1st study found a connection between conspiracy beliefs and belief in a just world, low self-efficacy, moral foundations of ingroup/loyalty and authority/respect, low institutional trust, and social cynicism In the 2nd study, it was shown that, compared to March-April, the level of belief of social media users in conspiracy theories of the origin of the pandemic, the severity of distrust in the health care system and skepticism about vaccinations significantly increased;both the fear of infection and the controllability of the threat have become less, but fears of a recurrence of epidemics have increased It is shown that involvement in social media increases anxiety about the consequences of the coronavirus crisis, which in turn intensifies the search for conspiracy explanations of pandemic Conclusions Low social trust and the experience of an uncontrollable threat increase the susceptibility of social media users to belief in conspiracy theories of the origin of the pandemic ? 2020 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education All right reserved","output":"Socio-psychological predictors of belief in conspiracy theories of the origin of COVID-19 and involvement in social media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic is a history-changing event affecting all nurses.

The TC microbiota is closely related to the development of upper gastrointestinal malignancies, such as oral, gastric, and esophageal cancer. Nonetheless, the microbiological characteristics of common TCs in individuals with precancerous lesions of the upper gastrointestinal tract are still unclear. Herein, we designed a case-control study, recruiting 153 PLUGT patients with four different types of TCs, including 47 white-thin, 19 white-thick, 47 yellow-thin, and 40 yellow-thick, as well as 47 volunteers as controls. To analyze microbial characteristics, 16S rRNA microbiome approaches were used. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to assess serum IL-17A and total bile acid (TBA). According to the obtained results, Leptotrichia was found to be a promising biomarker for thin as well as thick yellow coatings. In comparison to the control TC microbiota, 39 different genera developed commensal networks in common TCs. Lachnoanaerobaculum and pseudonocardia were the most striking core bacteria. Lachnoanaerobaculum positively correlated with Leptotrichia in W-thin and Y-thick coatings, with actinomyces and methylobacterium in Y-thin coatings, with Campylobacter in Y-thick coatings, and with Bradyrhizobium in W-thick and Y-thick coatings. Serum IL-17A levels were greater in cases with W-thin coating than in controls, and serum IL-17A was positively linked with Parvimonas in patients with W-thick or Y-thin coating. In Y-thin coating, the oral dominating bacteria Streptococcus was negatively linked with serum TBA.

We investigated whether metabolic, inflammatory, and epigenetic (microRNA (miRNA)) markers are associated with TNF- expression in SCAD. Materials and Methods: Patients with SCAD were prospectively recruited and their metabolic and inflammatory profiles were assessed. TNF- levels were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relative expression of six circulating miRNAs associated with the regulation of inflammation and/or atherosclerosis was determined. Results: Of the 24 included patients with the mean age of 65 (9) years, 88% were male, and 54% were diabetic. The TNF- levels were (median (interquartile range)) 1.0 (0.7C1.1) pg/mL. The percentage of glycosylated hemoglobin (r = 0.418, p = 0.042), serum triglyceride levels (r = 0.429, p = 0.037), and C-reactive protein levels (r = 0.407, p = 0.048) were positively correlated with TNF- levels. Of the candidate miRNAs, miR-146a expression levels were negatively correlated with TNF- levels (as indicated by r = 0.500, p = 0.035 for correlation between delta cycle threshold (C(t)) miR-146a and TNF- levels). In multivariate analysis, serum triglyceride levels and miR-146a expression levels were independently associated with TNF- levels. miR-146 expression levels were not associated with metabolic or other inflammatory parameters and were negatively correlated with the number of coronary vessels with obstructive disease (as indicated by r = 0.556, p = 0.017 for correlation between C(t) miR-146a and number of diseased vessels). Conclusions: miR-146a expression levels were negatively correlated with TNF- levels in patients with SCAD, irrespective of other metabolic or inflammatory markers, and with the severity of coronary artery disease.

This approach requires maintenance of the social license and public trust. The ultimate success of PM programs will thus likely be contingent upon understanding public expectations about data sharing and establishing appropriate governance structures. There is a lack of data on public attitudes towards PM in Asia. Methods: The aim of the research was to measure the priorities and preferences of Singaporeans for sharing health-related data for PM. We used adaptive choice-based conjoint analysis (ACBC) with four attributes: uses, users, data sensitivity and consent. We recruited a representative sample of n = 1000 respondents for an in-person household survey. Results: Of the 1000 respondents, 52% were female and majority were in the age range of 40C59 years (40%), followed by 21C39 years (33%) and 60 years and above (27%). A total of 64% were generally willing to share de-identified health data for IRB-approved research without re-consent for each study. Government agencies and public institutions were the most trusted users of data. The importance of the four attributes on respondents willingness to share data were: users (39.5%), uses (28.5%), data sensitivity (19.5%), consent (12.6%). Most respondents found it acceptable for government agencies and hospitals to use de-identified data for health research with broad consent. Our sample was consistent with official government data on the target population with 52% being female and majority in the age range of 40C59 years (40%), followed by 21C39 years (33%) and 60 years and above (27%). Conclusions: While a significant body of prior research focuses on preferences for consent, our conjoint analysis found consent was the least important attribute for sharing data. Our findings suggest the social license for PM data sharing in Singapore currently supports linking health and genomic data, sharing with public institutions for health research and quality improvement; but does not support sharing with private health insurers or for private commercial use.","output":"Trust and Trade-Offs in Sharing Data for Precision Medicine: A National Survey of Singapore"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense RNA viruses that can emerge from endemic reservoirs and infect zoonotically, causing significant morbidity and mortality. CoVs encode an endoribonuclease designated EndoU that facilitates evasion of host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, but the target of EndoU activity was not known. Here, we report that EndoU cleaves the 5-polyuridines from negative-sense viral RNA, termed PUN RNA, which is the product of polyA-templated RNA synthesis. Using a virus containing an EndoU catalytic-inactive mutation, we detected a higher abundance of PUN RNA in the cytoplasm compared to wild-type?infected cells. Furthermore, we found that transfecting PUN RNA into cells stimulates a robust, MDA5-dependent interferon response, and that removal of the polyuridine extension on the RNA dampens the response. Overall, the results of this study reveal the PUN RNA to be a CoV MDA5-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). We also establish a mechanism for EndoU activity to cleave and limit the accumulation of this PAMP. Since EndoU activity is highly conserved in all CoVs, inhibiting this activity may serve as an approach for therapeutic interventions against existing and emerging CoV infections.","output":"Coronavirus endoribonuclease targets viral polyuridine sequences to evade activating host sensors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The global pandemic has made it more important than ever to quickly and accurately retrieve relevant scientific literature for effective consumption by researchers in a wide range of fields.

The aim of this pilot was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a mobile-technology based lifestyle program for NAFLD patients. METHODS: We enrolled adult patients with NAFLD in a 6-month mobile-technology based program where participants received a FitBit with weekly tailored step count goals and nutritional assessments. Anthropometrics, hepatic and metabolic parameters, Fibroscan, physical function and activity, and health-related quality of life measures were obtained at enrollment and month 6. Semi-structured exit interviews were conducted to assess patients experience with the program. RESULTS: 40 (63%) eligible patients were enrolled. Median age was 52.5 with 53% males, 93% whites, 43% with diabetes and median BMI 33.9. On baseline Fibroscan, 59% had F0-2 fibrosis and 70% had moderate-severe steatosis. 33 patients completed the study. Median percentage of days with valid FitBit data collection was 91. 4 patients increased and maintained, 19 maintained, and 8 increased but subsequently returned to baseline weekly step count. 59% of patients reported Fitbit was easy to use and 66% felt step count feedback motivated them to increase their activity. Roughly 50% of patients had reduction in weight, triglycerides and Fibroscan liver stiffness, and 75% had improvement in controlled attenuation parameter and physical function.

The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens? Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 10(4) RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens? Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the gold standard. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent.

The trend is linked with low soft skills (self-esteem and assertiveness skills) for them to make informed, reasoned, and responsible decisions over sexual activities. This study designed and tested the effect of integrated reproductive health (RH) lesson materials in a problem-based pedagogy (PBP) to enhance soft skills for safe sexual behaviour among adolescents in Tanzania. METHODS: A double-blinded clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted between September 2019 and September 2020 among 660 randomly selected adolescents. A Sexual-risk Behaviour Beliefs and Self-esteem Scale adopted from previous studies measured soft skills for safe sexual behaviour. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed by using the statistical analysis software programme version 9.4. The effect of the intervention was determined using Linear Mixed Model set at  error probability = 5% significance level (95% confidence interval) and a  error probability = 0.80. FINDINGS: Adolescents mean age was 151.869 with 57.5% females. The end-line findings indicated that the coefficient of soft skills was significantly higher among adolescents in the hybrid PBP (=9.0986, p<0.01; 95%CI: 4.7772, 14.2311) and pure PBP ( =8.7114, p<0.01; 95%CI: 3.9990, 10.1208) than in the control group. The retention rate of soft skills was still significantly higher at 3-months follow-up (=2.0044; p<0.01; 95%CI: 1.0234, 4.1182) and at 6-months follow-up (=1.9803; p<0.01; 95%CI: 0.8399, 3.1099) compared to the baseline and immediate post-intervention assessments. CONCLUSION: The intervention substantially enhanced soft skills for safe sexual behaviour among adolescents of both sex. Despite the fact that scores for soft skills varied across the study timelines, adolescents demonstrated significant intentions to abstain from sexual intercourse, delay sexual relationships, negotiate condom use, and withstand sexual coercions. The PBP may need to be incorporated in ordinary level secondary school curricula as a formal guide to teachers and or health workers to optimally prepare adolescents for their healthy adulthood.","output":"Effect of integrated reproductive health lesson materials in a problem-based pedagogy on soft skills for safe sexual behaviour among adolescents: A school-based randomized controlled trial in Tanzania"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maatregelen om verspreiding van infectieziekten tegen te gaan worden door alle kuddedieren genomen (zoals afzondering), en zullen dus ook zeker door onze prehistorische voorouders zijn genomen.

Lung macrophages are important in mounting an inflammatory response to injury, but they are also involved in repair of injury. Macrophages develop mixed phenotypes in complex pathological conditions and polarize to a predominant phenotype depending on the duration and stage of injury and/or repair. Little is known about the reprogramming required for lung macrophages to switch between these divergent functions; therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which macrophages promote metabolic reprogramming to regulate lung injury is essential. Here, we show that lung macrophages polarize to a pro-inflammatory, classically activated phenotype after cadmium-mediated lung injury. Since metabolic adaptation provides energy for the diverse macrophage functions, these classically activated macrophages show metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and transcription factors regulating glycolytic flux in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice. Moreover, cadmium exposure promoted increased macrophage glycolytic function with enhanced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glycolytic metabolites, and lactate excretion. These observations suggest that cadmium mediates the persistence of classically activated lung macrophages to exacerbate lung injury.","output":"Cadmium-mediated lung injury is exacerbated by the persistence of classically activated macrophages."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Castiglione DAdda is one of the municipalities more precociously and severely affected by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Lombardy.

This paper presents a novel method for an economy-wide estimate of the emissions reductions caused by the restriction of movement. Using a global multiregional macro-economic model complemented by Google Community Mobility Reports (CMRs) and national transport data, we cover 129 individual countries and quantify direct and indirect global emissions reductions of greenhouse gases (GHG; 1173 Mt), PM(2.5) (0.23 Mt), SO(2) (1.57 Mt), and NO(x) (3.69 Mt). A statistically significant correlation is observed between cross-country emission reductions and the stringency of mobility restriction policies. Due to the aggregated nature of the CMRs, we develop different scenarios linked to consumption, work, and lifestyle aspects.

Surprisingly, COPD is already the third leading cause of death worldwide, something that WHO had not predicted to occur until 2030. It is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airway limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles of gases. Neutrophil is one of the key infiltrated innate immune cells in the lung during the pathogenesis of COPD. Neutrophils during pathogenic attack or injury decide to undergo for a suicidal death by releasing decondensed chromatin entangled with antimicrobial peptides to trap and ensnare pathogens. Casting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been widely demonstrated to be an effective mechanism against invading microorganisms thus controlling overwhelming infections. However, aberrant and massive NETs formation has been reported in several pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, NETs can directly induce epithelial and endothelial cell death resulting in impairing pulmonary function and accelerating the progression of the disease. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanism of NET formation is the need of the hour in order to use NETs for beneficial purpose and controlling their involvement in disease exacerbation. For example, DNA neutralization of NET proteins using protease inhibitors and disintegration with recombinant human DNase would be helpful in controlling excess NETs. Targeting CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) would also reduce neutrophilic inflammation, mucus production and neutrophil-proteinase mediated tissue destruction in lung. In this review, we discuss the interplay of NETs in the development and pathophysiology of COPD and how these NETs associated therapies could be leveraged to disrupt NETopathic inflammation as observed in COPD, for better management of the disease.","output":"Orchestration of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (Nets), a Unique Innate Immune Function during Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Brazil is experiencing the greatest episode of sanitary collapse ever known in the countrys history.

HRM evaluated esophageal motility for water swallows and a solid test meal. RESULTS Systemic sclerosis patients had less frequent effective esophageal contractions during the test meal compared to healthy controls even in very early disease (0.15, 1.0, 2.1 per minute for groups #1, #2, and #3, vs 2.5 per minute in health; P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.0085, respectively). Ineffective motility at HRM was associated with a higher modified Rodnan skin score at baseline. Moreover, at mean 18 (10-31) months of follow-up, the presence of ineffective motility at baseline was associated with progression of skin disease (P = 0.01). Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified hypotensive peristalsis in the test meal (<15% effective solid swallows) and low distal contractile integral (DCI; <400 mm Hgcms) as predictors for skin aggravation, but not for new organ involvement. CONCLUSION Ineffective motility during a test meal is present already in patients with very early SSc.

However, the training of end-to-end neural-based medical dialogue system is restricted by an insufficient quantity of medical dialogue corpus. In this work, we make the first attempt to build and release a large-scale high-quality Medical Dialogue dataset related to 12 types of common Gastrointestinal diseases named MedDG, with more than 17K conversations collected from the online health consultation community. Five different categories of entities, including diseases, symptoms, attributes, tests, and medicines, are annotated in each conversation of MedDG as additional labels. To push forward the future research on building expert-sensitive medical dialogue system, we proposes two kinds of medical dialogue tasks based on MedDG dataset. One is the next entity prediction and the other is the doctor response generation. To acquire a clear comprehension on these two medical dialogue tasks, we implement several state-of-the-art benchmarks, as well as design two dialogue models with a further consideration on the predicted entities. Experimental results show that the pre-train language models and other baselines struggle on both tasks with poor performance in our dataset, and the response quality can be enhanced with the help of auxiliary entity information.

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand precisely the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this multifaceted disease. There is increasing evidence that the immune system reacts insufficiently to SARS-CoV-2 and thus contributes to organ damage and to lethality. In this review, we suggest that the overwhelming production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in oxidative stress is a major cause of local or systemic tissue damage that leads to severe COVID-19. It increases the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and suppresses the adaptive arm of the immune system, i.e. T cells that are necessary to kill virus-infected cells. This creates a vicious cycle that prevents a specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The key role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 implies that therapeutic counterbalancing of ROS by antioxidants such as vitamin C or NAC and/or by antagonizing ROS production by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and neutrophil granulocytes and/or by blocking of TNF-&#945; can prevent COVID-19 from becoming severe.

A drug that targets NOD2 was shown to have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity against other flaviviruses, alphaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Another drug that inhibits the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) which functions downstream of NOD2, also decreased replication of these pathogenic RNA viruses. The broad-spectrum action of nodosome targeting drugs is mediated, at least in part, by enhancement of the interferon response.

Nitric oxide is essential in multiple physiological processes, and a reduction in nitric oxide bioavailability is associated with the occurrence or worsening of pathologies, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and sepsis. Oral facultative anaerobic bacteria are essential for the enterosalivary nitrateCnitriteCnitric oxide pathway due to their capacity to reduce nitrate to nitrite. Nitrate originates from dietary sources or from the active uptake by salivary glands of circulating nitrate, which is then excreted in the saliva. Because antiseptic mouthwashes eradicate the oral bacterial flora, this nitric oxide-generating pathway is abolished, which may result in nitric oxide-deficient conditions potentially leading to life-threatening complications such as ischaemic heart events or sepsis.","output":"Antiseptic mouthwash, the nitrateCnitriteCnitric oxide pathway, and hospital mortality: a hypothesis generating review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study embedded attentional cues in the study phase of an item-method directed forgetting task.

One way to improve rates of institutional deliveries is through improving institutional delivery service satisfaction in women. The aim of this research is to identify which factors influence delivery service satisfaction during the period of COVID-19 and which socio-demographic characteristics of women are associated with greater fear of catching COVID-19 during institutional deliveries. METHODS: A total of 190 women who had given birth between May to June, 2020, were sampled from two private and two public sector hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. A standardized tool was modified for use and a combination of descriptive statistics and multivariate regression was applied. RESULTS: The results reveal that a majority of women, at 74.7%, are afraid of contracting COVID-19; specifically, women delivering at public hospitals, those who are illiterate or semi-literate, with more than four children, with low household income, and who are unemployed. Regression models are used to identify factors related to higher satisfaction, including the following: (i) pre-delivery care (explanatory power of R(2) = 0.651); (ii) during delivery care (R(2) = 0.716); (iii) after delivery care for women (R(2) = 0.525); and (iv) after delivery care for newborn (R(2) = 0.780). The main areas which influence satisfaction include the following: service quality of staff and administration; maintenance of hygiene and sanitation; involvement in decision-making; provision of necessary information; and advice for breastfeeding, immunization and family planning. CONCLUSIONS FOR PRACTICE: Based on our findings, we recommend improved regulation of delivery services in both public and private hospitals and increased protection for disadvantaged women groups to maintain service quality during the pandemic.

In recent years, this has led to perceiving population health outcomes as an emergent property of a dynamic and open, complex adaptive system. The current paper explores these themes further and applies the principles of systems approach and complexity science (i.e. systems science) to conceptualize social determinants of health inequalities. The conceptualization can be done in two steps: viewing health inequalities from a systems approach and extending it to include complexity science. Systems approach views health inequalities as patterns within the larger rubric of other facets of the human condition, such as educational outcomes and economic development. This anlysis requires more sophisticated models such as systems dynamic models. An extension of the approach is to view systems as complex adaptive systems, i.e. systems that are 'open' and adapt to the environment. They consist of dynamic adapting subsystems that exhibit non-linear interactions, while being 'open' to a similarly dynamic environment of interconnected systems. They exhibit emergent properties that cannot be estimated with precision by using the known interactions among its components (such as economic development, political freedom, health system, culture etc.). Different combinations of the same bundle of factors or determinants give rise to similar patterns or outcomes (i.e. property of convergence), and minor variations in the initial condition could give rise to widely divergent outcomes. Novel approaches using computer simulation models (e.g. agent-based models) would shed light on possible mechanisms as to how factors or determinants interact and lead to emergent patterns of health inequalities of populations.","output":"Social determinants of health inequalities: towards a theoretical perspective using systems science"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the affective and cognitive risk perceptions in the general population of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during the 2015 MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in South Korea and the influencing factors. DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional design with four consecutive surveys. SETTING: Nationwide general population in South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Overall 4010 respondents (aged 19 years and over) from the general population during the MERS-CoV epidemic were included. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were (1) affective risk perception, (2) cognitive risk perception, and (3) trust in the government. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify factors (demographic, socioeconomic, area and political orientation) associated with risk perceptions. RESULTS: Both affective and cognitive risk perceptions decreased as the MERS-CoV epidemic progressed. Proportions of affective risk perception were higher in all surveys and slowly decreased compared with cognitive risk perception over time. Females (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.72-2.00; 95% CI 1.14 to 2.86) and lower self-reported household economic status respondents were more likely to perceive the affective risk. The older the adults, the higher the affective risk perception, but the lower the cognitive risk perception compared with younger adults. The respondents who had low trust in the government had higher affective (aOR 2.19-3.11; 95 CI 1.44 to 4.67) and cognitive (aOR 3.55-5.41; 95 CI 1.44 to 9.01) risk perceptions. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that even if cognitive risk perception is dissolved, affective risk perception can continue during MERS-CoV epidemic. Risk perception associating factors (ie, gender, age and self-reported household economic status) appear to be noticeably different between affective and cognitive dimensions. It also indicates that trust in the government influences affective risk perception and cognitive risk perception.

Due to low incidence, an individual randomized controlled trial (RCT) is underpowered to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 vaccines increase the risks of thromboembolism and hemorrhage. Methods: : We performed a literature search using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, medRxiv databases, and reference lists of relevant articles to identify RCTs that reported thromboembolic and hemorrhagic events and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled thromboembolic risk related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines compared to placebo. The secondary outcomes included estimating the risks of arterial thromboembolism (ATE), venous thromboembolisms (VTE), hemorrhage, and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death. Results: : Eight RCTs of 4 vaccine platforms comprised of 195,196 participants were retrieved. SARS-CoV-2 vaccines were not associated with an increased risk of overall thromboembolism (risk ratio [RR], 1.14;95%CI [confidence interval], 0.61-2.14;I 2 = 35%), ATE (RR, 0.97;95%CI, 0.46-2.06;I 2 = 21%), VTE (RR, 1.47;95%CI, 0.72-2.99;I 2 = 0%), hemorrhage (RR, 0.97;95%CI, 0.35-2.68;I 2 = 0), and thromboembolism/hemorrhage-related death (RR, 0.53;95%CI, 0.16-1.79;I 2 = 0).

Hydrolyzed species such as Ti(OH)3+, TiO2+, Ti(OH)2 2+ or Ti(OH)3 + have been identified and their equilibria have been studied in nitric and perchloric acid. A predominance of the divalent cations was found for low pH (i.e., pH <2). Nonetheless, recent literature reports the existence of small titanium oxo-clusters in aqueous acidic media for large titanium(iv) concentration (typically., >0.1 mol L-1), as stable precursors for the formation of condensed titanium dioxide. The present paper reconsiders firstly previous knowledge about the speciation of titanium(iv) in non-complexing acidic media by giving evidence for the presence of polynuclear hydrolyzed species, even at very low Ti(iv) concentration (i.e., typically <0.1 mmol L-1). UV-visible absorbance spectra recorded for diluted nitric acid solutions (a model of non-complexing acidic medium) containing titanium(iv) were compared to time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) predicted excitation energies. Experimental and predicted maximal absorbance wavelengths showed significantly improved matches when polynuclear species were considered in TD-DFT calculation. Then, 0.1-12.7 mol L-1 phosphoric acid solutions containing titanium(iv) were studied by means of spectroscopic techniques (UV-visible, NMR) in order to identify qualitatively the presence of titanium(iv) complexes and to link this speciation to the acid concentration. Two different titanium(iv) orthophosphate complexes, potentially polynuclear, were detected, and the presence of free titanium(iv) is also expected for low phosphoric acid concentration (i.e., <0.1 mol L-1). A general complexation scheme for a large range of H3PO4 concentration was thus formulated.","output":"New insights for titanium(iv) speciation in acidic media based on UV-visible and 31P NMR spectroscopies and molecular modeling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The spread of Covid-19 and the lockdown have brought in acute deprivation for rural, marginalised communities with loss of wages, returnee migrants and additional state-imposed barriers to accessing facilities and public provisions.

We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread.

We attempted to uncover a new application of spiramycin, an old medication that was classically prescribed for toxoplasmosis and various other soft-tissue infections; specifically, we initiated a study on the anti-inflammatory capacity of spiramycin. For this purpose, we used murine macrophage RAW 264.7 as a model for this experiment and investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of spiramycin by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines. In the present study, we demonstrated that spiramycin significantly decreased nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Spiramycin also inhibited the expression of NO synthase (iNOS), potentially explaining the spiramycin-induced decrease in NO production. In addition, spiramycin inhibited the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs); extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N terminal kinase (JNK) as well as the inactivation and subsequent nuclear translocation of nuclear factor B (NF-B). This indicated that spiramycin attenuates macrophages secretion of IL-6, IL-1, and NO, inducing iNOS expression via the inhibition of the NF-B and MAPK signaling pathways. Finally, we tested the potential application of spiramycin as a topical material by human skin primary irritation tests. It was performed on the normal skin (upper back) of 31 volunteers to determine whether 100 M and M of spiramycin had irritation or sensitization potential. In these assays, spiramycin did not induce any adverse reactions.

One way to increase uptake is to take advantage of environments outside of primary care which present easy opportunities for vaccination. This study provides a narrative review of hospital-based strategies in acute care settings aimed at improving influenza vaccination rates for adult inpatients. METHODS: A search was conducted using Scopus, Embase and PubMed databases for articles reporting on hospital-based interventions aimed at improving influenza vaccination for adults. Studies published in English were included and descriptively analysed. RESULTS: A total of 31 articles were included. Tested interventions included 7 standing order protocols (SOP); 4 reminders; 4 assessment/administration programs; 1 patient education program; 1 organisational-based program; 7 multi-component strategies and 8 studies comparing SOPs with other strategies. One article was included in both SOPs and reminders categories. Studies were published between 1983 and 2017 and conducted in the USA, Canada, or Australia. 18 studies reported statistical significance. Individually, each type of intervention showed success. SOPs were significantly more effective than other individual interventions, but multi-component interventions (which included an SOP) were more effective than SOPs alone. Three articles reported no significant increase in uptake attributed mainly to patient refusals, even with a strategy involving patient education. Only three studies tested provider-level strategies including hospital campaigns, hospital reward programs and interdepartmental competitions, and showed success. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-based interventions are an effective means of improving opportunistic inpatient vaccination. Suggestions for future research include organisational or system-based interventions; qualitative review of barriers and enablers to inpatient vaccination programs; and re-examination of outpatient settings for vaccine delivery. Most studies were not randomised or controlled; therefore, we also recommend additional RCT studies to confirm existing findings on individual strategies.","output":"A review of hospital-based interventions to improve inpatient influenza vaccination uptake for high-risk adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has affected many countries and regions In order to contain the spread of infection, many countries have adopted lockdown measures As a result, SARS-CoV-2 has negatively influenced economies on a global scale and has caused a significant impact on the environment In this study, changes in the concentration of the pollutant Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) within the lockdown period were examined as well as how these changes relate to the Spanish population NO2 is one of the reactive nitrogen oxides gases resulting from both anthropogenic and natural processes One major source in urban areas is the combustion of fossil fuels from vehicles and industrial plants, both of which significantly contribute to air pollution The long-term exposure to NO2 can also cause severe health problems Remote sensing is a useful tool to analyze spatial variability of air quality For this purpose, Sentinel-5P images registered from January to April of 2019 and 2020 were used to analyze spatial distribution of NO2 and its evolution under the lockdown measures in Spain The results indicate a significant correlation between the population&rsquo;s activity level and the reduction of NO2 values","output":"Effect of Lockdown Measures on Atmospheric Nitrogen Dioxide during SARS-CoV-2 in Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Student wellbeing is foundational to academic success One recent survey of postsecondary educators found that nearly 80 percent believed emotional wellbeing is a \\"very\\" or \\"extremely\\" important factor in student success Studies have found the dropout rates for students with a diagnosed mental health problem range from 43 percent to as high as 86 percent While dealing with stress is a normal part of life, for some students, stress can adversely affect their physical, emotional, and psychological health, particularly given that adolescence and early adulthood are when most mental illnesses are first manifested In addition to students who may develop mental health challenges during their time in postsecondary education, many students arrive on campus with a mental health problem or having experienced significant trauma in their lives, which can also negatively affect physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing The nation's institutions of higher education are seeing increasing levels of mental illness, substance use and other forms of emotional distress among their students Some of the problematic trends have been ongoing for decades Some have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic consequences Some are the result of long-festering systemic racism in almost every sphere of American life that are becoming more widely acknowledged throughout society and must, at last, be addressed Mental Health, Substance Use, and Wellbeing in Higher Education lays out a variety of possible strategies and approaches to meet increasing demand for mental health and substance use services, based on the available evidence on the nature of the issues and what works in various situations The recommendations of this report will support the delivery of mental health and wellness services by the nation's institutions of higher education","output":"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Wellbeing in Higher Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Structural racism causes significant inequities in the diagnosis of perinatal and maternal mental health disorders and access to perinatal and maternal mental health treatment.

This paper presents qualitative analysis of interviews with 20 people in middle age about their willingness to care for older relatives in the future. Interviewees were asked their general views about who should provide care, then to consider future scenarios in which a close relative developed care needs. Willingness to care was influenced by beliefs about reciprocity, love and identity, beliefs about who was likely to provide the best quality and most appropriate care, and beliefs about how difficult caring would be. Older relatives' care preferences were a key consideration. While some interviewees felt the best care would always be provided by family, others considered that professional skills were needed. Interviewees saw important roles for easily accessible information and advice, sharing care, including respite care, and financial support, in making it easier to provide care.

Such pressures may impact on working conditions, psychological wellbeing and perception of safety. In spite of this, no study has assessed the relationship between safety attitudes and psychological outcomes. Moreover, only limited studies have examined the relationship between personal characteristics and psychological outcomes during Covid-19. From 22nd March 2020 to 18th June 2020, healthcare workers from the United Kingdom, Poland, and Singapore were invited to participate using a self-administered questionnaire comprising the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ), Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to evaluate safety culture, burnout and anxiety/depression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of burnout, anxiety and depression. Of 3,537 healthcare workers who participated in the study, 2,364 (67%) screened positive for burnout, 701 (20%) for anxiety, and 389 (11%) for depression. Significant predictors of burnout included patient-facing roles: doctor (OR 2.10; 95% CI 1.49-2.95), nurse (OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.84), and 'other clinical' (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.45-2.82); being redeployed (OR 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58), bottom quartile SAQ score (OR 2.43; 95% CI 1.98-2.99), anxiety (OR 4.87; 95% CI 3.92-6.06) and depression (OR 4.06; 95% CI 3.04-5.42).

Generally, vaccines are considered as public health tools rather than from the individual patient perspective.

Currently, most immunization programs, including those for pneumococcal vaccines, have only been adopted on the basis of age or medical risk. Areas covered: Based on a broad literature search, this review addresses possible environmental factors which can affect the burden of pneumococcal disease and the immune response to pneumococcal vaccines. Expert opinion: Factors which influence the incidence of pneumococcal disease and the reaction against pneumococcal vaccination, including personal conditions, geographic/ethnic factors and social risks, are diverse. To maximize the effects of pneumococcal vaccination, not only for public health but also to induce optimal effects at the individual level, vaccines need to be verified under diverse situations and with collaboration among relevant medical societies, governments, and the pharmaceutical industry. Whereas vaccines are generally considered only from the public health perspective, flexible, comprehensive and tailored pneumococcal immunization programs, with appropriate policy support, can generate a greater positive impact on public health.","output":"Environmental factors which can affect the burden of pneumococcal disease and the immune response to pneumococcal vaccines: the need for more precisely delineated vaccine recommendations."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background : COVID-19, the disease caused by the highly infectious and transmissible coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has quickly become a morbid global pandemic Although the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is less clinically apparent, collecting high-quality biospecimens from infants, children and adolescents in a standardized manner during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential to establish a biologic understanding of the disease in the pediatric population This biorepository enables pediatric centers world-wide to collect samples in a standardized manner to drive forward our understanding of COVID-19 by addressing specific pediatric and neonatal COVID-19-related questions Methods : A broad study was implemented with strategic enrollment guidelines to include patients seen in urgent care clinics and hospital settings, neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 infected mothers, and asymptomatic children The methodology described here, details the importance of establishing collaborations between the clinical and research teams to harmonize protocols for patient recruitment and sample collection, processing and storage Results : Considerations and challenges facing enrollment of neonatal and pediatric cohorts are described A roadmap is laid out for successful collection, processing, storage and database management of multiple pediatric samples such as blood, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, saliva, tracheal aspirates, stool, and urine Using this methodology, we enrolled 327 participants, who provided a total of 972 biospecimens Conclusions : Pediatric biospecimens will be key in answering questions relating to viral transmission by children, differences between pediatric and adult viral susceptibility, and, immune responses, the impact of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection on fetal development, and factors driving the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children The specimens in this biorepository will allow necessary comparative studies between children and adults, help determine the accuracy of current pediatric viral testing techniques, in addition to, understanding neonatal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease abnormalities The successful establishment of a pediatric biorepository is critical to provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and subsequently, develop future treatment and vaccination strategies","output":"Establishment of a Pediatric COVID-19 Biorepository: Unique Considerations and Opportunities for Studying the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chapter 6 describes the adversarial environment.

Some orthopaedic surgeons in Wuhan were infected with COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a survey to identify the orthopaedic surgeons who were infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to collect information such as social demographic variables, clinical manifestations, exposure history, awareness of the outbreak, infection control training provided by hospitals, and individual protection practices. To further explore the possible risk factors at the individual level, a 1:2 matched case-control study was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 26 orthopaedic surgeons from 8 hospitals in Wuhan were identified as having COVID-19. The incidence in each hospital varied from 1.5% to 20.7%. The onset of symptoms was from January 13 to February 5, 2020, and peaked on January 23, 8 days prior to the peak of the public epidemic. The suspected sites of exposure were general wards (79.2%), public places at the hospital (20.8%), operating rooms (12.5%), the intensive care unit (4.2%), and the outpatient clinic (4.2%). There was transmission from these doctors to others in 25% of cases, including to family members (20.8%), to colleagues (4.2%), to patients (4.2%), and to friends (4.2%). Participation in real-time training on prevention measures was found to have a protective effect against COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR], 0.12). Not wearing an N95 respirator was found to be a risk factor (OR, 5.20 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09 to 25.00]).

There is an urgent need for sensitive diagnostic testing implementation to control and manage SARS-CoV-2 in public health laboratories. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay is the gold standard method, but the sensitivity and specificity of SARS-CoV-2 testing are dependent on a number of factors. METHODS: We synthesized RNA based on the genes published to estimate the concentration of inactivated virus samples in a biosafety level 3 laboratory. The limit of detection (LOD), linearity, accuracy, and precision were evaluated according to the bioanalytical method validation guidelines. RESULTS: We found that the LOD reached around 3 copies/reaction. Furthermore, intra-assay precision, accuracy, and linearity met the accepted criterion with an RSD for copies of less than 25%, and linear regression met the accepted R(2) of 0.98. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that synthesized RNA based on the database of the NCBI gene bank for estimating the concentration of inactivated virus samples provides a potential opportunity for reliable testing to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as well as limit the spread of the disease. This method may be relatively quick and inexpensive, and it may be useful for developing countries during the pandemic era. In the long term, it is also applicable for evaluation, verification, validation, and external quality assessment.","output":"The Production of Standardized Samples with Known Concentrations for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RT-qPCR Testing Validation for Developing Countries in the Period of the Pandemic Era"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The coronavirus pandemic has had devastating effects on many nations, including Afghanistan Public awareness and following recommendations play an important part in managing such a large-scale crisis, which are affected largely by knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) Medical students can act as reliable sources of information for the public in such a scenario This study aimed to investigate KAP of medical students regarding COVID-19 Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in October 2020 among medical students in Afghanistan, Kabul University of Medical Sciences Information on sociodemographics and KAP, was collected using a web-based questionnaire Results: A total of 1,169 medical students completed the survey More than half were female (54 6%), a majority (95%) aged &gt;=20 years, and more than half (56 2%) lived in the city of Kabul Overall, students had acceptable KAP regarding COVID-19, except for a few undesirable responses with regard to the risks of close contact with COVID-19 patients, incubation periods, and groups vulnerable to COVID-19 Conclusion: Overall, the students had acceptable KAP regarding COVID-19, except for the few undesired aforementioned responses, which need more focus during awareness campaigns in future","output":"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices of Medical Students Regarding COVID-19 in Afghanistan: A Cross-Sectional Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 is expected to have a significant impact on the socio-behavioural aspect of citizens lives, although the effects are expected to manifest differently in different population groups.

This characteristic is unusual and seems specific to COVID\\\\19 infections, especially in their severe form. Viral infections can trigger acquired thrombophilia, which can then lead to thrombotic complications. We investigate for the presence of acquired thrombophilia, which could participate in this phenomenon, and report its prevalence. We also wonder if these thrombophilias participate in the bad prognosis of severe COVID\\\\19 infections. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 89 consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID\\\\19 infection, we found a 20% prevalence of PS (protein S) deficiency and a high (ie, 72%) prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies: mainly lupus anticoagulant. The presence of PS deficiency or antiphospholipid antibodies was not linked with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time nor with D\\\\dimer, fibrinogen, or CRP (C\\\\reactive protein) concentrations. These coagulation abnormalities are also not linked with thrombotic clinical events occurring during hospitalization nor with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: We assess a high prevalence of positive tests detecting thrombophilia in COVID\\\\19 infections. However, in our series, these acquired thrombophilias are not correlated with the severity of the disease nor with the occurrence of thrombotic events. Albeit the strong thrombotic tendency in COVID\\\\19 infections, the presence of frequent acquired thrombophilia may be part of the inflammation storm of COVID\\\\19 and should not systematically modify our strategy on prophylactic anticoagulant treatment, which is already revised upwards in this pathological condition.

The birth of cyber diplomacy, occurred in the year 2007, which will always be remembered due to a wide-ranging cyber attack on Estonia. Indeed, Estonia is known for being one of the most wired countries in Europe. The attack consisted of crippled computer networks because of hackers which paralysed numerous amount of government and corporates sites. The escalation in these kinds of attacks highlighted the need for governments to formulate national cyber strategies. This sprang from the realisation that cyberspace, like the physical world, also has military and strategic dimensions and requires countries to work together to defeat cyber opponents. Attacks within cyberspace are subject to strategically-formulated threats, which go beyond the usual physical terrorist-type threats. Global progress, democracy and peace are at stake. This makes cyber diplomacy a major issue for countries foreign policies, due to the interdisciplinary nature of the domain. A number of aspects are relevant in this respect: policies, politics and sociology (dread), diplomacy, digital/cyber science, multilateralism and world history. This paper reports on a systematic literature review that was carried out to reveal the dimensions of current cyber diplomacy research. While a number of studies have introduced and defined Cyber Diplomacy and its associated diplomatic actions, none have sought to distinguish this field from the more traditional and well established diplomacy concept.

Zinc (Zn) is a cofactor for desaturases and elongases enzymes. There is limited evidence regarding the relationships between biomarkers of Zn status, nutritional intake, plasma phospholipid fatty acid profile and clinical outcomes among patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Objective: To examine the relationships between dietary and serum levels of Zn and Cu/Zn ratio and to explore associations of these micronutrients with PUFA profile and estimated desaturase and elongase enzyme activities in serum phospholipids among HD patients. Methods: This study included 40 adult patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. Repeated 24-h recalls were applied for dietary intake assessment. Serum concentration of Zn and Cu were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and fatty acid composition by gas-liquid chromatography. Desaturase and elongase activities were calculated from product-precursor fatty acid ratios. Results: Inadequate dietary Zn intake was found in 55% of HD patients. They all had serum Zn concentration below the reference value of 60 g/dL (mean 38.8  7.72 g/dL). Adequate zinc intake was accompanied with significantly higher intake of energy, total fats, SFA, MUFA and proteins. There was no correlation between Zn serum status and Zn intake estimates. Serum Cu/Zn ratio was high, (2.76  0.68), directly and significantly associated with HD period, CRP, BMI, VFA, and inversely with Kt/V, albumin, iron, and iPTH. The n-6/n-3 ratio in plasma phospholipids was elevated (12.25  3.45) and patients with inadequate Zn intake had lower n-3 PUFA intake and status compared to those with adequate intake. Serum Zn concentrations were inversely correlated with linoleic/dihomo--linolenic acid ratio (LA/DGLA) (p = 0.037), related to D6-desaturase activity (p = 0.033) and directly with DGLA relative abundances (p = 0.024). Cu status was inversely associated with EPA level (p = 0.03) and estimates of elongase activity (p = 0.001). Furthermore, positive relationship was found between the Cu/Zn ratio and determined elongase value (p = 0.01). Conclusion: Findings of this study underpin the high prevalence of Zn deficiency and inadequate n-3 PUFA intake and status among subjects undergoing HD. The results obtained indicate that the assessment of Zn status should be a standard parameter of nutritional status screening in HD patients while emphasizing the importance of Cu/Zn determination.

STUDY DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Data were collected between 6th and 7th May 2020. A total of 2240 participants living in the UK aged 18 years or older were recruited from YouGov's online research panel. RESULTS: A total of 217 people (9.7%) reported that they or someone in their household had symptoms of COVID-19 (cough or high temperature/fever) in the last 7 days. Of these people, 75.1% had left the home in the last 24 h (defined as non-adherent). Men were more likely to be non-adherent, as were people who were less worried about COVID-19, and who perceived a smaller risk of catching COVID-19. Adherence was associated with having received help from someone outside your household. Results should be taken with caution as there was no evidence for associations when controlling for multiple analyses. Of people reporting no symptoms in the household, 24.5% had gone out shopping for non-essentials in the last week (defined as non-adherent). Factors associated with non-adherence and with a higher total number of outings in the last week included decreased perceived effectiveness of government lockdown measures, decreased perceived severity of COVID-19 and decreased estimates of how many other people were following lockdown rules. Having received help was associated with better adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to self-isolation is poor. As we move into a new phase of contact tracing and self-isolation, it is essential that adherence is improved. Communications should aim to increase knowledge about actions to take when symptomatic or if you have been in contact with a possible COVID-19 case. They should also emphasise the risk of catching and spreading COVID-19 when out and about and the effectiveness of preventative measures.

METHODS: Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. RESULTS: About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. CONCLUSIONS: There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread.

In addition to remote working, parents have had to monitor their childrens schoolwork and manage their daily lives. When one of the children also has neuro-developmental disorders, this results in an increased burden. We can therefore wonder how these families with one or more young children (under 6 years old) with special needs have experienced and dealt with this lockdown. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this context, the COVJEUNENFANT study focused more specifically on the subjective experience, as a parent, of those who cared for children with special needs (i.e., with developmental disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, proven disabilities or chronic health conditions) compared to the general population. We wished to see if the consequences of the health crisis were significantly different from those perceived by respondents in the general population (n = 490) and if the sociodemographic structure of these families differed from those of other respondents. METHODS: Ninety three French families with at least one child under 6 years old and one with developmental difficulties or a chronic illness, from a cohort of 490 control families, participated in a web-based survey during the first lockdown, from the 28th April 2020 to 29th May 2020. RESULTS: After presenting the participants sociodemographic characteristics, the results show that these French families (n = 93) are less wealthy than the control population without special needs (n = 397), have felt more pressures originating from their environment (families, friends, colleagues, media, social networks), have suffered from more health issues (other than COVID-19), have taken more measures to protect themselves (social-distancing), and were less likely to feel happy. A significantly larger number of them lamented the lack of free time and voiced a larger need for information regarding childrens education. However, their parental role was felt as being more satisfying and their family relations strengthened more than in the general population of participants. CONCLUSION: It is apparent that urgent prioritisation is needed in order to support and care for these families by continuing to provide care for their children in one way or another, and by ensuring that their need to adapt again does not exceed their own abilities and resources, especially as young children, who have high levels of requirements, are present in the home.","output":"Lockdown in France: Impact on Families of Young Children With Special Needs"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: Sociocultural factors in the aftermath of any pandemic can play a role in increasing suicidal behavior like suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts, or suicide.

Harbin is one of the major cities in northeast China, and more than half of any given year in Harbin is occupied by winter. To reveal the viral etiology and seasonality in adult patients from Harbin, a 4-year consecutive survey was conducted in Harbin, China. Methods: From January 2014 to December 2017, specimens were obtained from adult patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University with lower respiratory tract infections. Sputum samples were examined by direct immunofluorescence assays to detect seven common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (type A and B), parainfluenza virus (type 1 to 3), respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Adenovirus positive samples were seeded onto A549 cells to isolate viral strains. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the highly variable region of adenoviral hexon gene. Results: A total of 1,300 hospitalized adult patients with lower respiratory tract infections were enrolled, in which 189 patients (14.5%) were detected as having at least one viral infection. The co-infection rate in this study was 25.9% (49/189). The dominant viral pathogen from 2014 to 2017 was parainfluenza virus, with a detection rate of 7.2%, followed by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Based on the climate seasons determined by daily average temperature, the highest overall viral detection rate was detected in spring (22.0%, 52/236), followed by winter (13.4%, 109/813), autumn (11.4%, 13/114) and summer (10.9%, 15/137). Adenovirus type 3 strains with slight variations were isolated from positive cases, which were closely related to the GB strain from the United States, as well as the Harbin04B strain isolated locally. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that common respiratory viruses were partially responsible for hospitalized lower respiratory tract infections in adult patients from Harbin, China, with parainfluenza virus as the dominant viral pathogen. Climate seasons could be rational indicators for the seasonality analysis of airborne viral infections.

Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and ?229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors.

Primary endpoint was mortality rate. Five RCTs involving 7692 patients were included. Overall mortality of patients treated with corticosteroids was slightly but significantly lower than mortality of controls (26% vs 28%, RR=0.89 [95% CI 0.82 to 0.96], p=0.003). The same beneficial effect was found in the subgroup of patients requiring mechanical ventilation (RR=0.85 [95% CI 0.72-1.00], p=0.05 NNT=19). Remarkably, corticosteroids increased mortality in the subgroup of patients not requiring oxygen (17% vs 13%, RR=1.23 [95% CI 1.00 to 1.62], p=0.05 NNH=29). Tests for comparison between mechanical ventilated and not requiring oxygen subgroups confirmed that treatment with corticosteroids had a statistically significant different effect on survival. Patients treated with corticosteroids had a significantly lower risk of need for mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: : Corticosteroids may be weighed in severe critically ill COVID-19 patients, but must be discouraged in patients not requiring oxygen therapy. Further trials are urgently warranted before implementing this treatment worldwide.","output":"Corticosteroids for COVID-19 patients with different disease severity: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic forces learning activities to change from classroom learning to online-based learning Based on the results of the interview, it was found that the teachers at Nurul Fadhilah school did not yet have the readiness to manage online teaching and learning activities, especially in science subjects The influencing factors are (1) understanding of basic science concepts (physics, chemistry, biology), (2) understanding of systematic online learning management and (3) mastery of Learning Management System (LMS) technology Therefore, the aim of this activity is to implement LMS technology in the management of online science learning using a basic conceptual approach to chemistry education LMS is a technology application developed specifically for managing classrooms, distributing learning materials and enabling collaboration between students and teachers online The LMS used in this activity is Google Classroom Based on the data, it is known that 65% of the teachers at Nurul Fadhilah School have not managed online science teaching and learning activities using LMS technology The results of the systematic online science learning management workshop using the basic concepts of chemistry education and the implementation of LMS technology, especially Google Classroom, showed an increase, as many as 80% of teachers have created, designed and managed classes interactively using Google Classroom LMS technology and have integrated the concept of basic chemistry education in science learning So that students are more happy and comfortable in learning online and are more disciplined in collecting assignments and teachers are more comfortable in managing and evaluating student assignments Keywords: Natural science, Learning management system, Google classroom","output":"The Implementation For Natural Science Online Lecture With Chemistry Education Base At Nurul Fadhillah School Bandar Setia"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We adopt and extend the concept of noncooperative space to analyze how (aspirant) black women intellectual activists attempt to sustain their efforts within settings that publicly endorse racial equality, while, in practice, the contexts remain deeply racist. Noncooperative spaces reflect institutional, organizational, and social environments portrayed by powerful white agents as conducive to anti-racism work and promoting racial equality but, indeed, constrain individuals who challenge racism. Our work, which is grounded in intersectionality, draws on an autoethnographic account of racially motivated domestic violence suffered by our lead author. Our analysis suggests that (aspirant) black women intellectual activists must develop courage to sustain their voice within noncooperative spaces. However, the three interlinked dimensions of noncooperative spacesnamely, deceiving design, hegemonic actors indifference to racism, and (some assimilated gatekeepers) false equivalencemay gradually erode a black female scholars courage. This forces her voice to vanish temporarily, or even permanently. Courage is thus fragile and depletable. Yet, courage can be regenerated, resulting in regaining voice. Consequently, we propose courageous collective action by white allies and black and brown individuals who voluntarily and officially cooperate within and across various spaces to achieve racial equality.","output":"A Critique of Vanishing Voice in Noncooperative Spaces: The Perspective of an Aspirant Black Female Intellectual Activist"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background This study focused on online social interactions as non-face-to-face interactions increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic today. This study aims to identify factors that affect the smooth interaction between participants, and the outputs in online co-creation, to propose ways of using co-creation tools. Methods Based on the conversations of participants in the online co-creation empirical study, the frequency of social interaction and facilitating factors were derived. Then, a t-test was performed to compare the ideas of the groups and to confirm the difference. Finally, the effects of the facilitating factors were verified by comparing the results of the empirical study and the literature search. Results First, the most frequent personal experience mention factor in human is based on daily conversations between participants. Second, the facilitators answer induction factor, which is the most frequent in facilitator, intentionally leads to an answer, increasing interaction. Third, the shared post-it factor, which is the most frequent in technology and material, effectively helps online collaboration. Fourth, the pre-participant experience gathering factor, which is the most frequent in other, increases opinion feedback by expressing ideas visually. Conclusions The Silence domain and the participant experience gathering factors analyzed in this study could compensate for the problem of low feasibility of ideas developed online. In addition, where online collaboration research is increasing, it is necessary to conduct a follow-up study on the participation of multi-stakeholders in online co-creation in the future based on the results of this study.

The first major solidarity action responded to the euro debt crisis. Despite economic policy mistakes and the fact that the crisis was self-inflicted to this depth, the other EU states demonstrated solidarity. In doing so, they took significant financial risks for their own taxpayers by taking comprehensive support measures and establishing a euro rescue fund. The EU also showed solidarity with extensive aid packages during the Corona pandemic. The EUs first Corona crisis package of May 2020 was followed by a reconstruction instrument known as the Next Generation EU (NGEU). It is worth almost 807 billion euros. Most of it goes to the Reconstruction and Resilience Facility and is to be used for investments and reforms in EU member states. Disbursement of the funds is tied to reconstruction and resilience plans, which must be submitted by the member states and are assessed by the European Commission. The fact that the countries make the plans themselves and the European Commission does not prescribe them, but only checks them, increases the so-called ownership and the chances of implementation.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A three-armed, waitlist, randomized trial design tested Tele-Savvy, an online adaptation of a successful in-person psychoeducation program, the Savvy Caregiver. Tele-Savvy is delivered over 43 days to groups of 6-8 caregivers in seven weekly synchronous sessions accompanied by 36 brief asynchronous video lessons. We enrolled 23 cohorts of 15 eligible caregivers (N=261), randomized 2:2:1 to active, attention control, and usual care arms. We assessed caregiver psychological well-being and caregiving mastery at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Multilevel linear models assessed outcomes over the three time points examined. The trial was slightly truncated, with DSMB approval, because of the apparent confounding psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions. RESULTS: Study findings indicate statistically and clinically significant benefits to Tele-Savvy arm caregivers (with moderate to large effect sizes) in the areas of depression, perceived stress, reaction to care-recipients' behaviors and enhancement of caregiver mastery. Expected benefits for caregiver burden and anxiety were not found. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Findings attest to program efficacy and the viability of employing distance means to improve family caregivers' emotional well-being and sense of mastery in the caregiving role over a 6-month period.

METHODS: An 8-month-old girl was hospitalized because of uncontrollable fever and cough for 6 days. Routine laboratory tests, biochemical detection, immunological tests, pathogenic examination, and imaging inspection were performed. Genetic tests of trio whole genome sequencing (Trio-WES), trio copy number sequencing (Trio-CNVseq), and Sanger sequencing were conducted to identify pathogenic variants. In silico analysis of the sequence alignment and structural modeling results was carried out to study the possible pathogenicity of the identified variant. Western blotting was performed to investigate the expression of the identified gene at the protein level. RESULTS: Enhanced CT and MRI scanning demonstrated thymic dysplasia, diffuse pulmonary and liver nodules, and many balloon-like air sacs in both lungs. The white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and neutrophil ratio were normal or elevated. The patient was HIV-negative and bone marrow and blood culture showed T. marneffei infection. Total lymphocyte count, CD3+ T lymphocyte count, CD3+CD4+ T lymphocyte count, CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte count, and NK cell count decreased, while the number of CD19 positive B cells increased.

Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 14 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal to noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE. Significance Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a cause of significant morbidity after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is often drug-resistant. Robust, informative animal models would greatly facilitate PTE research. Ideally, this biofidelic model of PTE would utilize a species that approximates human brain anatomy, brain size, glial populations, and inflammatory pathways. An ideal model would also incorporate feasible methods for long-term video EEG recording required to quantify seizure activity. Here, we describe the first model of PTE in swine and describe a method for robust long-term video EEG monitoring for up to 14 months post-TBI.

The better strategy regarding fluid volume is debated, but preliminary data in patients with septic shock or sepsis-related hypotension favor restrictive fluid administration. We describe the protocol and statistical analysis plan for the Restrictive Fluid Administration vs. Standard of Care in Emergency Department Sepsis Patients (REFACED Sepsis)a multicenter, randomized clinical proof-of-concept trial. The aim of the REFACED Sepsis trial is to test if a restrictive intravenous fluid protocol in emergency department patients with sepsis without shock is feasible and decreases the intravenous fluid volume administered in comparison to standard care. METHODS: This is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-labeled, feasibility trial investigating volumes of crystalloid fluid within 24 h in 124 patients with sepsis without shock enrolled at three emergency departments in the Central Denmark Region. Patients are allocated to two different intravenous fluid regimens: a restrictive approach using four trigger criteria for fluid administration vs. standard care. The primary, feasibility outcome is total intravenous, crystalloid fluid volume within 24 h, and key secondary outcomes include protocol violations, total fluids (intravenous and oral) within 24 h, and serious adverse reactions and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions. Status: The trial started in November 2021, and the last patient is anticipated to be included in January 2022. DISCUSSION: Sepsis is very common in emergency department patients and fluid administration is very frequently administered in these patients. However, the evidence to guide fluid administration is very sparse.

METHODS: This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled ascending dosing study including two parts: in part 1, 30 participants received 0.004-11.475mg h-1 of STR-324 or placebo (ratio 4:1) by 4h intravenous infusion in a two-group, partial cross-over design with four treatment periods separated by one month wash-out, and in part 2, 48 participants divided into three groups received either the active drug (1.25-11.25mg h-1) or placebo (ratio 3:1) by 48h intravenous infusion. Safety and tolerability parameters, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects on neurocognitive and neurophysiological tasks and on a nociceptive test battery were evaluated. RESULTS: No clinically relevant changes in safety parameters were observed. All treatment-emergent adverse events were mild and transient. Pharmacokinetics of STR-324 could not be determined due to most concentrations being below quantifiable limits.

The 30-day mortality rate was 20 per cent in the drain group versus 34 per cent after no drainage (OR 068, 95 per cent c.i. 026 to 179; P = 043). The morbidity rate was 656 per cent in the drain group and 620 per cent in the no-drain group (OR 117, 086 to 160; P = 031). Clinically relevant pancreatic fistulas were seen in 115 per cent of patients in the drain group and 95 per cent in the no-drain group. Reinterventions, intra-abdominal abscesses and duration of hospital stay also showed no significant difference between the two groups. CONCLUSION Pancreatic resection with, or without abdominal drainage results in similar rates of mortality, morbidity and reintervention.","output":"Meta-analysis of prophylactic abdominal drainage in pancreatic surgery."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ISSUES Prescription drug monitoring programs are a harm minimisation intervention and clinical decision support tool that address the public health concern surrounding prescription drug misuse. Given the large number of studies published to date and the ongoing implementation of these programs, it is important to map the literature and identify areas for further research to improve practice. APPROACH A scoping review was undertaken to identify the research on prescription drug monitoring programs published between January 2015 and April 2021. KEY FINDINGS A total of 153 citations were included in this scoping review. The majority of the studies originated from the USA and were quantitative. Results on program effectiveness are mixed and mainly examine their association with opioid-related outcomes. Unintended consequences are revealed in the literature and this review also highlights barriers to program use. IMPLICATIONS Overall, findings are mixed despite the large number of studies published to date. Mapping the literature identifies priority areas for further research that can advise policymakers and clinicians on practice improvement. CONCLUSION Results on prescription drug monitoring program effectiveness are mixed and mainly examine their association with opioid-related outcomes. This review highlights barriers to prescription drug monitoring program effectiveness related to program use and system integration.

We collected data on consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Emergency Department of Castel San Giovanni Hospital, between February 29th and April 7th, 2020. Exclusion criteria were age <18 years, hospital stay <7 days, patients on dialysis and patients who had been transferred to other centers for which we could not collect data. Of the 257 patients included in the study, 49 (19.1%) died during hospitalization. We considered a wide set of variables as independent variables (age, sex, comorbidities and in-hospital treatments). We used a multivariate logistic regression model and, being heparin the only one therapy affecting survival rate, we compared prophylactic LMWH (p-LMWH) and Therapeutic LMWH (T-LMWH) groups. Kaplan Meier curve showed a higher survival probability in the T-LMWH and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant according to the log-rank or Mantel- Haenszel test (p< 0.0001). In a stratified analysis by ventilation type, the subgroup of patients who benefited from therapeutic LMWH was that in non-invasive mechanical ventilation. Using a multivariate analysis and adjusting for the drugs intake, T-LMWH was the only therapy impacting on survival (HR 0.293, p <0.001). No fatal bleeding was observed.

They are characterised by an aneurysmatic dilatation of the pulmonary vascular bed, including the main pulmonary artery or the accompanying pulmonary artery branches. Increases in pulmonary flow and pulmonary artery pressure increase the risk of rupture: when these conditions are detected, surgical intervention is necessary.This study is a retrospective analysis of 33 patients treated in our paediatric cardiac surgery clinic from 2012 to 2020. Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms in patients who were patched for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction and corrected with a conduit were excluded from the study. Seventeen (51.5%) of the patients included in the study were female and 16 (48.5%) were male. The patients were aged between 23 and 61 years (mean 30.66  12.72 years). Graft interpositions were performed in 10 patients (30.3%) and pulmonary artery plications were performed in 23 patients (69.7%) to repair aneurysms. There was no significant difference in mortality between the two groups (p > 0.05).Pulmonary artery aneurysm interventions are safe, life-saving treatments that prevent fatal complications such as ruptures, but at present there is no clear guidance regarding surgical timing or treatment strategies. Pulmonary artery interventions should be performed in symptomatic patients with dilations 5 cm or asymptomatic patients with dilations 8 cm; pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular systolic pressure, and pulmonary artery aneurysm diameter must be considered when planning surgeries, their timing, and making decisions regarding indications.

The episodic control-binding hypothesis posits that the formation of temporary stimulus-control bindings, which are held in event-files supported by episodic memory, can guide the contextually appropriate application of cognitive control. Across two experiments, we sought to examine the role of task-focused attention in the encoding and implementation of stimulus-control bindings in episodic event-files. In Experiment 1, we obtained self-reports of mind wandering during encoding and implementation of stimulus-control bindings. Results indicated that, whereas mind wandering during the implementation of stimulus-control bindings does not decrease their efficacy, mind wandering during the encoding of these control-state associations interferes with their successful deployment at a later point. In Experiment 2, we complemented these results by using trial-by-trial pupillometry to measure attention, again demonstrating that attention levels at encoding predict the subsequent implementation of stimulus-control bindings better than attention levels at implementation. These results suggest that, although encoding stimulus-control bindings in episodic memory requires active attention and engagement, once encoded, these bindings are automatically deployed to guide behavior when the stimulus recurs. These findings expand our understanding of how cognitive control processes are integrated into episodic event files.

In the first case we study the possibility that cosmic rays from the supernova remnant (SNR) Puppis A, seen nearby in the sky, reach the dense gas at the location of the source and produce the gamma-rays through inelastic proton-proton collisions. We apply a standard model for particle diffusion in the interstellar medium and derive the required physical parameters. We find that this scenario for the gamma rays is possible if the gas is located at a distance that is not higher than ~40 pc from Puppis A, unless the SNR is older than 7 kyr or the diffusion coefficient is higher than typical Galactic values, and relatively low-energy cosmic rays are currently escaping from the SNR. In the second scenario, we consider the protostellar jet HH219 as the origin of the GeV source and find the very interesting possibility that particles could be accelerated up to energies of at least several TeV in HH219. This would make this system the first known of its kind to produce gamma-ray emission extending up to hundreds of GeV without any apparent cutoff and an excellent laboratory to study the process of particle acceleration.","output":"Probing the origin of 4FGL J0822.8-4207: cosmic ray illumination from the SNR Puppis A and the Herbig-Haro object HH219"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A pandemic like Covid19 has shifted the paradigm of our daily life.

The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study was to assess the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on job organization, exploring the effects of lockdown measures on the psychological distress and perceived well-being of workers experiencing telework. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A web-based cross-sectional survey has been used to collect data. The participants answered the questionnaire from April 1 to April 30, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, which investigated: 1) demographic and occupational variables, 2) lifestyle and habits variables, 3) psychological distress and perceived well-being. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been used to evaluate psychological distress and the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to explore subjective well-being. RESULTS Psychological distress was associated with educational level, with habits, and with reporting poor well-being. Poor well-being was associated with a higher job demand during pandemic, lifestyle and habits variables, and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS This is one of the first studies exploring the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the perceived well-being and psychological distress of workers experiencing telework.

Mitochondria that are injured are removed by mitophagy, and this process can be critical for regulating macrophage activation. For example, impaired mitophagy can result in cytosolic leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that can lead to activation of cGASCSTING signaling pathway of macrophage proinflammatory response.

Most recent studies identified a single point mutation in S gene. A single point mutation in S gene leading to an amino acid substitution at codon 614 from an aspartic acid 614 into glycine (D614G) resulted in greater infectivity compared to the wild type SARS-CoV2.

Previous studies have shown that the time to thrombolysis should be less than 30 minutes of the patients arrival at the emergency room. Pain-to-needle time is a time from onset of chest pain to the initiation of thrombolysis, and door-to-needle time is a time between arrival to the emergency room to initiation of thrombolytic treatment. Ideally, the target for door-to-needle time should be less than 30 minutes; however, it is unclear if the door-to-needle time has a significant impact on patients presenting later than three hours from the onset of pain. As many of the previous studies were conducted in first-world countries, with established emergency medical services (EMS) systems and pre-hospital ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) triages and protocols, the data is not completely generalizable to developing countries. We, therefore, looked for the impact of the shorter and longer door-to-needle times on patient outcomes who presented to the emergency room (ER) with delayed pain-to-needle times (more than three hours of pain onset). Objective To determine the impact of delayed pain-to-needle time (PNT) with variable door-to-needle time (DNT) on in-hospital complications (post-infarct angina, heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and death) in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who underwent thrombolysis. Methods and results A total of 300 STEMI patients who underwent thrombolysis within 12 hours of symptoms onset were included, which were divided into two groups based on PNT. These groups were further divided into subgroups based on DNT. The primary outcome was in-hospital complications between the two groups and between subgroups within each group. The pain-to-needle time was 3 hours in 73 (24.3%) patients and >3 hours in 227 (75.7%) patients. In-hospital complications were higher in group II with PNT >3 hours (p <0.05). On subgroup analysis, in-hospital complications were higher with longer door-to-needle time in group II (p<0.05); however, there was no difference in complications among group I.

We used the conceptual framework of prosocial behavior during an emergency - behaviors whose primary focus is benefiting others - to examine volunteering during COVID-19. MethodsWe conducted an in-depth, mixed-methods cross-sectional survey, from 2nd May to 15th June 2020, of medical students studying at UK medical schools. Data analysis was informed by Latane and Darleys theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency and aimed to understand students decision-making processes. ResultsA total of 1145 medical students from 36 medical schools completed the survey. While 947 (82.7%) of students were willing to volunteer, only 391 (34.3%) had volunteered. The majority (92.7%) of students understood that they may be asked to volunteer; however, we found that deciding ones responsibility to volunteer was mitigated by a complex interaction between the interests of others and self-interest. Further, concerns revolving around professional role boundaries influenced students decisions over whether they had the required skills and knowledge to volunteer. Deciding to volunteer depended not only on possession of necessary skills, but also seniority and identification with the nature of volunteering roles offered. ConclusionsWe propose two additional domains to Latane and Darleys theory of prosocial behavior during an emergency that students consider before making their final decision to volunteer. These are logistics - whether it is logistically feasible to volunteer - and safety - whether it is safe to volunteer. This study highlights a number of modifiable barriers to prosocial behavior that medical students encounter and provides suggestions regarding how Latane and Darleys theory of prosocial behavior can be operationalized within educational strategies to address these barriers.

Younger children appear to be at greater risk than adults, yet helmet use is low despite this risk and legislation and ordinances requiring helmet use among younger riders. We sought to determine whether bicycle helmets are associated with the incidence and severity of head injury among pediatric bicyclists involved in a bicycle crash involving a motor vehicle. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients age  18 years hospitalized at a level I pediatric trauma center between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Data were abstracted from the institutional trauma registry and electronic medical record. International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th editions and external causes of injury codes were used to identify MV related bicycle crashes and determine the abbreviated injury severity (AIS) for head injury severity. Injury narratives were reviewed to determine helmet use. We calculated the incidence of head injury from bicycle vs. MV crashes utilizing descriptive statistics. We analyzed the risk and severity of injury utilizing univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 226 bicyclists were treated for injuries from being struck by a MV. The median age was 11 (interquartile range (IQR): 8 to 13) years. Helmeted bicyclists (n = 26, 27%) were younger (9.4 years versus 10.8 years, p = 0.04), and were less likely (OR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.49) to be diagnosed with a head injury compared to unhelmeted bicyclists (n = 199). Of those with a head injury, helmeted bicyclists were less likely (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11C2.82) to sustain severe or higher injury using AIS. When adjusting for demographics (age, sex, race) and injury severity, helmet use predicted a reduction in head injury (OR 6.02, 95% CI 2.4C15.2).

Current iNKT cell strategies are hindered by the extremely low presence of iNKT cells, and we have developed a platform to overcome this critical limitation. METHODS: We produced allogeneic HSC-engineered iNKT ((Allo)HSC-iNKT) cells through TCR engineering of human cord blood CD34(+) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and differentiation of these HSCs into iNKT cells in an Ex Vivo HSC-Derived iNKT Cell Culture. We then established in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection assays to assess (Allo)HSC-iNKT cell antiviral and anti-hyperinflammation functions. Lastly, using in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, we evaluated (Allo)HSC-iNKT cell safety and immunogenicity for off-the-shelf application. RESULTS: We reliably generated (Allo)HSC-iNKT cells at high-yield and of high-purity; these resulting cells closely resembled endogenous human iNKT cells in phenotypes and functionalities.

CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report a method to robustly produce therapeutic levels of (Allo)HSC-iNKT cells. Preclinical studies showed that these (Allo)HSC-iNKT cells closely resembled endogenous human iNKT cells, could reduce SARS-CoV-2 virus infection load and mitigate virus infection-induced hyperinflammation, and meanwhile were free of GvHD-risk and resistant to T cell-mediated allorejection. These results support the development of (Allo)HSC-iNKT cells as a promising off-the-shelf cell product for treating COVID-19; such a cell product has the potential to target the new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the future new emerging viruses.

Despite established susceptibility to infectious complications and the importance of humoral immunity in protection against SARS-CoV-2, few studies have investigated the humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 within this population. Here, we evaluate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in patients awaiting renal transplantation and determine whether seroconverted patients with ESKD have durable and functional neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Serum samples were obtained from 164 patients with ESKD by August 2020. Humoral immune responses were evaluated by SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit and nucleoprotein semiquantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudotype neutralization assay. All patients with ESKD with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed infection (n = 17) except for 1 individual seroconverted against SARS-CoV-2. Overall seroprevalence (anti-S1 and/or anti-N IgG) was 36% and was higher in patients on hemodialysis (44.2%). A total of 35.6% of individuals who seroconverted were asymptomatic. Seroconversion in the absence of a neutralizing antibody (nAb) titer was observed in 12 patients, all of whom were asymptomatic. Repeat measurements at a median of 93 days from baseline sampling revealed that most individuals retained detectable responses although a significant drop in S1, N and nAb titers was observed. Patients with ESKD, including those who develop asymptomatic disease, routinely seroconvert and produce detectable nAb titers against SARS-CoV-2. Although IgG levels wane over time, the neutralizing antibodies remain detectable in most patients, suggesting some level of protection is likely maintained, particularly in those who originally develop stronger responses.","output":"Neutralizing Antibody Responses After SARS-CoV-2 Infection in End-Stage Kidney Disease and Protection Against Reinfection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide medical challenge due to the scarcity of proper information and remedial resources.

This is a multi-phase observatory study conducted in the SG Moscati Hospital of Taranto in Italy that was converted into COVID-19 Special Care Unit for SARS-Co-V2 risk management. Patients were admitted to the 118 Emergency Pre-Hospital and Emergency Department based on two diagnostic criteria, the nasopharyngeal swab assessed by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) and CT-scan image characterized by ground glass opacity. Patients were divided into four groups, positive-positive (ER-PP), negative-positive (ER-NP), negative-negative (ER-NN) and a group admitted to the ICU (ER-IC). A further control group was added when the T and B lymphocyte subsets were analyzed. Data included gender, age, vital signs, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), extensive laboratory results with microbiology and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) which were analyzed and compared. Fundamental differences were reported among the groups. Males were significantly higher in PP, ICU, and NP groups, from 2 to 4-fold higher than females, while in the NN group, the number of females was mildly higher than males; the PP patients showed a marked alkalotic, hypoxic, hypocapnia ABG profile with hyperventilation at the time of admission; finally, the laboratory and microbiology results showed lymphopenia, fibrinogen, ESR, CRP, and eGFR were markedly anomalous.

Concern has been raised about the lack of veterinary pharmacy training that community pharmacists receive, but no studies have evaluated the actual prevalence of errors in veterinary prescriptions including the prevalence of prescription writing errors. OBJECTIVES: This study identifies the prevalence of errors in veterinary prescriptions at independent community pharmacies. METHODS: An electronic form was used to ensure required information was pulled from the pharmacy software systems in a consistent manner. Information was pulled from the hard copy image and the prescription label corresponding to that fill. Prescribing trends, such as species and errors, were assessed using descriptive statistics for the overall sample. Error comparisons between written and verbal prescriptions and between weight-based and nonweight-based prescriptions were assessed using chi-square and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: Weight, although not legally required but clinically necessary for evaluation of veterinary prescriptions, was omitted from 97.8% of prescriptions. When evaluating the prevalence of errors between handwritten and verbal prescriptions, it was more likely to see errors in prescriptions handwritten by the veterinarian (105 of 119; 88%) than verbal prescriptions (257 of 389; 66%). Conversely, handwritten prescriptions were less likely to omit the required Drug Enforcement Agency number on controlled substance prescriptions. CONCLUSION: Based on the number of errors seen in both handwritten and verbal prescriptions, emphasis should be placed on training pharmacists to be competent in clinically evaluating veterinary prescriptions and training veterinarians on handwriting prescriptions to include both legally and clinically required information needed before dispensing.","output":"Veterinary prescription errors in a community pharmacy setting: A retrospective review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives.

Generally, teleworking arrangements impacts directly worker's efficiency and motivation.

Moreover, these effects of teleworking can be amplified in case of vulnerable groups of workers, such as women. The first step in understanding the implications of teleworking on women is to have timely information on the extent of teleworking by age and gender. In the absence of timely official statistics, in this paper we propose a method for nowcasting the teleworking trends by age and gender for 20 Italian regions using mobile network operators (MNO) data. The method is developed and validated using MNO data together with the Italian quarterly Labour Force Survey. Our results confirm that the MNO data have the potential to be used as a tool for monitoring gender and age differences in teleworking patterns.

However, responsible use of AI in a clinical workflow requires healthcare workers review outputs from AI to judiciously agree or disagree with it. For a classification task, we can examine explanation of its prediction by the use of an explainer such as Grad-CAM. In this work, competent, well-known models, along with their ensemble counterparts, were studied to evaluate their prediction performance and explainability. There are three findings that are main contributions of this work: (1) models with higher prediction performance (e.g., better accuracy) could be outperformed in terms of explainability by models with lower prediction performance, (2) two models producing the same COVID-19 classification result might rely on considerably different features, and (3) while ensemble models created by our approach gained significant improvements in some metrics, they could also get performance degradation in others, and their explainability could be better or worse than their underlying single models. This implication suggests that although we tend to select the model that performs best in metrics that matter the most in a target application, in a clinical environment, it may be better if we employ multiple models so that we can assess explanations from them altogether and prevents incorrect decision from human errors.

All patients were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2-RNA with PCR, were in clinical remission prior to COVID-19 and only one patient continued his immunosuppressive treatment during the COVID-19 infection. Initial symptoms of COVID-19 were pyrexia, diarrhea, cephalea, and dysgeusia and anosmia. No patient needed admission to hospital or ICU. The SARS-CoV-2 antibody development was described to be late in three of the six patients.

However, the benefit of dexamethasone was largest in patients who received mechanical ventilation or supplemental oxygen therapy, while no benefit was found among patients without hypoxemia. In addition, a positive outcome was found in patients who received dexamethasone after several days of symptoms, while possible harm could exist if administered early. The right time interval for GC administration is still a matter of debate. Previous studies showed that an early GC use during the first phase of the disease, when viral replication peaks, may negatively affect the innate immune response through several mechanisms, such as the inhibition of pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokine production and signaling pathway, including type I interferon, that is fundamental to counteract the virus and that was found to be impaired in several patients with life-threatening COVID-19. The GC misuse can lead to a more severe disease even in patients who do not have the established risk factors, such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of digital nutrition interventions for children on dietary outcomes compared with status quo interventions (eg, conventional face-to-face programming or nondigital support). METHODS: We conducted an umbrella review of systematic reviews of studies assessing primary research on digital interventions aimed at improving food and nutrition outcomes for children aged <18 years compared with conventional nutrition education were eligible for inclusion. RESULTS: In total, 11 systematic reviews published since 2015 were included (7/11, 64%, were of moderate quality). Digital interventions ranged from internet, computer, or mobile interventions to websites, programs, apps, email, videos, CD-ROMs, games, telehealth, SMS text messages, and social media, or a combination thereof. The dose and duration of the interventions varied widely (single to multiple exposures; 1-60 minutes). Many studies have been informed by theory or used behavior change techniques (eg, feedback, goal-setting, and tailoring). The effect of digital nutrition interventions for children on dietary outcomes is small and inconsistent. Digital interventions seemed to be the most promising for improving fruit and vegetable intake compared with other nutrition outcomes; however, reviews have found mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the heterogeneity and duration of digital interventions, follow-up evaluations, comparison groups, and outcomes measured, the effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear. High-quality evidence with common definitions for digital intervention types evaluated with validated measures is needed to improve the state of evidence, to inform policy and program decisions for health promotion in children.

However, as case numbers decrease, air travel will gradually resume. We considered a future scenario in which case numbers are low and air travel returns to normal. Under that scenario, there will be a risk of outbreaks in locations worldwide due to imported cases. We estimated the risk of different locations acting as sources of future coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks elsewhere. METHODS: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates from locations worldwide to analyse the risk that 1364 airports are sources of future coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks. We use a probabilistic, branching-process-based approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the reproduction number at each location, accounting for local population density. RESULTS: Under the scenario we model, we identify airports in East Asia as having the highest risk of acting as sources of future outbreaks. Moreover, we investigate the locations most likely to cause outbreaks due to air travel in regions that are large and potentially vulnerable to outbreaks: India, Brazil and Africa. We find that outbreaks in India and Brazil are most likely to be seeded by individuals travelling from within those regions. We find that this is also true for less vulnerable regions, such as the United States, Europe and China. However, outbreaks in Africa due to imported cases are instead most likely to be initiated by passengers travelling from outside the continent.

The data was classified into positive or negative classes using the choice of machine learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), na?ve bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and voting. The results show the highest classification accuracy for the RF algorithm, as it achieved 100% accuracy with over-sampled data from Snapchat using both test options. The algorithms were compared among the three different datasets. All algorithms achieved a high level of accuracy. Hence, the results show that 80% of the sentiments were positive while 20% were negative.","output":"Sentiment analysis for cruises in Saudi Arabia on social media platforms using machine learning algorithms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on healthcare has led to rapid changes in otolaryngology service provisions. As such, new standard operating procedures for the management of suspected tonsillitis or quinsy were implemented in our centre. METHODS: A retrospective audit was performed of acute referrals to ENT of patients with suspected tonsillitis, peritonsillar cellulitis or quinsy, during the 10 weeks before (group 1) and 10 weeks after (group 2) implementation of the new standard operating procedures. RESULTS: Group 2 received fewer referrals. Fewer nasendoscopies were performed and corticosteroid use was reduced. The frequency of quinsy drainage performed under local anaesthetic increased, although the difference was not statistically significant. Hospital admission rates decreased from 56.1 to 20.4 per cent, and mean length of stay increased from 1.13 to 1.5 days. Face-to-face follow up decreased from 15.0 to 8.2 per cent, whilst virtual follow up increased from 4.7 to 16.3 per cent. There were no significant differences in re-presentation or re-admission rates. CONCLUSION: Management of suspected tonsillitis or quinsy using the new standard operating procedures appears to be safe and effective. This management should now be applied to an out-patient setting in otherwise systemically well patients.","output":"Improving the management of suspected tonsillitis and peritonsillar abscess referred to ENT - a coronavirus disease 2019 service improvement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nowadays, information and communication technology grows rapidly. The microelectronics and communication mediums also enhance their reachability of coverage and connectivity. 5G enhances the capacity of the network in terms of lowest communication latency, highest speed, enhanced throughput, minimum E2E delay, and minimizing the packet loss. In this paper, we discuss the working principle and key features of 5G communication technology along with the limitations of existing technologies. Further, we provide the taxonomy of the 5G network. Moreover, we provide a comparison of 5G and 4G LTE in terms of data privacy and security aspects. Further, we propose a four-layer architecture for ehealthcare system, which uses 5G NR (New Radio) architecture incorporating the control plane and user plane. We perform the simulation over the frequency range1 and frequency range2 and calculated the throughput and latency for distinct values of OFDM numerologies. Further, we provide a comparative analysis for 4G and 5G and deduce that 5G facilitates 10 times lower latency than 4G, and 5G can accommodate a much higher number of devices than 4G.

Here we describe how the pilot study of the Australian Epilepsy Project (AEP) has transitioned to tele-neuropsychology (teleNP), enabling continued safe operations during the pandemic. METHODS: The AEP includes adults (age 18-60) with a first unprovoked seizure, new diagnosis of epilepsy or drug resistant focal epilepsy. Shortly after launching the study, COVID-related restrictions necessitated adaptation to teleNP, including delivery of verbal tasks via videoconference; visual stimulus delivery via document camera; use of web-hosted, computerised assessment; substitution of oral versions for written tests; online delivery of questionnaires; and discontinuation of telehealth incompatible tasks. RESULTS: To date, we have completed 24 teleNP assessments: 18 remotely (participant in own home) and six on-site (participant using equipment at research facility). Five face-to-face assessments were conducted prior to the transition to teleNP. Eight of 408 tests administered via teleNP (1.9%) have been invalidated, for a variety of reasons (technical, procedural, environmental). Data confirm typical patterns of epilepsy-related deficits (p < .05) affecting processing speed, executive function, language and memory. Questionnaire responses indicate elevated rates of patients at high risk of mood (34%) and anxiety disorder (38%). CONCLUSION: Research teleNP assessments reveal a typical pattern of impairments in epilepsy. A range of issues must be considered when introducing teleNP, such as technical and administrative set up, test selection and delivery, and cohort suitability. TeleNP enables large-scale neuropsychological research during periods of social distancing (and beyond), and offers an opportunity to expand the reach and breadth of neuropsychological services.","output":"Teleneuropsychology in the time of COVID-19: the experience of the Australian Epilepsy Project"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the mental health of the general population, and for healthcare workers (HCWs) it has been no different.

Many surveys were cancelled, including those for walleye pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), the largest fishery in the United States. To partially mitigate the loss of survey information, we deployed three uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) equipped with echosounders to extend the ship-based acoustic-trawl time series of pollock abundance. Trawling was not possible from USVs, so an empirical relationship between pollock backscatter and biomass established from previous surveys was developed to convert USV backscatter observations into pollock abundance. The EBS is well suited for this approach since pollock dominate midwater fishes in the survey area. Acoustic data from the USVs were combined with historical surveys to provide a consistent fishery-independent index in 2020. This application demonstrates the unique capabilities of USVs and how they could be rapidly deployed to collect information on pollock abundance and distribution when a ship-based survey was not feasible.

Other factors such as diabetes, hypertension, and other patient comorbidities might also play a role. Decreased flow promotes hypercoagulability. Lower pressure in the left atrium (and higher velocities in the left ventricle) can partially contribute to the higher incidence of mitral MVT versus aortic MVT.

Neuroimaging studies of cigarette smokers also suggest that chronic inhalation of tobacco smoke leads to brain atrophy, although the neurotoxic component is unknown. As a high proportion of chronic alcoholics also smoke cigarettes it has been hypothesized that at least some alcohol-related brain damage is due to tobacco smoke exposure. METHODS: 39 Long Evans rats were subjected to 8 weeks exposure to alcohol and/or 5 weeks co-exposure to nicotine-specific nitrosamine ketone (NNK), a proxy for tobacco smoke. Their frontal WM was then assayed with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: NNK and ethanol co-exposure had a synergistic effect in decreasing myelinated fibre density. Furthermore, NNK treatment led to a greater reduction in myelin sheath thickness than ethanol whereas only the ethanol-treated animals showed a decrease in unmyelinated fibre density.

Results Of the total number of HD patients (1514), 248 HD patients were suspected to have COVID-19 (106 were positive, 83 were negative and 59 suspected using PCR testing); the median age was 51 years (IR 36-63 years), 54.8% were males, had hypertension (87.5%), with a hemoglobin count of 8.9 g (IR 7.5-10.6 g) and symptoms such as cough, fever and dyspnea (65.7, 64.5 and 53.2%, respectively). The fatality rate in the group of patients with positive RT-qPCR was 29.24%. Conclusions The mortality and fatality rate is often high in this population. The age group, sex, and cardio-metabolic comorbidities behave similarly to the rest of the non-renal population. Pre-existing biochemical status does not make a difference in the outcome.

Liver injury has been reported as a non-pulmonary manifestation of COVID-19 but characterization of liver test abnormalities and their association with clinical outcomes is incomplete. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 1827 patients with confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized within the Yale-New Haven Health System (YNHHS) between March 14, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Clinical characteristics, liver tests (AST, ALT, ALP, TBIL, albumin) at three time points (pre-infection baseline, admission, peak hospitalization), and hospitalization outcomes (severe COVID-19, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, death) were analyzed. Abnormal liver tests were commonly observed in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, both at admission (AST 66.9%, ALT 41.6%, ALP 13.5%, TBIL 4.3%) and peak hospitalization (AST 83.4%, ALT 61.6%, ALP 22.7%, TBIL 16.1%). Most patients with abnormal liver tests at admission had minimal elevations 1-2x ULN (AST 63.7%, ALT 63.5%, ALP 80.0%, TBIL 75.7%). A significant proportion of these patients had abnormal liver tests pre-hospitalization (AST 25.9%, ALT 38.0%, ALP 56.8%, TBIL 44.4%). Multivariate analysis revealed an association between abnormal liver tests and severe COVID-19, including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death; associations with age, male gender, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were also observed. Medications used in COVID-19 treatment (lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, and tocilizumab) were associated with peak hospitalization liver transaminase elevations >5x ULN. Conclusion: Abnormal liver tests occur in most hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes.","output":"Abnormal Liver Tests in COVID-19: A Retrospective Observational Cohort Study of 1827 Patients in a Major U.S. Hospital Network."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Intercity transportation systems have experienced severe disruptions since the outbreak of COVID-19. However, it remains unclear how the operations of different systems were affected and whether the pandemic has influenced modal interaction. This paper provides an empirical assessment to address these questions using high-speed rail (HSR) and aviation in China as an example. The impact of COVID-19 on aviation and HSR operations was examined both temporally and spatially using a high-dimensional fixed-effect panel model. Using the big data with daily operational frequency for the period of JanuaryCJune 2020, the study shows that the lockdown of Wuhan had varying effects on the operations of HSR and aviation. In addition, the correlation of operational services between HSR and aviation was found to vary both spatially and temporally during the pandemic. These research findings provide important implications for improving the adaptability of transportation systems and operational resilience.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on High-Speed Rail and Aviation Operations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is a multifunctional transmembrane protein recently recognised as the entry receptor of the virus causing COVID-19. In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II (Ang II) into angiotensin 1-7 (Ang 1-7), which is considered to exert cellular responses to counteract the activation of the RAS primarily through a receptor, Mas, in multiple organs including skeletal muscle. Previous studies have provided abundant evidence suggesting that Ang 1-7 modulates multiple signalling pathways leading to protection from pathological muscle remodelling and muscle insulin resistance. In contrast, there is relatively little evidence to support the protective role of ACE2 in skeletal muscle. The potential contribution of endogenous ACE2 to the regulation of Ang 1-7-mediated protection of these muscle pathologies is discussed in this review. Recent studies have suggested that ACE2 protects against ageing-associated muscle wasting (sarcopenia) through its function to modulate molecules outside of the RAS. Thus, the potential association of sarcopenia with ACE2 and the associated molecules outside of RAS is also presented herein. Further, we introduce the transcriptional regulation of muscle ACE2 by drugs or exercise, and briefly discuss the potential role of ACE2 in the development of COVID-19.","output":"ACE2, angiotensin 1-7 and skeletal muscle: review in the era of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"It has become a trope to speak of the increasing value of health data in our societies.

Recently, some HFP activities have grown (e.g. gardening), while other activities (e.g. hunting) have become less common in the United States. Anecdotally, COVID-19 has sparked an increase in HFP evidenced by increased hunting licenses and shortages in seeds and canning supplies. HFP may have positive benefits for food security and diet quality, though research beyond gardening is especially limited in high-income countries. Methods: We examine HFP activities before and since the COVID-19 pandemic, and their relationship to food security and dietary quality using multivariable logit models and matching analysis with a statewide representative survey (n=600) of residents of Vermont, United States. Results: We find 29% of respondent households classified as food insecure since COVID-19, and more prevalence among those experiencing a negative job change since COVID-19, households earning less than $50,000 annually, Hispanic and multi-race respondents. Forty-two percent of respondents engaged in HFP activities; the majority of those gardened, and more than half pursued HFP activities more intensely than before the pandemic. HFP was more common among food insecure households, who were more likely to fish, forage, hunt and have backyard livestock. Respondents who were food insecure, Black, Indigenous, People of Color and/or Hispanic, those with a negative job disruption, and larger households all had greater odds of increased intensity of HFP since COVID-19. HFP were significantly associated with eating greater amounts of fruits and vegetables, especially if gardening and canning, while respondents hunting or having backyard livestock were significantly more likely to have higher red meat intake. Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that HFP activities have increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be an important safety net for food insecure households, and provide diet quality impacts. Long-term, HFP activities may have important food security and diet quality impacts, as well as conservation implications, which should be more thoroughly explored. Regardless, the increased interest and intensity of HFP demonstrates multiple opportunities for educational and outreach efforts.","output":"Home Food Procurement Impacts Food Security and Diet Quality during COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In time of crisis, the role of public institutions is on the rise and the communication between citizens and institutions is increasingly important, in order to preserve society's civic fabric and ensure the maintenance of trust in the aftermath of the crisis.

Methods: We conducted a population-based study investigating the outcomes of COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD in Denmark. The Danish COVID-19 IBD Database is an extensive population-based database which prospectively monitors the disease course of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 among patients with UC and CD. Severe COVID-19 was defined as COVID-19 necessitating intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, or death, while adverse COVID-19 was defined as requirement of COVID-19 related hospitalization. Clinical disease activity was measured by simple clinical colitis index and Harvey-Bradshaw Index in UC and CD, respectively. The biochemical activity was defined as C-reactive protein higher than 5 mg/L or fecal calprotectin higher than 250 g/g. The endoscopic activity was defined as Mayo Endoscopic Subscore of at least 2 in UC, or Simple Endoscopic Score Crohn's Disease of at least 3 for CD. Sequelae following COVID-19 were defined as symptoms that (i) developed during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19, (ii) and were present for more than 12 weeks, (iii) and were not attributable to alternative diagnoses. Results: During the inclusion period between January 28th, 2020, to April 1st, 2021, the study included 319 patients with UC and 197 patients with CD who developed laboratory confirmed COVID-19.

Discussion: A 49-year-old female without any prior history of thyroid dysfunction presented with clinical and biochemical hyperthyroidism after a diagnosis of COVID-19 illness four months ago. At the time of thyroiditis diagnosis: free T4 was 1.52 ng/dL (normal, 0.76-1.46 ng/dL), TSH &amp;lt;0.005 uIU/mL (normal, 0.358-3.74 uIU/mL), Thyroglobulin antibodies 2 IU/mL (normal, &amp;lt;=1 IU/mL), TPO antibody 1 IU/mL (normal, &amp;lt;9 IU/mL), ESR 5 mm/hr (normal, 0-20 mm/hr). Thyroid US showed no nodules or evidence of autoimmune thyroid disease or abnormal vascular flow. A radioactive iodine uptake test was performed through the primary care office. The test demonstrated symmetric, uniform radiotracer uptake in the right and left lobe. 24-hour uptake was low at 0.1% (normal 15-25%) indicating thyroiditis. Patient features consistent with the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis include suppressed TSH, diffuse tenderness on thyroid palpation, absent TPO/TG antibodies, and suppressed I-123 RAI uptake (&amp;lt;1%) on 24-hour scan. Conclusion: There is limited data surrounding thyroid disease and COVID-19. It has been suggested that a possible sequela of COVID-19 is thyroiditis.

Arranging transportation could spike the number of COVID-19 infected cases. Hence, this paper investigates the potential surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection and assesses the train and bus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The expected to repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011 census data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants (i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence, travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, about 50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day to Maharashtra and less than 20,000 per day to other states of India was recommended.","output":"Implication of repatriating migrant workers on COVID-19 spread and transportation requirements"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents the results of a detailed analysis using e-learning log data of an introductory computer science course located in the second semester of a respective program during a corona induced distance learning phase.

WWXDY (Wuweixiaoduyin) is a traditional Chinese medicine, and it is usually used to treat infections in China. This study aimed to explore the active compounds, therapeutic targets, key pathways, and potential mechanisms of WWXDY in the treatment of S. aureus infection. Materials: & Methods: Data related to active compounds and therapeutic targets of WWXDY for treating S. aureus were collected from DisGeNET, GeneCards, and DrugBank databases. To explore the roles of the active targets in gene function and signaling pathways, KEGG (Kyoto Gene and Genomics Encyclopedia) pathway enrichment and GO (Gene Ontology) analyses of the 122 target genes in the PPI (protein-protein interaction) network were performed. We further performed NP (network pharmacology) by using a network analyzer to screen 30 key targets. Results: : A total 92 active compounds of WWXDY were screened. The 122 overlapped genes were found from 785 therapeutic targets and 684 S. aureus-related genes. Besides, 92 active compounds of WWXDY, such as mandenol, ethyllinolenate, eriodyctiol, secologanic dibutylacetal_qt, etc., were identified. The PPI network of the effective ingredients of WWXDY in treating S. aureus infection identified the top 30 genes, including IL-6 (interleukin-6), TNF- (tumor necrosis factor-), VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A), AKT1, CXCL8, MAPK3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase 3), TLR (toll-like receptor 4), IL-1, EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), and MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9). Conclusion: The GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses indicated that 122 overlapped genes were mainly enriched in COVID-19, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, Pertussis, and Chagas disease.

We are iteratively developing Active-Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older adults with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step count aided by a Fitbit. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and signals of improvement in emotional, physical, and cognitive function when delivered in-person to this population. OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) of AB-F versus a time- and dose-matched educational control (Health Enhancement Program; HEP) in older adults with CP and CD. Due to COVID-19 and qualitative feedback from former participants, both programs are delivered in an entirely virtual format via live video (Zoom). Here, we describe our virtual study protocol, manualized treatments, evaluation plan, and study design. We will evaluate feasibility benchmarks and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and cognitive function. METHODS: This is a single-blind pilot RCT. Participants are randomized to one of two programs: AB-F or HEP. Patients are recruited through pain clinic referrals, institutional registries, and IRB-approved flyers. Interested participants are screened for eligibility via telephone and provide electronic informed consent. After randomization, participants are mailed all study documents, including their treatment manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate sealed envelope for AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via secure live video. Participants complete self-report and performance-based (6-minute walk test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) outcome measures via live video at baseline and post-intervention. Primary outcomes are a-priori set feasibility (recruitment, quantitative measures, adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and satisfaction benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional function, as well as intervention targets (social function, pain intensity, pain-specific coping, mindfulness). RESULTS: The trial is ongoing. We have recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F, 11 HEP) across two rounds. Only two participants have withdrawn (1 before baseline, 1 before first session). All 19 remaining participants have completed the baseline. In the first round, attendance is high (11/12 completed all 4 sessions so far) and AB-F participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step goals (5/6). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our completely virtual AB-F intervention but need to be confirmed at the trial conclusion. This study will answer important questions about the feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body and activity program to older adults with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Details on integrating multiple digital platforms for the virtual assessments and intervention delivery will inform treatment development for older adults generally and those with CP-CD specifically, during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.

Evidence for long-term health effects is scarce and rare for health care service research. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise-based phase III cardiac rehabilitation programs in improving mortality and working capacity outcomes. METHODS: The present analyses used claims data of the German pension fund from 2010 to 2017. Overall, 54,163 patients with coronary heart disease (ICD10 I20.CI25.) were included and followed up for exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation participation (mean 4.3  1.9 years). All patients were categorized according to participation duration (long:  90 days, short: < 90 days, no). The effectiveness of exercise-based rehabilitation was analyzed by calculating adjusted hazard ratios for mortality and reduced working capacity in relation to program participation. RESULTS: Of all the cardiac patients, 57.6% received medical recommendations for exercise-based phase III rehabilitation, and 16.8% participated in this rehabilitation. In total, 1776 (3.3%) patients died during the study period, and 3050 (5.5%) received reduced earning capacity pensions. Mortality risk was nearly doubled for those who did not participate in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation compared to those who participated for a long duration (HR 1.97, 95% CI 1.60C2.43) and 44% higher compared to a short participation (HR 1.44, 95% CI 1.03C2.01). Furthermore, the risk of reduced working capacity was higher for those who did not participate compared to those who participated for a short duration (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00C1.54). CONCLUSION: Exercise-based phase III cardiac rehabilitation is independently associated with reduced mortality and reduced loss in working capacity.

Yet, significant waning of specific immunity within six months after 2nd vaccination, along with higher incidence of breakthrough infections associated with the time elapsed since 2nd vaccination raises concerns regarding the durability of immunity also after 3rd vaccination. We address the currently debated consequence of a third vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 for generating durable immunity especially in older adults. Specifically, we assessed virus-specific serum antibody and single cell blood T cell responses after vaccination with the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2 in more than 50 individuals older than 80 years. All old adults demonstrate a strong humoral response to 3rd vaccination which is higher and wanes slower than the response to 2nd vaccination, indicative of enhanced humoral immunity. In contrast, their respective T cell response reaches only the level obtained after 2nd vaccination, with similar waning over time and no enhancement of IFN{gamma} production per cell. Because BNT162b2-mediated protection from the Omicron variant relies more on T cells than antibodies, our findings raise concern on the durability of protection from the Omicron variant by BNT162b2 in a population at risk.","output":"Differential durability of humoral and T cell immunity after two and three BNT162b2 vaccinations in adults aged >80 years"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In previously introduced rat model of Wolfram syndrome, we have shown that in cardiac myocytes lacking functional wolframin protein the calcium transients and contractile response are significantly changed.

Patients and Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested among men in the National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden diagnosed with non-metastatic PCa 1998-2015. We included 369 men who died from PCa (cases) and 369 men who did not (controls).

Pre-2005 GS was back-transformed using i) information on cribriform pattern and/or poorly formed glands and ii) the diagnostic GS from the registry. Models were developed using Firth logistic regression and compared in terms of discrimination (AUC). Results: The ISUP 2014 GS (AUC = 0.808) performed better than the pre-2005 GS when back-transformed using only cribriform pattern (AUC = 0.785) or both cribriform and poorly formed glands (AUC = 0.792), but not when back-transformed using only poorly formed glands (AUC = 0.800).

However, church-based religious communication has rarely been explored in this perspective. This in mind, the paper explores the YouTube channel Jana believes, a pioneering and also controversial project sponsored by the Evangelical Church in Germany. The argumentation proceeds in five steps. First, Hubert Knoblauchs concept of popular religion is interlinked with the practical-theological perspective of communicating the Gospel as well as with more recent approaches to the mediatization of religion. Then characteristic elements and video genres of YouTube communication as part of popular culture are explicated. Against this background, the distinct profile of the YouTube channel Jana believes is outlined, with specific regard to the vlog genre. Subsequently, the interplay between popular religion, communicating the Gospel and mediatization of religion is explored in a more in depth-analysis of two exemplary video sequences.

RECENT FINDINGS Limited clinical studies suggest that an exposure-response relationship for posaconazole exists for the treatment of established invasive fungal diseases (IFDs), with emerging but less compelling data supporting its role in prophylaxis. The high prevalence of subtherapeutic levels has not translated to high prophylactic failure rates perhaps because of preferential uptake by effector cells important in the front-line defence against Aspergillus species. Nevertheless, TDM would appear prudent in patients deemed at highest risk for IFD with correction of patient modifiable factors and attention to drug administration important in optimizing drug exposure. TDM performed within a few days after commencing posaconazole may be predictive of steady-state levels, thus minimizing the delay in obtaining results in addition to identifying a subset of patients who may remain persistently subtherapeutic and also resistant to dose-escalation. Trough levels may be supplanted by untimed levels at steady state, thereby expanding the practicalities of TDM. We propose that TDM becomes one of the several measures in an integrated approach to IFD prevention combining screening of high-risk haematology patients for invasive aspergillosis at presentation, together with prospective surveillance for IFD, explicit criteria for switching to an alternative prophylactic agent and adherence to infection control practices. SUMMARY Growing evidence supports the value of TDM for posaconazole to identify patients who may benefit from correction of modifiable factors impacting bioavailability, dosage adjustment or switch to an alternative agent.","output":"Making sense of posaconazole therapeutic drug monitoring: a practical approach."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires rapid medical responses The risk of venous and arterial thromboembolism increases in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection There is a hypercoagulable state that includes elevated levels of D-dimer, with an increased risk of organ failure and increased mortality The abnormalities described in hemostasis should be considered for therapeutic decision making We analyzed the available scientific evidence for the therapeutic approach of coagulopathy in the course of the disease with the objective of designing realistic therapeutic recommendations aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with COVID-19","output":"Coagulopathy and COVID-19. recommendations for a changing reality"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has tested the level of preparedness and readiness of governments globally.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Design a program to address the emotional and psychiatric needs of COVID-19 first response Healthcare personnel in Mexico. MATERIALS: in march 2020, the Mexican Psychiatric Association was invited to be part of the Workgroup for the fortification of Mental Health during Disasters of the Ministry of Health in Mexico. The charge was to develop a program to address the needs and prevent burn out in physicians and the rest of healthcare personal. The details of how this program was planned, implemented, and launched will be presented. RESULTS: The program was launched in two phases. Phase A through a chat with text messaging capability was launched on 25 April, 2020. B through telepsychiatric video calls, was launched on 15 June, 2020. Phase A had a very limited demand. Phase B also had a very limited demand until the month 5 September, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: from the time of program launch through the first four months, the demand was very low, what may be explained due to normalization of stress and/or stigma among healthcare professionals.

Establishing a relationship among these three predictors is therefore important for comprehensive assessment of the circulatory system, but very few studies focused on this. In this study, we first derived a mathematical description for localized luminal pressure change (p) as a function of arterial wall strain () and transverse shear modulus (_T); the arterial wall was modelled as a transversely isotropic and piecewise linearly-elastic material. Finite element simulations (FES) and in vitro fluid-driven inflation experiments were performed on arteries with both normal and abnormal geometries and _T in the experimental study were estimated by an ultrasound elastographic imaging framework (UEIF). FES results showed good accuracy (percent errors 6.42%) of the proposed method for all simulated artery models. Experimental results showed excellent repeatability and reproducibility. Estimated (p) _pp values (average peak-to-peak pressure change) compared with pressure meter measurements in two normal geometry phantoms and an excised aorta were 65.95 4.29 mmHg vs. 66.45 3.80 mmHg, 60.49 1.82 mmHg vs. 59.92 2.69, and 36.03 1.90 mmHg vs. 38.8 3.21 mmHg, respectively. For the artery with abnormal geometry mimicking a simple plaque shape, the feasibility of the proposed method for p estimation was also validated.

This paper presents a new metaheuristic-based fusion model for COVID-19 diagnosis using chest X-ray images. The proposed model comprises different preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification processes. Initially, the Weiner filtering (WF) technique is used for the preprocessing of images. Then, the fusion-based feature extraction process takes place by the incorporation of gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray level run length matrix (GLRM), and local binary patterns (LBP). Afterward, the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) selected the optimal feature subset. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied as a classification process to classify infected and healthy patients. The proposed model's performance has been assessed using the Chest X-ray image dataset, and the results are examined under diverse aspects.

We examined the host response of UNC93B1 mutant mice, which do not signal properly through TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, to acute MCMV infection to determine whether liver antiviral defense depends on signaling through these molecules. Infection of UNC93B1 mutant mice revealed reduced production of systemic and liver proinflammatory cytokines including IFN-, IFN-, IL-12 and TNF- when compared to wild-type. UNC93B1 deficiency also contributed to a transient hepatitis later in acute infection, evidenced by augmented liver pathology and elevated systemic alanine aminotransferase levels. Moreover, viral clearance was impaired in UNC93B1 mutant mice, despite intact virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the liver.

Given their higher median age, patients are at an increased risk for severe symptoms and complications in cases of infection, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. Therefore, a review of the routine colorectal cancer practices is needed to minimize risk of exposure.

It causes a biphasic febrile illness that can be accompanied by central nervous system involvement and moderate morbidity in humans and severe mortality in equines. The virus has a history of weaponization, lacks FDA-approved therapeutics and vaccines in humans, and is considered a select agent. Like other RNA viruses, VEEV replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells and eventually induces apoptosis. The capsid protein, which contains a nuclear localization and a nuclear export sequence, induces a shutdown of host transcription and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Here we show that infection with VEEV causes a dysregulation of cell cycling and a delay in the G(0)/G(1) phase in Vero cells and U87MG astrocytes. Cells infected with VEEV encoding a capsid NLS mutant or treated with the capsid-importin  interaction inhibitor G281-1485 were partially rescued from this cell cycle dysregulation. Pathway analysis of previously published RNA-sequencing data from VEEV infected U87MG astrocytes identified alterations of canonical pathways involving cell cycle, checkpoint regulation, and proliferation. Multiple cyclins including cyclin D1, cyclin A2 and cyclin E2 and other regulators of the cell cycle were downregulated in infected cells in a capsid NLS dependent manner. Loss of Rb phosphorylation, which is a substrate for cyclin/cdk complexes was also observed.

Murine models are adequate, though limited when exploring different doses and lengths of exposureas this increases the number of animals required, contrary to the Three R's principle in animal experimentation. This article proposes an in vitro model using primary, non-transformed normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells as an alternative to the most widely used model to date, the human lung tumor cell line A549. The model has been tested with three graphene derivativesgraphene oxide (GO), few-layer graphene (FLG), and small FLG (sFLG). We observed a cytotoxic effect (necrosis and apoptosis) at early (6- and 24-h) exposures, which intensified after seven days of contact between cells and the graphene-related materials (GRMs)with cell death reaching 90% after a 5 g/mL dose. A549 cells are more resistant to necrosis and apoptosis, yielding values less than half of NHBE cells at low concentrations of GRMs (between 0.05 and 5 g/mL). Indeed, GRM-induced cell death in NHBE cells is comparable to that induced by toxic compounds such as diesel exhaust particles on the same cell line. We propose NHBE as a suitable model to test GRM-induced toxicity, allowing refinement of the dose concentrations and exposure timings for better-designed in vivo mouse assays.","output":"Rapid and efficient testing of the toxicity of graphene-related materials in primary human lung cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries mandated staying at home to reduce transmission.

House occupancy was defined as: living alone; living with one other person; living with multiple other people; or living in a nursing/residential home. Outcomes were time from admission to mortality and discharge (Cox regression), and Day-28 mortality (logistic regression), analyses were adjusted for key comorbidities and covariates including admission: age; sex, smoking; heart failure; admission CRP; COPD; eGFR, frailty and others. RESULTS: 1584 patients were included from 13 hospitals across UK and Italy: 676 (42.7%) were female, 907 (57.3%) were male, median age was 74 years (range: 19-101). At 28 days, 502 (31.7%) had died.

Methods A total of 35 participants, including 14 patients taking methotrexate and 21 patients with normal immune function, entered this study, and the indicators of COVID-19 severity were compared between these two groups. Results The case group, who were on methotrexate therapy, had significantly less severe COVID-19 based on their symptoms, including fever (p = 0.000) and cough and dyspnea (p = 0.01) as well as in terms of COVID-19 severity indicators such as pulmonary involvement (p = 0.001), ferritin level (p = 0.001), white blood cell count (p = 0.008) and CRP level (p = 0.006), compared to the control group.

The patients suffering from this ailment present with unilateral or bilateral chronic groin pain associated with physical activity without a clear diagnosis of a groin hernia. Though physical therapy and medical treatments are considered first line remedies, some believe that surgical treatment may have better, quicker, and more durable outcomes and procedures aimed at groin reinforcement seem to relieve most of symptoms in the majority of the patients. Despite many surgeons consistently noting rectus insertion or adductor thinning, multiple hernia defects are often seen during dissections and the clinical significance of these findings is still not known. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2007 and 2011, 40 patients underwent an extra-peritoneal laparoscopic reinforcement of rectus abdominals and insertion of adductor muscles for AP. All patients underwent wide and bilateral groin dissection and the findings were cataloged. RESULTS All of the patients presented with groin defects upon wide dissection. Thirty-four patients (85%) presented with small bilateral indirect inguinal defects and 28 (70%) of these patients did not have any additional defects. Five patients (12.5%) were found to have only unilateral inguinal hernia defects. One patient presented with a small direct defect. In addition to these defects, five patients (12.5%) had additional unilateral femoral hernias, whereas no patient had solitary femoral hernia defects.

It is an acute infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Virus (SARS-CoV-2). The severe disease is characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Currently, no drugs or vaccine exist against the disease and the only course of treatment is symptom management involving mechanical ventilation, immune suppressants, and repurposed drugs. As such the severe form of the disease has a relatively high mortality rate. Last 6 months have seen an explosion of information related to the host receptors, virus transmission, virus structure-function relationships, pathophysiology, co-morbidities, immune response, treatment and most promising vaccines. This review takes a critically comprehensive look at various aspects of host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19. We examine genomic aspects of SARS-CoV-2, modulation of innate and adaptive immunity, complement-triggered microangiopathy, and host transmission modalities. We also examine its pathophysiological impact during pregnancy, in addition to various gaps in our knowledge. The lessons learnt from various clinical trials involving repurposed drugs have been summarised. We also highlight the rationale and likely success of the most promising vaccine candidates.","output":"Host-pathogen interaction in COVID-19: Pathogenesis, potential therapeutics and vaccination strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: A direct comparison of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients with a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 negative control group undergoing an operative intervention during the current pandemic is lacking, and a reliable estimate of the assumed difference in morbidity and mortality between both patient categories remains unknown. METHODS: We included all consecutive patients with a confirmed pre- or postoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive status (operated in 27 hospitals) and negative control patients (operated in 4 hospitals) undergoing emergency or elective operations. A propensity score-matched comparison of clinical outcomes was performed between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and negative tested patients (control group). Primary outcome was overall 30-day mortality rate between both groups. Main secondary outcomes were overall, pulmonary, and thromboembolic complications. RESULTS: In total, 161 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive and 342 control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 negative patients were included in this study. The 30-day overall postoperative mortality rate was greater in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive cohort compared with the negative control group (16% vs 4% respectively; P = .007). After propensity score matching, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive group consisted of 123 patients (median 70 years of age [interquartile range 59-77] and 55% male) were compared with 196 patients in the matched control group (median 69 years (interquartile range 58-75] and 53% male). The 30-day mortality rate and risk were greater in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive group compared with the matched control group (12% vs 4%; P = .009 and odds ratio 3.4 [95% confidence interval 1.5-8.5]; P = .005, respectively). Overall, pulmonary and thromboembolic complications occurred more often in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 positive patients (P < .01). CONCLUSION: Patients diagnosed with perioperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have an increased risk of 30-day mortality, pulmonary complications, and thromboembolic events.

We assessed two new DNA vaccines expressing premembrane and envelope Zika virus structural proteins. METHODS: We did two phase 1, randomised, open-label trials involving healthy adult volunteers. The VRC 319 trial, done in three centres, assessed plasmid VRC5288 (Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus chimera), and the VRC 320, done in one centre, assessed plasmid VRC5283 (wild-type Zika virus). Eligible participants were aged 18C35 years in VRC19 and 18C50 years in VRC 320. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 by a computer-generated randomisation schedule prepared by the study statistician. All participants received intramuscular injection of 4 mg vaccine. In VRC 319 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations via needle and syringe at 0 and 8 weeks, 0 and 12 weeks, 0, 4, and 8 weeks, or 0, 4, and 20 weeks. In VRC 320 participants were assigned to receive vaccinations at 0, 4, and 8 weeks via single-dose needle and syringe injection in one deltoid or split-dose needle and syringe or needle-free injection with the Stratis device (Pharmajet, Golden, CO, USA) in each deltoid. Both trials followed up volunteers for 24 months for the primary endpoint of safety, assessed as local and systemic reactogenicity in the 7 days after each vaccination and all adverse events in the 28 days after each vaccination. The secondary endpoint in both trials was immunogenicity 4 weeks after last vaccination. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02840487 and NCT02996461. FINDINGS: VRC 319 enrolled 80 participants (20 in each group), and VRC 320 enrolled 45 participants (15 in each group). One participant in VRC 319 and two in VRC 320 withdrew after one dose of vaccine, but were included in the safety analyses. Both vaccines were safe and well tolerated. All local and systemic symptoms were mild to moderate. In both studies, pain and tenderness at the injection site was the most frequent local symptoms (37 [46%] of 80 participants in VRC 319 and 36 [80%] of 45 in VRC 320) and malaise and headache were the most frequent systemic symptoms (22 [27%] and 18 [22%], respectively, in VRC 319 and 17 [38%] and 15 [33%], respectively, in VRC 320). For VRC5283, 14 of 14 (100%) participants who received split-dose vaccinations by needle-free injection had detectable positive antibody responses, and the geometric mean titre of 304 was the highest across all groups in both trials.

Eligible studies were observational and experimental which had at least one tangible item provided for free and had at least one quantitative measure of health. Studies were excluded if the intervention was primarily a service and the free good was relatively unimportant; if the good was a medication; or if the data in a study was duplicated in another study.

As a result, new forms of contestation are emerging that reveal social inequalities at the heart of community-led responses to climate change. This paper uses four tenets of energy justice C distributional, procedural, restorative and recognition justice C to critically analyse and understand the politics and geography of local renewable energy deployment in Bristol, England. Focusing on the development of two solar PV farms in and around Lawrence Weston, an area of high deprivation in North West Bristol, the paper demonstrates the critical nature of instances of both energy justice and injustice in a time of austerity. Using primary data obtained via a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach in Bristol during 2015C2017, the paper draws on participant observation data and in-depth interviews (n = 10) with a variety of local energy actors and community members active in Lawrence Weston. The primary data details the extent to which spatial configurations of new low-carbon energy infrastructures are integral to their justice implications. Indeed, it is the proximity of projects both close to and within the Lawrence Weston community that shapes the participants thoughts and deliberations on how to achieve local energy justice, through appeal to the four tenets outlined. The findings emphasise the distributional justice impacts of creating new low-carbon energy infrastructures in deprived communities in a time of austerity, whilst also noting that opening up local energy transitions to greater input from local communities offers opportunities to achieve procedural justice. Shifting relationships between local energy actors and Lawrence Weston highlight opportunities for the remediation of past claims of injustice, facilitating processes of restorative justice, whilst local energy schemes that seek to advance greater active participant (skills training & employment) opportunities for deprived communities in which they, or their projects, are embedded, may be underpinned by recognition justice concerns. This active participant approach is shown to be key to advancing beyond passive recipient approaches to community energy transitions and enhancing spatial equity. Finally, the paper offers novel empirical insights into the contested role of geography, space and place in local transitions and contributes to bottom-up perspectives on issues of spatial (in)justice in community energy schemes.","output":"Proximities of energy justice: contesting community energy and austerity in England"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Lopinavir/ritonavir has been used for the treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections. It has been suggested that, based on this experience, this drug should also be studied in SARS-CoV2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a systematic review of the literature regarding the use of lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of these three infections. We systematically searched the PubMed database from inception to April 30th, 2020, to identify in-vitro and animal studies and any reports of human use of lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of SARS, MERS and COVID-19. We also searched the Clinicatrial.gov to identify ongoing trials. RESULTS Five in-vitro studies evaluated the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir in SARS. Three additional in-vitro studies reported the EC50 of the antiviral activity of lopinavir/ritonavir in MERS. We identified no in vitro studies evaluating the effect of lopinavir/ritonavir on the novel coronavirus. Two retrospective matched-cohort studies reported the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with ribavirin for SARS patients. Three case reports and one retrospective study described the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in MERS. Twenty-two papers describe the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in adult patients with COVID-19.

On March 13, 2003, on receiving notification of an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, nurses from the study emergency department (ED) started screening patients for the disease that became known as SARS. METHODS The ED nurses started with a simple screening tool that was incorporated into triage. The screening tool was later revised into a questionnaire. An outdoor screening station was set up and patients were subsequently screened before triage. After the patients were screened, they were assigned to different risk areas, where triage and treatment were rendered. Two further revisions were made to the questionnaire. RESULTS From March 13 to May 31, 11457 patients were screened. Version One of the screening questionnaire was used to screen 72 patients from March 13 to 17, Version Two screened 93 patients from March 18 to 21, Version Three screened 2909 patients from March 22 to April 8, and Version Four screened 8383 patients from April 9 to May 31. There was a significant (p < 0.05) downward trend in the proportion of admissions. Among those discharged from the ED, 0.28% reattended and were later confirmed to have SARS. CONCLUSIONS The screening tool underwent three major revisions in response to new information. By keeping it relatively simple, user-friendly, and regularly updated, nurses were able to screen patients rapidly.

Faecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA from COVID-19 patients has extensively been reported. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in six wastewater treatments plants (WWTPs) serving the major municipalities within the Region of Murcia (Spain), the area with the lowest COVID-19 prevalence within Iberian Peninsula. Firstly, an aluminum hydroxide adsorption-precipitation concentration method was validated using a porcine coronavirus (Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, PEDV) and mengovirus (MgV). The procedure resulted in average recoveries of 10  3.5% and 10  2.1% in influent water (n = 2) and 3.3  1.6% and 6.2  1.0% in effluent water (n = 2) samples for PEDV and MgV, respectively. Then, the method was used to monitor the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 from March 12 to April 14, 2020 in influent, secondary and tertiary effluent water samples. By using the real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Diagnostic Panel validated by US CDC that targets three regions of the virus nucleocapsid (N) gene, we estimated quantification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA titers in untreated wastewater samples of 5.4  0.2 log10 genomic copies/L on average. Two secondary water samples resulted positive (2 out of 18) and all tertiary water samples tested as negative (0 out 12).

Quality assessment for each study was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: A literature search carried out in August 2020 yielded 313 records published between 1992 and 2018. Following a rigorous selection process, only 39 studies were included for this review published between 2000 and 2018. Of these, 19 assessed gynaecological clinical practice, eight assessed gynaecological education, one both, and 11 investigated the feasibility of telemedicine within gynaecological practice. 19 studies were classified as good, 12 fair and eight poor using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Telecolposcopy and abortion care were two areas where telemedicine was found to be effective in potentially speeding up diagnosis as well as providing patients with a wide range of management options. Studies focusing on education demonstrated that telementoring could improve teaching in a range of scenarios such as live surgery and international teleconferencing. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review are promising and demonstrate that telemedicine has a role to play in improving clinical effectiveness and education within gynaecology. Its applications have been shown to be safe and effective in providing remote care and training. In the future, randomised controlled studies involving larger numbers of patients and operators with measurable outcomes are required in order to be able to draw reliable conclusions.","output":"Evaluating the use of telemedicine in gynaecological practice: a systematic review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a phenolic compound that has been well studied for its antiviral, anti-inflammatory and immune stimulating properties. This research was aimed to focus on the antiviral properties of CGA on infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in vivo and in vitro for the very first time. The outcome of in vitro experiments validated that, out of five previously reported antiviral components, CGA significantly reduced the relative mRNA expression of IBV-N in CEK cells. At high concentration (400 mg/kg), CGA supplementation reduced IBV-N mRNA expression levels and ameliorated the injury in trachea and lungs. The mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-1?, IL-12, and NF-&#954;B were considerably turned down, but IL-22 and IL-10 were enhanced in trachea. However, CGA-H treatment had considerably increased the expression levels of MDA5, MAVS, TLR7, MyD88, IRF7, IFN-? and IFN-&#945; both in trachea and lungs. Moreover, CGA-H notably induced the CD3+, CD3+ CD4+ and CD4+/CD8+ proliferation and significantly increased the IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in the serum. In conclusion, these results showed that at high concentration CGA is a strong anti-IBV compound that can effectively regulate the innate immunity through MDA5, TLR7 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways and have the potential to induce the cell mediated and humoral immune response in IBV infected chickens.","output":"Chlorogenic acid is a positive regulator of MDA5, TLR7 and NF-B signaling pathways mediated antiviral responses against Gammacoronavirus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Abstract Programmed frameshifting is a recoding event in which a ribosome shifts reading frame by one or more nucleotides at a specific mRNA signal between overlapping genes. Programmed frameshifting is involved in the expression of many genes in a wide range of organisms, especially in viruses and bacteria. The mechanism of programmed frameshifting is not fully understood despite many studies, and there are few databases available for detailed information on programmed frameshifting. We have developed a database called FSDB (Frameshift Signal Database), which is a comprehensive compilation of experimentally known or computationally predicted data about programmed ribosomal frameshifting. FSDB provides a graphical view of frameshift signals and the genes using programmed frameshifting for their expression. It also allows the user himself/herself to find programmed frameshift sites in genomic sequences using a program called FSFinder (http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/fsfinder2).

Dental academics play a crucial role in the promotion of public oral health and the education of dental students. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to assess COVID-19-related concerns, stress and behavior changes in Iranian dental academics, determine the associated factors, and assess the potential gender differences. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this cross-sectional study, we shared a researcher-developed questionnaire with Iranian dental academics through social media and e-mail. The questionnaire contained 4 sections: Background (8 items and additional 6 knowledge questions); Concerns (18 items); Stress (based on the 15-item Impact of Event Scale (IES)); and Behavior Change (5 items). We divided the concerns by means of the principal component analysis (PCA) into 3 various components of the fear of infection, concerns over professional responsibilities and concerns over restrictions. The backward stepwise multilevel linear and logistic regression analyses served to discover the association of other factors with stress and behavior changes. RESULTS Out of 274 respondents, 66% were female, and 78% were 45 years old or younger. Approximately half of the respondents demonstrated moderate to severe stress and the median (Me) for behavior change was 46.5 out of 50. The greatest concern expressed by the participants referred to the fear of becoming infected by their patients and spreading the virus to their loved ones. Being female, living with parents and not having any administrative role, along with greater fear of infection, concerns over restrictions and academic experience were associated with higher levels of COVID-19-related stress. Being female and having an administrative role, along with greater fear of infection and knowledge, and more daily patient visits were associated with desirable COVID-19-related behavior changes. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected dental academics' psychological state, leading to various levels of concern, stress and behavior change.

Minimal neutralizing antibody titers were detected against Omicron pseudovirus at all four time points, including for a majority of patients who had SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections. Neutralizing antibody titers against all other variant spike protein-bearing pseudoviruses declined dramatically from one to six months after the second mRNA vaccine dose, although SARS-CoV-2 infection boosted vaccine responses. Additionally, mRNA-1273-vaccinated HCWs exhibited about two-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than BNT162b2-vaccinated HCWs.

These two viruses areimportant examples of viral immune evasion of the hosts innate immune response. The innate immune system provides an early form of host protection from infectious diseases without pre-exposure and plays an essential role in determining the outcome of viral infections. The mechanisms that the innate immune system utilizes to counteract infections are based on therecognition of a relatively limited set of molecular structures that are either products of microbes (virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites) or expressed by injured or dead host cells. This review provides a brief overview of the main mechanisms achieved by hosts innate immunity, focusing primarily on the immune escape mechanisms developed and carried out by FCoV and FeHV-1 during infection. ABSTRACT: Over time, feline viruses have acquired elaborateopportunistic properties, making their infections particularly difficult to prevent and treat. Feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline herpesvirus-1 (FeHV-1), due to the involvement of host genetic factors and immune mechanisms in the development of the disease and more severe forms, are important examples of immune evasion of the hosts innate immune response by feline viruses.It is widely accepted that the innate immune system, which providesan initial universal form of the mammalian host protection from infectious diseases without pre-exposure, plays an essential role in determining the outcome of viral infection.The main components of this immune systembranchare represented by the internal sensors of the host cells that are able to perceive the presence of viral component, including nucleic acids, to start and trigger the production of first type interferon and to activate the cytotoxicity by Natural Killercells, often exploited by viruses for immune evasion.In this brief review, we providea general overview of the principal tools of innate immunity, focusing on the immunologic escape implemented byFCoVand FeHV-1 duringinfection.","output":"Feline Coronavirus and Alpha-Herpesvirus Infections: Innate Immune Response and Immune Escape Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the current situation of pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), main organ involvement is of respiratory system ranging from mild symptoms to acute severe respiratory distress syndrome.

There is lack of evidence on distress and mental health of patients hospitalized due to other reasons than COVID-19a vulnerable population group in two ways: First, given their risk for physical diseases, they are at increased risk for severe courses and death related to COVID-19. Second, they may struggle particularly with COVID-19 restrictions due to their dependence on social support. Therefore, we investigated the association of intensity of COVID-19 restrictions with levels of COVID-19-related distress, mental health (depression, anxiety, somatic symptom disorder, and mental quality of life), and perceived social support among Swiss general hospital non-COVID-19 inpatients. METHODS: We analyzed distress of 873 hospital inpatients not admitted for COVID-19, recruited from internal medicine, gynecology, rheumatology, rehabilitation, acute geriatrics, and geriatric rehabilitation wards of three hospitals. We assessed distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and four indicators of mental health: depressive and anxiety symptom severity, psychological distress associated with somatic symptoms, and the mental component of health-related quality of life; additionally, we assessed social support. The data collection period was divided into modest (June 9 to October 18, 2020) and strong (October 19, 2020, to April 17, 2021) COVID-19 restrictions, based on the Oxford Stringency Index for Switzerland. RESULTS: An additional 13% (95%-Confidence Interval 4C21%) and 9% (1C16%) of hospital inpatients reported distress related to leisure time and loneliness, respectively, during strong COVID-19 restrictions compared to times of modest restrictions. There was no evidence for changes in mental health or social support. CONCLUSIONS: Focusing on the vulnerable population of general hospital inpatients not admitted for COVID-19, our results suggest that tightening of COVID-19 restrictions in October 2020 was associated with increased COVID-19-related distress regarding leisure time and loneliness, with no evidence for a related decrease in mental health.

For a time-sensitive emergency such as acute ischemic stroke (AIS), streamlined workflow times are essential to ensure good clinical outcomes. METHODS: The aim of this single-center, retrospective, observational study was to describe changes in stroke workflow patterns and clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from AIS patients undergoing emergent endovascular treatment (EVT) between 23 January and 8 April 2020 were retrospectively collected and compared with data from patients admitted during a similar period in 2019. The primary outcome was difference in time from symptom onset to recanalization. Secondary outcomes included workflow times, clinical management, discharge outcomes, and health-economic data. RESULTS: In all, 21 AIS patients were admitted for emergent EVT during the 77-day study period, compared with 42 cases in 2019. Median time from symptom onset to recanalization was 132 minutes longer during the pandemic compared with the previous year (672 vs. 540 min, P=0.049). Patients admitted during the pandemic had a higher likelihood of endotracheal intubation (84.6% vs. 42.4%, P<0.05) and a higher incidence of delayed extubation after EVT (69.2% vs. 45.5%, P<0.05).

However, the exact mechanism providing the benefits of UB remains unknown. Our hypothesis was that the benefits of UB are achieved mainly through reduction of upper airway dead space. METHODS Sixteen stable COPD patients requiring oxygen use at home were enrolled in this prospective study at a tertiary health care center. A nasal mask and a mouthpiece were used, each having a removable one-way valve to direct the breathing pattern. Four experimentally defined patterns of spontaneous breathing, NMB, mouth-in nose-out (MNB), nose-in nose-out (NNB), and mouth-in mouth-out (MMB), were compared. Each breathing pattern lasted 5 min followed by a 5-min rest period. A NICO device continuously monitored respiratory parameters. The functional anatomical dead space volume (VD) and expired VT values were determined. Breathing efficiency (BE) was calculated as alveolar VT divided by expired volume. RESULTS Functional anatomical VD was higher in bidirectional breathing (BB) (overall: 207.4  7.9 mL; MMB: 232.5  72.7 mL; NNB: 182.2  75 mL) compared to UB (overall: 178.1  87.2 mL; NMB: 176.9  91.3 mL; MNB: 179.3  83.2 mL) (P < .001). BE achieved with UB (overall: 76.2  6.5%; NMB: 76.8  6.8%; MNB: 75.6  6.3%) was higher than that with BB (overall: 66.2  0.09%; MMB: 64.3  0.10%; NNB: 68.1  0.08%) (P < .001). The difference in BE between UB and BB was more pronounced with small VT values (UB: 73.8  0.08; BB: 49.4  0.09) than with large VT values (UB: 77.3  0.06; BB: 63.0  0.07) (P < .001).

Methods: Multi-center retrospective cohort study involving patients who underwent oocyte cryopreservation, in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo cryopreservation, or frozen euploid embryo transfer in 2019 and 2020 at two academic fertility centers located in regionally distinct areas of the US with high coronavirus infection rates. Patients were screened for infectious symptoms, exposure to sick contacts, and fevers, and tested with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing within 5 days of oocyte retrieval. The primary outcomes were the number of oocytes retrieved, embryos fertilized, blastocyst or euploid embryos produced in oocyte retrieval and IVF cycles, and rates of embryo implantation, biochemical pregnancy or no pregnancy following frozen embryo transfer (FET). Results: We found no consistent significant differences in the number of oocytes retrieved, embryos fertilized, blastocysts or euploid embryos produced at either institution over the study period. Furthermore, we did not detect any differences in FET outcomes, including rates of embryo implantation, biochemical pregnancy, or no pregnancy, at either institution during the study time period. Conclusions: There were no significant differences in ART outcomes in patients who received fertility treatment during the pandemic at our centers.

Methods The adult eight-items of the English version of ELCSA was translated into Sinhala and Tamil. Cognitive testing (on ten pregnant women and five local experts) and psychometric validation of the self-administered HFI tool was conducted among pregnant women (n=269) attending the Rajarata Pregnancy Cohort (RaPCo) special clinics in Anuradhapura in February 2020. We assessed psychometric properties and fit using a one parameter logistic model (Rasch analysis) using STATA version 14 and WINSTEP software version 4.3.4. Concurrent validity was tested using psychological distress. Results The scale was internally consistent (Cronbachs alpha = 0.79), had a good model fit (Rasch infit statistic range: 0.85 to 1.07). Item 8 (did not eat for the whole day) was removed from the model fit analysis as it was not affirmed by anyone.

The mechanism underlying this comorbidity, however, is unclear. Decrease in self-esteem caused by the initial disorder might play a decisive role in the development of the subsequent disorder. The present study aimed to determine whether the association between symptoms of social phobia and depression is mediated by decrease in self-esteem in mid-adolescent girls and boys. METHODS As a part of the prospective Adolescent Mental Health Cohort (AMCH), subjects of this study were 9th grade pupils (mean age, 15.5) responding to a survey conducted in 2002-2003 (T1) and to a 2-year follow-up survey in 2004-2005 (T2) (N = 2070, mean age 17.6 years, 54.5% girls). RESULTS Symptoms of social phobia without symptoms of depression at age 15 and symptoms of depression at age 17 were associated only among boys, and this association was mediated by decrease in self-esteem. Symptoms of depression without symptoms of social phobia at age 15 and symptoms of social phobia at age 17 were associated only among girls, and this association was partially mediated by decrease in self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS Decrease in self-esteem plays a decisive role in the association between social phobia and depression. Self-esteem should be a key focus in interventions for adolescents suffering from social phobia or depression. Efficient intervention for the first disorder might help to prevent the decline in self-esteem and thus the incidence of the subsequent disorder. These findings are based on a sample of Finnish adolescents and should be confirmed in other jurisdictions or in more ethnically diverse samples.","output":"Decrease in self-esteem mediates the association between symptoms of social phobia and depression in middle adolescence in a sex-specific manner: a 2-year follow-up of a prospective population cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kidneys are one of the targets for SARS-CoV-2, it is reported that up to 36% of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection would develop into acute kidney injury (AKI).

The aim of this study is to shed the light on the impact of this lockdown on the surgical emergency practice at a tertiary referral center in Amman, the capital of Jordan. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of the patients who were admitted to the hospital through the emergency department over the lock-down months in 2020 and compare them to the records of the patients admitted within the same period in 2019. Results: A total of 143 patients were admitted in the 2020 group, compared to 201 patients in the 2019 group, marking a 28% reduction in admission rate. The average duration of symptoms before the ER visit was significantly longer in the 2020 period compared to 2019 (95.32a?a?148.62a?min, 57a?a?64.4a?min respectively, pa?=a?0.01) which resulted in a Significant increase in the ICU admission in the same period (P=.00001). As for the type of management, there was no difference between the two groups with similar percentage of surgeries performed in the two periods (pa?=a?0.333). Additionally, the average length of stay did not also differ (pa?=a?0.141). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the health care systems around the world to the point of collapse in some countries. This study has demonstrated its effects on the emergency surgery practice at our institution which was mainly related to the delay in getting medical care caused by the strict lock-down laws implemented in the country.

The cellular composition of the lesions was characterized on the basis of cellular morphology and immunohistochemistry using markers for T and B-lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. The extent and distribution of viral antigen expression was also assessed. In G lesions, macrophages were mainly located in the center of the granuloma, with a moderate number of T-lymphocytes scattered among the macrophages, plasma cells, and B-lymphocytes. G-N lesions exhibited a necrotic center surrounded by abundant macrophages, some T-lymphocytes, plasma cells, and a few B-lymphocytes. In G-NL lesions, there was a central area dominated by neutrophils with low numbers of macrophages, plasma cells, and lymphocytes.

Furthermore, impacts of fungicides on bees are rarely examined in peer-reviewed studies, although these are often the pesticides that bees are most exposed to. In a full-factorial semi-field experiment with 39 large flight cages, we assessed the single and combined impacts of the globally used azoxystrobin-based fungicide Amistar? and three types of flowering resources (Phacelia, buckwheat, and a floral mix) on Bombus terrestris colonies. Although Amistar is classified as bee-safe, Amistar exposure through Phacelia monocultures reduced adult worker body mass and colony growth (including a 55% decline in workers and an 88% decline in males), while the fungicide had no impact on colonies in buckwheat or the floral mix cages. Furthermore, buckwheat monocultures hampered survival and fecundity irrespective of fungicide exposure. This shows that bumblebees require access to complementary flowering species to gain both fitness and fungicide tolerance and that Amistar impacts are flowering resource-dependent.

The pandemic may have also indirectly affected access to health care for patients with other conditions, not related to COVID-19, even in countries not overwhelmed by an outbreak.We analyzed and compared visits to the emergency room (ER) department during the same calendar period of 2019 and 2020 (from March 1 to March 31 of each year) in our hospital, a medium size, tertiary center, located in the center of Athens, which is not a referral center for COVID-19.Total ER visits were reduced by 42.3% and the number of those requiring hospitalization by 34.8%. This reduction was driven by lower numbers of visits for low risk, non-specific symptoms and causes. However, there was a significant decrease in admissions for cardiovascular symptoms and complications (chest pain of cardiac origin, acute coronary syndromes, and stroke) by 39.7% and for suspected or confirmed GI hemorrhage by 54.7%. Importantly, number of ER visits for infections remained unchanged, as well as the number of patients that required hospitalization for infection management; only few patients were diagnosed with COVID-19.During the initial period of the pandemic and lock-down in Greece, there was a major decrease in the patients visiting ER department, including decrease in the numbers of admissions for cardiovascular symptoms and complications.

Nevertheless, we still lack an adequate understanding of HPAI H5N1 epidemiology and infection ecology. The nature of the wild waterfowlCpoultry interface, and the sharing of diverse wetland habitat among these birds, currently underscore important knowledge gaps. India has emerged as a global hotspot for HPAI H5N1, while also providing critical wintering habitat for many species of migratory waterfowl and year-round habitat for several resident waterfowl species. The current study sought to examine the extent to which the wild waterfowlCpoultry interface, varied wetland habitat, and climate influence HPAI H5N1 epizootics in poultry in India. Using World Organisation for Animal Health reported outbreaks, this study showed that the wild waterfowlCpoultry interface and lacustrine, riparian, and coastal marsh wetland systems were strongly associated with landscape suitability, and these relationships varied by scale. Although increasing poultry density was associated with increasing risk, this was only the case in the absence of wild waterfowl habitat, and only at a local scale. In landscapes increasingly shared between wild waterfowl and poultry, suitability was greater among lower density poultry, again at a local scale only. These findings provide further insight into the occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in India and suggest important landscape targets for blocking the waterfowlCpoultry interface to interrupt virus transmission and prevent future outbreaks.","output":"Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) Landscape Suitability Varies by Wetland Habitats and the Degree of Interface between Wild Waterfowl and Poultry in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this critical commentary, we propose that the outdoors is a contested leisure terrain that is both a space for freedom, relaxation and enjoyment, and, at the same time, a site of exclusion, hierarchy and discrimination We review some of the well-established benefits of outdoor leisure in relation to physical and mental health, well-being and personal development However, these benefits are not equally accessible to all, with many groups and individuals reporting feeling excluded from leisure in the outdoors Drawing on the context of the UK, we argue that the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating these divisions, as outdoor leisure takes on added significance during times of lockdown Nevertheless, we suggest that the pandemic may also offer an opportunity to rethink outdoor leisure and the outdoors as a leisure space in more inclusive and accessible ways ? 2021 Australia and New Zealand Association of Leisure Studies","output":"The outdoors as a contested leisure terrain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Gait impairments in Alzheimers disease (AD) result from structural and functional deficiencies that generate limitations in the performance of activities and restrictions in individuals biopsychosocial participation.

The 3xTg-AD mice show more significant functional impairment in gait and exploratory activity quantitative variables. The presence of movement limitations and muscle weakness mark the functional decline related to the disease severity stages that intensify with increasing age. Motor performance in 3xTg-AD is accompanied by a series of bizarre behaviors that interfere with the trajectory, which allows us to infer poor neurological control.

We utilized multimodality imaging to provide a detailed sequential description of the cardiac involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty consecutive patients (mean age 10.6  3.8 years) presenting to our institution underwent serial echocardiographic evaluation on admission (median day 5 of illness), the day coinciding with worst cardiac function (median day 7), and the day of discharge (median day 15). We performed cardiac computed tomography (CT) to assess coronary anatomy (median day 15) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) to assess dysfunction (median day 20). On admission, almost all patients displayed abnormal strain and tissue Doppler indices. Three-dimensional (3D) echocardiographic ejection fraction (EF) was <55% in half of the patients. Valvular regurgitation (75%) and small pericardial effusions (10%) were detected. Serial echocardiography demonstrated that the mean 3D EF deteriorated (54.7  8.3% vs. 46.4  8.6%, P = 0.017) before improving at discharge (P = 0.008). Left main coronary artery (LMCA) dimensions were significantly larger at discharge than at admission (Z score C0.11  0.87 vs. 0.78  1.23, P = 0.007). CT showed uniform coronary artery dilatation commonly affecting the LMCA (9/12). CMR detected abnormal strain in all patients with global dysfunction (EF <55%) in 35%, myocardial oedema in 50%, and subendocardial infarct in 5% (1/20) patients.

The first questionnaire targeted physicians, with 72 responses, and the second questionnaire targeted patients, with 248 responses. Both questionnaires contained common sections covering nine aspects of communication such as empathy, honesty, optimism, simple and deliberateness. RESULTS: This study found that the psychological effect of physicians positive communication skills on COVID-19 patients is significant. There were almost statistical agreement between physicians and patients questionnaire responses that the physicians communication skills have positively affected the patients psychological status; all patients responses confirmed this finding. CONCLUSION: Based on this studys findings, appropriate and continuous training will advance physicians communication skills in the form of exercises that could be as simple as class- or lecture-based activities, or using technology-based learning. Using a protocol or handbook to guide such communication is another essential strategy to enhance physicianCpatient communication (PPC).

This study was designed to determine event-free survival (EFS) for adolescents with GCTs and compared them with children and young adults. METHODS: An individual patient database of 11 GCT trials was assembled: 8 conducted by pediatric cooperative groups and 3 conducted by an adult group. Male patients aged 0 to 30 years with metastatic, nonseminomatous, malignant GCTs of the testis, retroperitoneum, or mediastinum who were treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were included. The age groups were categorized as children (0 to <11 years), adolescents (11 to <18 years), and young adults (18 to &#8804;30 years). The study compared EFS and adjusted for risk group by using Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: From a total of 2024 individual records, 593 patients met the inclusion criteria: 90 were children, 109 were adolescents, and 394 were young adults. The 5-year EFS rate was lower for adolescents (72%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62%-79%) than children (90%; 95% CI, 81%-95%; P = .003) or young adults (88%; 95% CI, 84%-91%; P = .0002). The International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group risk group was associated with EFS in the adolescent age group (P = .0020). After adjustments for risk group, the difference in EFS between adolescents and children remained significant (hazard ratio, 0.30; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: EFS for adolescent patients with metastatic GCTs was similar to that for young adults but significantly worse than for that children. This finding highlights the importance of coordinating initiatives across clinical trial organizations to improve outcomes for adolescents and young adults. LAY SUMMARY: Adolescent males with metastatic germ cell tumors (GCTs) are frequently treated with regimens developed for children. In this study, a large data set of male patients with metastatic GCTs across different age groups has been built to understand the outcomes of adolescent patients in comparison with children and young adults. The results suggest that adolescent males with metastatic GCTs have worse results than children and are more similar to young adults with GCTs. Therefore, the treatment of adolescents with GCTs should resemble therapeutic approaches for young adults.","output":"Outcomes of adolescent males with extracranial metastatic germ cell tumors: A report from the Malignant Germ Cell Tumor International Consortium"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This case report underlines the appearance of a \\"walking pneumonia\\" in a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient, with evidence of progressive lung involvement on chest imaging studies The patient traveled from Wuhan, Hubei, China, to Thailand in January 2020 One of her family members was diagnosed with COVID-19 She presented to the hospital because of her concern, but she was without fever or any respiratory symptoms Three days earlier, her nasopharyngeal and throat swabs revealed a negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Her initial chest radiography was abnormal, and her first sputum SARS-CoV-2 test yielded inconclusive results A subsequent sputum test was positive for SARS-CoV-2 Diagnosis in this patient was facilitated by chest imaging and repeat viral testing Thus, chest imaging studies might enhance capabilities for early diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia","output":"Walking pneumonia in novel Coronavirus disease (Covid-19): mild symptoms with marked abnormalities on chest imaging"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background/aim: Alprostadil and iloprost are successful agents used for both pulmonary hypertension and extremity ischemia treatment.

Superiority of preventing ischemia/ reperfusion (IR) injury is a criterion for clinical preference of these agents. The present study was designed to compare the protective effects of alprostadil and iloprost in a rat model of IR injury. Materials and methods: Twenty-three male Sprague Dawley rats were used (aged 8-12 weeks, mean weight 230  30 g). They were randomized into 4 groups: Group 1 (iloprost + IR), Group 2 (alprostadil + IR), Group 3 (saline + IR), and Group 4 (control). Under general anesthesia, in all groups except Group 4, the abdominal region was explored and the abdominal aorta was temporarily clamped for 60 min. After the clamp was removed, 120 min of reperfusion was applied. In Group 4, the rats were placed under general anesthesia and abdominal exploration was performed without the IR procedure. For all rats, body temperature was kept at 36 C with a heater pad through the whole procedure. The rats were euthanized under general anesthesia to remove the kidneys and lungs for study. Histopathological and biochemical analyses were conducted with kidney and lung tissues. Histopathological scoring was done by analyzing cellular damage at tissue level. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase, and glutathione levels were studied for biochemical analysis. Results: Histopathologic analysis showed that, as compared with alprostadil, iloprost provided a significantly higher level of renal protection against IR injury (P < 0.01). Renal tissue levels of MDA were significantly lower in the alprostadil group as compared to Group 3 (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Alprostadil and iloprost seem to provide protection against IR injury, with iloprost being more protective in renal tissue.

The Press Ganey Ambulatory Surgery (PGAS) is a satisfaction survey that has emerged as a prominent quality assessment tool; however, no data exist on whether PGAS scores correlate with early postsurgical satisfaction during the PGAS survey administration period in patients who underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Purpose: To determine if PGAS scores correlate with measures of satisfaction and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 2 weeks postoperatively in ACLR patients. Study Design: Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A retrospective review of patients who underwent ACLR at a single institution was performed. Patients who completed the PGAS survey and PROs at 2 weeks postoperatively were included in the study. Surgical satisfaction was measured with the Surgical Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ-8), and PROs included 6 Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System domains. Bivariate analysis between PGAS and PRO scores was conducted using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r S). Results: Of the 716 patients who received the PGAS survey after ACLR, 81 patients completed the survey, and 39 patients also completed PROs and were included in the study. Total converted (mean scaled score) and \\"top box\\" (percentages of questions with highest rating selected) PGAS scores showed no significant correlations with the SSQ-8 (r S =-0.24; P = .14). There were no significant correlations between SSQ-8 and PGAS domain scores except for a negative correlation with Facility domain top box scores (r S =-0.33; P = .04), meaning that patients with higher surgical satisfaction had lower PGAS Facility scores. Total PGAS (converted and top box scores) and PGAS domain scores showed no significant correlation with any of the other PROs. Conclusion: PGAS scores showed no significant positive correlation with surgical satisfaction, function, pain, mental health, activity, or expectations of surgery in patients 2 weeks after ACLR. This suggests little to no relationship between PGAS score and surgical satisfaction in the early recovery period after ACLR.","output":"Correlation of Press Ganey Scores With Early Patient Satisfaction After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"B.1.1.529 is the SARS-CoV-2 variant designated Omicron by the WHO in November 2021.

In the past, despite an impressive record of vaccine effectiveness in the United States, several factors have contributed to a decreased acceptance of vaccines that has resulted in outbreaks of infectious diseases, e.g., measles. More recently, vaccine hesitancy has spread to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. There are many causes of vaccine hesitancy, such as misinformation, fallacies, and myths, that have contributed to vaccine hesitancy. Objective: The purpose of the present report is to address the many causes of vaccine hesitancy and to suggest ways that the allergist/immunologist can be involved in the promotion of vaccine acceptance. Methods: The current COVID-19 vaccines were reviewed, together with their mechanisms(s) of action and adverse reactions to them. Results: The many causes of vaccine hesitancy include many doubts and concerns related to COVID-19 vaccines as well as a diminished level of confidence and trust by segments of the public in the nation's leaders in government, medical, and business communities, that those groups once enjoyed. Conclusion: Vaccination with COVID-19 vaccines is the only way that COVID-19 will be eliminated or at least controlled today, and vaccine hesitancy is the potential nemesis. The present report describes how the allergist/immunologist not only plays a major role in the delivery of specialized therapy of COVID-19 but also in educating the public with regard to the importance of COVID-19 vaccines, in dispelling misinformation, and in promoting trust for vaccine acceptance but must be informed with the most accurate and current information to do so.","output":"COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine hesitancy: Role of the allergist/immunologist in promotion of vaccine acceptance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: This study aimed to characterize the 30-day readmission in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

The most frequent diagnoses upon readmission were COVID-19 (63%), other viral pneumonia (36%), and acute respiratory failure with hypoxia (34%). Compared to non-readmitted, readmitted patients were older (60 vs 65), had more comorbidities such as COPD (24% vs 37%) and congestive heart failure (28% vs 44%), and longer median LOS (6 vs 7 days) during index hospitalization. Conclusions: This study of a large and geographically diverse population revealed substantial burden on patients beyond the initial COVID-19 hospitalization, as 16% of the patients were re-admitted within 30-days. Over the study period, lower readmission was observed in patients who were treated with RDV during their index hospitalization.","output":"POSB13 Thirty-Day Readmission in US Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"More recently in statistical quality control studies, researchers are paying more attention to quality characteristics having nonnormal distributions. In the present article, a generalized multiple dependent state (GMDS) sampling control chart is proposed based on the transformation of gamma quality characteristics into a normal distribution. The parameters for the proposed control charts are obtained using in-control average run length (ARL) at specified shape parametric values for different specified average run lengths. The out-of-control ARL of the proposed gamma control chart using GMDS sampling is explored using simulation for various shift size changes in scale parameters to study the performance of the control chart. The proposed gamma control chart performs better than the existing multiple dependent state sampling (MDS) based on gamma distribution and traditional Shewhart control charts in terms of average run lengths. A case study with real-life data from ICU intake to death caused by COVID-19 has been incorporated for the realistic handling of the proposed control chart design.","output":"Monitoring Mortality Caused by COVID-19 Using Gamma-Distributed Variables Based on Generalized Multiple Dependent State Sampling"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Data change the game in terms of how we respond to pandemics.

The goal of the present study was to investigate the potential of peracetic acid (PA) as an alternative method to achieve reliable disinfection of freshly extracted teeth. A total of 80 extracted teeth were collected for this study. Whole teeth were incubated in one of four solutions for defined periods of time: sterile water (2 weeks), formalin (2 weeks), PA 1000 ppm (2 weeks), and PA 2000 ppm (1 week). After sectioning, the crown and root fragments were transferred into separate tubes containing brainCheart infusion broth and incubated at 37 C under anaerobic conditions for 72 h. Absence of broth turbidity was used to assess effectiveness of disinfection. No turbidity was observed in any of the formalin-treated or peracetic acid-treated samples, signifying complete disinfection.

By logging signals such as text, timestamp information, and social connectivity graphs, an increasingly rich and detailed picture of how tasks are created and organized, what makes them important, and who acts on them, can be progressively developed. Yet the context around actual task completion remains fuzzy, due to the basic disconnect between actions taken in the real world and telemetry recorded in the digital world.

We describe our annotation framework and conduct a number of analyses on the data that were collected, demonstrating that it captures intuitive contextual properties for common tasks. Finally, we test the dataset on the two problems of predicting spatial and temporal task co-occurrence, concluding that predictors for co-location and co-time are both learnable, with a BERT fine-tuned model outperforming several other baselines.

Disruptions in the drug market are expected and shortages might worsen. Community pharmacies can contribute to early identification and report of medicines' supply and demand issues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on outpatient medicines' sales and shortages. METHODS: A retrospective, time-trend analysis of medicine sales, shortages and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases was performed from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and its homologous period (regarding sales only). A detailed analysis of 6 pharmaceutical substances was performed. All data were subjected to rescaling using the min-max normalization method, in order to become comparable. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft? Excel. RESULTS: The pandemic resulted in an increase in medicines' demand and reported shortages during the early stage of the outbreak. The maximum proportion of medicine sales was registered on March 13th, 2020, 4 days after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By the end of March, sales have already dropped to proportions similar to those of 2019. The maximum proportion of drug shortages was reached about one week after the sales peak and by the end of the study period were below those recorded in the pre-COVID-19 period. The analyzed drugs were paracetamol, ascorbic acid, dapagliflozin plus metformin, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, formoterol, and hydroxychloroquine, as these pharmaceutical substances registered the highest growth rate in sales and shortages when compared to the same period in the previous year. Hydroxychloroquine showed the most different pattern trends on sales and shortages of these medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies can provide timely and real-world data regarding sales and shortages.

Ribavirin is the treatment of choice for most patients and type I interferon (IFN) has been evaluated in a few infected transplantation patients in vivo. However, no effective and specific treatments against HEV infections are currently available. In this study, we evaluated the natural compound silvestrol, isolated from the plant Aglaia foveolata, and known for its specific inhibition of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A in state-of-the-art HEV experimental model systems. Silvestrol blocked HEV replication of different subgenomic replicons in a dose-dependent manner at low nanomolar concentrations and acted additive to ribavirin (RBV). In addition, HEV p6-based full length replication and production of infectious particles was reduced in the presence of silvestrol. A pangenotypic effect of the compound was further demonstrated with primary isolates from four different human genotypes in HEV infection experiments of hepatocyte-like cells derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells.

Ten mares undergoing standing bilateral laparoscopic ovariectomy were used in a randomized clinical study. During surgery, blood vessels within the mesovarium were either: (1) sealed and transected with a vessel sealing and dividing device (VSDD), or (2) ligated using two loops placed proximal to each ovary and then the mesovarium transected using laparoscopic scissors. The ovaries were removed through the ipsilateral body wall. Abdominocentesis was performed before surgery and 24 h and 72 h after surgery. Markers of peritoneal inflammation, as measured by total nucleated cell count, total protein (TP) and red blood cell count via abdominocentesis, were consistently increased for all groups compared to pre-operative values. The mean (range) of TP for the VSDD group was 4.14 (3.9-4.5) g/dL, and that for the ligating loop group was 3.18 (2.7-3.5) g/dL.

Objectives We describe EV and PeV infections among children from 2 US study sites aged <1 year and hospitalized with acute infections. For EV- and PeV-negative case-patients, we explored other viral etiologies. Methods Participants were aged <1 year, hospitalized during 2016, and had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected for routine diagnostic testing. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from medical charts, and residual specimens were sent to CDC for confirmatory testing and typing. Results Of 472 eligible case-patients, CSF specimen was available for 319 (67.6%). Among those, 13 (4.1%) were positive for EV and 11 (3.4%) for PeV. Most case-patients (86.8%, n = 277) were aged <2 months, as were all EV- or PeV-positive case-patients. None of the positive case-patients had underlying conditions, and the chief complaint for 91.7% (n = 22) was fever. Twelve positive case-patients were admitted to intensive care (ICU) and had brief hospital stays (median 2 days). Sequencing revealed a variety of EV types and the predominance of PeV-A3 among the PeV-positive case-patients. Conclusions A range of EV and PeV types were associated with acute febrile illnesses leading to hospitalization in children aged <2 months. Approximately half of EV and PeV case-patients were admitted to ICU, but length of hospital stay was brief and illnesses were generally self-limiting.

A supportive end-of-life care approach emphasises family involvement, optimal symptom control, multidisciplinary team collaboration and death and bereavement support services for residents and families. Community-based and palliative care specialist physicians who visit residents in LTC facilities play an important role in supportive end-of-life care. Yet, perspectives, experiences and perceptions of these physicians remain unknown. The objective of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to optimal supportive end-of-life palliative care in LTC through the experiences and perceptions of community-based and palliative specialist physicians who visit LTC facilities. DESIGN: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, basic qualitative description and directed content analysis using the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) theoretical framework. SETTING: Residential long-term care. PARTICIPANTS: 23 physicians who visit LTC facilities from across Alberta, Canada, including both in urban and rural settings of whom 18 were community-based physicians and 5 were specialist palliative care physicians. RESULTS: Motivation barriers include families lack of frailty knowledge, unrealistic expectations and emotional reactions to grief and uncertainty. Capability barriers include lack of symptom assessment tools, as well as palliative care knowledge, training and mentorship. Physical and social design barriers include lack of dedicated spaces for death and bereavement, inadequate staff, and mental health and spiritual services of insufficient scope for the population.

Targeted treatment relies on a precise microbiological diagnosis  in pneumonia, this poses a challenge as the usefulness of Gram stains and cultures is highly dependent on the quality of the sputum sample. This study aims to examine adverse effects and quality of sputum samples obtained by expiratory techniques (forced expiratory technique and sputum induction) compared with tracheal suction. The hypothesis is that expiratory techniques are non-inferior to tracheal suction in obtaining samples from the lower respiratory tract. This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the study design, method, and data analysis of the trial to increase transparency, avoid reporting bias or data-driven analysis and increase the studys reproducibility. METHOD: The design is a pragmatic, non-inferiority, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial including 280 patients admitted with suspected lower respiratory infection to two emergency departments. Patients are randomized to a usual care group, where sputum samples are collected by tracheal suction or to an intervention group where sputum samples are collected by forced expiratory technique and sputum induction. The statistical analysis will follow an intention-to-treat protocol. This SAP is developed and submitted before the end of recruitment, database closure, and statistical analyses.

Pharmacists can perform multifaceted tasks in hypertension management such as measuring blood pressure. In a time where the use of educational videos in health professions education has increased, an educational video might be an option for teaching blood pressure measurement skills to pharmacy students. This project aimed to develop an educational video tailored to pharmacy students on oscillometric blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting that can be used as a self-instruction video. METHODS: The video was created with support from the universitys multimedia center. The video development was roughly divided into pre-production, production, and post-production. Students satisfaction with and perception of the video was surveyed. RESULTS: An 11-minute 33-second self-instruction video in the German language on proper oscillometric blood pressure measurement tailored for pharmacy students was created. Along with descriptive slides, the video delineates the necessary steps of blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting in a role-play, to support students in communication with the patient. Results of a survey on the satisfaction and perception of the video from thirty-seven pharmacy students were included in the analysis and revealed that the video was well accepted by pharmacy students. Moreover, approximately 95% responded that instructional videos should be included in future pharmacy education. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed an educational video on oscillometric blood pressure measurement for a community pharmacy setting. This work is a valuable form of support for faculty members, who intend to develop educational videos.

During the pandemic surge in New York City, NY, a number of military Medical Corps (MC) and Nurse Corps (NC) providers were mobilized in direct support of critical care capabilities through expansion intensive care units. In the course of the deployment, high rates of neurological-related manifestations associated with COVID-19 infection were directly observed by our military provider teams which will be described and supporting literature highlighted.Case ReportExperiences of a group of mobilized providers including anesthesiologists, neurosurgeons, and other physician specialists were integrated as attending intensive care unit providers as part of the Navy Medicine Support Team (NMST) during the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and Department of Defense (DoD) collective response C i.e. Operation Gotham. Various neurological manifestations diagnosed in patients suffering from COVID-19 infection were identified and are reported to illustrate some of the unique considerations in the care of these critically ill patients. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19 varied in presentation and severity. Cerebral vascular injuries documented included strokes, iatrogenic intraparenchymal hemorrhage, hypoxic-related changes and sequalae, as well as acquired diseases secondary to delayed treatment of other primary neurologic disease states. Hypercoagulable and inflammatory markers (d-dimer, CRP, etc) were commonly elevated, and anticoagulation became a key factor in disease treatment and to help mitigate the downstream neurologic sequalae associated with this disease.ConclusionPatients suffering from COVID-19 infection may suffer severe end organ neurologic compromise that should be directly acknowledged and addressed in both the initial and long-term intensive care unit setting. Familiarity and integration of the latest stroke intervention criteria combined with best possible neurologic examination is critical in the medical management and treatment of these patients.

Rapid advances in wearable technology present a dizzying display of possible functions: from thermometers and barometers, magnetometers and accelerometers, to oximeters and calorimeters. Consumers and practitioners utilize wearable devices to track outcomes, such as energy expenditure, training load, step count, and heart rate. While some rely on these devices in tandem with more established tools, others lean on wearable technology for health-related outcomes, such as heart rhythm analysis, peripheral oxygen saturation, sleep quality, and caloric expenditure. Given the increasing popularity of wearable devices for both recreation and health initiatives, understanding the strengths and limitations of these technologies is increasingly relevant. Need exists for continued evaluation of the efficacy of wearable devices to accurately and reliably measure purported outcomes. The purposes of this review are (1) to assess the current state of wearable devices using recent research on validity and reliability, (2) to describe existing gaps between physiology and technology, and (3) to offer expert interpretation for the lay and professional audience on how best to approach wearable technology and employ it in the pursuit of health and fitness. Current literature demonstrates inconsistent validity and reliability for various metrics, with algorithms not publicly available or lacking high-quality validation studies.

Patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are prone to both thrombosis and bleeding, calling for special care during COVID-19. We reviewed the clinical features of MPN patients with COVID-19, suggesting guidance for treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: One study by the European LeukemiaNet collected 175 MPN patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the pandemic, from February to May 2020. Patients with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were at higher risk of mortality (48%) in comparison with essential thrombocythemia (ET) (25%) and polycythemia vera (19%); the risk of death was higher in those patients who abruptly discontinued ruxolitinib. In patients followed at home, in regular wards, or in ICU, the thrombosis rate was 1.0%, 2.8%, and 18.4%, respectively. Independent risk factors for thrombosis were ET phenotype, transfer to ICU, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio; major bleeding occurred in 4.3% of patients, particularly those with PMF. SUMMARY: MPN patients with non-severe COVID-19 treated at home should continue their primary or secondary antithrombotic prophylaxis with aspirin or oral anticoagulants. In the case of hospitalization, patients assuming aspirin should add low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at standard doses. In contrast, LMWH at intermediate/therapeutic doses should replace oral anticoagulants prescribed for atrial fibrillation or previous venous thromboembolism. Intermediate/high doses of LMWH can also be considered in ICU patients with ET, particularly in the case of a rapid decline in the number of platelets and progressive respiratory failure.","output":"Philadelphia-Negative Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Around the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The university accreditation system in Chile appears to be influenced by tensions between interest groups from well-established institutions and newer (private) institutions.

This arrangement creates a potential conflict of interest that can jeopardize the accreditations legitimacy. We explore this potential bias through an empirical study examining voting behaviour by commissioners of the Chilean National Commission of Accreditation from March 2013 to October 2016. We assess whether commissioners appeared as favouring institutions within their appointing conglomerates. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the region designed to examine the presence of bias in higher education accreditation.

We studied the association between time to treatment and stone-free rate in patients with ureteral stones to determine optimal shock wave lithotripsy timing. We retrospectively analyzed 537 patients undergoing shock wave lithotripsy for ureteral stones. Patients were divided into five groups according to time from onset of symptoms to lithotripsyurgent (0C3 days), early (4C30 days), late (31C60 days), long-delayed lithotripsy ( 61 days), and asymptomatic. Stone-free rates were compared among groups. Mean age and stone size were 55.6  13.1 years and 7.48  3.29 mm, respectively. Mean number of shock wave lithotripsy sessions and stone-free rate were 1.37 and 91.6%, respectively, in the overall population. Stone-free rates were 95.2%, 96.8%, 91.3%, 86.3%, and 82.7% in urgent, early, late, long-delayed lithotripsy, and asymptomatic groups, respectively. Long-delayed lithotripsy and asymptomatic groups had significantly more lithotripsy sessions and lower stone-free rate, compared to urgent and early lithotripsy groups. In multivariate analysis, time to lithotripsy [long-delayed lithotripsy (odds ratio: 0.273, p = 0.004) and asymptomatic nature (odds ratio: 0.236, p = 0.002)] and age (odds ratio: 0.959, p = 0.003) independently affected stone-free rate. In conclusion, time to lithotripsy is a strong predictive factor for stone-free status following shock wave lithotripsy. Urgent shock wave lithotripsy did not improve stone-free rate if performed within 1 month. However, time to shock wave lithotripsy > 2 months reduced likelihood of stone-free status.

METHODS An initial survey was conducted to measure staff confidence and competency in prone positioning. A literature review was performed, and a plan-do-study-act approach was used to develop a protocol through in situ simulation involving mock patients. A training video and a simulation scenario using a high-fidelity manikin were developed to facilitate staff education. Staff were surveyed again after training.

Methods: We enrolled 378 healthcare workers (255 women and 123 men) whose Ab titers were analyzed 3 and 6 months after the second dose in our previous study and whose characteristics and adverse effects were collected previously by using a structured self-report questionnaire. Results: The workers median age was 44 years. Although injection-site symptoms occurred with almost equal frequency between the first and second doses, systemic adverse effects, such as general fatigue and fever, were significantly more frequent after the second dose than after the first dose. Multivariate analysis showed that fever was significantly correlated with female participants for the second dose (odds ratio (OR), 2.139; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.185C3.859), older age for the first dose (OR, 0.962; 95% CI, 0.931C0.994) and second dose (OR, 0.957; 95% CI, 0.936C0.979), and dyslipidemia for the first dose (OR, 8.750; 95% CI, 1.814C42.20).

At the time of conducting this study, it had recorded over 11,301,850 confirmed cases while more than 531,806 have died due to it, with these figures rising daily across the globe. The burden of this highly contagious respiratory disease is that it presents itself in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patterns in those already infected, thereby leading to an exponential rise in the number of contractions of the disease and fatalities. It is, therefore, crucial to expedite the process of early detection and diagnosis of the disease across the world. The case-based reasoning (CBR) model is a compelling paradigm that allows for the utilization of case-specific knowledge previously experienced, concrete problem situations or specific patient cases for solving new cases. This study, therefore, aims to leverage the very rich database of cases of COVID-19 to solve new cases. The approach adopted in this study employs the use of an improved CBR model for state-of-the-art reasoning task in the classification of suspected cases of COVID-19. The CBR model leverages on a novel feature selection and the semantic-based mathematical model proposed in this study for case similarity computation. An initial population of the archive was achieved from 71 (67 adults and 4 pediatrics) cases obtained from the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM) repository. Results obtained revealed that the proposed approach in this study successfully classified suspected cases into their categories with an accuracy of 94.54%. The study found that the proposed model can support physicians to easily diagnose suspected cases of COVID-19 based on their medical records without subjecting the specimen to laboratory tests.

Resident CNS cell types, such as astrocytes and microglia, are known to produce key inflammatory and antiviral mediators following infection with neurotropic DNA viruses. However, the mechanisms by which glia mediate such responses remain poorly understood. Recently, a class of intracellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), collectively known as DNA sensors, have been identified in both leukocytic and non-leukocytic cell types. The ability of such DNA sensors to initiate immune mediator production and contribute to infection resolution in the periphery is increasingly recognized, but our understanding of their role in the CNS remains limited at best. In this review, we describe the evidence for the expression and functionality of DNA sensors in resident brain cells, with a focus on their role in neurotropic virus infections. The available data indicate that glia and neurons can constitutively express, and/or can be induced to express, various disparate DNA sensing molecules previously described in peripheral cell types. Furthermore, multiple lines of investigation suggest that these sensors are functional in resident CNS cells and are required for innate immune responses to viral infections. However, it is less clear whether DNA sensormediated glial responses are beneficial or detrimental, and the answer to this question appears to dependent on the context of the infection with regard to the identity of the pathogen, host cell type, and host species. Defining such parameters will be essential if we are to successfully target these molecules to limit damaging inflammation while allowing beneficial host responses to improve patient outcomes.","output":"Cytosolic DNA Sensors and CNS Responses to Viral Pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Post-extubation stridor is a known complication of mechanical ventilation that affects a substantial number of all critical care patients and leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Common risk factors for the development of post-extubation stridor include female gender, older age, and prolonged length of mechanical ventilation. There may be an increased incidence of post-extubation stridor in patients who require mechanical ventilation to manage the respiratory complications of COVID-19. In this case series, we analyzed nine patients from across our institution who were intubated to manage acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to COVID-19 and subsequently developed post-extubation stridor. The patients were predominantly females with prolonged intubations and multiple days of prone ventilation. While the patients in this case series possessed some of the well-described risk factors for post-extubation stridor, there may be risk factors specific to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection that make these patients more susceptible to the complication. The cuff leak test was performed on the majority of patients in the case series and did not successfully predict successful extubation in this population. Our analysis suggests that prophylactic corticosteroids given in the 24-48 hours prior to elective extubation in female COVID-19 patients who were intubated for more than six days with consecutive days of intermittent prone ventilation may be helpful in reducing the incidence of post-extubation stridor in this population.

We describe COVID-19 infection control measures implemented and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in the Emory Dialysis facilities. METHODS: Implementation of COVID-19 infection procedures commenced in February 2020. Subsequently, COVID-19 preparedness assessments were conducted at each facility. Patients with COVID-19 from March 1-May 31, 2020 were included; with a follow-up period spanning March-June 30, 2020. Percentages of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were calculated, and characteristics of COVID-19 patients were summarized as medians or percentage. Baseline characteristics of all patients receiving care at Emory Dialysis (i.e. Emory general dialysis population) were presented as medians and percentages. RESULTS: Of 751 dialysis patients, 23 (3.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The median age was 67.0 years and 13 patients (56.6%) were female. Eleven patients (47.8%) were residents of nursing homes. Nineteen patients (82.6%) required hospitalization and 6 patients (26.1%) died; the average number of days from a positive SARS-CoV-2 (COVID) test to death was 16.8 days (range 1-34). Two patients dialyzing at adjacent dialysis stations and a dialysis staff who cared for them, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in a time frame that may suggest transmission in the dialysis facility. In response, universal masking in the facility was implemented (prior to national guidelines recommending universal masking), infection control audits and re-trainings of PPE were also done to bolster infection control practices. CONCLUSION: We successfully implemented recommended COVID-19 infection control measures aimed at mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the patients with COVID-19 required hospitalizations.

In some cases the response rates have been impressive and no adverse autoimmunity have been observed.

STAT1 is a 91 kDa protein originally identified as the mediator of the cellular response to interferon (IFN) , and thereafter found to be a major component of the cellular response to IFN. STAT1 is, in fact, involved in the response to several cytokines and to growth factors. It is activated by cytokine receptors via kinases of the JAK family. STAT1 becomes phosphorylated and forms a dimer which enters the nucleus and triggers the transcription of its targets. Although not lethal at birth, selective gene deletion of STAT1 in mice leads to rapid death from severe infections, demonstrating its major role in the response to pathogens. Similarly, in humans who do not express STAT1, there is a lack of resistance to pathogens leading to premature death. This indicates a key, non-redundant function of STAT1 in the defence against pathogens. Thus, to successfully infect organisms, bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens must overcome the activity of STAT1, and almost all the steps of this pathway can be blocked or inhibited by proteins produced in infected cells. Interestingly, some pathogens, like the oncogenic EpsteinCBarr virus, have evolved a strategy which uses STAT1 activation.","output":"STAT1 and pathogens, not a friendly relationship"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Covid 19 pandemic influences business, office activities, and education.

The results show that as: (1) only the communication function has positive impacts on knowledge sharing, while the impact of the information storing function and information distribution function on knowledge sharing is not significant; (2) knowledge sharing does not affect course satisfaction in a direct way, but it can act indirectly through promoting collaborative learning, which shows the mediating role of collaborative learning. The theoretical implications and practical implications of the study are discussed.","output":"How Do Mobile Social Apps Matter for College Students Satisfaction in Group-Based Learning?

This piece ends with a proposal for doing key experiments that can be run to test this hypothesis. As more than 30 million people have been infected with this disease world-wide, a safe method for stopping spread is worthy of consideration. Publication of this hypothesis would enable the scientific community at large to test this in a clinically meaningful setting to address the potential for DHA-based prophylaxis.

The current challenge is to translate plastic antibodies to in vivo applications for diagnosis, drug delivery, theranostic, therefore it is crucial to evaluate the effect of the biological sample complexity on the selectivity and the formation of protein corona (PCs), which ultimately dictate the fate of circulating nanoparticles. A set (n = 4) of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs) against different proteins was prepared. Quantitative (iBAC) shotgun proteomics permitted to define the PC composition of nanoMIPs in human plasma, the relative protein abundances, the correlation between PC and the plasma dilution. NanoMIPs showed >200 proteins PC, while ~150 proteins were found on controls, suggesting the imprinting process influences the nanoparticle's structure hence the protein uptake. NanoMIPs and controls shared the 44% of the PC, but PC iBAQ values on nanoMIPs were 10-100 times higher than controls, suggesting PC/nanoMIPs interactions were far stronger than PC/non imprinted particles. PCs were richer in small proteins and in immunoglobulins, indicating a defensive response, while the selectivity was negatively challenged in the crowded plasma sample. SIGNIFICANCE: The formation and the composition of the protein corona (PC) is key to decide the fate of nanoparticles when in vivo, therefore there is the strong need to study the composition of the PC. To enable and to support the translation of the use of plastic antibodies (nanoMIPs), prepared by means of the molecular imprinting technique, to the clinical practice and to in vivo uses, the present work evaluates the effects of the complexity of the biological sample (plasma) on nanoMIPs composed of highly crosslinked polyacrylamide and acrylamide derivatives. Proteomic study offers an in depth insight of the protein corona formed in plasma on nanoMIPs. A set of nanoMIPs synthesized and raised to recognize either small or large proteins was tested. The selection abilities of the nanoMIPs when placed in plasma at different dilutions was studied. Quantitative shotgun proteomics allowed to define the composition of the formed protein corona (PC) enabling to detail the protein compositions, the relative abundances, its correlation to the biological sample composition and the correlation between PC and nanoMIP's imprinted template. In plasma, all the nanoMIPs gained a PC composed of more than 200 proteins. Type of protein recruited for the corona, molecular weight and abundance in the PC were studied. The PC on the nanoMIPs appeared to be driven by the protein composition of the plasma, while the template protein, towards which a nanoMIP was imprinted and that was proven to have high affinity for, did not influence the PC.","output":"Does the protein corona take over the selectivity of molecularly imprinted nanoparticles?

Data on its status are scattered due to both its rarity and evasiveness, and records are biased towards occasional, mostly coastal, encounters. Nowadays molecular techniques allow us to detect and quantify minute amounts of DNA traces released in the environment (eDNA) by any organism. We present three qPCR-assays targeting the monk seal mitogenome. The assays were soundly tested on an extensive and diversified sample set (n=73), including positive controls from Madeira breeding population collected during the peak of abundance, and two opportunistic Mediterranean eDNA-sample collections (offshore/coastal) from on-going projects. Monk seal DNA was detected in 47.2% and 66.7% of the samples collected in the Tyrrhenian from a ferry platform (2018-2019) and in the Pelagie archipelago -Strait of Sicily- (2020) respectively, anticipating (up to 2 year) visual observations occurred subsequently in proximity of the sampled areas. In the Tyrrhenian, detection occurrence increased between 2018 and 2019. Monk seal DNA recoveries were commoner in night-time ferry-samples, suggesting nocturnal predatory activity in pelagic waters.

The decreased activity and abnormal differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are considered to be one of the major reasons for the onset and progression of this disease. Periostin (POSTN) is a matricellular protein which plays an important role in regulating osteoblast function and bone formation. Sclerostin (SOST) is a secreted antagonist of Wnt signaling that is mainly expressed in osteocytes to inhibit bone formation. However, the exact role of POSTN and SOST in SONFH has not been reported yet. Therefore, we detected the differential expression of POSTN and SOST in BMSCs of SONFH Group patients, and Control Group was patients with traumatic ONFH (TONFH) and developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Furthermore, we used lentiviral transfection to knockdown POSTN expression in BMSCs of patients with SONFH to study the effect of POSTN knockdown on the SOST expression and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. The results indicated that the endogenous expression of POSTN and SOST in BMSCs of SONFH Group was upregulated, compared with Control Group. POSTN was upregulated gradually while SOST was downregulated gradually at days 0, 3, and 7 of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in Control Group. Contrarily, POSTN was gradually downregulated while SOST was gradually upregulated during osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in SONFH Group. This could be due to increased expression of SOST in BMSCs, which was caused by excessive GCs. In turn, the increased expression of POSTN in BMSCs may play a role in antagonizing the continuous rising of SOST during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in patients with SONFH. POSTN knockdown significantly attenuated osteo-specific gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium nodule formation in vitro; thus inhibiting the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in patients with SONFH. Besides, POSTN knockdown upregulated SOST expression, increased GSK-3 activity, and downregulated -catenin. These findings suggest that POSTN have an essential role in regulating the expression of SOST and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs in patients with SONFH, and POSTN knockdown suppresses osteogenic differentiation by upregulating SOST and partially inactivating Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, targeting POSTN and SOST may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of SONFH.","output":"Knockdown of POSTN Inhibits Osteogenic Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells From Patients With Steroid-Induced Osteonecrosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The lipid bilayer is the basis of the structure and function of the cell membrane.

Participants were identified from PCHC electronic medical records. For three age groupsC 0C4, 5C11, and 12C17 yearsCwe estimated the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of individual symptoms and three symptom combinations: a case definition published by the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH), and two novel combinations generated by different statistical approaches to maximize sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. We evaluated symptom combinations both with and without consideration of COVID-19 exposure. Myalgia, headache, sore throat, abdominal pain, nausea, anosmia, and ageusia were not assessed in 0C4 year-olds due to the lower reliability of these symptoms in this group. RESULTS: Of 555 participants, 217 (39.1%) were SARS-CoV-2-infected. Fever was more common among 0C4 years-olds (p = 0.002); older children more frequently reported fatigue (p = 0.02). In children 5 years old, anosmia or ageusia had 94C98% specificity. In all ages, exposure history most accurately predicted infection. With respect to individual symptoms, cough most accurately predicted infection in <5 year-olds (AUC 0.69) and 12C17 year-olds (AUC 0.62), while headache was most accurate in 5C11 year-olds (AUC 0.62). In combination with exposure history, the novel symptom combinations generated statistically to maximize test characteristics had sensitivity >95% but specificity <30%. No symptom or symptom combination had AUC 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: Anosmia or ageusia in children 5 years old should raise providers index of suspicion for COVID-19.

We demonstrate that this variant peaked during the second wave of COVID-19 in Mexico City in the spring of 2021. This variant is likely more infectious, attributed to mutation in the RBD of the spike protein T478K also seen in the alpha variant (B.1.1.7). However the time dynamics of the spread of this variant drastically changed upon the introduction of delta (B.1.617.2) to the country in which we observe a shift from 0% in May 2021 to 55% delta in the span of one month. Since the delta variant has dominantly spread across the globe, we investigated the increasing frequency of the Mexico variant, B.1.1.519, in the public community within Mexico City. Once present, the delta variant was 78% of the Mexico City catchment in July 2021, a time which marked the commencement of Mexicos third wave. Our data supports the growing concern that the delta variant is closely associated with the massive infection spread of the VOC in Central and South America.

The UPR restores protein homeostasis, which otherwise would be toxic to cellular survival. Here, we interrogated the role of DNA-damage inducible protein 1 (PfDdi1), a unique proteasome-interacting retropepsin in mediating the actions of the ARTs. We demonstrate that PfDdi1 is an active A(2) family protease that hydrolyzes ubiquitinated proteasome substrates. Treatment of P. falciparum parasites with ARTs leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the parasites and blocks the destruction of ubiquitinated proteins by inhibiting the PfDdi1 protease activity. Besides, whereas the PfDdi1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, exposure of the parasites to ARTs leads to DNA fragmentation and increased recruitment of the PfDdi1 into the nucleus. Furthermore, we show that Ddi1 knock-out Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells are more susceptible to ARTs and the PfDdI1 protein robustly restores the corresponding functions in the knock-out cells. Together, these results show that ARTs act in multiple ways; by inducing DNA and protein damage and might be impairing the damage recovery by inhibiting the activity of PfDdi1, an essential ubiquitin-proteasome retropepsin.","output":"Artemisinin Binds and Inhibits the Activity of Plasmodium falciparum Ddi1, a Retroviral Aspartyl Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted graduate medical education.

As a mitigating initiative, holistically evaluating customers perceived degree of exposure to COVID-19 in restaurants is deemed relevant in the design of mitigation measures. Such an agenda is associated with multiple attributes under decision-making uncertainty within the framework of multiple criteria sorting (MCS). Thus, this work addresses this problem domain by proposing an intuitionistic fuzzy set extension of the previously developed TOPSIS-Sort (i.e., IF TOPSIS-Sort). As a case demonstration, 40 restaurants are evaluated under six attributes that define exposure to COVID-19. With 250 survey participants, the IF TOPSIS-Sort assigns 10, 13, and 17 restaurants to low, moderate, and high exposure classes, respectively. With this classification, crucial insights are offered to the restaurant industry for planning and policy formulation. To determine its effectiveness, a comparative analysis was carried with other distance-based MCS methods. Findings reveal that the proposed method is pessimistic and that other methods tend to underestimate the assignments, which may be counterintuitive, especially in applications related to public health. These sorting differences may be associated with addressing the vagueness and uncertainty in decision-making within the IF TOPSIS-Sort platform.

With the aim to facilitate mental health communications, we tested an Interactive Computer-assisted Client Assessment Survey (iCCAS) in Cantonese/Mandarin and English at a nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic in Toronto. The iCCAS offers a touch-screen, pre-consultation survey with questions on depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol abuse, and social context. The program generates point-of-care reports for the clinician and patient. METHODS A pilot randomized controlled trial examined the intervention impact on mental health discussion and symptom detection, compared with the usual care, followed by clinicians' qualitative interviews. RESULTS Fifty self-identified Chinese adult patients participated (iCCAS = 26, Usual Care = 24), response rate 79.4%. Participant mean age was 44.8 years and 92% were immigrants. There was an increase of 19% and 15% in the mental health discussion and detection of symptoms in the iCCAS group compared with the usual care.

It is estimated that up to 20% of DENV infections affect the brain. Incidence of DENV infections is increasing, which suggests more people are at risk of developing neurological complications. The most common neurological manifestations of DENV are encephalitis and encephalopathy, and movement disorders such as parkinsonism have been observed. Parkinsonism describes syndromes similar to Parkinsons Disease where tremors, stiffness, and slow movements are observed. Parkinsonism caused by viral infection is characterized by patients exhibiting at least two of the following symptoms: tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. To investigate DENV-associated parkinsonism, case studies and reports of DENV-associated parkinsonism were obtained from peer-reviewed manuscripts and gray literature. Seven reports of clinically diagnosed DENV-associated parkinsonism and 15 cases of DENV encephalitis, where the patient met the case criteria for a diagnosis of viral parkinsonism were found. Clinically diagnosed DENV-associated parkinsonism patients were more likely to be male and exhibit expressionless face, speech problems, and lymphocytosis. Suspected patients were more likely to exhibit tremor, have thrombocytopenia and low hemoglobin. Viral parkinsonism can cause a permanent reduction in neurons with consequential cognitive and behavior changes, or it can leave a latent imprint in the brain that can cause neurological dysfunction decades after recovery. DENV-associated parkinsonism is underdiagnosed and better adherence to the case definition of viral parkinsonism is needed for proper management of potential sequalae especially if the patient has an ongoing or potential to develop a neurodegenerative disease. Author summary Dengue Virus (DENV) causes generalized fever in most patients and is transmitted via Aedes aegypti mosquitos. A small proportion of DENV infected patients have neurological complications associated with the critical phase of the illness. The usual neurological manifestations are encephalitis and encephalopathy, but there can also be movement disorders such as parkinsonism. DENV patients with parkinsonism present with tremor, bradykinesia, instability, and rigidity on top of the typical febrile manifestations of the disease. We searched the literature and uncovered 7 cases of clinically diagnosed DENV parkinsonism patients and 15 cases of suspected DENV parkinsonism. We found that the clinically diagnosed patients were more likely to be male, have expressionless face, speech issues and lymphocytosis. The suspected cases often had a diagnosis of encephalitis and were more likely to have tremors, thrombocytopenia, and low hemoglobin.","output":"Viral Parkinsonism: An underdiagnosed neurological complication of Dengue virus infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cellular senescence is a driver of many age-related pathologies.

Using chemical inhibitor screening for CRYAB disruption, we identified 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), an endogenous metabolite of cholesterol biosynthesis, as a potent senolytic. We then validated 25HC as a senolytic in mouse and human cells in culture and in vivo in mouse skeletal muscle. Thus, 25HC represents a potential class of senolytics, which may be useful in combating diseases or physiologies in which cellular senescence is a key driver.","output":"Senolysis induced by 25-hydroxycholesterol targets CRYAB in multiple cell types"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to counter the spread of COVID-19 many schools were forced to shut down.

Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. Methods: We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models, and the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring. Results: We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4%) - representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not. Discussion: Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to -- not at -- symptom onset. Detailed estimation of the trajectories of viral load and virus shedding can inform the transmission, mathematical modeling, and clinical implications of SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS infection.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset: a systematic review and individual-pooled analysis of coronavirus viral load from 66 studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research is a pilot study which aims to create the website and analyze the effectiveness of a website-based solution focused-brief counseling (SFBC) program to reduce academic anxiety experienced by high school students.

Multiple studies have demonstrated a decline in the quality of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed as soon as 3-month post-training. The Resuscitation Quality Improvement (RQI) programme is a quarterly low-dose, high-frequency training, based around the use of manikins connected to a cart providing real-time and summative feedback. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the RQI Programme on CPR psychomotor skills in UK hospitals that had adopted this as a method of BLS training, and establish whether this program leads to increased compliance in CPR training. METHODS: The study took place across three adopter sites and one control site. Participants completed a baseline assessment without live feedback. Following this, participants at the adopter sites followed the RQI curriculum for adult CPR, or adult and infant CPR. The curriculum was split into quarterly training blocks, and live feedback was given on technique during the training session via the RQI cart. After following the curriculum for 12/24 months, participants completed a second assessment without live feedback. RESULTS: At the adopter sites, there was a significant improvement in the overall score between baseline and assessment for infant ventilations (N = 167, p < 0.001), adult ventilations (n = 129, p < 0.001), infant compressions (n = 163, p < 0.001) adult compressions (n = 205, p < 0.001), and adult CPR (n = 249, p < 0.001). There was no significant improvement in the overall score for infant CPR (n = 206, p = 0.08). Data from the control site demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in mean score for adult CPR (n = 22, p = 0.02), but not for adult compressions (N = 18, p = 0.39) or ventilations (n = 17, p = 0.08). No statistically significant difference in improvement of mean scores was found between the grouped adopter sites and the control site. The effect of the duration of the RQI curriculum on CPR performance appeared to be minimal in this data set. Compliance with the RQI curriculum varied by site, one site maintained hospital compliance at 90% over a 1 year period, however compliance reduced over time at all sites. CONCLUSIONS: This data demonstrated an increased adherence with guidelines for high-quality CPR post-training with the RQI cart, for all adult and most infant measures, but not infant CPR. However, the relationship between a formalised quarterly RQI curriculum and improvements in resuscitation skills is not clear. It is also unclear whether the RQI approach is superior to the current classroom-based BLS training for CPR skill acquisition in the UK. Further research is required to establish how to optimally implement the RQI system in the UK and how to optimally improve hospital wide compliance with CPR training to improve the outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrests.","output":"The assessment of a manikin-based low-dose, high-frequency cardiac resuscitation quality improvement program in early UK adopter hospitals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present three unusual cases of atypical scrotal lesions in children.

Serological immunoglobulin tests may help to better understand the development of immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 cases and exposed but asymptomatic individuals. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to SARS-CoV-2, symptoms, and antibody responses in a large sample of healthcare workers following a COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A COVID-19 outbreak among staff members of a major German children's and women's hospital was followed by massive RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests and provided the opportunity to study symptoms, chains of infection, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses (IgG and IgA) by ELISA. Study participants were classified as COVID-19 cases, and persons with close, moderate, or no exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical setting, respectively. RESULTS: Out of 201 study participants, 31 were COVID-19 cases. While most study participants experienced many symptoms indicative for SARS-CoV-2 infection, anosmia and coughing were remarkably more frequent in COVID-19 cases. Approximately 80% of COVID-19 cases developed some specific antibody response (IgA and IgG) approximately 3 weeks after onset of symptoms. Subjects in the non-COVID-19 groups had also elevated IgG (1.8%) and IgA values (7.6%) irrespective of contact history with cases. CONCLUSION: We found that a significant number of diseased did not develop relevant antibody responses three weeks after symptom onset.

This salutary effect is mediated by antioxidant activity as well transcriptional modulation by AA. HCT recipients are deficient in AA, therefore we evaluated the safety and efficacy of patients receiving parenteral AA after myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic HCT compared to similarly treated historical controls who did not receive AA. Methods: Patients with hematologic malignancies, AML (48% of patients), ALL (28%), and CML+MDS (25%) were enrolled in an IRB approved prospective phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03613727). IV AA 50 mg/kg/d divided in 3 doses was given on days 1-14 after HCT, followed by oral AA 500 mg bid from day 15 until 6 months post HCT (FDA-IND 138924). Conditioning regimens utilized included;fludarabine & melphalan (45%), cyclophosphamide with either busulfan (30%) or total body irradiation (25%). GVHD prophylaxis included calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate or cellcept along with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Primary endpoint was reduction in TRM at 1 year. Propensity score matching was used for matching study patients with similarly treated historical controls, matching for diagnosis, conditioning regimen, and CIBMTR disease risk category for comparison of clinical outcomes. Cox-proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (AHR) between the time-to-event outcomes and study group, adjusted for patient age, donor type, stem cell source, diagnosis, conditioning regimen, and CIBMTR disease risk. Results of an interim analysis following a period of COVID 19 mandated suspension of study accrual are reported. Results: As of March 2020, 40 patients have received IV AA: these include HLA-matched related donor (MRD;n=11), and either 10/10 or 9/10 HLA- matched unrelated donor (MUD;n=22 & 7 respectively) recipients. Graft source was either peripheral blood (n=38) or bone marrow (n=2);88% patients had CIBMTR high risk disease. Median age was 55 years;males (19). All patients enrolled were deficient in AA at day 0, median AA level 0.3 mg/dL (range: 0.1-0.5);post AA infusion level was normal at 1.6 (1.2-5.7) on day 14. Median neutrophil and platelet recovery was by 12 days (range: 9-15 & 8-21 days respectively) with sustained donor engraftment. Median absolute CD3+ cell count at day 30 was 330 cells/microL. With a median follow up of 220 days in AA recipients, no statistically significant difference was observed in transplant related mortality between propensity matched historical controls and study patients (AHR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.5;p-value = 0.27);univariate survival analysis is depicted in Figure 1. Relapse was also similar (AHR 1.2, 95% CI: 0.3-4.5;p-value = 0.82), and despite a larger number of HLA mismatched unrelated donor recipients, acute GVHD (Grade II-IV) rates were similar in the two groups for both grade II-IV (AHR 0.8, 95% CI: 0.7-1.7;p-value = 0.65) and grade III-IV disease (AHR 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.6;p-value = 0.32). Chronic GVHD rates were also similar (AHR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.1-2.7;p-value = 0.74). There are no attributable grade 3 - 4 toxicities from AA;CMV and EBV reactivation rates were not different in the two groups. Conclusions: In patients undergoing myeloablative allogeneic HCT the administration of IV ascorbic acid is safe and does not negatively impact myeloid engraftment or immune reconstitution. In this interim analysis, transplant related mortality, relapse and GVHD are not increased in IV AA recipients compared to historical controls. Thus, given its safety and tolerability, and possible salutary impact on survival and relapse in these high-risk patients, we posit the feasibility of a randomized phase 3 trial with IV AA in the post-transplant setting to determine its effect on relapse and TRM.

Studies from five databases were screened: PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), IEEE Xplore, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Data from studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were extracted and synthesized narratively. RESULTS: Out of 417 citations retrieved, 53 studies were included in this review. Most research focused on influenza-like illnesses or COVID-19 with at least three papers on other epidemics (Ebola, Zika or measles). The geographic scope ranged from global to concentrating on specific countries. Multiple processing and analysis methods were reported, although often missing relevant information. The majority of outcomes are reported for two application areas: crisis communication and detection of disease outbreaks. CONCLUSIONS: For most diseases, the small number of studies prevented reaching firm conclusions about the utility of PHI in detecting and monitoring these disease outbreaks. For others, e.g., COVID-19, social media and online search patterns corresponded to disease patterns, and detected disease outbreak earlier than conventional public health methods, thereby suggesting that PHI can contribute to disease and pandemic monitoring.","output":"Role of Participatory Health Informatics in Detecting and Managing Pandemics: Literature Review"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) systems in the inpatient setting is considered investigational. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether RT-CGM, using the glucose telemetry system (GTS), can prevent hypoglycemia in the general wards. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for hypoglycemia were recruited. Participants were randomized to RT-CGM/GTS or point-of-care (POC) blood glucose testing. The primary outcome was difference in inpatient hypoglycemia. RESULTS: Seventy-two participants were included in this interim analysis, 36 in the RT-CGM/GTS group and 36 in the POC group. The RT-CGM/GTS group experienced fewer hypoglycemic events (<70 mg/dL) per patient (0.67 [95% CI 0.34C1.30] vs. 1.69 [1.11C2.58], P = 0.024), fewer clinically significant hypoglycemic events (<54 mg/dL) per patient (0.08 [0.03C0.26] vs. 0.75 [0.51C1.09], P = 0.003), and a lower percentage of time spent below range <70 mg/dL (0.40% [0.18C0.92%] vs. 1.88% [1.26C2.81%], P = 0.002) and <54 mg/dL (0.05% [0.01C0.43%] vs. 0.82% [0.47C1.43%], P = 0.017) compared with the POC group. No differences in nocturnal hypoglycemia, time in range 70C180 mg/dL, and time above range >180C250 mg/dL and >250 mg/dL were found between the groups. The RT-CGM/GTS group had no prolonged hypoglycemia compared with 0.20 episodes <54 mg/dL and 0.40 episodes <70 mg/dL per patient in the POC group. CONCLUSIONS: RT-CGM/GTS can decrease hypoglycemia among hospitalized high-risk insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.","output":"Reducing Inpatient Hypoglycemia in the General Wards Using Real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring: The Glucose Telemetry System, a Randomized Clinical Trial"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementation of Master Data Management (MDM) in an organization aims to help the process of consolidating and integrating various sources of master data into a solitary truth source.

Aiming to \\"flatten the curve\\" a strict Movement Control Order (MCO) was implemented in Malaysia. Older adults with cognitive frailty are prone to physical, cognitive and psychosocial decline. This study aims to compare physical activity patterns, psychological wellbeing and coping strategies of older persons with cognitive frailty in the \\"WE-RISE\\" trial (intervention versus control) throughout this period. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted as a sub-analysis of the ongoing \\"WE-RISE\\" randomized controlled trial. This study included 42 community-dwelling older adults, aged 60 years and above, with cognitive frailty, stratified into intervention (n=21) and control (n=21) groups who are receiving a multi-domain intervention and usual care, respectively, within the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Phone call interviews were conducted during the MCO period. Physical activity patterns were assessed using International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychological wellbeing was assessed using Flourishing Scale (FS) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) assessed coping strategies. Data were analysed descriptively and with independent samples t-test. Results: The WE-RISE intervention group had significantly higher levels of estimated resting energy expenditure (MET) for \\"walking activity\\" (I:=1723.1780.7;C:=537.4581.9)(p<0.001), \\"moderate activity\\" (I:=1422.81215.1;C:=405.7746.9)(p=0.002) and \\"total physical activity\\" (I: =3625.93399.3;C:=994.61193.9)(p=0.002). The intervention group was also significantly more independent in functional activities (=1.761.73) as compared to the control group (=5.578.31) (p<0.05). Moreover, significant higher self-perception of living a meaningful life and feeling respected (p<0.05) was demonstrated in regard to psychological well-being in the intervention group. Regarding coping strategies, the intervention group relied significantly on the domains of religion (I:=6.430.99;C:=6.091.09)(p<0.05) and planning (I:=4.810.75; C:=4.041.28)(p<0.05) whilst the control group relied on humour (C:=3.141.19; I:=2.380.74)(p<0.05). Conclusion: Participants of the WE-RISE intervention group were more physically active, functionally independent and had higher self-perceived social-psychological prosperity regarding living a meaningful life and feeling respected; whilst both groups relied on positive coping strategies during the MCO.

However, when not properly regulated, NETs have the potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA), and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter 2 are specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute-phase reactants, including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count.

One of the sources of compounds with potential antiviral activity is Traditional Chinese Medicinal (TCM) plants used in China in the supportive treatment of COVID-19. Reynoutria japonica is important part of the Shu Feng Jie Du Granule/Capsule-TCM herbal formula, recommended by China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) for treatment of patients with H1N1- and H5N9-induced acute lung injury and is also used in China to treat COVID-19, mainly combined with other remedies. In our study, 25 compounds from rhizomes of R. japonica and Reynoutria sachalinensis (related species), were docked into the binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Next, 11 of them (vanicoside A, vanicoside B, resveratrol, piceid, emodin, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, procyanidin B2, procyanidin C1, procyanidin B2 3,3-di-O-gallate) as well as extracts and fractions from rhizomes of R. japonica and R. sachalinensis were tested in vitro using a fluorescent peptide substrate. Among the tested phytochemicals the best results were achieved for vanicoside A and vanicoside B with moderate inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, IC(50) = 23.10 M and 43.59 M, respectively. The butanol fractions of plants showed the strongest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (IC(50) = 4.031 g/mL for R. sachalinensis and IC(50) = 7.877 g/mL for R. japonica). As the main constituents of butanol fractions, besides the phenylpropanoid disaccharide esters (e.g., vanicosides), are highly polymerized procyanidins, we suppose that they could be responsible for their strong inhibitory properties. As inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 main protease could prevent the replication of the virus our research provides data that may explain the beneficial effects of R. japonica on COVID-19 and identify the most active compounds worthy of more extensive research.","output":"Reynoutria Rhizomes as a Natural Source of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro InhibitorsCMolecular Docking and In Vitro Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Wire-bending skills is commonly taught through live demonstrations (LD) though flipped classroom (FC) method has gained popularity. Continuous formative assessment promotes personalised learning via closely monitored progress, with the identification of students strengths and weaknesses. This study aims to evaluate the effects of LD and FC teaching methods, supplemented with continuous formative assessment, on dental students learning of wire-bending skills for six types of removable orthodontic appliance components. A deeper understanding of the relative effectiveness between LD and FC teaching methods can help identify the most appropriate method to achieve student learning objectives, which is especially important given the current Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Forty third-year undergraduate dental students were randomly assigned into FC (n = 20) or LD (n = 20) cohort. Each student attended six teaching sessions, each to teach students competency in fabricating one type of wire component, for a total competency in fabricating six wire components over the course of six teaching sessions. Either LD or FC teaching methods were used. After each session, wire assignments had to be submitted. Wire assignments were then evaluated using a blinded wire-bending assessment protocol. As part of their formative assessment, the assessment results were distributed to students, lecturers, and technicians before the next session. After the first session (T0) and at the end of all six sessions (T1), students completed a self-reported questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean wire-bending scores for FC were significantly higher than LD for two of the six assignments, namely the Adams clasp (p < 0.01) and Z-spring (p = 0.03). Scores for both LD and FC increased significantly over time, which may be attributed to formative assessment. There was no statistically significant correlation between wire-bending scores and video usage. Students were satisfied with both teaching methods, according to T0 and T1 questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Both LD and FC are equally effective in transferring practical orthodontic wire-bending skills and well-received by students. Continuous formative assessment may have enhanced students learning of orthodontic wire-bending skills. Further studies with control group are recommended to investigate the effect of formative assessment on teaching practical dental skills.","output":"The effect of live demonstration and flipped classroom with continuous formative assessment on dental students orthodontic wire-bending performance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"About 5 million Americans require a blood transfusion each year, needed for acute blood loss, surgery, hemophilia or cancer.

The extent of papaverine-induced suppression of viral growth was dependent on drug dose and treatment regimen. Cells progressively recovered their viral permissive state after removal of drug. The cyclic nucleotide, cGMP, nullified the inhibitory effect of papaverine if added to cells during drug treatment. Pulse labeling experiments with [35S]methionine showed that papaverine compromises production of all virus-specific proteins in infected cells without adversely affecting host cell protein synthesis. Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP.","output":"Inhibitory effect of papaverine on RNA and protein synthesis of vesicular stomatitis virus"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 pandemic has spawned numerous dynamic modeling attempts aimed at estimation, prediction, and ultimately control.

We estimated the savings in CO 2 emissions of an international cohort of master's students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University MPH programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. We estimated the aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students reside, and subtracted the per capita emissions for the country of origin from the per capita emissions for the UK over the time that the student would have spent in Manchester as a full-time student, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO 2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO 2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO 2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK. The saving by this small cohort of nearly a million kg of CO 2 emissions through not attending university in-person offers an indication of the potential environmental benefits of offering university education online to overseas students.","output":"Comparing carbon emissions between online and in-person study for a cohort of overseas students: A retrospective cohort study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 severity is disproportionately high in the elderly and people with comorbidities.

We aimed at comparing work-matched high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) on aerobic performance and muscular plasticity markers in healthy rats. Cognitive functions and brain plasticity markers were also investigated following the 8-week training. Rats performed the incremental exercise test and behavioural tests before and after training at day 1 (D1), D15, D29 and D57. Key cerebral markers were assessed by Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to provide information on brain function related to angiogenesis, aerobic metabolism and neurotrophin activity at D59. Muscular protein levels involved in angiogenesis and aerobic metabolism were measured in both triceps brachii and soleus muscles. HIIT induced superior improvement of aerobic fitness compared to MICT, as indicated by enhancement of speed associated with lactate threshold (SLT) and maximal speed (Smax). In the triceps brachii muscle, markers of angiogenesis and aerobic activity were upregulated as well as myokines involved in neuroplasticity. Moreover, levels of key brain plasticity markers increased in the hippocampus after 8 weeks of HIIT, without improving cognitive functions. These findings might contribute to define physical exercise guidelines for maintaining brain health by highlighting the promising role of HIIT when using SLT for distinguishing low running speed from high running speed.

The structural characteristics of reception centres create many challenges in the implementation of measures to contrast the diffusion of the virus, putting refugees and asylum seekers (RAS) even more at risk. For these reasons, we carried out a qualitative study to analyze the impact of the syndemic on the health of RAS who reside in reception facilities in Bologna (one of the cities with the highest number of migrants in Italy) and the measures that were introduced to contrast the diffusion of Sars-CoV-2. METHODS: Between April and September 2020, we interviewed 25 professionals and volunteers who were critical in the management of the COVID-19 epidemic in reception centres. Key-informants were selected through a snowball sampling process and covered various professions (i.e. doctors, nurses, social workers, psychologists, cultural mediators, anthropologists, lawyers). The semi-structured interviews explored the consequences of COVID-19 on the health of RAS living in reception centres, the measures implemented to contrast the diffusion of the epidemic and the challenges that interviewees had in handling the emergency. After transcription, the interviews were analyzed using deductive and inductive approaches. RESULTS: All key-informants agreed to participate in the study. Even though various measures were implemented in reception centres (i.e. mass quarantine, supply of personal protective equipment, risk communication campaigns and specific governance tools) they often had a discriminatory approach towards migrants and only considered the biomedical aspects of COVID-19, excluding its social roots and repercussions. This factor, together with the lack of an effective governance system at both the local and the national level, was the most relevant issue associated with the management of the syndemic in reception facilities and affected all the social determinants that shape the health profile of RAS. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed the importance of social factors in the management of the syndemic in reception centres. It also highlighted how the underlying causes of the impact of COVID-19 are tightly correlated to the political and social approaches of local and national institutions to migration. In order to guarantee the well-being of society as a whole and successfully control the epidemic, it is necessary to consider migration as a human reality rather than an emergency, and demolish all the policies and bureaucratic systems that act as structural violence on RAS. This process brings into play different levels of responsibility and many action plans. We need to develop intersectoral collaborations for more holistic and interconnected practices, while investing the resources to build a worthy reception system and effective social protection programs. This way it will be possible to develop more inclusive approaches to public health and guarantee the conditions for RAS' empowerment.","output":"Health equity during COVID-19: A qualitative study on the consequences of the syndemic on refugees and asylum seekers health in reception centres in Bologna (Italy)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 epidemic has been going on continuously for more than 1.5 years.

According to our data, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the examined population equaled 14.7%; however, large differences were observed depending on where the sampling point was located: as much as 50.3% of positive results for samples collected at a stationary point, 36.2% for samples from inpatients and hospital staff, and only 8.9% for samples from patients whose test was paid by their employer.

Men were examined more often, but it was among women that a higher percentage of infection was recorded. Every fifth test was performed for a foreigner, but compared to Poles, a much lower incidence of infection was found in these samples.

RESULTS: The number of patients with procedure requests decreased 20.8%, from 26,789 in 2019 to 21,162 in 2020. Patients aged 36-50 and >65a??years, those speaking non-English languages, those with Medicare or no insurance, and those living >a??100 miles away had disproportionately larger decreases. Requested procedures had significantly increased adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of not being scheduled for patients with primary languages other than English, Spanish, or Cantonese (aOR 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.28); unpartnered marital status (aOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.37); uninsured or self-pay (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.53-2.70). Significantly longer wait times were seen for patients aged 36-65a??years; with Medi-Cal insurance; from ZIP codes with lower incomes; and from ZIP codes >a??100 miles away. CONCLUSIONS: Patient access to elective surgeries decreased during the pandemic recovery phase with disparities based on patient age, language, marital status, insurance, socioeconomic status, and distance from care. Steps to address modifiable disparities have been taken.","output":"Pandemic Recovery: Persistent Disparities in Access to Elective Surgical Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: South Africa reported a notable increase in COVID-19 cases from mid-November, 2021, onwards, starting in Tshwane District, which coincided with the rapid community spread of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) variant. This increased infection rate coincided with a rapid increase in paediatric COVID-19-associated admissions to hospital (hereafter referred to as hospitalisations). METHODS: The Tshwane Maternal-Child COVID-19 study is a multicentre observational study in which we investigated the clinical manifestations and outcomes of paediatric patients (aged 19 years) who had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to hospital for any reason in Tshwane District during a 6-week period at the beginning of the fourth wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in South Africa. We used five data sources, which were: (1) COVID-19 line lists; (2) collated SARS-CoV-2 testing data; (3) SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing data; (4) COVID-19 hospitalisation surveillance; and (5) clinical data of public sector COVID-19-associated hospitalisations among children aged 13 years and younger. FINDINGS: Between Oct 31 and Dec 11, 2021, 6287 children and adolescents in Tshwane District were recorded as having COVID-19. During this period, 2550 people with COVID-19 were hospitalised, of whom 462 (18%) were aged 19 years or younger. The number of paediatric cases was higher than in the three previous SARS-CoV-2 waves, uncharacteristically increasing ahead of adult hospitalisations. 75 viral samples from adults and children in the district were sequenced, of which 74 (99%) were of the omicron variant. Detailed clinical notes were available for 138 (75%) of 183 children aged 13 years with COVID-19 who were hospitalised. 87 (63%) of 138 children were aged 0C4 years. In 61 (44%) of 138 cases COVID-19 was the primary diagnosis, among whom symptoms included fever (37 [61%] of 61), cough (35 [57%]), shortness of breath (19 [31%]), seizures (19 [31%]), vomiting (16 [26%]), and diarrhoea (15 [25%]). Median length of hospital stay was 2 days [IQR 1C3]). 122 (88%) of 138 children with available data needed standard ward care and 27 (20%) needed oxygen therapy. Seven (5%) of 138 children were ventilated and four (3%) died during the study period, all related to complex underlying copathologies. All children and 77 (92%) of 84 parents or guardians with available data were unvaccinated to COVID-19. INTERPRETATION: Rapid increases in paediatric COVID-19 cases and hospitalisations mirror high community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant in Tshwane District, South Africa. Continued monitoring is needed to understand the long-term effect of the omicron variant on children and adolescents.

Few data exist on the level of access to CR after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and the factors affecting the probability of timely access to CR after SAVR have never been empirically investigated. This study aims at estimating the proportion of SAVR patients who initiated timely CR and understanding to what extent timely access to CR for SAVR patients is influenced by specific characteristics of patients and hospitals. METHODS We conducted a real-world, retrospective, population-based study by identifying from the Italian National Hospital Discharge Records all the discharged alive SAVR patients who accessed timely CR from 2009-2016. Two different cutoffs for timely access were considered, i.e. one and 21 days after discharge. A unique dataset was constructed by merging several data sources. Multiple logistic regressions were performed to identify the factors influencing the probability to access to timely CR. FINDINGS 107,545 patients underwent SAVR in Italy from 2009-2016 and were discharged alive. Overall, 71,593 SAVR patients (66.6%) accessed timely CR, with an increasing trend over time. Additional 6,149 patients (5.7%) started CR from 2-21 days after discharge, slightly decreasing over time. The probability of timely CR (one-day cutoff) was significantly higher in older (OR=1.025, p<0.001) female patients (OR = 1.003, p<0.05) and patients with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular comorbidities. Presence of rehabilitation wards and number of rehabilitation beds in the index hospital significantly increased the probability of timely access to CR (OR = 1.105, p<0.001 and OR = 1.006, p<0.001 respectively). Patients hospitalized in private teaching hospitals had the highest predicted probability of timely CR after SAVR. A substantial variation in access to CR was found across Italian regions. Similar results were obtained with the alternative 21-days cutoff. IMPLICATIONS Approximately one-third of SAVR patients did not benefit from CR in Italy, mainly due to shortness of rehabilitation facilities, with relevant disparities across the country. The cessation of CR services during the COVID-19 pandemic provides the opportunity to re-think and innovate CR, shifting from center-based to home-based models. Digital health technologies can supplement traditional health services and grant safe, effective, and equitable access to care, especially for countries with insufficient rehabilitation bed capacity. As CR is associated with better outcomes, we recommend decision-makers to use our results to plan adequate healthcare services, also investing in digital health, to ensure patients' access to cost-effective care.","output":"How to Reduce Inequity of Access to Cardiac Rehabilitation After Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

To better cope with epidemics and pandemics, early emotional guidance should be provided based on an understanding of the status of public emotions in the given circumstances. From January 27 to February 11, 2020 (during which the cases of COVID-19 were increasing), a national online survey of the Chinese public was conducted. A total of 132,482 respondents completed a bespoke questionnaire, the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire (BEQ). Results showed that at the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, 53.0% of the Chinese population reported varying degrees of fear, mostly mild. As seen from regression analysis, for individuals who were unmarried and with a relatively higher educational level, living in city or area with fewer confirmed cases, cognitive reappraisal, positive expressivity and negative inhibition were the protective factors of fear. For participants being of older age, female, a patient or medical staff member, risk perception, negative expressivity, positive impulse strength and negative impulse strength were the risk factors for fear. The levels of fear and avoidant behavior tendencies were risk factors for disturbed physical function. Structural equation modeling suggested that fear emotion had a mediation between risk perception and escape behavior and physical function disturbance. The findings help to reveal the public emotional status at the early stage of the pandemic based on a large Chinese sample, allowing targeting of the groups that most need emotional guidance under crisis.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop and clinically validate an adaptable, personalized diagnostic model to assist clinicians in ruling in and ruling out COVID-19 in potential patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of probabilistic, graphical, and machine learning models against a previously published benchmark model. METHODS: We integrated patient symptoms and test data using machine learning and Bayesian inference to quantify individual patient risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We trained models with 100,000 simulated patient profiles based on 13 symptoms and estimated local prevalence, imaging, and molecular diagnostic performance from published reports. We tested these models with consecutive patients who presented with a COVID-19Ccompatible illness at the University of California San Diego Medical Center over the course of 14 days starting in March 2020. RESULTS: We included 55 consecutive patients with fever (n=43, 78%) or cough (n=42, 77%) presenting for ambulatory (n=11, 20%) or hospital care (n=44, 80%). In total, 51% (n=28) were female and 49% (n=27) were aged <60 years. Common comorbidities included diabetes (n=12, 22%), hypertension (n=15, 27%), cancer (n=9, 16%), and cardiovascular disease (n=7, 13%). Of these, 69% (n=38) were confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 20% (n=11) had repeated negative nucleic acid testing and an alternate diagnosis. Bayesian inference network, distance metric learning, and ensemble models discriminated between patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and alternate diagnoses with sensitivities of 81.6%-84.2%, specificities of 58.8%-70.6%, and accuracies of 61.4%-71.8%. After integrating imaging and laboratory test statistics with the predictions of the Bayesian inference network, changes in diagnostic uncertainty at each step in the simulated clinical evaluation process were highly sensitive to location, symptom, and diagnostic test choices.

Moreover, the biotechnological exploitation of RNAi offers therapeutic potential for a range of diseases for which drugs are currently unavailable. Unfortunately, the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that are central to RNAi in the cytoplasm are readily degradable by ubiquitous nucleases, are inefficiently targeted to desired organs and cell types, and are excreted quickly upon systemic injection. As a result, local administration techniques have been favored over the past few years, resulting in great success in the treatment of viral infections and other respiratory disorders. Because there are several advantages of pulmonary delivery over systemic administration, two of the four siRNA drugs currently in phase II clinical trials are delivered intranasally or by inhalation. The air-blood barrier, however, has only limited permeability toward large, hydrophilic biopharmaceuticals such as nucleic acids; in addition, the lung imposes intrinsic hurdles to efficient siRNA delivery. Thus, appropriate formulations and delivery devices are very much needed. Although many different formulations have been optimized for in vitro siRNA delivery to lung cells, only a few have been reported successful in vivo. In this Account, we discuss both obstacles to pulmonary siRNA delivery and the success stories that have been achieved thus far. The optimal pulmonary delivery vehicle should be neither cytotoxic nor immunogenic, should protect the payload from degradation by nucleases during the delivery process, and should mediate the intracellular uptake of siRNA. Further requirements include the improvement of the pharmacokinetics and lung distribution profiles of siRNA, the extension of lung retention times (through reduced recognition by macrophages), and the incorporation of reversible or stimuli-responsive binding of siRNA to allow for efficient release of the siRNAs at the target site. In addition, the ideal carrier would be biodegradable (to address difficulties with repeated administration for the treatment of chronic diseases) and would contain targeting moieties to enhance uptake by specific cell types. None of the currently available polymer- and lipid-based formulations meet every one of these requirements, but we introduce here several promising new approaches, including a biodegradable, nonimmunogenic polyester. We also discuss imaging techniques for following the biodistribution according to the administration route. This tracking is crucial for better understanding the translocation and clearance of nanoformulated siRNA subsequent to pulmonary delivery. In the literature, the success of pulmonary siRNA delivery is evaluated solely by relief from or prophylaxis against a disease; side effects are not studied in detail. It also remains unclear which cell types in the lung eventually take up siRNA. These are critical issues for the translational use of pulmonary siRNA formulations; accordingly, we present a flow cytometry technique that can be utilized to differentiate transfected cell populations in a mouse model that expresses transgenic enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP). This technique, in which different cell types are identified on the basis of their surface antigen expression, may eventually help in the development of safer carriers with minimized side effects in nontargeted tissues.","output":"Nonviral pulmonary delivery of siRNA."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Personal protective equipment (PPE) used by healthcare workers was scarce during the COVID-19 pandemic.

It was postulated that estrogens may play a role in reducing the severity of the disease and may therefore offer a treatment option for COVID-19 patients. However, more female cases and deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded in Canada. To determine the potential role of estrogens, we analyzed COVID-19 data from Canada, focusing on the impact of sex and age. Although the overall incidence rate is higher in females than in males, when several high risk groups, including health care workers and long-term care residences, which are predominantly females, were excluded, we found that females had a lower incidence rate than males between the ages of 20s to 70s. Interestingly, this sex-based difference is more evident in females of the reproductive ages (20C49) than in postmenopausal patients (60s or older). Males have significantly higher hospitalization, ICU admission, and case fatality rates; however, a greater difference was observed in the older age groups. Finally, symptom manifestation varied between sexes. Some of the symptoms, which were more frequently observed in patients who recovered than patients who died, were more commonly observed in females of the reproductive age compared to their male counterparts. Since only females of the reproductive age have much higher circulating estrogens than males, these findings suggest that estrogens may play a role in reducing COVID-19 incidence and in the development of symptoms, especially those related to better survival.","output":"Incidence, clinical features, and outcomes of COVID-19 in Canada: impact of sex and age"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This paper reports the methodology for undertaking a randomized controlled trial to assess the combined effect of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and activity pacing on fatigue experienced by breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

It is important to take into account the geometric structure of manifolds in statistical analysis to avoid misleading results. Although there has been a considerable focus on simple and specific manifolds, there is a lack of general and easy-to-implement statistical methods for density estimation and modeling on manifolds. In this article, we consider a very broad class of manifolds: non-compact Riemannian symmetric spaces. For this class, we provide a very general mathematical result for easily calculating volume changes of the exponential and logarithm map between the tangent space and the manifold. This allows one to define statistical models on the tangent space, push these models forward onto the manifold, and easily calculate induced distributions by Jacobians. To illustrate the statistical utility of this theoretical result, we provide a general method to construct distributions on symmetric spaces. In particular, we define the log-Gaussian distribution as an analogue of the multivariate Gaussian distribution in Euclidean space. With these new kernels on symmetric spaces, we also consider the problem of density estimation. Our proposed approach can use any existing density estimation approach designed for Euclidean spaces and push it forward to the manifold with an easy-to-calculate adjustment. We provide theorems showing that the induced density estimators on the manifold inherit the statistical optimality properties of the parent Euclidean density estimator; this holds for both frequentist and Bayesian nonparametric methods. We illustrate the theory and practical utility of the proposed approach on the space of positive definite matrices.","output":"Density estimation and modeling on symmetric spaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become severe threats to economic, societal, and healthcare systems.

Two new technologies C pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) and Big Data analytics C promise to improve our capacity to detect and control outbreaks earlier, saving lives and resources. However, routinely using these technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information could be perceived as intrusive and a threat to privacy. METHOD: making pathogen WGS and linked administrative data available for public health research; using this information in concert with data linkage and machine learning to enhance communicable disease surveillance systems. Fifty participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited by random-digit-dialling and topic-blinded social-media advertising. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence supporting different expert perspectives on the potential benefits and costs of technologically enhanced public health research and communicable disease surveillance and given the opportunity to question experts. RESULTS: Almost all jurors supported data linkage and WGS on routinely collected patient isolates for the purposes of public health research, provided standard de-identification practices were applied. However, allowing this information to be operationalised as a syndromic surveillance system was highly contentious with three juries voting in favour, and one against by narrow margins. For those in favour, support depended on several conditions related to system oversight and security being met. Those against were concerned about loss of privacy and did not trust Australian governments to run secure and effective systems. CONCLUSIONS: Participants across all four events strongly supported the introduction of data linkage and pathogenomics to public health research under current research governance structures. Combining pathogen WGS with event-based data surveillance systems, however, is likely to be controversial because of a lack of public trust, even when the potential public health benefits are clear.

RECENT FINDINGS: As documented in other settings, racial bias appears to operate in HF providers' consideration of patients for advanced therapy. Multiple medical and psychosocial elements of the evaluation process are particularly vulnerable to bias.

A number of studies before the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that the primary caregivers of the ED patients are subjected to great burden, psychological pressure, and serious emotional problems. This study aimed to investigate the psychological distress level of the primary caregivers of ED offspring during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From March 6 to April 20, 2020, 378 questionnaires for primary caregivers of ED offspring and 1163 questionnaires for primary caregivers of healthy offspring were collected through an online crowdsourcing platform in mainland China. Valid questionnaires that met the criteria included 343 (90.74%) primary caregivers of ED offspring and 1085 (93.29%) primary caregivers of healthy offspring. Using Propensity Score Matching (PSM), 315 (83.33%) primary caregivers of ED offspring and 315 matched primary caregivers of healthy offspring were included in the statistical analysis. Depression, anxiety, perceived stress and social support were measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Perceived Stress Scale-10 and Social Support Rating Scale, respectively. RESULTS: The rates of depression and anxiety of the primary caregivers of ED offspring were 20.6 and 16.5%, which were significantly higher than those of primary caregivers of healthy offspring (4.1 and 2.2%), all P &lt; 0.001. Regression analysis found that perceived stress, social support, previous or present mental illness, family conflicts during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the severity of depression (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.041, P = 0.014);Perceived stress, social support, family conflicts during the COVID-19 pandemic and years of education had a significant impact on the severity of anxiety (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.002, P = 0.002, P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, primary caregivers of ED offspring experienced more psychological distress than that of primary caregivers of healthy offspring. ED caregivers with high perceived stress may have higher levels of depression and anxiety. ED caregivers with high social support, no mental illness and no family conflicts may have lower levels of depression.

METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated 15 children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children and adolescents from a single institution in Adana, Turkey. RESULTS: The patients presented in a seasonal distribution, with 73.3%: (11/15) presenting in winter or spring. The majority of patients (13/15, 86.7%) had a history of acute febrile illness 2 to 40 days before presentation, and five children had serologic evidence of specific triggers: mycoplasma (2 children), influenza-A (H1N1) (1 child), or Epstein-Barr virus. All children were treated with a standard protocol of 3 to 5 days of intravenous administration of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin for patients who continued to deteriorate. Oseltamivir and clarithromycin were administered in patients with influenza-A (H1N1) and mycoplasma according to the serology. In 13 patients, all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved after treatment. Only one patient was left with severe neurologic sequelae and another child had recurrent attacks and was ultimately diagnosed with possible multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: The present series demonstrates that acute disseminated encephalomyelitis in children occurs predominantly in winter or spring and often follows an upper respiratory tract illness for those along the southern coast of Anatolia (Mediterranean region).

Whenever there is a novel disease outbreak, the norm is to wait for the development of scientifically proven vaccines for its treatment. However, the scientific validation of drugs is a rigorous and lengthy process, thereby inappropriate for dealing with health emergencies like the COVID-19 outbreak. The alarming rapidity with which the novel COVID-19 pandemic rages globally and decimates humanity has brought to the fore the need for Africa to look inwards in search of viable and efficient alternative approaches to the pandemic. In this paper, I examine pragmatism as a theoretical framework and relate it to proposed African epistemic and validation frameworks with a particular reference to homegrown orthodox and alternative/complementary medicines. I argue that the validation and approval of any knowledge claim based on pragmatism is a more expeditious mode of attending to COVID-19 and other prevalent diseases in Africa. The application of knowledge that brings practical success in dealing with health challenges in Africa without necessarily following rigid and lengthy scientific validation procedures will go a long way toward improving human conditions and well-being.

We evaluated the impact of the NKG2C deletion on HIV-1 susceptibility, with or without HBV/HCV co-infection, in a total of 780 individuals, including 385 HIV-infected patients and 395 healthy blood donors.

In the current study, we synthesized a new naphthoquinolinedione-based probe (probe 1) to monitor Cu2+ in different water systems, such as tap water, lakes, and drain water. Two triazole units were introduced into the probe via a click reaction to increase the binding affinity to a metal ion. In day-light, probe 1 dissolved in a mixed solvent system (HEPES: EtOH = 1:4) showed a vivid color change from light greenish-yellow to pink in the presence of only Cu2+ among various metal ions. In addition, the green luminescence and fluorescence emission of the probe were effectively bleached out immediately after Cu2+ addition. The limit of detection (LOD) of the probe was 0.5 M when a ratio-metric method was used for metal ion detection. The fluorescence titration data of the probe with Cu2+ showed a calculated LOD of 41.5 pM. Hence, probe 1 possesses the following dual response toward Cu2+ detection: color change and fluorescence quenching. Probe 1 was also useful for detecting Cu2+ spiked in tap/lake water as well as the cytoplasm of live HeLa cells.

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Saudi Arabian University students and faculty members has received little attention. OBJECTIVE: To assess stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among university college students and faculty members of Jouf University, KSA and evaluate the impact of socio- demographic factors on anxiety and depression levels. METHODS: Two hundred and seventeen participants from Jouf University completed an anonymous web-based survey that includes questionnaires about anxiety and depression symptoms. Beck's anxiety inventory (BAI) was used to assess the anxiety levels, and Beck's depression inventory (BDI) was used to determine the depression levels due to COVID 19 pandemic. The research was carried out between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. An ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed to explain the odds of observing anxiety and depression. RESULTS: For \\"moderate anxiety\\" (22-35), the most frequently observed category of age, nationality, gender, duration spent in lockdown and profession was 20-30 years (na??=a??15, 65%), Saudis (na??=a??14, 61%), female (na??=a??15, 65%),>3 months (na??=a??17, 74%), and students (na??=a??15, 65%) respectively.

In the last 10 years, there have been major advances in understanding how cells recognize being infected by influenza viruses, leading to secretion of type I IFN, and on the effector mechanisms by how IFN exerts its antiviral activity. In addition, we also now know that influenza virus uses multiple mechanisms to attenuate the type I IFN response, allowing for successful infection of their hosts.

However, it is not clear whether testing for RNAaemia is correlated with the occurrence of cytokine storms or with the specific class of patients. METHODS: This study enrolled 48 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command, PLA, a designated hospital in Wuhan, China. The patients were divided into three groups according to the \\"Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Pneumonia (6th edition)\\" issued by the National Health Commission of China. The clinical and laboratory data were collected. The serum viral load and IL-6 levels were determined. . RESULTS: Clinical characteristics analysis of 48 cases of COVID-19 showed that RNAaemia was diagnosed only in the critically ill group and seemed to reflect the severity of the disease. Furthermore, the level of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in critically ill patients increased significantly, almost 10 times that in other patients. More importantly, the extremely high IL-6 level was closely correlated with the detection of RNAaemia (R = 0.902). CONCLUSIONS: Detectable serum SARS-Cov-2 RNA(RNAaemia) in COVID-19 patients was associated with elevated IL-6 concentration and poor prognosis. Because the elevated IL-6 may be part of a larger cytokine storm which could worsen outcome, IL-6 could be a potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients with an excessive inflammatory response.","output":"Detectable serum SARS-CoV-2 viral load (RNAaemia) is closely correlated with drastically elevated interleukin 6 (IL-6) level in critically ill COVID-19 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 67-year-old man with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma was initially treated with whole-brain radiotherapy for intracranial metastases, followed by chemotherapy and pembrolizumab.

Mutations of KCNQ1 genes that result in reduction or loss of channel activity cause prolongation of repolarization during action potential, thereby causing long QT syndrome (LQTs). Small molecule activators of KCNQ1/KCNE1 are useful both for understanding the mechanism of the complex activity and for developing therapeutics for LQTs. In this study we report that hexachlorophene (HCP), the active component of the topical anti-infective prescription drug pHisoHex, is a KCNQ1/KCNE1 activator. HCP potently increases the current amplitude of KCNQ1/KCNE1 expressed by stabilizing the channel in an open state with an EC(50) of 4.611.29 M. Further studies in cardiomyocytes showed that HCP significantly shortens the action potential duration at 1 M. In addition, HCP is capable of rescuing the loss of function of the LQTs mutants caused by either impaired activation gating or phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding affinity.

The COVID-19 pandemic, which reached Rwanda in March 2020, presented new and unique challenges for infectious disease control. The objective of this paper is to characterize Rwandas domestic response to the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight effective strategies so that other countries, including high and middle-income countries, can learn from its innovative initiatives. METHODS: Government publications describing Rwandas healthcare capacity were first consulted to obtain the countrys baseline context. Next, official government and healthcare system communications, including case counts, prevention and screening protocols, treatment facility practices, and behavioral guidelines for the public, were read thoroughly to understand the course of the pandemic in Rwanda and the specific measures in the response. RESULTS: As of 31 December 2020, Rwanda has recorded 8,383 cumulative COVID-19 cases, 6,542 recoveries, and 92 deaths since the first case on 14 March 2020. The Ministry of Health, Rwanda Biomedical Centre, and the Epidemic and Surveillance Response division have collaborated on preparative measures since the pandemic began in January 2020. The formation of a Joint Task Force in early March led to the Coronavirus National Preparedness and Response Plan, an extensive six-month plan that established a national incident management system and detailed four phases of a comprehensive national response. Notable strategies have included disseminating public information through drones, robots for screening and inpatient care, and official communications through social media platforms to combat misinformation and mobilize a cohesive response from the population.

As a result, there is keen interest to identify and increase glycan data in bioinformatics databases like ChEBI and PubChem, and connecting them to resources at the EMBL-EBI and NCBI to facilitate access to important annotations at a global level. GlyTouCan is a comprehensive archival database that contains glycans obtained primarily through batch upload from glycan repositories, glycoprotein databases, and individual laboratories. In many instances, the glycan structures deposited in GlyTouCan may not be fully defined or have supporting experimental evidence and citations. Databases like ChEBI and PubChem were designed to accommodate complete atomistic structures with well-defined chemical linkages. As a result, they cannot easily accommodate the structural ambiguity inherent in glycan databases. Consequently, there is a need to improve the organization of glycan data coherently to enhance connectivity across the major NCBI, EMBL-EBI, and glycoscience databases. This paper outlines a workflow developed in collaboration between GlyGen, ChEBI, and PubChem to improve the visibility and connectivity of glycan data across these resources. GlyGen hosts a subset of glycans (~29,000) from the GlyTouCan database and has submitted valuable glycan annotations to the PubChem database and integrated over 10,500 (including ambiguously defined) glycans into the ChEBI database.

There are contradictory reports of the association between catch-up growth in childhood and school age cognition. METHODS: A community-based birth cohort recruited between 2010 and 2012 from urban slums in Vellore, India was followed up until 9 years of age. From regular anthropometric measurements, stunting status for each individual child was calculated at 2, 5 and 9 years. Cognition was assessed at 9 years of age using the Malins Intelligence Scale for Indian Children (MISIC). Children were divided into groups based on stunting at each time point as well as catch-up growth, and a regression model was utilised to evaluate their association with cognition at 9 years. RESULTS: Among 203 children included in this analysis, 94/203 (46.31%) children were stunted at 2 years of age, of whom 39.36% had a catch-up growth at 5 years of age, and 38.30% at 9 years. Around 10% of the cohort remained stunted at all time points. In the multivariable analysis, children who were stunted at 2, 5 and 9 years had a significantly lower verbal and total intelligence quotient (IQ) scores by 4.6 points compared to those who were never stunted. Children with catch up growth following stunting at 2 years had higher cognition scores than those who were persistently stunted throughout the childhood. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed persistent stunting in childhood was associated with lowering of 4C5 IQ points in childhood cognition at 9 years of age.

METHODS: This is an observational, cross-sectional study, with data collection from October to December 2020 at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. The participants answered an online survey with questions on socioeconomic status, demographics, and food insecurity (Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale). A logistic regression model was constructed to investigate socioeconomic variables associated with food insecurity. RESULTS: Overall, 1327 volunteers participated in the study; 66.5% were undergraduates, 8.5% post-graduation students, 13.5% administrative staff, and 11.5% professors. Undergraduates presented a higher prevalence of African-Americans than the other studied groups (11.4% vs. 5.3% in post-graduation students, 5.0% in administrative servers, 3.9% professors, P = 0.004). 23.2% of the undergraduates presented an income up to the minimum wage vs. 1.8% in post-graduation students, 0.6% in administrative servers, and 0.0% in professors (P < 0.0005). More undergraduates and post-graduation students had more reduced family income during the pandemic than other groups (44.3% and 41.6%, respectively vs. 37.6% in administrative staff and 28.1% in professors, P < 0.0005). Food insecurity was more present in undergraduates (32.1% with mild food insecurity, 11.5% moderate and 4.8% severe), than in the other studied groups (post-graduation students: 25.7% mild, 2.7% moderate and 2.6% severe; administrative servers: 19% mild, 1.7% moderate, 0.0% severe; professors: 9.8% mild, 0.0% moderate or severe; P < 0.0005).

COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection-induced acute infectious disease, which is featured by universal susceptibility and strong infectivity, and SHS (a status of low quality health) refers to a status of low-quality health. COVID-19 has gradually developed into a global pandemic, making the public in a high stress situation in physiological, psychological and social states in the short term. METHODS From March 6 to 11, 2020, a large-scale cross-sectional survey was conducted by convenient sampling, and SHS assessment scale was used in the questionnaire. The ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors affecting SHS. RESULTS In this study, 17,078 questionnaires were delivered with 16,820 effective questionnaires collected, and 10,715 subjects (63.7%) were found with SHS, with moderate SHS primarily. Physiological sub-scale scored the highest, followed by psychological and social sub-scales. Ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that man, only-child, workers and farmers were risk factors of SHS. Protective factors of SHS included living in rural areas and townships, laid-off retirees and education degree. CONCLUSION It shows many people in China place in a poor health status during COVID-19 pandemic. It is necessary that relevant departments pay more attention to people with poor health such as men, only-child, urban people, workers and farmers, and groups with high education degree during and after pandemic stabilization.","output":"Sub-Health Status Survey and Influential Factor Analysis in Chinese during Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An animal's social behaviour both influences and changes in response to its parasites. Here we consider these bidirectional links between host social behaviours and parasite infection, both those that occur from ecological vs evolutionary processes. First, we review how social behaviours of individuals and groups influence ecological patterns of parasite transmission. We then discuss how parasite infection, in turn, can alter host social interactions by changing the behaviour of both infected and uninfected individuals. Together, these ecological feedbacks between social behaviour and parasite infection can result in important epidemiological consequences. Next, we consider the ways in which host social behaviours evolve in response to parasites, highlighting constraints that arise from the need for hosts to maintain benefits of sociality while minimizing fitness costs of parasites. Finally, we consider how host social behaviours shape the population genetic structure of parasites and the evolution of key parasite traits, such as virulence. Overall, these bidirectional relationships between host social behaviours and parasites are an important yet often underappreciated component of population-level disease dynamics and host-parasite coevolution.","output":"Bidirectional interactions between host social behaviour and parasites arise through ecological and evolutionary processes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Control of the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic requires accurate laboratory testing to identify infected individuals while also clearing essential staff to continue to work.

While the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is moderate, given the large number of transmission chains, it is prudent to monitor circulating viruses for variants that might compromise these assays. Here, we report the identification of a C-to-U transition at position 26340 of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that is associated with failure of the cobas SARS-CoV-2 E gene qRT-PCR in eight patients. As the cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay targets two positions in the genome, the individuals carrying this variant were still called SARS-CoV-2 positive. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 showed all to carry closely related viruses. Examination of viral genomes deposited on GISAID showed this mutation has arisen independently at least four times. This work highlights the necessity of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 for the emergence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms that might adversely affect RT-PCRs used in diagnostics.

Methods: Using insurance claims data, we identified 48,657 adults who underwent ACL reconstruction from 2010-2015, had prescription drug insurance and had 1 year of continuous insurance enrollment postoperatively. Chronic opioid use was defined as filling 120 days' supply from 3-12 months postoperatively. Logistic and linear regression, controlled for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index value, were used to determine associations of preoperative depression with binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. Results: Preoperatively, 2,237 patients (4.6%) had depression and 2,387 (4.9%) were taking opioids; patients with depression had 6.5 times the odds (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.8, 7.3) of taking opioids than patients without depression. Postoperatively, 25% of patients filled 1 opioid prescription; mean duration of use was 13  11 days, and 362 patients (0.7%) had chronic use. Patients with preoperative depression were less likely than patients without depression to fill an opioid prescription postoperatively (OR 0.2, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.2). Of patients who filled opioid prescriptions postoperatively, those with preoperative depression were more likely to refill that prescription at least once (OR 2.0, 95% CI: 1.9, 2.2) but did not have greater odds of chronic use (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.5, 1.5). Preoperative depression was not associated with greater cumulative opioid consumption from 3-12 months postoperatively ( = -40, 95% CI: -226, 146). Conclusion: Although patients with preoperative depression were more likely to take opioids preoperatively and to obtain 1 opioid refill postoperatively, they did not have greater odds of chronic postoperative opioid use or greater cumulative opioid consumption after ACL reconstruction.","output":"Associations Between Preoperative Depression and Opioid Use After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Concomitant Procedures."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has transformed the way we work, with many employees working under isolating and difficult conditions. However, research on the antecedents, consequences, and buffers of work loneliness is scarce. Integrating research on need for belonging, regulatory loop models of loneliness, and self-compassion, the current study addresses this critical issue by developing and testing a conceptual model that highlights how COVID-related stressors frustrate employees' need for belonging (i.e., telecommuting frequency, job insecurity, and a lack of COVID-related informational justice), negatively impacting worker well-being (i.e., depression) and helping behaviors [i.e., organizational citizenship behavior (OCB)] through work loneliness. Furthermore, we examine the buffering role of self-compassion in this process. Results from a weekly diary study of U.S. employees conducted over 2 months during the initial stage of the pandemic provide support for the mediating role of work loneliness in relations between all three proposed antecedents and both outcomes. In addition, self-compassion mitigated the positive within-person relationship between work loneliness and employee depression, indicating that more self-compassionate employees were better able to cope with their feelings of work loneliness. Although self-compassion also moderated the within-person relationship between work loneliness and OCB, this interaction was different in form from our prediction. Implications for enhancing employee well-being and helping behaviors during and beyond the pandemic are discussed.

We performed serial thromboelastography (TEG) and laboratory coagulation studies in 40 critically-ill, mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients over a 14-day period and analysed differences between 30-day survivors and non-survivors. METHODS: Single-center prospective, observational study including 40 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation. TEG analysis was performed on days 1, 7 and 14 of ICU admission and laboratory coagulation studies were performed on days 1 and 14. Coagulation variables were evaluated for change over the 14-day observation period. Differences between survivors and non-survivors at 30-days were analysed and compared. RESULTS: On admission, TEG maximum amplitude (MA) with heparinase correction was above the upper limit of the reference range in 32 (80%) patients while 33 (82.5%) presented with absent clot lysis at 30 min. The functional fibrinogen MA was also elevated above the upper limit of the reference range in 37 (92.5%) patients. All patients had elevated D-dimer and fibrinogen levels, mildly prolonged prothrombin times (PT), normal platelet counts and normal activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT). The heparinase MA decreased significantly with time and normalised after 14 days (p = < 0.001) while the increased fibrin contribution to clot strength persisted with time (p = 0.113). No significant differences in TEG analysis were noted between 30-day survivors and non-survivors at all time points. No patients developed disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) after 14-days, however thrombosis and bleeding were each reported in 3 (7.5%) patients. CONCLUSION: Critically-ill patients with COVID-19 present in a hypercoagulable state characterised by an increased clot strength. This state normalises after 14 days despite a persistently increased fibrin contribution to clot strength.

Determining such immunity may enhance knowledge about susceptibility of HCWs to COVID-19, frequency of vaccine administration, and degree of workplace risk, and may also support enactment of better workplace policies and procedures. The present study reports on 6-months follow-up serosurveillance to determine the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in HCWs. Sub-sample (n=35) of the original serosurveillance in HCWs (n = 3,458) with baseline, 8-week, and 6-month blood sampling were analyzed. Information on job duties, location, COVID-19 symptoms, polymerase chain reaction test history, travel since January 2020, and household contacts with COVID-19 was collected. Of 35 subjects, 13 were seropositive at baseline and maintained positivity at 8-week follow-up, with 3 losing positivity at 6-month follow-up. Among 22 subjects who were seronegative at baseline and seropositive at 8-week follow-up, all but one maintained positivity at 6-month follow-up. There was no significant effect of all factors (e.g., age, gender, job duties) examined at the .05 level on seropositivity at 6-month follow-up. The observed antibody longevity was 7.0+/-0.6 months for seropositive subjects (n=13), and 4.5+/-0.8 months for those seronegative subjects (n=22), at baseline. The longest duration of seropositivity observed in this cohort was 7.9 months (236 days). With reported COVID-19-related symptoms up to 4.7 months prior to baseline blood sampling, possibly longer antibody presence is suggested. Similarly, seropositivity at 6-month follow-up further suggests greater antibody longevity than observed in this study.","output":"Longevity of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody in Health Care Workers: 6-Months Follow Up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We investigate the class of languages recognized by permutation deterministic finite automata.

Machine learning provides a reliable approach for assessing the contribution of these changes to air quality. This study investigates impacts of health protection measures upon air pollution and traffic emissions and estimates health and economic impacts arising from these changes during two national lockdown periods in Oxford, UK. Air quality improvements were most marked during the first lockdown with reductions in observed NO(2) concentrations of 38% (SD  24.0%) at roadside and 17% (SD  5.4%) at urban background locations. Observed changes in PM(2.5,) PM(10) and O(3) concentrations were not significant during first or second lockdown. Deweathering and detrending analyses revealed a 22% (SD  4.4%) reduction in roadside NO(2) and 2% (SD  7.1%) at urban background with no significant changes in the second lockdown. Deweathered-detrended PM(2.5) and O(3) concentration changes were not significant, but PM(10) increased in the second lockdown only. City centre traffic volume reduced by 69% and 38% in the first and second lockdown periods. Buses and passenger cars were the major contributors to NO(2) emissions, with relative reductions of 56% and 77% respectively during the first lockdown, and less pronounced changes in the second lockdown. While car and bus NO(2) emissions decreased during both lockdown periods, the overall contribution from buses increased relative to cars in the second lockdown. Sustained NO(2) emissions reduction consistent with the first lockdown could prevent 48 lost life-years among the city population, with economic benefits of up to 2.5 million. Our findings highlight the critical importance of decoupling emissions changes from meteorological influences to avoid overestimation of lockdown impacts and indicate targeted emissions control measures will be the most effective strategy for achieving air quality and public health benefits in this setting.","output":"Impacts of emergency health protection measures upon air quality, traffic and public health: Evidence from Oxford, UK()"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a recently emerged disease with formidable infectivity and high mortality Emerging data suggest that diabetes is one of the most prevalent comorbidities in patients with COVID-19 Although their causal relationship has not yet been investigated, preexisting diabetes can be considered as a risk factor for the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 Proinflammatory state, attenuation of the innate immune response, possibly increased level of ACE2, along with vascular dysfunction, and prothrombotic state in people with diabetes probably contribute to higher susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection and worsened prognosis On the other hand, activated inflammation, islet damage induced by virus infection, and treatment with glucocorticoids could, in turn, result in impaired glucose regulation in people with diabetes, thus working as an amplification loop to aggravate the disease Therefore, glycemic management in people with COVID-19, especially in those with severe illness, is of considerable importance The insights may help to reduce the fatality in the effort against COVID-19 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of International Journal of Endocrinology is the property of Hindawi Limited and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Diabetes Mellitus and COVID-19: Associations and Possible Mechanisms"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Current classification and retrieval methods are affected by the amount of data in the classification of multimedia learning resources, and there are problems such as low classification accuracy, low retrieval rate, and long retrieval time.

Final-year medical students are one of the resources potentially available to expand the workforce. There is a need to explore the willingness of final-year medical students to meet this demand, examine their perceived competence, and determine how their overall perceived competence correlates with their willingness. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire was used. The questionnaire included demographic data, students self-perceived competence derived from the patient care theme of the Saudi Medical Education Directives (SaudiMED) framework, and their willingness to be measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The study targeted final-year medical students at King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: The number of participants was 134 (56.1% response rate), of whom 47 students (34.3%) were willing to work, while 31 (23.1%) were somewhat willing. The mean total self-perceived-competence score was 58.36/88 (66.3%). Demonstration of essential clinical skills had the highest mean score 11.48/16 (71.8%) among learning outcomes.

ResultsOut of 99 critically severe intubated patients we have observed good clinical progress/discharged from ICU in 52 (52.5%) patients. Where as 86 (77.5%) of 111 severe unintubated patients discharged from ICU. Intubated 47 (47.5%) patients and unintubated 25 (22.5%) patients pass away. Significantly higher survival was observed in patients who underwent UC-MSCs before intubation (OR=1.475, 95% CI=1.193-1.824 p<0.001). It was observed that the SaO 2 parameter tended to improve after UC-MSC therapy compared to all groups. But SaO 2 parameter between intubated and unintubated groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05), while in discharged cases SaO 2 parameter was statistically significant ( p = 0.01). Besides, there was a statistically significant relation with intubation status, age (OR= 3.868, 95% CI=0.574-7.152 p =0.02) and weigh (OR=6.768, 95% CI=3.423-10.112 p<0.001) thus presented an elevated risk for COVID-19. The linear regression analysis confirmed that the high weight was associated with the risk of intubation in COVID-19 ( p =0.001). Conclusions?According to our results and from recent studies, UC-MSC treatment is safe with high potential to be used as an added therapeutic treatment for severe COVID-19 patients. Our experience showed that UC-MSC therapy may restore oxygenation and downregulate cytokine storm in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. We advice wider randomised studies to discover the detailed therapeutic pathophysiology of the MSCs on COVID-19 patients.","output":"Clinical Experience on Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell Treatment in 210 Severe and Critical COVID-19 Cases in Turkey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Identification of immunogenic targets against hepatitis B virus (HBV)-encoded proteins will provide crucial advances in developing potential antibody therapies. In this study, 63 treatment-na?ve patients with chronic HBV infection and 46 patients who achieved hepatitis B surface antigen loss (sAg loss) following antiviral treatment were recruited. Moreover, six patients who transitioned from the hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic infection phase (eAg(+)CInf) to the hepatitis phase (eAg(+)CHep) were enrolled from real-life clinical practice. Additionally, telbivudine-treated eAg(+)CHep patients and relapsers or responders from an off-treatment cohort were longitudinally studied. The frequencies and function of B cells were assessed by flow cytometry. We devised a peptide array composed of 15-mer overlapping peptides of HBV-encoded surface (S), core (C), and polymerase (P) proteins and performed a screening on B-cell linear epitopes with sera. Na?ve B cells and plasmablasts were increased, whereas total memory, activated memory (AM), and atypical memory (AtM) B cells were reduced in sAg(-) patients compared with sAg(+) patients. Importantly, longitudinal observations found that AtM B cells were associated with successful treatment withdrawal. Interestingly, we identified six S-specific dominant epitopes (S33, S34, S45, S76, S78, and S89) and one C-specific dominant epitope (C37) that reacted with the majority of sera from sAg(-) patients. Of note, more B-cell linear epitopes were detected in CHep patients with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) flares than in nonflare CInf patients, and five B-cell linear epitopes (S4, S5, S10, S11, and S68) were overwhelmingly recognized by ALT flare patients. The recognition rates of epitopes on C and P proteins were significantly increased in CHep patients relative to CInf patients. Strikingly, a statistically significant elevation in the number of positive epitopes was observed when ALT nonflare patients shifted into the flare phase. Moreover, S76 identified at baseline was confirmed to be associated with a complete response after 48 weeks of telbivudine therapy. Taken together, we identified several functional cure-related B-cell linear epitopes of chronic HBV infection, and these epitopes may serve as vaccine candidates to elicit neutralizing antibodies to treat HBV infection.","output":"Identification and Mapping of HBsAg Loss-Related B-Cell Linear Epitopes in Chronic HBV Patients by Peptide Array"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Lung transplant patients are at increased risk of infection due to immunosuppression.

Italy has not only been the first European country to be exposed to the pandemic and to undergo national lockdown but also a country where the wave of racist assaults started in late January 2020, even before the first clusters have been detected. The critical investigation of Italian media discourses will highlight how deep-rooted, colonialist and ambivalent assumptions about the ?Oriental?, ?Asian?, ?Chinese? and ?yellow? other may have been crucial to the reproduction of racism against specific people, cultures and civilizations, regardless of nationality, class and gender. It will refer in particular to the concept of ?yellowness?, resulting from a process of bio-cultural racialization within the hegemonic frame of ?Western?, ?White? or ?Italian? identity. Furthermore, it will indicate how this process of racialized othering has emerged, but has also been contested, within the specific context of citizenship, Asian immigrants and governmental actions in contemporary Italy.

Based on the lack of expression of the virus entry proteins in olfactory receptor neurons, it was originally assumed that the new coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) does not infect olfactory neurons. Recent studies have reported otherwise, opening the possibility that the virus can directly infect the brain by traveling along the olfactory nerve. Multiple animal models have been employed to assess mechanisms and routes of brain infection of SARS-CoV-2, often with conflicting results. We here review the current evidence for an olfactory route to brain infection and conclude that the case for infection of olfactory neurons is weak, based on animal and human studies. Consistent brain infection after SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in mouse models is only seen when the virus entry proteins are expressed abnormally, and the timeline and progression of rare neuro-invasion in these and in other animal models points to alternative routes to the brain, other than along the olfactory projections. COVID-19 patients can be assured that loss of smell does not necessarily mean that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has gained access to and has infected their brains.","output":"The olfactory nerve is not a likely route to brain infection in COVID-19: a critical review of data from humans and animal models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"During a pandemic, there are conflicting demands that arise from public health and socioeconomic costs.

The high transmission rate of coronaviruses, the time-consuming development of efficient anti-infectives and vaccines, the possible evolutionary adaptation of the virus to conventional vaccines, and the challenge to cover broad human population worldwide are the major reasons that made it challenging to avoid coronaviruses outbreaks. Although, a plethora of different approaches are being followed to design and develop vaccines against coronaviruses, most of them target subunits, full-length single, or only a very limited number of proteins. Vaccine targeting multiple proteins or even the entire proteome of the coronavirus is yet to come. In the present chapter, we will be discussing multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) and multi-patch vaccine (MPV) approaches to design and develop efficient and sustainably successful strategies against coronaviruses. MEV and MPV utilize highly conserved, potentially immunogenic epitopes and antigenic patches, respectively, and hence they have the potential to target large number of coronavirus proteins or even its entire proteome, allowing us to combat the challenge of its evolutionary adaptation. In addition, the large number of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles targeted by the chosen specific epitopes enables MEV and MPV to cover broader global population.","output":"Vaccines Targeting Numerous Coronavirus Antigens, Ensuring Broader Global Population Coverage: Multi-epitope and Multi-patch Vaccines."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The spectrum of COVID-19 clinical manifestations is not yet known. In the elderly, mortality and extrapulmonary involvement appears more frequent than expected. METHODS: A multicentre-retrospective-case-series study of COVID-19 patients, aged &#8805;65 years, hospitalised between March 1 and June 15, 2020. Patients were classified at admission into 3 groups based on their Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score: 1-3 (group A), 4-6 (group B) and 7-9 (group C). RESULTS: Of the 206 patients in the study, 60 (29%) were assigned to group A, 60 (29%) to B and 86 (42%) to C. Significantly more frequent in group C than in B or A were: mental confusion (respectively 65%, 33%, 7%; P < 0.001), kidney failure (39%, 22%, 20%; P = 0.019), dehydration syndrome (55%, 27%, 13%; P < 0.001), electrolyte imbalance (54%, 32%, 25%; P = 0.001), and diabetic decompensation (22%, 12%, 7%; P = 0.026). Crude mortality was 27%.

DESIGN: Randomised controlled, adaptive, open label clinical trial. SETTING: 28 hospitals in Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and US. PARTICIPANTS: 465 adults admitted to hospital wards with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels were recruited between 29 May 2020 and 12 April 2021 and were randomly assigned to therapeutic dose heparin (n=228) or prophylactic dose heparin (n=237). INTERVENTIONS: Therapeutic dose or prophylactic dose heparin (low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin), to be continued until hospital discharge, day 28, or death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, non-invasive mechanical ventilation, or admission to an intensive care unit, assessed up to 28 days. The secondary outcomes included all cause death, the composite of all cause death or any mechanical ventilation, and venous thromboembolism. Safety outcomes included major bleeding. Outcomes were blindly adjudicated. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 60 years; 264 (56.8%) were men and the mean body mass index was 30.3 kg/m(2). At 28 days, the primary composite outcome had occurred in 37/228 patients (16.2%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 52/237 (21.9%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.10; P=0.12). Deaths occurred in four patients (1.8%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 18 patients (7.6%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.22, 0.07 to 0.65; P=0.006). The composite of all cause death or any mechanical ventilation occurred in 23 patients (10.1%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and 38 (16.0%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.59, 0.34 to 1.02; P=0.06). Venous thromboembolism occurred in two patients (0.9%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and six (2.5%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.34, 0.07 to 1.71; P=0.19). Major bleeding occurred in two patients (0.9%) assigned to therapeutic heparin and four (1.7%) assigned to prophylactic heparin (0.52, 0.09 to 2.85; P=0.69). CONCLUSIONS: In moderately ill patients with covid-19 and increased D-dimer levels admitted to hospital wards, therapeutic heparin was not significantly associated with a reduction in the primary outcome but the odds of death at 28 days was decreased.

An unintended side-effect of face masks is their adverse influence on speech perception especially in challenging listening situations. So far, behavioural studies have not pinpointed exactly which feature(s) of speech processing face masks affect in such listening situations. We conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech (i.e. an audiobook). In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). A decoding model on the clear AV speech (i.e. no additional speaker and target speaker not wearing a face mask) was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations, i.e. when a distracting speaker was also presented. Our findings demonstrate the detrimental impact face masks have on listening and speech perception, thus extending previous behavioural results. Supporting the idea of visual facilitation of speech is the fact that we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics. This idea is in line with recent research, also by our group, showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Since hearing impairment usually affects higher frequencies, the detrimental effect of face masks might pose a particular challenge for individuals who likely need the visual information about higher frequencies (e.g. formants) to compensate.","output":"Face masks impair reconstruction of acoustic speech features and higher-level segmentational features in the presence of a distractor speaker"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Scientific evidence suggests that Saharan dust intrusions in Southern Europe contribute to the worsening of multiple pathologies and increase the concentrations of particulate matter (PM) and other pollutants.

We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18-64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18-64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10a??000 or 1 in 100a??000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (288%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (712%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 294% (95% CI 286-302) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10a??000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 274% [268-280]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100a??000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 613% [605-621]).

We aimed to compare the outcomes, the clinical characteristics, and the adverse effects of COVID-19 patients to a retrospective cohort of influenza patients. This retrospective case-control study was conducted in the ICUs of Lille and Rouen University Hospitals between January 2014 and May 2020. Two independent cohorts of patients with ARDS requiring V-V ECMO infected with either COVID-19 (n = 30) or influenza (n = 22) were compared. A 3-month follow-up was completed for all patients. Median age of COVID-19 and influenza patients was similar (57 vs. 55 years; p = 0.62). The 28-day mortality rate did not significantly differ between COVID-19 (43.3%) and influenza patients (50%, p = 0.63). There was no significant difference considering the cumulative incidence of ECMO weaning, hospital discharge, and 3-month survival. COVID-19 patients had a lower SAPS II score (58 [37C64] vs. 68 [52C83]; p = 0.039), a higher body mass index (33 [29C38] vs. 30 [26C34] kg/m(2); p = 0.05), and were cannulated later (median delay between mechanical support and V-V ECMO 6 vs. 3 days, p = 0.004) compared with influenza patients. No difference in overall adverse events was observed between COVID-19 and influenza patients (70% vs. 95.5% respectively; p = 0.23). Despite differences in clinical presentation before V-V ECMO implantation, 28-day and 3-month mortality rate did not differ between COVID-19 and influenza patients. Considering the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19, V-V ECMO should be considered as a relevant rescue organ support.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 Versus Influenza-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Requiring Veno-venous Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Support"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Implementing the concept of state defense is now increasingly broad, not only facing threats militarily but also non-military with various variations Currently, 28% of Indonesia's population is Generation Z, namely those born between 1997 - 2012 As the nation's next-generation, Generation Z must increasingly understand that the various challenges and opportunities that will be faced are different from the previous generation Based on the study results, respondents stated that Generation Z needed insight and understanding of relevant state defense as a form of a contribution to love for the country Respondents stated that so far, the concept of state defense is more perceived as attitudes and actions related to \\"physical\\" or \\"war\\" in the true sense Therefore, this paper hopes to provide insight into the importance of continuous understanding from all stakeholders by inviting and involving Generation Z to contribute and work for hand in hand for the Indonesian nation's progress The Covid-19 pandemic is a momentum to strengthen cooperation, collaboration, and tolerance so that they can rise together for the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia ? 2021 Karadeniz Technical University All rights reserved","output":"Defend the country: Generation Z perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT During the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention has been addressed in cancer care to mitigate the impact on the patient's prognosis.

A total of 47 patients and 54 HCW were tested for COVID-19, by PCR-SARS-CoV-2. We report 11 cases of COVID-19 in hematological patients (including 2 post stem cell transplant) and 28 cases in HCW. Hematological cases were most severe or moderate and presented with several poor risk factors. Among HCW, COVID-19 were mostly mild, and all recovered without hospitalization. A cluster was observed among HCW. Despite a decrease in the number of procedures, the Transplant Program performed 8 autologous and 4 allogeneic SCT during the period, and 49 onco-hematological patients were admitted to continuing their treatments.

It was recognised that such restrictions could have profound impact on residents and their families. Nonetheless, these measures were strictly imposed over a prolonged period in many countries; impeding families from remaining involved in their relatives' care and diluting the meaningful connections for residents with society. It is timely to explore the impact of public health measures on people living in nursing homes from an ethical perspective. In order to foreground the ethical dimensions of the implications of visitor restrictions in nursing homes, we compiled an ethical case that reflects some recent experiences of nursing homes residents and their families, in the Irish Republic. We describe a series of events encountered by a woman and her family during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020 and we deploy an ethical decision-making tool to guide and structure our analysis. Our case analysis draws attention to ethical principles that are relevant to explicating the ethical duties and obligations that arise in relation to the interests, well-being, and safety of residents and their families, as well as nursing home staff and the wider community during a pandemic. These include the right of autonomy, trust, minimising harm, and proportionality. We conclude that a number of different strategies should be adopted by nursing homes and relevant regulatory bodies. This includes honest, regular communication between the nursing home staff, the resident and their family. Central to communications is the resident's wishes, their current clinical status and the all-important wider public health obligations.

EVIDENCE: Health and vaccine literacy encompass peoples knowledge, motivation, and competence to access, understand, appraise and apply health information in order to make judgements and take decisions in everyday life concerning health care, disease prevention and health promotion. FINDINGS: Appropriate vaccine communication, which depends greatly on personal and contextual determinants, as well as on societal and environmental circumstances, is essential to reassure people about vaccine efficacy, safety, and possible side effects. However, vaccine confidence is not solely a question of trust in the vaccines efficacy, safety. and individual protective benefit of vaccination. It also encompasses the mechanism(s) of vaccine activity, immunization schedules, organization and trust in the healthcare system that promotes and delivers the vaccines, and at what costs. When healthcare professionals as science brokers of vaccine knowledge attempt to increase vaccine knowledge and confidence, they must adjust their communication to the educational or health literacy level of their intended audience. Even if their messages are apparently clear and simple, they absolutely need to verify that they are properly understood. RELEVANCE: Specific vaccine communication training appears essential to increase vaccine communication skills among healthcare providers.

Infection with other ALV subgroup (A/B) strains also triggered ERK/MAPK activation. Moreover, when activating ERK2, ALV subgroups A, B and J simultaneously induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun, an AP1 family member and p38 activation but had no obvious effect on JNK activation at either 15 min or 120 h. Interestingly, only PD98059 inhibited the ALV-induced c-Jun phosphorylation while SP600125 or SB203580 had no influence on c-Jun activation. Furthermore, the viral gp85 and gag proteins were found to contribute to ERK2/AP1 activation. Additionally, the specific ERK inhibitor, PD980509, significantly suppressed ALV replication, as evidenced by extremely low levels of ALV promoter activity and ALV-J protein expression.

Tapentadol is a central analgesic with an improved tolerability profile that may be particularly beneficial to the elderly CLBP. METHODS We performed an observational retrospective study to comparatively assess the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol in young and elderly patients with severe CLBP. Sixtyfive young patients (< 65 years) and 87 elderly patients ( 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P < 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration. Treatment with tapentadol was associated with comparable and clinically meaningful pain reductions in 24-h NRS from baseline to treatment month-4 both in young and elderly patients (- 5.3  1.4 and - 4.8  2.1; P < 0.01); a 50% pain relief was achieved in 66% and 58% of young and elderly patients.

With test procedures and vaccines becoming available at scale, nursing homes might relax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections. By control we mean that each index case infects less than one other person on average. Here, we develop an agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of SARS-CoV-2 calibrated to Austrian nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends critically on test turnover time (time until test result), the detection threshold of tests and mitigation testing frequencies. Under realistic conditions and in absence of vaccinations, we find that mitigation testing of employees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks if tests have low turnover times and detection thresholds. If vaccines that are 60% effective against high viral load and transmission are available, control is achieved if 80% or more of the residents are vaccinated, even without mitigation testing and if residents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on vaccine efficacy against infection, retention of testing infrastructures, regular testing and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to enable early identification of new variants of concern.","output":"Agent-based simulations for protecting nursing homes with prevention and vaccination strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This research investigates Italians' attitudes towards the contact tracing app Immuni, promoted by the Italian government to track the spread of Covid-19 and prevent possible future outbreaks.

It can be assumed that symptomatic behaviors and mental health of individuals with eating disorders (ED) deteriorated during this time. To get a thorough overview, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the following aims: First, to provide a comprehensive overview of symptoms of ED during the COVID-19-related confinement; second, to identify psychological mechanisms which impacted the emergence and maintenance of ED symptoms; third, to describe changes of daily routine and changes of access to healthcare in individuals with ED during confinement. METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases for observational studies published between January 1st, 2020, to July 1st, 2021, which investigated the symptomatology of ED during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: After the screening, 13 studies with 7848 participants were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of exacerbation of binge eating, food restriction, purging behaviors, and concerns about food intake in the pooled sample of 7848 was 59.65% (95% CI: 49.30%; 69.60%), and the overall prevalence of improved symptoms of ED in the pooled sample of 741 individuals was 9.37% (95% CI: 3.92%; 16.57%). Furthermore, COVID-19-related social restrictions negatively impacted the psychological health, daily routines, and physical activity of individuals with ED. More specifically, symptoms of anxiety and depression related to ED were increased significantly over time. However, there were also positive aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main positive consequences included more emotional support from the family, less pressure to engage in social activities, and more flexible meal planning. Individuals with ED reported having difficulties getting access to healthcare centers and using telemedicine. They also found a hard time communicating via online sessions. CONCLUSIONS: According to our interpretation, based on the data included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic and its related social restrictions detrimentally impacted the mental health of majority of individuals with ED. Limited and impaired access to healthcare interventions appeared to have further exacerbated mental health issues of individuals with ED.

The identification of co-infections in dogs is important to determine the prognosis and to plan strategies for their treatment and prophylaxis. Although many pathogens have been individually detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a comprehensive panel of agents that cause diarrhea in privately owned dogs has not yet been established. The objective of this study was to use a real-time PCR diarrhea panel to survey the frequencies of pathogens and co-infections in owned dogs attended in a veterinary hospital with and without diarrhea, as well the frequency in different countries. Feces samples were tested for canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin (CPA), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp., and Salmonella spp. using molecular techniques. RESULTS: In total, 104 diarrheic and 43 control dogs that were presented consecutively at a major private veterinary hospital were included in the study. Overall, 71/104 (68.3%) dogs with diarrhea were positive for at least one pathogen: a single infection in 39/71 dogs (54.9%) and co-infections in 32/71 dogs (45.1%), including 21/32 dogs (65.6%) with dual, 5/32 (15.6%) with triple, and 6/32 (18.8%) with quadruple infections. In the control group, 13/43 (30.2%) dogs were positive, all with single infections only. The most prevalent pathogens in the diarrheic dogs were CPA (40/104 dogs, 38.5%), CPV-2 (36/104 dogs, 34.6%), and Giardia spp. (14/104 dogs, 13.5%). CPV-2 was the most prevalent pathogen in the dual co-infections, associated with CPA, Cryptosporidium spp., or Giardia spp. No statistical difference (P = 0.8374) was observed in the duration of diarrhea or the number of deaths (P = 0.5722) in the presence or absence of single or co-infections. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrheic dogs showed a higher prevalence of pathogen infections than the controls. Whereas the healthy dogs had only single infections, about half the diarrheic dogs had co-infections.

Previous studies exploring the self-management experiences of KTRs have focused on specific tasks (e.g., medication adherence), age groups (e.g., adolescent or older recipients), or have been conducted outside of the UK where transferability of findings is unknown. Our study aimed to explore the perceptions and experiences of self-management in UK KTRs to identify facilitators and barriers associated with self-management tasks. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eleven KTRs. Topics explored included experiences of self-management tasks (diet, exercise, medications, stress management), perceived healthcare role, and future interventional approaches. Thematic analysis was used to identify and report themes. RESULTS: Eight themes were identified which were mapped onto the three self-management tasks described by Corbin and Strauss: medical, role and emotional management. Perceived facilitators to self-management were: gathering health-related knowledge, building relationships with healthcare professionals, creating routines within daily life, setting goals and identifying motivators, establishing support networks, and support from family and friends. Complexity of required treatment and adjusting to a new health status were perceived barriers to self-management. CONCLUSIONS: Participants described the importance of collaborative consultations and continuity of care. Tailored interventions should identify individualised goals and motivators for participating in self-management. Education on effective strategies to manage symptoms and comorbidities could help alleviate KTRs perceived treatment burden.

As U.S. hospitals were forced to aggressively limit non-essential care to preserve personal protective equipment and minimize COVID-19 exposure, in-person education and hands-on training was nearly eliminated for students. The objective of this study was to immediately and comprehensively investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical student education. Medical students in the U.S. were invited to complete an online survey about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on their medical education experience. Students provided basic demographic information and answered questions about the impact of COVID-19 on their training/education, finances, and mental health. Results: Medical students reported nearly 18 fewer hours of patient care per week, an immediate switch to virtual learning (74%) along with grading changes (62%), and widespread cancellation of national exams. Additionally, 55% of fourth year students graduated early to provide direct clinical care. Students across years felt that changes from the pandemic would negatively affect their residency applications and that upcoming rotations would be impacted (p<0.001). Students reported that the pandemic had negatively affected their finances, increased their anxiety/stress, increased their feelings of burnout, and negatively impacted their work-life balance (p<0.001). Conclusion: Medical education has been critically impacted by COVID-19. Student perceptions and evaluation of experiences to date should be considered as educators prepare to ready students for academic and professional transitions in the context of continued COVID-19 disruptions and distanced learning.","output":"Assessing the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Student Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched health care resources to a point of crisis throughout the world.

The term refers to illegal gatherings of a large number of people in circumstances when all gatherings are restricted under anti-epidemic measures. A phenomenon similar to corona parties and co-ocurring with them in the Serbian socio-cultural and pandemic temporal context, is the dancing of the traditional kolo dance in public spaces. Both phenomena represent a conscious disregard for one's own health and of regulations introduced by the authorities, and at the same time an emphatic public display of indifference towards the epidemiological situation in the country, and rejection of the consequent legal restrictions on public life. The paper aims to establish the cultural background of such behavior, i.e. to ascertain its socio-cultural meaning. The indirect or direct endangerment of one's own or other people's health, particularly in a pandemic, can be seen as a misanthropic act. The cultural notions on which such irrational behavior is based are a consequence of a postmodernist relativization of previously existing socio-cultural discourse on science, and are counterintuitive. Behavior based on these notions is an irrational response to changes in socio-cultural reality due to COVID-19. The response is not only irrational but also ineffective, as it cannot eliminate the undesired consequences of the given situation, neither in terms of the illness itself, nor in terms of how it will be managed by those who have been put in charge by the government. Due to this, such behavior can also be seen simply as a deliberate defiance of rules. The misanthropic quality of the behavior of those who ignore anti-epidemic measures by dancing kolo in the streets or attending corona parties is evident in the conscious rejection of the principle of not harming others. Ignoring the possible health risks to themselves, they ignore the possible health risks to others, and thus become social factors of biological contagion. It is in this way that such behavior becomes the cause of the extension of the very state of socio-cultural reality against which it is supposed to be directed.","output":"Cognitive and Medical Misanthropology: Corona Parties and Kolo Dancing by the Monument"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Septic systems are typically designed to treat domestic wastewater from households without access to centralized facilities. The installation of a food waste disposer (FWD) may increase the discharge of food waste (FW) into the wastewater; therefore, the installation of a FWD is discouraged in households that have a septic system. This study was conducted to determine how a typical dose of FW from a FWD can affect the performance of a septic system in terms of sewage treatment and solids accumulation. A 20-L control tank was compared with an experiment tank to which FW was added, increasing the amount of total suspended solids (TSS) by 31.3% and total chemical oxygen demands by 46.3% for a period of 110 days. Although the influent water quality changed dramatically, the effluent from the experiment tank had a substantially lower percentage increase in water quality parameters compared with the effluent from the control. It was found that in the experiment tank, 75.8% of FW TSS was degraded, whereas only 36.7% of sewage TSS was degraded, and that 18.8% of FW TSS and 44.9% of sewage TSS accumulated in the experiment tank. The addition of FW increased the scum accumulation, even though the dry matter of the scum layer was much less in quantity than the sludge layer. It also increased the lipid content in the sludge. The increase in the scum layer was mainly due to the increase in protein from the addition of the FW. Overall, compared with sewage TSS, FW TSS tends to be more biodegradable, which indicates that the impact on pumping frequency from adding FW will be insignificant.","output":"Study of food waste degradation in a simulated septic tank."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic outbreak is the most astounding scene ever experienced in the 21st century. It has been determined to be caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With the global pandemic, the lack of efficient rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing tools has hindered the public opportunely response to the emerging viral threat. Herein, a DNA nanoscaffold hybrid chain reaction (DNHCR)-based nucleic acid assay strategy is reported for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In this method, the DNA nanoscaffolds have been first constructed by the self-assembly of long DNA strands and self-quenching probes (H1). Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will initiate the hybridization of H1 and free H2 DNA probes along the nanoscaffold, and an illuminated DNA nanostring is instantly obtained. By taking advantages of the localization design of the H1 probes and the temperature tolerance of the isothermal amplification, the proposed DNHCR method can detect target at short responding time (within 10 min) and mild condition (15 C-35 C). Moreover, the reliability of DNHCR method in serum and saliva samples have also been validated. Therefore, DNHCR-based method is expected to provide a simple and faster alternative to the traditional SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay.","output":"DNA nanoscaffold-based SARS-CoV-2 detection for COVID-19 diagnosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to unprecedented demands on the modern health care system, and the highly contagious nature of the virus has led to particular concerns of infection among health care workers and transmission within health care facilities.

From the initial 204 variables selected from UKB, processed into>520 features, iterative backward elimination using Cox proportional hazards model was performed to select predictors which account for the majority of its predictive capability. Baseline and reduced models were then trained for depression and anxiety using both Cox and DeepSurv, a deep neural network approach to survival analysis. The baseline Cox model achieved concordance of 0.813 and 0.778 on the validation dataset for depression and anxiety, respectively. For the DeepSurv model, respective concordance indices were 0.805 and 0.774. After feature selection, the depression model contained 43 predictors and the concordance index was 0.801 for both Cox and DeepSurv. The reduced anxiety model, with 27 predictors, achieved concordance of 0.770 in both models.

It has become the second most affected country worldwide, as of June 9, 2020. Official Brazilian government sources present contradictory data on the impact of the disease; thus, it is possible that the actual number of infected individuals and deaths in Brazil is far larger than those officially reported. It is very likely that the actual spread of the disease has been underestimated. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the underreporting of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 in the most affected cities in Brazil, based on public data available from official Brazilian government internet portals, to identify the actual impact of the pandemic. METHODS: We used data from historical deaths due to respiratory problems and other natural causes from two public portals: DATASUS (Department of Informatics of the Unified Healthcare System) (2010-2018) and the Brazilian Transparency Portal of Civil Registry (2019-2020). These data were used to build time-series models (modular regressions) to predict the expected mortality patterns for 2020. The forecasts were used to estimate the possible number of deaths that were incorrectly registered during the pandemic and posted on government internet portals in the most affected cities in the country. RESULTS: Our model found a significant difference between the real and expected values. The number of deaths due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was considerably higher in all cities, with increases between 493% and 5820%. This sudden increase may be associated with errors in reporting. An average underreporting of 40.68% (range 25.9%-62.7%) is estimated for COVID-19-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The significant rates of underreporting of deaths analyzed in our study demonstrate that officially released numbers are much lower than actual numbers, making it impossible for the authorities to implement a more effective pandemic response. Based on analyses carried out using different fatality rates, it can be inferred that Brazil's epidemic is worsening, and the actual number of infectees could already be between 1 to 5.4 million.","output":"COVID-19 Mortality Underreporting in Brazil: Analysis of Data From Government Internet Portals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been associated with a hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk for ischemic stroke. In select cases, patients are already on anticoagulation therapy. Such examples highlight the severity of COVID-19's hyperthrombotic state, and raise questions regarding optimal stroke prevention in these patients. CASE REPORT: An 84-year-ool male with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was admitted for respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia. He was continued on his home apixaban 5 mg twice daily. On day 2 of admission, he developed a new aphasia, and right-sided facial droop. Computed tomography (CT) head was unrevealing. CT angiography did not show large vessel occlusion. CT perfusion demonstrated a left middle cerebral artery ischemic penumbra, without core. He was not eligible for thrombolysis or thrombectomy interventions. Later CT head confirmed L middle cerebral artery infarct. The patient's D-dimer was 1,184 ng/mL on day 1 of admission, and increased to 111,574 by day 4. His hypoxia worsened, requiring intubation and transfer to the ICU. He experienced further clinical decline and eventual demise. CONCLUSION: Ischemic stroke in anticoagulated patients with COVID-19 has been previously reported. Such cases emphasize the severity of the coronavirus virus associated hypercoagulable state. A majority of reported cases have occurred in patients continuing their ambulatory therapy. Overall, such cases are likely underreported. There are current trials comparing therapeutic versus prophylactic dose anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. There are no studies specifically addressing anticoagulation agent failure in these patients.

As of 17 September 2020, more than 30 million confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in 204 different countries, claiming more than 1 million lives worldwide. Accumulating evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a variety of clinical conditions, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening cases.

However, there are no comprehensive studies on the decontamination methods, which is not helpful for the sustainable development of nuclear energy and environment protection. Therefore, in this work, the current status and future trends of global energy and nuclear energy are first analyzed.

Finally, the criteria and factors for selecting a decontamination process, the challenges, and future studies are directed. Among the mechanical methods, laser-based cleaning is high-speed, having automation ability, and thus is promising, although it creates a dust and airborne contaminant hazard. In further studies, factors such as selecting a proper laser facility, optimizing operating parameters, and designing a high-efficiency dust collection system could be studied. Regarding the chemical method, chemical gels are good for decontaminating complex shapes and vertical and overhead surfaces. In addition, they can enhance other decon agents efficiency by improving contact time. However, the formulation of colloidal gels is complex and no gel type is useful for all contaminants.

In this study, differential neurochemical sequelae in response to sepsis (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia and caecal ligation and puncture (CLP)), were evaluated in two inbred mouse strains, known to differ in behaviour, immune profile, and neurotransmitter levels, namely BALB/c and C57BL/6J. It was hypothesized that these strains would differ in sepsis severity, cytokine profile, peripheral tryptophan metabolism and central monoamine turnover. BALB/c mice exhibited more pronounced sickness behavioural scores, hypothermia, and significant upregulation of cytokines in the LPS model relative to C57BL/6J mice. An increased plasma kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, hippocampal serotonin and brainstem dopamine turnover were evident in both strains, but the magnitude was greater in BALB/c mice. In addition, CLP significantly enhanced kynurenine levels and hippocampal serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in C57BL/6J mice. Overall, these studies depict consistent changes in kynurenine, serotonin, and dopamine post sepsis.

These organelles have various other functions, all carried out by numerous proteins, with the majority of them being encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mitochondria occupy ~1/3 of the volume of myocardial cells in adults, and function at levels of high-efficiency to promptly meet the energy requirements of the myocardial contractile units. Mitochondria have their own DNA (mtDNA), which contains 37 genes and is maternally inherited. Over the last several years, a variety of functions of these organelles have been discovered and this has led to a growing interest in their involvement in various diseases, including cardiovascular (CV) diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction relates to the status where mitochondria cannot meet the demands of a cell for ATP and there is an enhanced formation of reactive-oxygen species. This dysfunction may occur as a result of mtDNA and/or nDNA mutations, but also as a response to aging and various disease and environmental stresses, leading to the development of cardiomyopathies and other CV diseases. Designing mitochondria-targeted therapeutic strategies aiming to maintain or restore mitochondrial function has been a great challenge as a result of variable responses according to the etiology of the disorder. There have been several preclinical data on such therapies, but clinical studies are scarce. A major challenge relates to the techniques needed to eclectically deliver the therapeutic agents to cardiac tissues and to damaged mitochondria for successful clinical outcomes. All these issues and progress made over the last several years are herein reviewed.","output":"Mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiovascular disease: Current status of translational research/clinical and therapeutic implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 pandemic has forced schools to accelerate their digitalization process, causing an exacerbation of pre-existing educational disparities and a worldwide increase of students affected by mental health issues.

DESIGN Cross-sectional postal survey. SETTING Province of Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS Attending physicians and residents in four specialties at 15 teaching hospitals. INTERVENTIONS We used literature searches and focus groups to design questions related to NIV utilization with respect to frequency, location of and indications for use, awareness of supporting literature, and perceived efficacy. We assessed the survey's clinical sensibility and reliability. We used regression analyses to evaluate practice variation among hospitals and specialties and to determine predictors of more frequent NIV use, initiation of and continued use in nonmonitored settings, and use for specific indications. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Three hundred eighty-five (48%) of 808 physicians responded; 242 used NIV. The two most common indications for NIV use were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. NIV guidelines, protocols, or policies were available in 12 of 15 hospitals. We found variation in NIV utilization among specialties but not hospitals. Specialty (critical care and respirology versus internal and emergency medicine), fewer years of postgraduate experience, and a greater number of noninvasive ventilators were predictors of more frequent NIV use (all p < or = .001). Only 6% of respondents reported initiation of use and continued use most frequently in nonmonitored settings, which increased with the number of noninvasive ventilators (p = .02). Physician characteristics such as awareness of the literature were predictive of NIV use for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, whereas perceived NIV efficacy was predictive of use for many indications, including congestive heart failure. CONCLUSIONS Self-reported practice variation for bilevel NIV exists among specialties but not hospitals and differs with respect to frequency, location of use, and use for specific indications. Some factors associated with variation in NIV use may be suitable targets for utilization improvement interventions.","output":"Bilevel noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure: survey of Ontario practice."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV outbreak, began in China, which has now spread many countries around the globe in a form of pandemic, with the number of confirmed cases increasing every day With a death toll exceeding that of the SARS-CoV outbreak, 2019-nCoV has led to a public health emergency of international concern, putting all health organizations around the world on a high alert Here, we presented an overview of the currently available information on the clinical presentation and complication of this virus","output":"Variation of clinical features of Covid19 patients (Special Issue: Newly emerging COVID19 infectious disease)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"For the last six months till today, the world had had no luck in defeating COVID-19.

METHODS: IgM/IgG and total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by a cyclic enhanced fluorescence assay (CEFA) and a microsphere immunoassay (MIA), respectively. Independent performance evaluation included imprecision, reproducibility, specificity and cross-reactivity (CEFA n = 320, MIA n = 364). Clinical utility was evaluated by both methods in 87 patients at initial emergency department visit, 28 during subsequent hospitalizations (106 serial samples), and 145 convalescent patients. Totally 916 patients and 994 samples were evaluated. RESULTS: Agreement of CEFA and MIA was 90.4%-94.5% (Kappa: 0.81-0.89) in 302 samples. CEFA and MIA detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 26.2% and 26.3%, respectively, of ED patients. Detection rates increased over time reaching 100% after 21 days post-symptom onset. Longitudinal antibody kinetic changes by CEFA and MIA measurements correlated well and exhibited three types of seroconversion. Convalescent sera showed a wide range of antibody levels.

This study examined the relationship between trust in the government and trust in COVID-19 health information from the US CDC, state health departments, and social media on the experience of COVID-19 social and health services-related disruptions. METHODS: People living with HIV (N = 459) recruited through social media advertisements and chain referrals completed confidential surveys delivered through an online platform. RESULTS: Participants experienced high-levels of disruptions to social relationships and health services attributable to COVID-19 mitigation efforts. We also observed high-rates of inaccurate information and low-levels of trust in government and sources of COVID-19 information. Greater disruptions to social relationships were predicted by more concern about oneself and others contracting COVID-19, whereas disruptions to health services were predicted by greater concern for oneself contracting COVID-19, greater general medical mistrust, and less trust in information from the CDC.

Physicians and health care workers are at added risk of exposure and infection during the course of patient care. Because of the rapid spread of this disease through respiratory droplets, health care workers who come in close contact with the upper aerodigestive tract during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as otolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons, are particularly at risk. A set of safety recommendations was created based on a review of the literature and communications with physicians with firsthand knowledge of safety procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Observations: A high number of health care workers were infected during the first phase of the pandemic in the city of Wuhan, China. Subsequently, by adopting strict safety precautions, other regions were able to achieve high levels of safety for health care workers without jeopardizing the care of patients. The most common procedures related to the examination and treatment of upper aerodigestive tract diseases were reviewed. Each category was reviewed based on the potential risk imposed to health care workers. Specific recommendations were made based on the literature, when available, or consensus best practices. Specific safety recommendations were made for performing tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Preserving a highly skilled health care workforce is a top priority for any community and health care system. Based on the experience of health care systems in Asia and Europe, by following strict safety guidelines, the risk of exposure and infection of health care workers could be greatly reduced while providing high levels of care.

We hypothesized that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation may improve outcomes in noncritically ill patients who are hospitalized with Covid-19. METHODS: In this open-label, adaptive, multiplatform, controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and who were not critically ill (which was defined as an absence of critical careClevel organ support at enrollment) to receive pragmatically defined regimens of either therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with heparin or usual-care pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. The primary outcome was organ supportCfree days, evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of ?1) and the number of days free of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support up to day 21 among patients who survived to hospital discharge. This outcome was evaluated with the use of a Bayesian statistical model for all patients and according to the baseline d-dimer level. RESULTS: The trial was stopped when prespecified criteria for the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation were met. Among 2219 patients in the final analysis, the probability that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation increased organ supportCfree days as compared with usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 98.6% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% credible interval, 1.03 to 1.58). The adjusted absolute between-group difference in survival until hospital discharge without organ support favoring therapeutic-dose anticoagulation was 4.0 percentage points (95% credible interval, 0.5 to 7.2). The final probability of the superiority of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation over usual-care thromboprophylaxis was 97.3% in the high d-dimer cohort, 92.9% in the low d-dimer cohort, and 97.3% in the unknown d-dimer cohort. Major bleeding occurred in 1.9% of the patients receiving therapeutic-dose anticoagulation and in 0.9% of those receiving thromboprophylaxis.

By utilizing a cellCcell fusion system, in complement with a pseudoviral infection model, we found that the spike engagement of ACE2 primed the generation of S2 fragments in target cells, a key proteolytic event coupled with spike-mediated membrane fusion. Mutagenesis of an S2 cleavage site at the arginine (R) 815, but not an S2 cleavage site at arginine 685, was sufficient to prevent subsequent syncytia formation and infection in a variety of cell lines and primary cells isolated from human ACE2 knock-in mice.

Many research studies have shown that even the most subtle metaphor can have a significant influence on the way people try to tackle various social problems. Thus, the assumption is that metaphors are not just a simple rhetorical tool, but also have a profound effect on how we conceptualize reality and respond to important social issues. In the last two decades, scientists have studied the impact of metaphorical framing on political discourse from different research perspectives. Metaphors are often used for framing political topics, and these metaphorical frames are considered to affect the way people regard these issues, perceive the world, and act, on both the individual and collective level. In accordance with these research studies, in this paper, we will regard the metaphor as a cognitive tool that classifies our conceptual system and enables the understanding of our experiences. The objective of this paper is to examine the use of conceptual metaphors in media discourse on the corona crisis and the earthquake crisis caused by the quake in Petrinja. The research was conducted in three steps, following the methodology of critical metaphor analysis (Charteris-Black, 2004). In the first step, the identification of metaphorical expressions was performed by using a big data corpus of articles published by Croatian web-portals from the beginning of the pandemic (from January 2020 to April 2021) and after the Petrinja earthquake (from 29 December 2020). In the second step, the dominant conceptual metaphors employed in communicating the two crises were interpreted. The results of this interpretation are that war metaphors are ubiquitous in reporting on the COVID-19 disease pandemic, and the apocalypse metaphor is used in reporting on the earthquake. In the third step of the analysis, the reasons and implications of the occurrence of these metaphors are explained. ? 2021 Doron Fakultet Politickih Znanosti.

However, the extent to which chronic cocaine may induce silent microischemia predisposing the cerebral tissue to neurotoxicity has not been investigated; in part, because of limitations of current neuroimaging tools, that is, lack of high spatiotemporal resolution and sensitivity to simultaneously measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vessels of different calibers quantitatively and over a large field of view (FOV). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) technique allows us to image three dimensional (3D) cerebrovascular network (including artery, vein, and capillary), and provides high resolution angiography of the cerebral vasculature and quantitative CBF velocity (CBFv) within the individual vessels in the network. In order to monitor the neurovascular changes from an in vivo brain along with the chronic cocaine exposure, we have developed an approach of implanting a cranial window on mouse brain to achieve long-term cortical imaging. The cranial window was implanted on sensorimotor cortex area in two animal groups, i.e., control group [saline treatment, ~0.1 cc/10 g/day, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)] and chronic cocaine group (cocaine treatment, 30 mg/kg/day i.p.). After implantation, the cortex of individual animal was periodically imaged by OCT and stereoscope to provide angiography and quantitative CBFv of the cerebral vascular network, as well as the surface imaging of the brain. We have observed vascular hemodynamic changes (i.e., CBFv changes) induced by the cranial preparation in both animal groups, including the inflammatory response of brain shortly after the surgery (i.e., <5 days) followed by wound-healing process (i.e., >5 days) in the brain. Importantly, by comparing with the control animals, the surgical-related vascular physiology changes in the cortex can be calibrated, so that the cocaine-induced hemodynamic changes in the neurovasculature can be determined in the cocaine animals. Our results demonstrate that this methodology can be used to explore the neurovascular functional changes induced by the brain diseases such as drug addiction.","output":"Cranial window implantation on mouse cortex to study microvascular change induced by cocaine."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) is commonly used to protect individuals from infectious aerosols.

Before the effectiveness of this strategy can be established, many parameters affecting respiratory protection must be measured: biocidal efficacy of the decontamination treatment, filtration performance, pressure drop, fit, and toxicity to the end user post treatment. This research effort measured the amount of residual chemicals created or deposited on six models of FFRs following treatment by each of 7 simple decontamination technologies. Measured amounts of decontaminants retained by the FFRs treated with chemical disinfectants were small enough that exposure to wearers will be below the permissible exposure limit (PEL).

This change manifests itself primarily in the fact that already 73% of Polish citizens shop online. E-commerce customers are generally optimistic about this type of shopping, and this opinion has even improved over the past year. Online shopping is primarily perceived as convenient and uncomplicated and offers more choice than buying in traditional stores. In this measurement, the perception of comfort was remarkably improved. As the period of online shopping lengthens, the level of experience acquired by e-commerce customers increases, which, on the one hand, not only improves the online shopping process but, on the other hand, may affect the perception of websites in terms of other criteria. Thus, the purpose of the article is to examine the relationships between the time of online shopping (understood as the acquisition of experience of e-commerce customers) by respondents and the assessment of individual variables. Research conducted among the e-commerce customers allowed us to make the following conclusion - the perception itself and perception of specific criteria influencing the functioning of the Internet platform changes during the time while experience in online shopping is being acquired. However, this does not mean that these ratings are constantly improving. In the case of the level of satisfaction and the assessment of meeting e-commerce customers' needs above expectations, with the higher experience in online shopping, both the level of satisfaction and ratings regarding meeting the needs above expectations become lower.

Discussion: COVID-19 is a -Coronavirus serotype which is a single strain of RNA virus and was an outbreak in 2002 (SARS-CoV) and 2012 (MERS-CoV). COVID-19 has Open Reading Frames (ORFs) consisting of Spikes (S) Envelopes (E) Membranes (M) and Nucleocapsids (N) with S parts being a glycoprotein that can attach to receptors owned by host cells the receptors are CD 26 ACE-2 Ezrin and Cyclophilins with the main receptor being ACE-2 in the lung organs. Process would evoke a host body's immune response consisting of natural and adaptive immune systems involving the Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) system which consists of two namely: Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and II. APC could also generate an adaptive immune system consisting of B and T cells. COVID-19 had the ability to survive in B and T cells so that cytokine-chemokine secretion continues to be known as cytokine storms that trigger Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and death. Conclusion: The recovery prognosis of COVID-19 depended on the detection of COVID-19 patients because it was related to the severity of ARDS so the earlier it was detected the greater the chance of recovery.

The majority of the participants agreed/totally agreed to statements on professional attributes attained during project-based learning session like the ability to think creatively (60%), make observations (71%), compile information (80%), assess and make a decision (59%), analyse situations of professional practice (65%), develop oral communication skills (57%), develop Self-Directed Learning (SDL) (70%), develop skills needed for professional practice (54%), develop empathy towards patients with disease (79%) and develop self-confidence in learning the subject (63%) with a median score of 4. The majority of participants agreed/totally agreed to the effectiveness of the project-based learning in helping acquire various clinical and theoretical competencies during COVID-19 lockdown. The majority of the participants and the patient identified at home were happy to be part of the project-based learning. Conclusion: The majority of the participants were in agreement with the questions posed to them with a median score of 4, however, a neutral opinion was obtained on the acquisition of written communication skills as well as their family members having better compliance after getting involved in project-based learning.","output":"Project-based learning in pharmacology during COVID-19 lockdown for second phase medical undergraduates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Both the threat of bioterrorism and the natural emergence of contagious diseases underscore the importance of quantitatively understanding disease transmission in structured human populations. Over the last few years, researchers have advanced the mathematical theory of scale-free networks and used such theoretical advancements in pilot epidemic models. Scale-free contact networks are particularly interesting in the realm of mathematical epidemiology, primarily because these networks may allow meaningfully structured populations to be incorporated in epidemic models at moderate or intermediate levels of complexity. Moreover, a scale-free contact network with node degree correlation is in accord with the well-known preferred mixing concept. The present author describes a semi-empirical and deterministic epidemic modeling approach that (a) focuses on time-varying rates of disease transmission in both unstructured and structured populations and (b) employs probability density functions to characterize disease progression and outbreak controls. Given an epidemic curve for a historical outbreak, this modeling approach calls for Monte Carlo calculations (that define the average new infection rate) and solutions to integro-differential equations (that describe outbreak dynamics in an aggregate population or across all network connectivity classes). Numerical results are obtained for the 2003 SARS outbreak in Taiwan and the dynamical implications of time-varying transmission rates and scale-free contact networks are discussed in some detail.","output":"Congruent epidemic models for unstructured and structured populations: Analytical reconstruction of a 2003 SARS outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore if newborns in the second pregnancy following a previous caesarean delivery (CD) have higher risk of perinatal mortality or cerebral palsy than newborns in pregnancies following a previous vaginal delivery (VD). DESIGN: Cohort study with information from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway and the Cerebral Palsy Registry of Norway. SETTING: Births in Norway. PARTICIPANTS: 294 598 women with their first and second singleton delivery during 1996-2015. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stillbirth, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality and cerebral palsy. RESULTS: Among 294 598 included women, 42 962 (15%) had a CD in their first pregnancy while 251 636 (85%) had a VD. Compared with the second delivery of mothers with a previous VD, the adjusted OR (adjOR), for stillbirth in the second pregnancy following a previous CD was 1.45, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.73; for perinatal death the adjOR was 1.42 (1.22 to 1.73) and for neonatal death 1.13 (0.86 to 1.49). Among children who survived the neonatal period, the adjOR for cerebral palsy was 1.27 (0.99 to 1.64). Secondary outcomes, including small for gestational age, preterm and very preterm birth, uterine rupture and placental complications (eg, postpartum haemorrhage and pre-eclampsia) were more frequent in the subsequent pregnancy following a previous CD compared with a previous VD, in particular for uterine rupture adjOR 86.7 (48.2 to 156.1). Adjustment for potential confounders attenuated the ORs somewhat, but the excess risk in the second pregnancy persisted for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: A previous CD was in this study associated with increased risk for stillbirth and perinatal death compared with a previous VD. Although less robust, we also found that a previous CD was associated with a slightly increased risk of cerebral palsy among children surviving the neonatal period. The aetiology behind these associations needs further investigation.","output":"Does caesarean delivery in the first pregnancy increase the risk for adverse outcome in the second?

In this study, we developed a wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA load model based on the fecal shedding profile of infected individuals. The epidemic data of COVID-19 in the Tokyo metropolitan area were used to perform a simulation to analyze the capability of WBE in providing early warning. The simulation result suggests that under the current settings, WBE is not a feasible approach as the detection limit is too high to provide a warning signal in the early stage of the epidemic. However, it also indicates that if the methodology can be reasonably improved by new experimental practices, optimized sampling strategy, and refined model, the concentration of viral RNA in Tokyo wastewater would exceed the detection limit as early as in April 2020, when Tokyo was being hit by the first wave of COVID-19 outbreak.

Although current biological therapeutic strategies for RA have been effective in many cases, new classes of therapeutics are needed. We investigated anti-inflammatory properties of the natural alkaloid tryptanthrin (TRYP) and its synthetic derivative tryptanthrin-6-oxime (TRYP-Ox). Both TRYP and TRYP-Ox inhibited matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 gene expression in interleukin (IL)-1-stimulated primary human FLS, as well as IL-1¨Cinduced secretion of MMP-1/3 by FLS and synovial SW982 cells and IL-6 by FLS, SW982 cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and monocytic THP-1 cells, although TRYP-Ox was generally more effective and had no cytotoxicity in vitro. Evaluation of the therapeutic potential of TRYP and TRYP-Ox in vivo in murine arthritis models showed that both compounds significantly attenuated the development of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and collagen-antibodyCinduced arthritis (CAIA), with comparable efficacy. Collagen II (CII)-specific antibody levels were similarly reduced in TRYP- and TRYP-Ox-treated CIA mice. TRYP and TRYP-Ox also suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production by lymph node cells from CIA mice, with TRYP-Ox being more effective in inhibiting IL-17A, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand (RANKL). Thus, even though TRYP-Ox generally had a better in vitro profile, possibly due to its ability to inhibit c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), both TRYP and TRYP-Ox were equally effective in inhibiting the clinical symptoms and damage associated with RA.

Lockdowns and movement restrictions increased the potential of negative impact on population mental health, in which depression and anxiety symptoms were frequently reported by different population groups during COVID-19 lockdown. However, the causal relationship of mitigation policies on national-wide mental health treatment is lacking. Objective This study investigates the effect of COVID-19 mitigation measures on mental health across the UnitedStates, on county and state levels. It examines the effect on the total mental health patients, different age and gender groups, and patients of selected mental health diagnoses. Methods We used large-scale medical claims data for mental health patients dated from September 1, 2019 to December31, 2020, with publicly available state- and county-specific COVID-19 cases from first case in January to December 31,2020, and used publicly available lockdown dates data for states and counties. We designed a difference-in-differences(DID) model, which infers the causal effect of a policy intervention by comparing pre-policy and post-policy periods indifferent regions. We mainly focused on two types of social distancing policies, stay-at-home and school closure orders. Results Based on common pre-treatment trend assumption of regions, we find that lockdown has significantly and causally increased seeking medical treatment for mental health across counties and states. Mental health patients inregions with lockdown orders have significantly increased by 18% compared to 1% decline in regions without a lockdown.Also, female populations have been exposed to a larger lockdown effect on their mental health with 24% increase in regions with lockdowns compared to 3% increase in regions without. While male mental health patients decreased by 5% in regions without lockdowns. Patients diagnosed with panic disorders and reaction to severe stress both were significantly exposed to a significant large effect of lockdowns. Also, life management difficulty patients doubled in regions with stay-at-home orders but increased less with school closures. Contrarily, attention-deficit hyperactivity patients declined in regions without stay-at-home orders. The number of mental health patients older than 80 decreased in regions with lockdowns. Adults between (21-40) years old were exposed to the greatest lockdown effect with patient number increasing between 20% to 30% in regions with lockdown. Adolescent patients under 21 increased in regions with school closures. Conclusion Although non-pharmaceutical intervention policies were effective in containing the spread of COVID-19, our results show that mitigation policies led to population-wide increase in mental health patients.

By March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a No Sail Order suspending U.S. cruise operations; the last U.S. passenger ship docked on April 16. METHODS: We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises in U.S. waters or carrying U.S. citizens and used regression models to compare voyage characteristics. We used compartmental models to simulate the potential impact of four interventions (screening for COVID-19 symptoms; viral testing on two days and isolation of positive persons; reduction of passengers by 40%, crew by 20%, and port visits to one) for 7-day and 14-day voyages. RESULTS: During January 19-April 16, 2020, 89 voyages on 70 ships had known SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks; 16 ships had recurrent outbreaks. There were 1,669 RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and 29 confirmed deaths. Longer voyages were associated with more cases (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.17, p < 0.0001). Mathematical models showed that 7-day voyages had about 70% fewer cases than 14-day voyages. On 7-day voyages, the most effective interventions were reducing the number of individuals onboard (43-49% reduction in total infections) and testing passengers and crew (42-43% reduction in total infections). All four interventions reduced transmission by 80%, but no single intervention or combination eliminated transmission. Results were similar for 14-day voyages. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks on cruises were common during January-April 2020. Despite all interventions modeled, cruise travel still poses a significant SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk.","output":"Cruise ship travel in the era of COVID-19: A summary of outbreaks and a model of public health interventions"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin, albeit indicated for the treatment of skin structure infections, is used for a much wider range of infections. This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. METHODS: In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin.

We sought to identify the most compelling themes for vaping warnings for US adolescents. METHODS: Participants were a national probability sample of 623 US adolescents aged 13-17, recruited in summer 2020. Adolescents were randomized to one of five warning message themes about the potential health effects of vaping: 1) chemical harms, 2) lung harms, 3) COVID-19 harms, 4) nicotine addiction, or 5) control (messages about vape litter). The primary outcome was perceived message effectiveness (PME; 3-item scale). Secondary outcomes were negative affect (fear), attention, anticipated social interactions, and message novelty. RESULTS: Adolescents rated the chemical, lung, and COVID-19 harms warning messages higher on PME than nicotine addiction and control (all p<.05), while nicotine addiction was rated higher than control (p<.05). The chemical, lung, and COVID-19 harms warning themes also elicited greater negative affect than nicotine addiction and control (all p<.05). For all other secondary outcomes, the COVID-19 harms warning message theme was rated higher than nicotine addiction and control (all p<.05). CONCLUSION: Adolescents perceived warning message themes about lung, chemical, and COVID-19 health effects of vaping as more effective than nicotine addiction. To discourage vaping, the FDA and others should communicate to youth about the health effects of vaping beyond nicotine addiction. IMPLICATIONS: Adolescents perceived warning message themes about the lung, chemical, and COVID-19 health effects of vaping as more effective than nicotine addiction, while nicotine addiction was perceived as more effective than control themes about vaping litter. To discourage vaping among adolescents, health messaging should expand message themes to communicate about a broader set of health effects of vaping beyond nicotine addiction.","output":"Identifying promising themes for adolescent vaping warnings: A national experiment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of informal care and shown that women continue to shoulder the brunt of responsibilities in this area. In this study, we analyzed differences in caregiving and self-perceived health in a group of informal male and female caregivers 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a cross-sectional survey of 261 informal caregivers (165 women and 96 men) in two regions of Spain using computer-assisted telephone interviewing between February and April 2021. We performed descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses to calculate the odds of poor self-perceived health according to different caregiver, care recipient, and caregiving characteristics. We also analyzed the perceived effects of the pandemic on caregiving, caregiver health, and other aspects of life. Compared with male caregivers, female caregivers were more likely to experience increases in caregiving intensity and burden and a decline in self-perceived health as a result of the pandemic. Men providing high-intensity care, however, also reported deteriorated health. Men experienced fewer reductions in informal support, a factor that exerted a protective health effect. Women, by contrast, experienced a reduction in all support systems and in this case, a third-level education exerted a protective effect. Our results provide key insights that should be taken into account to design gender-based interventions aimed at supporting already stretched and burdened caregivers.

Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. METHODS: To look at phase 3 from the endpointin this case hospital admissionshould facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. RESULTS: Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients.

Then, to facilitate mRNA hybridization, graphene sensing mesa were coated with an ultrathin sub-percolation threshold gold film for bonding 3'-thiolated single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (ssDNA) probes complementary to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene. Sub-percolated gold was used to minimize the distance between the graphene material and surface hybridization events. The liquid-transfer characteristics of the graphene FETs repeatedly shows correlation between the Dirac voltage and the copy number of polynucleotide. Ultrathin percolated gold films on graphene FETs facilitate two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) mRNA biosensors for transcriptomic profiling.","output":"Coronavirus RNA Sensor Using Single-Stranded DNA Bonded to Sub-Percolated Gold Films on Monolayer Graphene Field-Effect Transistors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Microfluidics-based lab-on-chip (LOC) systems are an active research area that is revolutionising high-throughput sequencing for the fast, sensitive and accurate detection of a variety of pathogens.

Many countries implemented social distancing and lockdown strategies that negatively impacted their economies and the psychological wellbeing of their citizens, even though they contributed to saving lives. Recently approved and available, COVID-19 vaccines can provide a really viable and sustainable option for controlling the pandemic. However, their uptake represents a global challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and logisticCorganizational hurdles that have made its distribution stagnant in several developed countries despite several appeals by the media, policy- and decision-makers, and community leaders. Vaccine distribution is also a concern in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of doses. The objective of the present study was to set up a metric to assess vaccination uptake and identify national socio-economic factors influencing this indicator. We conducted a cross-country study. We first estimated the vaccination uptake rate across countries by fitting a logistic model to reported daily case numbers. Using the uptake rate, we estimated the vaccine roll-out index. Next, we used Random Forest, an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm, to study the association between vaccination uptake rate and socio-economic factors. We found that the mean vaccine roll-out index is 0.016 (standard deviation 0.016), with a range between 0.0001 (Haiti) and 0.0829 (Mongolia). The top four factors associated with the vaccine roll-out index are the median per capita income, human development index, percentage of individuals who have used the internet in the last three months, and health expenditure per capita. The still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the disparity in vaccine adoption across low- and high-income countries, which represents a global public health challenge. We must pave the way for universal access to vaccines and other approved treatments, regardless of demographic structures and underlying health conditions. Income disparity remains, instead, an important cause of vaccine inequity, which restricts the functioning of the global vaccine allocation framework and, thus, the ending of the pandemic. Stronger mechanisms are needed to foster countries political willingness to promote vaccine and drug access equity in a globalized society where future pandemics and other global health crises can be anticipated.","output":"Assessing Inequities in COVID-19 Vaccine Roll-Out Strategy Programs: A Cross-Country Study Using a Machine Learning Approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A cell-based assay was developed to screen small interference RNA (siRNA) to block the expression of two genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus. These two genes encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) and envelope E protein. The RDRP plays an essential role in viral RNA replication where envelope E protein is involved in envelope formation and virus assembly. The RDRP and envelope E genes, based on published sequences, have been synthesized and cloned into mammalian expression vectors. In addition, four siRNA sites for the RDRP gene and two siRNA sites for envelope E gene were designed and tested. The siRNA or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassettes were co-transfected with the SARS viral RDRP or envelope E expression vectors into NIH 3T3 cells. The expression levels of RDRP and envelope E genes were examined by reverse transcription followed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two of the siRNA expression cassettes for RDRP successfully inhibited the expression of the gene, whereas both of the siRNA expression cassettes for envelope E decreased approx 90% of the envelope E gene expression. The siRNA and shRNA for one of the siRNA sites of the RDRP gene were also tested, and it was found that both inhibited exogenous RDRP expression in a dose-dependent manner. These siRNA molecules could be used to examine the function of these genes in SARS virus replication and assembly.

METHODS Four PSMA inhibitors derived from the glutamate-urea-glutamate or glutamate-urea-lysine pharmacophores conjugated to CIM or TIM chelators were radiolabeled with (99m)Tc and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS High-affinity, saturable binding to PSMA on LNCaP cells was observed with Kd values of 0.64  0.46 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1427, 1.07  0.89 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1404, 1.75  0.32 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1428, and 4.35  0.35 nM for (99m)Tc-MIP-1405. (99m)Tc-labeled PSMA inhibitors did not bind human prostate cancer PC3 cells, which lack PSMA, demonstrating specificity, and binding was abolished with 2-(phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid (PMPA), a structurally unrelated PSMA inhibitor. (99m)Tc-labeled PSMA inhibitors were shown to internalize at 37 C. Uptake in LNCaP xenografts ranged from 9.3% to 12.4% injected dose per gram at 1 h after injection and from 7.2% to 11.0% at 4 h, with tumor-to-blood ratios ranging from 29:1 to 550:1 and tumor-to-skeletal muscle ratios ranging from 31:1 to 157:1 at 4 h.

The treatment of Pipkin fractures is very challenging, especially for small trauma centers, because of the unusual fracture patterns and high-level surgical skills required. CASE PRESENTATION: Between 2017 and 2020, nine cases of Pipkin fractures came to the Emergency Department at the Trauma Center of our Hospital in Rome. Inclusion criteria were the diagnosis of femoral head fracture, the open reduction and internal fixation as surgical choice and at least 24 months follow-up. Patients older than 65 years and those treated through total hip replacement or combined hip procedure (CHP) were excluded. Thus, five patients were included in our case series. The clinical outcome was evaluated according to Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index, Vail Hip score, modified Harris Hip score and Merle DAubign Postel score. Radiographic assessment was scored according to Epstein-Thompson classification and heterotopic ossification was assessed through Brooker classification. The mean follow-up was 24 months (range 12-24). Average modified Harris Hip score was 92.1 points (range 75.9C100), and the average Vail score was 81.8 (range 55-95).

Chest CT scans are emerging as a useful tool in the diagnostic process of viral pneumonia cases associated with COVID-19. This review examines the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). METHODS: Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 in its various phases was compared using RT-PCR as a gold standard. A reverse calculation approach was applied and treated chest CT as a hypothetical gold standard and compared RT-PCR to it point out the flaw of the standard approach. RESULTS: High sensitivity (67C100%) and relatively low specificity (25C80%) was reported for the CT scans. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was reported to be modest (53C88%), hence cannot serve as an appropriate ground truth. The reverse calculation approach showed that CT could have a higher specificity (83C100%) if we consider the modest sensitivity of the RT-PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity and specificity of the chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 and the radiation exposure have to be judged together. Arguments are presented that chest CT scans have added value in diagnosing COVID-19 especially in patients, who exhibit typical clinical symptoms and have negative RT-PCR results in highly infected regions.

While wastewater-based epidemiology has been implemented as an alternative/additional monitoring tool to reduce reporting bias, the relationship between passive and wastewater surveillance data has yet to be explicitly examined. Since there is strong age dependency in the symptomatic ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infections, this study aimed to estimate i) an age-dependent association between the number of reported cases and the viral load in wastewater and ii) the time lag between those time series. The viral load in wastewater was modeled as a combination of contributions from different age groups' virus shedding, incorporating the delay, and fitted with daily case count data collected from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in wastewater collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. The estimated lag between the time series of viral loads in wastewater and of reported cases was 10.8 days (95% confidence interval =[10.2, 11.6]) for wastewater treatment plant's northern area and 8.8 days [8.4, 9.1] for southern area.

Effective public health preparedness and response to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, in the absence of vaccine or effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, is recommended by WHO to bring the pandemic under control. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the implementation of NPIs with different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results reveal that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations. Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In conclusion, the projection result reveals that the projected number of hospital cases is higher than the Ethiopian health system capacity during the peak time.

Thus, all stakeholders playing a role in COVID-19 deseases, including policy makers, researchers, publishers and journals, should prioritize well-designed meta-analyses, performed only when the background information seem suitable, and discouraging those of low quality or that use suboptimal methods.","output":"COVID-19 meta-analyses: a scoping review and quality assessment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is causing great alarm around the world. The pathogen for COVID-19 - severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) - is the seventh known coronavirus to cause pneumonia in humans. While much remains unknown about SARS-CoV-2, physicians and researchers have begun to publish relevant findings, and much evidence is available on coronaviruses previously circulating in human and animal populations. In this review, we situate COVID-19 in its context as a transboundary viral disease, and provide a comprehensive discussion focused on the discovery, spread, virology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of this disease, its causative coronaviral pathogen, and approaches to combating the disease through immunotherapies and other treatments and vaccine development. An epidemiological survey revealed a potentially large number of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers within the population, which may hamper efforts against COVID-19. Finally, we emphasize that vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, which may be developed by 2021, will be essential for prevention of COVID-19.","output":"Coronavirus disease 2019-Historical context, virology, pathogenesis, immunotherapy, and vaccine development"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increasing human Adenovirus (HAdV) infections complicated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) even fatal outcome were reported in immunocompetent adolescent and adult patients. Here, we characterized the cytokine/chemokine expression profiles of immunocompetent patients complicated with ARDS during HAdV infection and identified biomarkers for disease severity/progression. Forty-eight cytokines/chemokines in the plasma samples from 19 HAdV-infected immunocompetent adolescent and adult patients (ten complicated with ARDS) were measured and analyzed in combination with clinical indices. Immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2, 2009 pandemic H1N1 (panH1N1) or bacteria were included for comparative analyses. Similar indices of disease course/progression were found in immunocompetent patients with ARDS caused by HAdV, SARS-CoV-2 or panH1N infections, whereas the HAdV-infected group showed a higher prevalence of viremia, as well as increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK). Expression levels of 33 cytokines/chemokines were increased significantly in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS compared with that in healthy controls, and many of them were also significantly higher than those in SARS-CoV-2-infected and panH1N1-infected patients. Expression of interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-1, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), monokine induced by IFN- (MIG), IL-6, macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), IL-10, IL-1 and IL-2Ra was significantly higher in HAdV-infected patients with ARDS than that in those without ARDS, and negatively associated with the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO(2)/FiO(2)). Analyses of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) showed that expression of IL-10, M-CSF, MIG, HGF, IL-1, IFN- and IL-2Ra could predict the progression of HAdV infection, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.944 obtained for IL-10. Of note, the AUC value for the combination of IL-10, IFN-, and M-CSF reached 1. In conclusion, the cytokine storm occurred during HAdV infection in immunocompetent patients, and expression of IL-10, M-CSF, MIG, HGF, IL-1, IFN- and IL-2Ra was closely associated with disease severity and could predict disease progression.","output":"Cytokine/Chemokine Expression Is Closely Associated Disease Severity of Human Adenovirus Infections in Immunocompetent Adults and Predicts Disease Progression"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In many industrial sectors, there is a need for reliable ways to evaluate the safety of chemicals with methods anchored to human biology and pathology. For this purpose, many animal-free new approach methods (NAMs) have been developed and implemented in various stages of risk assessment. Now it is time to assemble individual NAMs into a comprehensive next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) strategy. The European Horizon 2020 RISK-HUNT3R project (\\"Risk assessment of chemicals integrating human-centric next-generation testing strategies promoting the 3Rs\\") has been designed to promote a combination of computational toxicology, in vitro toxicology, and systems biology. It is assumed that this approach will lead to faster and more accurate risk assessment procedures. The RISK-HUNT3R NGRA strategy will be developed to address the implementation of a comprehensive NAM toolbox into the regulatory framework. Critical conceptual approaches of the project include i) the integration of human-relevant data on biotransformation and elimination, ii) the translation of high-content mode-of-action datasets into predictions of adverse outcomes, iii) development of quantitative adverse outcome pathways (qAOPs), and iv) quantification of uncertainties associated with the predictions based on NGRA strategies. Many of the project steps will be used iteratively to generate datasets with sufficient quality and certainty for NGRA. Scientists and regulators will work together on case studies to evaluate NAMs' practical applicability and the strategies to combine information therefrom. Here we delineate how the strategy will be deployed to establish an overall NGRA framework for chemicals, pesticides, food additives, and drugs.","output":"Next-generation risk assessment of chemicals - Rolling out a human-centric testing strategy to drive 3R implementation: The RISK-HUNT3R project perspective."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recombination is increasingly seen as an important means of shaping genetic diversity in RNA viruses. However, observed recombination frequencies vary widely among those viruses studied to date, with only sporadic occurrences reported in RNA viruses with negative-sense genomes. To determine the extent of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses, phylogenetic analyses of 79 gene sequence alignments from 35 negative-sense RNA viruses (a total of 2154 sequences) were carried out. Powerful evidence was found for recombination, in the form of incongruent phylogenetic trees between different gene regions, in only five sequences from Hantaan virus, Mumps virus and Newcastle disease virus. This is the first report of recombination in these viruses. More tentative evidence for recombination, where conflicting phylogenetic trees were observed (but were without strong bootstrap support) and/or where putative recombinant regions were very short, was found in three alignments from La Crosse virus and Puumala virus. Finally, patterns of sequence variation compatible with the action of recombination, but not definitive evidence for this process, were observed in a further ten viruses: Canine distemper virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus, Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, Influenza C virus, Lassa virus, Pirital virus, Rabies virus, Rift Valley Fever virus and Vesicular stomatitis virus. The possibility of recombination in these viruses should be investigated further. Overall, this study reveals that rates of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses are very much lower than those of mutation, with many viruses seemingly clonal on current data. Consequently, recombination rate is unlikely to be a trait that is set by natural selection to create advantageous or purge deleterious mutations.","output":"Phylogenetic analysis reveals a low rate of homologous recombination in negative-sense RNA viruses."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 crisis has magnified the issues plaguing academic science, but it has also provided the scientific establishment with an unprecedented opportunity to reset.

The measurement of skin conductance (SC) is considered as a measure of stress and a surrogate indicator of pain. To identify the extent of research conducted and to synthesize the validity evidence of SC for assessing acute pain in infants. METHODS Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping reviews was followed and nine electronic databases were searched. Data were analyzed thematically and presented descriptively including the following main categories: study information/details, sampling information, characteristics of participants and settings, SC outcome measures and validity evidence. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies with 1061 infants were included, including 23 cross-sectional observation studies and five interventional studies. Most studied infants with mild severity of illness (n=13) or healthy infants (n=12). The validity evidence of SC was tested in relation to referent pain measures (13 variables), stimuli (13 variables), age (2 variables) and other contextual variables (11 variables). SC was not significantly correlated with vital signs, except heart rate in two of the eight studies. SC was significantly correlated with the unidimensional behavioral pain assessment scales and crying time rather than multidimensional measurements. Fourteen of 16 studies (87.5%) showed that SC increased significantly during painful procedures. CONCLUSION Inconsistent findings on validity of SC exist. Future research should aim to identify the diagnostic test accuracy of SC compared to well-accepted referent pain measures in infants, study the validity evidence of SC in critically ill infants and employ rigorous research design and transparent reporting.","output":"The Validity of Skin Conductance for Assessing Acute Pain in Infants: A Scoping Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Countries around the world are still struggling due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The results show that the Acehnese are dissatisfied with the local government's performance in all districts or cities and at all stages, which include: anticipation, early detection, containment, control and mitigation, and elimination. Meanwhile, the top five priority recommendations are: conducting more rapid test and COVID-19 test; providing more test tools; performing detection; and inhibiting spread. These findings lead to many interpretations: lower trust towards the government, a poor health system, and potential influence on the political output. While vaccines are now being distributed in Aceh, the main focus is still to minimize spread and heal the sick.

Recent studies have been successful in detecting airborne SARS-CoV-2 RNA in indoor settings using active sampling methods. The cost, size, and maintenance of these samplers, however, limit their long-term monitoring ability in high-risk transmission areas. As an alternative, passive samplers can be small, lightweight, and inexpensive and do not require electrical power or maintenance for continual operation. Integration of passive samplers into wearable designs can be used to better understand personal exposure to the respiratory virus. This study evaluated the use of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based passive sampler to assess personal exposure to aerosol and droplet SARS-CoV-2. The rate of uptake of virus-laden aerosol on PDMS was determined in lab-based rotating drum experiments to estimate time-weighted averaged airborne viral concentrations from passive sampler viral loading. The passive sampler was then embedded in a wearable clip design and distributed to community members across Connecticut to surveil personal SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The virus was detected on clips worn by five of the 62 participants (8%) with personal exposure ranging from 4 to 112 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA/m(3), predominantly in indoor restaurant settings. Our findings demonstrate that PDMS-based passive samplers may serve as a useful exposure assessment tool for airborne viral exposure in real-world high-risk settings and provide avenues for early detection of potential cases and guidance on site-specific infection control protocols that preempt community transmission.","output":"Development and Application of a Polydimethylsiloxane-Based Passive Air Sampler to Assess Personal Exposure to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the behavior of a publicly available deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) bone age algorithm when presented with inappropriate data inputs in both radiological and non-radiological domains. METHODS: We evaluated a publicly available DCNN-based bone age application. The DCNN was trained on 12,612 pediatric hand radiographs and won the 2017 RSNA Pediatric Bone Age Challenge (concordance of 0.991 with radiologist ground-truth). We used the application to analyze 50 left-hand radiographs (appropriate data inputs) and seven classes of inappropriate data inputs in radiological (i.e., chest radiographs) and non-radiological (i.e., image of street numbers) domains. For each image, we noted if (1) the application distinguished between appropriate and inappropriate data inputs and (2) inference time per image. Mean inference times were compared using ANOVA. RESULTS: The 16Bit Bone Age application calculated bone age for all pediatric hand radiographs with mean inference time of 1.1 s. The application did not distinguish between pediatric hand radiographs and inappropriate image types, including radiological and non-radiological domains. The application inappropriately calculated bone age for all inappropriate image types, with mean inference time of 1.1 s for all categories (p = 1). CONCLUSION: A publicly available DCNN-based bone age application failed to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate data inputs and calculated bone age for inappropriate images.

SARS-CoV-2 infects the pancreas through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), where it is highly expressed compared to other organs, leading to pancreatic damage with subsequent impairment of insulin secretion and development of hyperglycemia even in non-DM patients. Thus, this review aims to provide an overview of the potential link between COVID-19 and hyperglycemia as a risk factor for DM development in relation to DM pharmacotherapy. For that, a systematic search was done in the database of MEDLINE through Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), and Wanfang Data. Data obtained underline that SARS-CoV-2 infection in DM patients is more severe and associated with poor clinical outcomes due to preexistence of comorbidities and inflammation disorders. SARS-CoV-2 infection impairs glucose homeostasis and metabolism in DM and non-DM patients due to cytokine storm (CS) development, downregulation of ACE2, and direct injury of pancreatic -cells. Therefore, the potent anti-inflammatory effect of diabetic pharmacotherapies such as metformin, pioglitazone, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2Is), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors may mitigate COVID-19 severity. In addition, some antidiabetic agents and also insulin may reduce SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and severity through the modulation of the ACE2 receptor expression. The findings presented here illustrate that insulin therapy might seem as more appropriate than other anti-DM pharmacotherapies in the management of COVID-19 patients with DM due to low risk of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

Areas of visceral adipose tissue (VATA) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SATA) were obtained by measuring CT images at the level of the 3rd lumbar vertebra. Visceral adipose tissue index (VATI) and subcutaneous adipose index (SATI) were obtained by normalizing the square of height to analyze the distribution of the above indexes and visceral obesity among different body mass index (BMI), gender and age. RESULTS: The mean age of this healthy population was 45.3  15.2 years and the mean BMI was 23.5  3.2 kg/m(2), with 902 men and 885 women. Compared with women, men had a significantly higher median VATA (120.9 vs. 67.2 cm(2)), VATI (39.1 vs. 25.6 cm(2)/m(2)) and a significantly higher percentage of visceral adiposity (VATA  100 cm(2)) (60.8 vs. 30.4%), while women had significantly higher SATA (116.9 vs. 146.7 cm(2)) and SATI (38.8 vs. 55.8 cm(2)/m(2)) than men.

Our structural hypothesis model starting from social engagement to new-onset sarcopenia was suitable (root mean square error of approximation = 0.031, goodness-of-fit index = 0.967, adjusted goodness-of-fit index = 0.954, comparative fix index = 0.911, parsimonious comparative fit index = 0.755; all paths were significant), showing direct effects of social engagement on psychological status, physical activity and oral function, and indirect effects on nutritional status through oral function and psychological status. CONCLUSIONS The present results showed that social engagement could potentially decrease new-onset sarcopenia risks by influencing multidimensional factors, such as physical activity, oral function, and psychological and nutritional status. To prevent sarcopenia, it might be essential to promote social engagement through populational approaches.

In this study, data of SARS coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors; a key drug target in the coronavirus genome was retrieved from CHEMBL database. Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) studies, Molecular docking, Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion-Toxicity (ADMET) and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) were carried out using these 3CLpro inhibitors. QSAR model constructed using the data had correlation coefficient R2 value of 0.907; cross-validated correlation coefficient Q2 value of 0.866 and test set predicted correlation coefficient R2pred value of 0.517. Variance inflation factor (VIF) values for descriptors contained in the model ranged from 1.352 to 1.68, hence, these descriptors were orthogonal to one another. Therefore, the model was statistically significant and can be used to screen and design new molecules for their inhibitory activity against 3CLpro. Molecular docking showed that seven of the compounds (inhibitors) used in the study had a remarkable binding affinity (-9.2 to -10.3 kcal/mol) for 3CLpro. ADMET study revealed that five (CHEMBL Accession IDs 19438, 196635, 377150, 208763, and 210097) of the seven compounds with good binding ability obeyed Lipinski's rule of five. Hence, they were compounds with drug-like properties. MDS analysis revealed that 3CLpro-compound 21, 3CLpro-compound 22, 3CLpro-compound 40 complexes are very stable as compared to the reference 3CLpro-X77 complex. Therefore, this study identified three potent inhibitors of 3CLpro viz.

It has been regarded as the principal cause of acquired heart disease in children of the developed countries. Interleukin (IL)-37, as one of the IL-1 family members, is a natural suppressor of inflammation that is caused by activation of innate and adaptive immunity. However, detailed roles of IL-37 in KD are largely unclear. Sera from patients with KD displayed that IL-37 level was significantly decreased compared with healthy controls (HCs). QRT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that the expression level of IL-37 variant, IL-37b, was remarkably downregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to KD sera-treated THP1 cells. Therefore, we researched the role of IL-37b in the context of KD and hypothesized that IL-37b may have a powerful protective effect in KD patients. We first observed and substantiated the protective role of IL-37b in a mouse model of KD induced by Candida albicans cell wall extracts (CAWS). In vitro experiments demonstrated that IL-37b alleviated endothelial cell apoptosis and inflammation via IL-1R8 receptor by inhibiting ERK and NFB activation, which were also recapitulated in the KD mouse model. Together, our findings suggest that IL-37b play an effective protective role in coronary endothelial damage in KD, providing new evidence that IL-37b is a potential candidate drug to treat KD.","output":"IL-37b alleviates endothelial cell apoptosis and inflammation in Kawasaki disease through IL-1R8 pathway"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"China is a key player, not just an actor, in the global search for health security Reiteration of this point is useful for International Relations studies, which often portray China as a factor to contend with, especially given the background of the country as the first to report the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic This paper adopts an analytical framework developed through a summary of routines in Chinese engagement in global health from a practitioners perspective: aid, interdependence, governance and knowledge These are the core elements in a countrys pursuit of engagement with the rest of the world After the introduction, the second section of the paper reviews contributions from China in the history of global plague control over the past century The third section discusses structural issues affecting access to vaccines, which are essential for bringing COVID-19 under effective control The fourth section identifies a number of challenges China is facing in global health governance The final section offers a few concluding thoughts, reiterating the nature of interdependence in the global search for enhancement of health security","output":"China and the global search for health security: history, vaccines, and governance"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Patient safety is a key priority of the National Department of Health.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the epidemiology (incidence, nature and root causes) of PSIs at a long-term rehabilitative hospital between April 2011 and March 2016. METHOD: Data were collected through a review and analysis of routinely collected hospital information on patient records and from the PSI register, as well as minutes of adverse health events meetings, quality assurance reports and patient complaints register. RESULTS: A total or 4.12 PSIs per 10 000 inpatient days were reported. Approximately 52% of the adverse health events occurred in females with most of the adverse health events occurring in the 50C59 years category: 96% being reported during the day and 33% within the shift change. Pressure ulcers, falls, injury, hospital acquired infections and medication error were the most commonly reported PSIs. Patient factors were listed as the most common root cause for the PSIs. CONCLUSION: The study shows a low reporting rate of PSIs whilst showing a diverse pattern of PSIs over a period of 5 years. There is a need for active change management in order to establish a blame-free culture and learning environment to improve reporting of PSI.

This study will assess the impact of theory-based messages on COVID-19 vaccination intention, drawing on the Necessity-Concerns framework to address previously reported beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination, and assess whether hypothesised variables (illness coherence, perceived necessity and concerns) mediate change in vaccination intention. TRIAL DESIGN: Prospective, parallel two-arm, individually randomised (1:1) trial. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged over 18 years, living in Scotland and not vaccinated for COVID-19. A quota sampling approach will be used with the aim of achieving a nationally representative sample on gender, region and ethnic group, with oversampling of individuals with no educational qualifications or with only school-level qualifications. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages addressing necessity beliefs and concerns about COVID-19 vaccination. Comparator: Brief exposure to online text and image-based messages containing general information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary outcome: Self-reported intention to receive a vaccine for COVID-19 if invited, immediately post-intervention. Secondary outcomes: Self-reported COVID-19 illness coherence, perceived necessity of a COVID-19 vaccine and concerns about a COVID-19 vaccine, immediately post-intervention. RANDOMISATION: Quasi-randomisation performed automatically by online survey software, by creating a variable derived from the number of seconds in the minute that the participant initiates the survey.

However, their consequences in terms of mental well-being might be negative, especially for older adults.

Using data from the SHARE Corona Survey, we include retired respondents aged 60 and above from 25 European countries plus Israel. Combining SHARE data with macro-data from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker allows us to include macro-indicators at the country level, namely the number of deaths per 100,000 and the number of days with stringent epidemic control measures, in addition to individual characteristics. The findings show that both macro-indicators are influential for increased feelings of sadness/depression, but that individual factors are crucial for explaining increased feelings of loneliness in the time after the first lockdown. Models with interaction terms reveal that the included macro-indicators have negative well-being consequences, particularly for the oldest survey participants.

The purpose of our article is to demonstrate how the interRAI LTC facility (LTCF) assessment can inform clinical care and evaluate the effect of strategies to mitigate worsening mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a supporting analysis of the effects of lockdown in homes without COVID-19 outbreaks on depression, delirium, and behavior problems in a network of 7 LTC homes in New Brunswick, Canada, where mitigative strategies were deployed to minimize poor mental health outcomes (eg, virtual visits and increased student volunteers). This network meets regularly to review performance on risk-adjusted quality of care indicators from the interRAI LTCF and share learning through a community of practice model. We included 4209 assessments from 765 LTC residents between January 2017 to June 2020 and modeled the change within and between residents for depression, delirium, and behavioral problems over time with longitudinal generalized estimating equations. Though the number of residents who had in-person visits with family decreased from 73.2% before to 17.9% during lockdown (chi square, P < .001), the number of residents experiencing delirium (4.5%-3.5%, P = .51) and behavioral problems (35.5%-30.2%, P = .19) did not change. The proportion of residents with indications of depression decreased from 19.9% before to 11.5% during lockdown (P < .002). The final multivariate models indicate that the effect of lockdown was not statistically significant on depression, delirium, or behavioral problems.

Adults (N = 325, M age = 39.7, SD = 12.3) were surveyed before the pandemic began and at four additional time points throughout the first 4 months of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. Participants provided demographic information and completed measures of positive and negative affect. Latent growth curves were used to analyze changes in well-being over time, with age as a covariate. There was a significant linear increase in positive affect. Older age was positively associated with initial levels, but age was not associated with the slope. There was a significant curvilinear pattern in negative affect, with an initial increase, which, although remaining elevated, exhibited slow decreases over time. Age was significantly and negatively associated with initial negative affect, but age did not influence the shape or rate of change over time. We detected changes in both positive affect and negative affect during the first 4 months of COVID-19.

Studies that are now a decade old report worse self-rated health among rural than among urban residents (3,4). Whether the rural disadvantage persists in 2021 is uncertain and the contributing factors to contemporary rural-urban variations in self-rated health are not known. Rural America is diverse by population size and adjacency to metropolitan areas, and rural populations vary demographically and socioeconomically. This analysis used data from the National Well-being Survey (NWS), a national sample of approximately 4,000 U.S. working-aged adults conducted during February and March 2021 to examine differences in self-rated physical health among residents of large urban; medium/small urban; metro-adjacent rural; and remote rural counties. Residents of medium/small urban, metro-adjacent rural, and remote rural counties had significantly higher probabilities of reporting fair/poor self-rated physical health than their large urban county peers. There were no significant differences by sex or race/ethnicity in self-rated physical health. Individual-level socioeconomic resources (including higher educational attainment, higher household income, and higher probability of employment) contributed to the advantage among residents of large urban counties. Although there is no single solution to reducing rural-urban health disparities, these findings suggest that reducing socioeconomic disparities is essential.","output":"Self-Rated Physical Health Among Working-Aged Adults Along the Rural-Urban Continuum  United States, 2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide new insight into the modern slavery threat and to enhance its detection in supply chains by understanding and addressing barriers to whistleblowing. A broad definition of a whistle-blower is adopted, which includes any witness internal or external to an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: This is a viewpoint paper that includes using news reports and other secondary data sources on a recent modern slavery scandal in garment factories in Leicester, UK and the lens of the bystander effect from the social psychology literature. The core focus is on whistleblowing by members of the local community in which an operation or supply chain is embedded. Findings: The phenomenon of modern slavery being an open secret within the local community is highlighted. But rather than the case being characterised by widespread whistleblowing, the problem only came into full focus when poor working conditions and forced labour during COVID-19 lockdown restrictions contributed to the spread of the virus. It is argued that overcoming this bystander effect can lead to the greater mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing. Research limitations/implications: Two sets of propositions and a conceptual model are provided and seven future research suggestions are outlined, including extending the present study to whistleblowing by victims and other internal members of an organisation or supply chain. Practical implications: If it can be mobilised, then whistleblowing has the potential to be an important part of detecting modern slavery, either temporarily replacing audits where they are not possible due to social distancing restrictions or directing the use of limited auditing resources to high-risk factories. In this way, combinations of practices can be effectively used to tackle the threat. Social implications: This contributes to addressing an important societal problem and one of the grandest challenges facing modern-day supply chains. This, it has been argued, is an even bigger problem now than ever before given the economic and market conditions created by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Originality/value: This is the first paper to focus on operationalising the practice of whistleblowing as a source of greater supply chain intelligence to aid modern slavery detection. Causes of the bystander effect include the perceived low-emergency threat of modern slavery, the high-ambiguity environment, a low bystander responsibility and low assistance/intervention incentive. Countermeasures include elevating the emergency status of modern slavery, creating a shared sense of responsibility for tackling the problem, having clear reporting channels and taking swift and consistent action when instances of modern slavery are detected. ? 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","output":"Hidden in plain sight: the bystander effect and the mobilisation of modern slavery whistleblowing"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led to a halt in elective surgeries throughout the United States and many other countries throughout the world. Early reports suggest that COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery have an increased risk of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission and overall mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all COVID-19, positive with polymerase chain reaction confirmation, patients who had surgery between February 17, 2020 and April 26, 2020 at a major New York City hospital. Clinical characteristics and outcomes including ICU admission, ventilator requirement, and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-nine COVID-19 surgical patients were identified. Mean age was 53.9 y, and there were more men than women in the cohort (56.4% versus 43.6%). Twenty-two patients (56.4%) had a confirmed positive COVID-19 test preoperatively, and the remainder tested positive after their procedure. The majority (59%) of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 3 or higher. Postoperatively, 7 patients (17.9%) required ICU level care with a mean length of stay of 7.7 d. There were 4 deaths (10.3%) in this patient population, all of which occurred in patients who were ASA class 3 or 4. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest study to date, that objectively analyzes the outcomes of COVID-19 positive patients who underwent surgery. Overall, ICU admission rates and mortality are similar to reported rates in the literature for nonsurgical COVID-19 patients.

Existing evidence suggests that it is effective for patients with psychotic disorders in high-income countries. We tested the effectiveness of DIALOG ?+ ?for patients with depressive and anxiety disorders in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a middle-income country. METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, cluster randomised controlled trial of DIALOG+ in an outpatient clinic in Sarajevo. Patients inclusion criteria were: 18 years and older, a diagnosis of depressive or anxiety disorders, and low quality of life. Clinicians and their patients were randomly allocated to either the DIALOG ?+ ?intervention or routine care in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome, quality of life, and secondary outcomes, psychiatric symptoms and objective social outcomes, were measured at 6- and 12-months by blinded assessors. RESULTS: Fifteen clinicians and 72 patients were randomised. Loss to follow-up was 12% at 6-months and 19% at 12-months. Quality of life did not significantly differ between intervention and control group after six months, but patients receiving DIALOG ?+ ?had significantly better quality of life after 12 months, with a medium effect size (Cohen's d ?= ?0.632, p ?= ?0.007).

Rapid degradation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) by dsRNA-degrading nucleases (dsRNases) has been implicated to cause low RNAi efficiency in several insect species. In this study, we identified four dsRNase genes (OfdsRNase1, OfdsRNase2, OfdsRNase3 and OfdsRNase4) from the Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) transcriptome database. Bioinformatic analyses showed that each deduced protein sequence contained endonuclease NS domains and signal peptides. Gene expression analysis revealed that OfdsRNase2 was exclusively expressed in the midgut of larvae. RNAi efficiency was investigated in 2-day-old fifth-instar larvae (high expression of dsRNase2) and 2-day-old pupae (low expression of dsRNase2) by feeding or injecting dsRNA targeting a marker gene that encodes the lethal giant larvae protein (OfLgl). Our results showed that OfLgl only partially silenced the expression of OfLgl in pupae, but not in larvae, suggesting that OfdsRNase2 could contribute to lower RNAi efficiency in larval stages. This hypothesis was supported by our RNAi-of-RNAi experiment using a tissue culture technique where the silencing efficiency against the reporter gene, OfHex1, was significantly improved after knockdown of OfdsRNase2. When double luciferase assays were performed to evaluate the role of the four dsRNases in vitro, only OfdsRNase2 expressed in S2 cells significantly affected RNAi efficiency by degrading dsRNA. Taken together, our results suggested that the degradation of dsRNA by OfdsRNase2 in the midgut contributed to low RNAi efficiency in O. furnacalis larvae. This article is protected by copyright.

Military treatment facilities serve unique patients that have a service connection; thus, research and data on this population are relatively sparse. The purpose of this study was to provide descriptive data on characteristics and outcomes of MTF patients with COVID-19 who are treated with heated high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study at the Wright-Patterson Medical Center, a 52-bed hospital in an urban setting. We received approval from our Institutional Review Board. The cohort included patients admitted from June 1, 2020, through May 15, 2021 with severe or life-threatening COVID-19 from a positive severe acute respiratory syndromeCrelated coronavirus 2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test who were placed on HHFNC during their hospital stay. Severe disease was defined as dyspnea, respiratory rate 30/min, blood oxygen saturation 93% without supplemental oxygen, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio <300, or lung infiltrates involving >50% of lung fields within 24-48 hours. Life-threatening disease was defined as having septic shock or multiple organ dysfunction or requiring intubation. Patients meeting these criteria were retrieved from a quality improvement cohort that represents a consecutive group of patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Wright-Patterson Medical Center. RESULTS: Our MTF managed 70 cases of severe or life-threatening COVID-19 from June 1, 2020, to May 15, 2021. Of the 70 cases, 19 (27%) were placed on HHFNC. After initiation of HHFNC, median SpO(2)/FiO(2) was 281.8 and at 24 hours 145.4. Median respiratory rate oxygenation at these times were 10.7 and 9.4, respectively. Fifty percent required mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Median intensive care unit length of stay was 11 days, with a maximum stay of 39 days. Median hospital length of stay was 12 days, with a maximum of 39 days. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective cohort study characterized and analyzed outcomes observed in a MTF population, with severe or life-threatening COVID-19, who were treated with HHFNC. While the study did not have the power to make concrete conclusions on the optimal form of respiratory support for COVID-19 patients, our data support HHFNC as a reasonable treatment modality despite some notable differences between our cohort and prior studied patient populations.","output":"Outcomes of Heated High Flow Nasal Cannula in Patients With Severe or Life-Threatening COVID-19 at a Military Treatment FacilityA Retrospective Cohort Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives: We examined the association between neighborhood characteristics and depressive symptoms in a population-based sample of dementia caregivers.

OBJECTIVE To compare a relatively new supraglottic airway device, the Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway (SLMA), with the CLMA in a cardiac arrest scenario. METHODS Fifty healthcare professionals inexperienced in advanced airway management attempted to insert both airway devices in a manikin in 2 scenarios: in the first, chest compressions were not performed (non-CPR scenario), and in the second, uninterrupted chest compressions were performed (CPR scenario). The primary end points were insertion time and success rate at first attempt. The level of self-confidence of each participant was recorded. RESULTS SLMA achieves faster insertion times both in the non-CPR (SLMA: 10.4  2.7 seconds vs CLMA: 13.4  3.2 seconds, P < .05) and in the CPR scenario (SLMA: 9.9  2.0 seconds Vs CLMA: 11.9  2.3 seconds, P < .05). The difference between first attempt success rates was not statistically significant both in the non-CPR (SLMA: 96% vs CLMA: 90%, P = .18) and in the CPR scenario (SLMA: 98% vs CLMA: 94%, P = .32). The participants are more self-confident using SLMA instead of CLMA (P < .001) and 94% of them would prefer SLMA for future use.

METHODS: This is a single-centre exploratory observational study aiming to recruit 50 patients with COVID-19 infection who will undergo cardiac biomarker sampling. Of these, 30 patients will undergo combined CTCA and 18F-FDG-PET/CT, followed by CMR. Prevalence of obstructive and non-obstructive atherosclerotic coronary disease will be assessed using CTCA.

These patients were compared with those treated in the same interval in 2019. RESULTS: In the 2020 study period, 4035 patients met the inclusion criteria (2019: 4526 patients). During the first lockdown, there was a significant reduction in the number of cholecystectomies performed (51.1% decrease). More patients with a higher risk profile underwent urgent operations, which were accompanied by a significant increase in conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy. The patients were treated as inpatients for a longer duration than 2019, and the mortality rate increased significantly to 1.3% (2019: 0.1%). The complication rate also showed a significant increase. After the end of the first lockdown, daily admission rates normalized very quickly. However, it was not possible to fully address the backlog of operations.

Integra Connect sought to assess its impact on new visits for cancer care by querying its Electronic Medical Record and Claims database as a surrogate for understanding Covid's impact on cancer care in the larger United States population. Methods: Using Real World Data (RWD) from over 1200 oncology providers in 14 large practice settings, comprising 250 plus care sites in the ICD, we measured new patient (Pt) and established Pt visits from 2018 through 2020. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) codes for new and established Pt's were applied to define cohorts. Disease states were defined using CMS Oncology Care Model (OCM) mapping to diagnosis codes. Because the ICD is heavily based in the Eastern US, we conducted a geographic analysis by segmenting providers by Northeast (NE) with 506 providers from NY, NJ, PA, and VA and Southeast (SE) with 578 providers from FL, GA, SC, and AL. We looked at visits across all tumor types and identified breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CC) as likely to be most affected by decreased screening, and multiple myeloma (MM) and advanced prostate cancer (APC) as likely to be vulnerable to delay in initiation of first treatment since treatment often trails diagnosis. Results: We found a decline in new patient volume (NPV) in '20 of -1% compared to '19;this compared to an anticipated increase of +7% based on growth in NPV in the ICD from '18 to '19. In the NE we saw NPV decrease in '20 by -7% vs. '19 but increase by +6% in the SE compared to '19. In comparing NPV '20 to '19 and '19 to '18, we saw a smaller increase for BC of +4% vs. +6% and for CC of +5% vs. +7%, respectively. Whereas in MM it was -7% vs. +3% and APC -6% vs. +8%. (See Table). Conclusions: Covid-19 has negatively impacted cancer care access. This RWD shows the number of both newly diagnosed Pts and those with initial oncologic intervention in established Pts, where symptoms traditionally have determined initiation of treatment, has declined year-overyear. The American Cancer Society projected new Pt cases to increase +2% in '20 to 1.806 million (ACS, Cancer Facts and Figures 2020), whereas in the ICD, that figure was projected +7% but resulted in -1%. This suggests a major expected reduction of new Pt cases in the US at large. The drop in cases during Covid-19 in our data was greater in the NE compared to the SE. In addition, the drop in the NE in our data was earlier and more prolonged than SE. While recovery occurred in both regions, after an initial overshoot following lockdowns, volumes plateaued at levels lower than pre-pandemic.","output":"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on access to new patient cancer care as evaluated in the Integra Connect Database (ICD)"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite significant developments and persistent efforts by scientists, cancer is one of the primary causes of human death worldwide No form of life on Earth can survive without iron, although some species can live without oxygen Iron presents a double\\\\edged sword Excess iron is a risk for carcinogenesis, while its deficiency causes anemia, leading to oxygen shortage Every cell is eventually destined to death, either through apoptosis or necrosis Regulated necrosis is recognized in distinct forms Ferroptosis is defined as catalytic Fe(II)\\\\dependent regulated necrosis accompanied by lipid peroxidation The main observation was necrosis of fibrosarcoma cells through inhibition of cystine/glutamate antiporter with erastin, which reduced intracellular cysteine and, thus, glutathione levels Our current understanding of ferroptosis is relative abundance of iron (catalytic Fe[II]) in comparison with sulfur (sulfhydryls) Thus, either excess iron or sulfur deficiency causes ferroptosis Cell proliferation inevitably requires iron for DNA synthesis and energy production Carcinogenesis is a process toward iron addiction with ferroptosis resistance Conversely, ferroptosis is associated with aging and neurodegeneration Ferroptosis of immune cells during infection is advantageous for infectious agents, whereas ferroptosis resistance incubates carcinogenic soil as excess iron Cancer cells are rich in catalytic Fe(II) Directing established cancer cells to ferroptosis is a novel strategy for discovering cancer therapies Appropriate iron regulation could be a tactic to reduce and delay carcinogenesis","output":"Ferroptosis at the crossroads of infection, aging and cancer"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: This study was conducted to retrospectively review chest computed tomography (CT) findings in a Brazilian cohort of patients with pneumonia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) METHODS: Chest CT scans of 78 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID-19), obtained in March and April 2020, were reviewed Of 78 cases, the CT scans of 48 (61 5%) showed lung opacities CT opacity features, their distribution, and the extent of infiltration were evaluated RESULTS: The most common CT findings were ground-glass opacities (97 9%), crazy-paving pattern (58 3%), and mixed pattern (18 8%) Rounded lung opacities were observed most frequently (70 8%) Other findings were cystic airspace changes (37 5%), vascular dilatation (35 4%), and the organizing pneumonia pattern (14 6%) The findings were frequently bilateral (87 5%), symmetrical (68 9%), and peripheral (60 2%) CONCLUSIONS: The most common CT findings were ground-glass opacities and the crazy-paving pattern Involvement was mostly bilateral, symmetrical, and peripheral Round opacity morphology was frequently observed and might have some degree of specificity to viral COVID-19 pneumonia","output":"Computed tomography findings in a Brazilian cohort of 48 patients with pneumonia due to coronavirus disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To describe the weight-related family functioning of racial minority families with low income using family systems theory as an interpretive framework.

This in turn could reverse all the progress achieved over the years in reducing maternal and child mortality. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the indirect effect of the pandemic on maternal and child health services in public health facilities. METHODS: Data pertaining to maternal and child health services being provided under specific Government programmes, were collected from public health facilities of District Sant Kabir Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, India. Comparative analysis of the data from the pandemic phase with data from the year 2019 was done to determine the impact on services. RESULTS: Reduced coverage across all maternal and child health interventions was observed in the study. There was an overall decrease of 2.26 % in number of institutional deliveries. Antenatal care services were the worst affected with 22.91% decline. Immunization services were also dramatically decreased by more than 20%. CONCLUSION: The response of the public healthcare delivery system to the Covid-19 Pandemic is negatively affecting both the provision and utilization of maternal and child healthcare services. It is deterrent to the progress achieved in maternal and child health parameters over the years. Better response strategies should be put in place to minimize lag in service deliwvery.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal and child health services in Uttar Pradesh, India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently causing a widespread outbreak centered on Hubei province, China and is a major public health concern.

Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is a specialized pro-resolving mediator derived endogenously from omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids. RvE1 (10 g/kg i.v.) was injected to rats 6 h post-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14 mg/kg) induction. After another 3 h, alveolar fluid clearance was measured in live rats (n = 8-9). The primary Type II alveolar epithelial cell was isolated and treated by LPS (1 g/mL) with or without RvE1 (250 nM). The expression of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), AKT, serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1), and Nedd4-2 were detected. RvE1 improved survival rate (30% vs. 70%, P = 0.048), increased the clearance of alveolar fluid (13.34% vs. 18.73%, P < 0.001), reduced lung wet-dry weight ratio (5.01 vs. 4.63, P < 0.001), mitigated lung injury scores (13.38 vs. 7.0, P < 0.05) and inflammation in LPS-induced ARDS in rats. RvE1 upregulated alveolar ENaC and NKA expression in vivo and in vitro. In addition, RvE1 significantly increased the expression of phosphorylated AKT, SGK1, and phosphorylated Nedd4-2 in LPS-stimulated primary alveolar type II cells. The effects of RvE1 were abrogated by blocking phosphatidylinositide3'-kinase (PI3K) and SGK1 with LY294002 and GSK650394, respectively. In summary, RvE1 upregulated ENaC and NKA expression by activating PI3K/AKT/SGK1 pathway to promote alveolar fluid clearance, suggesting that RvE1 may be a potentially effective drug for ARDS treatment.","output":"Pro-Resolving Mediator Resolvin E1 Restores Alveolar Fluid Clearance in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At present, googling the search terms \\"COVID-19\\" and \\"Functional foods\\" yields nearly 500,000,000 hits, witnessing the growing interest of the scientific community and the general public in the role of nutrition and nutraceuticals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, while high-resolution observations of activity patterns can provide insights into the ecology of animal species, few methods are able to measure the activity of individuals of small taxa in their natural environment. We present a novel approach in which the automated VHF radio-tracking of small vertebrates fitted with lightweight transmitters (< 0.2 g) is used to distinguish between active and passive behavioural states. A dataset containing > 3 million VHF signals was used to train and test a random forest model in the assignment of either active or passive behaviour to individuals from two forest-dwelling bat species (Myotis bechsteinii (n = 50) and Nyctalus leisleri (n = 20)). The applicability of the model to other taxonomic groups was demonstrated by recording and classifying the behaviour of a tagged bird and by simulating the effect of different types of vertebrate activity with the help of humans carrying transmitters. The random forest model successfully classified the activity states of bats as well as those of birds and humans, although the latter were not included in model training (F-score 0.96C0.98). The utility of the model in tackling ecologically relevant questions was demonstrated in a study of the differences in the daily activity patterns of the two bat species. The analysis showed a pronounced bimodal activity distribution of N. leisleri over the course of the night while the night-time activity of M. bechsteinii was relatively constant. These results show that significant differences in the timing of species activity according to ecological preferences or seasonality can be distinguished using our method. Our approach enables the assignment of VHF signal patterns to fundamental behavioural states with high precision and is applicable to different terrestrial and flying vertebrates. To encourage the broader use of our radio-tracking method, we provide the trained random forest models together with an R-package that includes all necessary data-processing functionalities. In combination with state-of-the-art open-source automated radio-tracking, this toolset can be used by the scientific community to investigate the activity patterns of small vertebrates with high temporal resolution, even in dense vegetation.","output":"Classifying the activity states of small vertebrates using automated VHF telemetry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background Autoimmune blistering disorders (AIBD) are rare, potentially life-threatening conditions often requiring immunosuppression. Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, infection risk and mortality in AIBD patients is unknown. Objective We report outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections in AIBD patients and determined if patients on rituximab have increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We examined clinical outcomes in ten AIBD patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 infections at an American hospital. We performed a retrospective analysis of 132 AIBD patients enrolled in a clinical trial. Results Patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 (n = 4) or death (n = 2) trended older. These patients had higher mortality than the national average (20% vs 1.6%). Our cohort included 52 patients with a history of rituximab treatment, 35 of whom were immunosuppressed by rituximab during the pandemic, and 45 patients never treated with rituximab. We found no difference between rates of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in AIBD patients immunosuppressed by rituximab compared to those not on rituximab (9.1% vs 12.1%). Limitations Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on demand rather than surveillance. Overall transmission varied over time and outcomes depended on accepted treatments. The small sample size of our cohort limits the generalizability of our results. Conclusion This study suggests that rituximab may not increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in AIBD patients.

However, little is known about the relation between the human microbiome and COVID-19, largely due to the fact that previous studies fail to provide high taxonomic resolution to identify microbes that likely interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we used whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing data together with assembly and binning strategies to reconstruct metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from a total of 514 nasopharyngeal and fecal samples of patients with COVID-19 and controls. We reconstructed a total of 11,584 medium-and high-quality microbial MAGs and obtained 5,403 non-redundant MAGs (nrMAGs) with strain-level resolution. We found that, thanks to the high taxonomic resolution of nrMAGs, the gut microbiome signatures can accurately distinguish COVID-19 cases from healthy controls and predict the progression of COVID-19. Moreover, we identified a set of nrMAGs with a putative causal role in the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and revealed their functional pathways that potentially interact with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

PROCEDURE Effectiveness of passive immunity provided to pigs via colostrum and milk was assessed after TGEV challenge exposure, and TGEV antibody responses in colostrum and milk were analyzed. RESULTS Mortality in the 3 groups of young pigs correlated with severity of clinical signs of TGEV infection and was highest in control litters (86% in group-A pigs) and lowest in litters of sows inoculated with PRCV in 2 subsequent pregnancies (14% in group-C pigs). Virus-neutralization and IgA and IgG TGEV antibody titers of milk collected from sows at challenge exposure had significant positive correlation with litter survival. Significantly higher numbers of TGEV-specific IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells were found in group-A pigs than in group-C pigs, suggesting that high titer of maternal antibodies (induced in group-C sows multiply exposed to PRCV) may interfere with active antibody responses.

Based on these data, features were obtained from traditional feature extraction methods using empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Deep features were also obtained using pre-trained ResNet50 and pre-trained MobileNet models. Feature selection was applied to all obtained features with the ReliefF algorithm. In this case, the highest 98.4% accuracy and 98.6% F1-score values were obtained by selecting the EMD + DWT features using ReliefF. In another study in which deep features were used, features obtained from ResNet50 and MobileNet using scalogram images were used. For the features selected using the ReliefF algorithm, the highest performance was found with support vector machines-cubic as 97.8% accuracy and 98.0% F1-score.

In the UK, as of August 2021, they have not been approved, except in a few limited circumstances. To date, little qualitative research exists to explain the reasons and nuances behind public attitudes on this issue. Methods Qualitative group and one-to-one online interviews were conducted with a diverse sample of 24 adults to explore their views on the issue of COVID-19 vaccination in children. Results COVID-19 vaccination in children was framed as a complex problem (a 'minefield'). Six themes emerged to explain participants views: (1) Uncertainty over whether children can catch, transmit or be severely harmed by COVID-19; (2) Lower risk tolerance for unknown longer-term effects of the vaccine in children; (3) Association of the vaccine program with government's handling of the pandemic; (4) Local social norms as a driver of hesitancy; (5) Vaccinating children as a way to protect vulnerable adults; (6) Children's vaccination as parental choice. Conclusions Public attitudes to COVID-19 vaccination in children are likely to be met with more hesitancy compared to adult vaccinations. Public health communications will need to combat this hesitancy if vaccine uptake for children is to be pursued as a public health policy.","output":"Public attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in children: A qualitative study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Russia has been currently in the \\"hard-hit\\" area of the COVID-19 outbreak, with more than 396,000 confirmed cases as of May 30. It is necessary to analyze and predict its epidemic situation to help formulate effective public health policies. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were developed to predict the cumulative confirmed, dead, and recovered cases, respectively. R 3.6.2 software was used to fit the data from January 31 to May 20, 2020, and predict the data for the next 30 days. The COVID-19 epidemic in Russia was divided into two stages and reached its peak in May. The epidemic began to stabilize on May 19. The case fatality rate has been at an extremely low level. ARIMA (2,2,1), ARIMA (3,2,0), and ARIMA (0,2,1) were the models of cumulative confirmed, dead, and recovered cases, respectively. After testing, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of three models were 0.6, 3.9, and 2.4, respectively. This paper indicates that Russia's health system capacity can effectively respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Three ARIMA models have a good fitting effect and can be used for short-term prediction of the COVID-19 trend, providing a theoretical basis for Russia to formulate new intervention policies.","output":"Analysis and Estimation of COVID-19 Spreading in Russia Based on ARIMA Model"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Internet of things (IoT) is the connection between devices by the use of the Internet.

Seventy-five involved human host genetic factors, 36 of which involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small numbers of research subjects and loci. Three additional case reports were described. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility (seven of which identified protective alleles) and 16 related to outcomes (three of which identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication/validation cohorts. Among other studies, 30 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 178 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, and 984 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis. Previous human studies have been limited by issues that may be less impactful now, including low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods; however, these may raise additional considerations.

However, the success of using information technology in pulmonary rehabilitation is dependent on the end-users competence in information technology and access to the Internet. The aim was to describe the access to, and the use, knowledge, and preferences of information technology and technical equipment among people with COPD. METHODS: Telephone interviews were conducted using a standardised questionnaire on information technology and technical devises addressing the household, access to and usage of the Internet, contact with authorities, e-commerce, security, the workplace, digital competence, and disabilities. Questions were also posed regarding participants views on a future eHealth tool for COPD, appropriate content, and the potential likelihood for them to use an eHealth tool for exercise training. RESULTS: In total 137 persons agreed to participate, 17 dropped out resulting in 120 included participants (response rate 88%). The participants (86 women) were aged 51 to 92 years (mean: 72.5), and all severity grades of COPD according to GOLD A-D were represented. Over 90% had access to the Internet. Smartphones were used by 81%, and over 90% used apps. Participants had high knowledge of how to use the Internet, 91% had used the Internet during the last 3 months, 85% almost every day. The most common requests for a future eHealth tool for COPD were evidence-based and trustworthy information on COPD, (including medication, exercise training, inhalation and breathing techniques), communication (chat) with others and with health carers. Access to individually adjusted exercise training, and support, (motivation via prompts, chat rooms, digital information board) was also desired. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that people with COPD in Sweden have high access and ability to use the Internet and information technology.

We analysed the nosocomial COVID-19 cases that occurred in healthcare workers and inpatients and their caregivers between January and 20(th) December 2020. Cases with two to four secondary cases were defined as MSEs and those with five or more secondary cases as SSEs. FINDINGS: We identified 21 nosocomial events (single-case events, n = 12 [57%]; MSE + SSE, n = 9 [43%]) involving 65 individuals with COVID-19. Of these 65 individuals, 21 (32%) were infectors. The infectors tended to have a longer duration between symptom onset and diagnostic confirmation than did the non-infectors (median 2 days vs. 0 days, P = 0.08). Importantly, 12 (18%) individuals were responsible for MSEs and 1 (2%) for an SSE, which collectively generated 35 (54%) secondary cases. CONCLUSION: In a hospital with thorough infection control measures, approximately 70% of the nosocomial cases of COVID-19 did not generate secondary cases, and one-fifth of the infectors were responsible for SSEs and MSEs, which accounted for approximately half of the total cases.

It is also the cause of largest number of deaths in women dying in cancers. During the last few years, researchers are proposing different convolutional neural network models in order to facilitate diagnostic process of breast cancer. Convolutional neural networks are showing promising results to classify cancers using image datasets. There is still a lack of standard models which can claim the best model because of unavailability of large datasets that can be used for models training and validation. Hence, researchers are now focusing on leveraging the transfer learning approach using pre-trained models as feature extractors that are trained over millions of different images. With this motivation, this paper considers eight different fine-tuned pre-trained models to observe how these models classify breast cancers applying on ultrasound images. We also propose a shallow custom convolutional neural network that outperforms the pre-trained models with respect to different performance metrics. The proposed model shows 100% accuracy and achieves 1.0 AUC score, whereas the best pre-trained model shows 92% accuracy and 0.972 AUC score. In order to avoid biasness, the model is trained using the fivefold cross validation technique. Moreover, the model is faster in training than the pre-trained models and requires a small number of trainable parameters.

(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) MTT assay was applied to investigate the effects of miR-153-3p transfection or PAQR3 administration on mesangial cell (MC) activity. ELISA assays were used to check the expression levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) related proteins. The bioinformatics method and dual-luciferase reporter assay were employed together to anticipate and check the targeting relationship between miR-153-3p and PAQR3. Western blot assays were applied to check the PAQR3, PI3K and AKT expression after miR-153-3p transfection or PAQR3 administration. RESULTS The expression level of miR-153-3p was lower in diabetic nephropathy patients, while the expression of PAQR3 was concomitantly higher. Upregulation of miR-153-3p can reduce MC proliferation and ECM accumulation. Further research indicated that miR-153-3p directly regulated PAQR3 expression via coupling with the 3'-UTR of PAQR3.

We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Exposed, Presymptomatic Infective, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health.

We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low prevalence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low prevalence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region.

Here, we aimed to explore the role of CAF-derived exosome miR-148b-3p in bladder cancer progression and chemosensitivity. METHODS Transwell, MTT, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were applied to assess the effects of CAF-derived exosomes on bladder cancer cell metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and chemosensitivity. A dual luciferase reporter assay was employed to evaluate the targeting relationship between miR-148b-3p and PTEN. Gain- and loss- of function assays were conducted to explore the roles of miR-148b-3p and PTEN in the behavior of bladder cancer cells. The role of PTEN in the metastasis, EMT and chemosensitivity of bladder cancer cells was assessed both in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS We found that CAF-derived exosomes promoted the metastasis, EMT and drug resistance of bladder cancer cells. We also found that CAF-derived exosomes could directly transport miR-148b-3p into bladder cancer cells. In a xenograft mouse model we found that CAF-derived exosomes increased miR-148b-3p expression levels and promoted tumor proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance.

By aggregating 51,476 real-time active COVID-19 case-data between 22 January 2021 and 4 February 2021 to district-level administrative units, the incidence, global and local Moran indexes were calculated. Spatial autoregressive models (SAR) complemented with geographical weighted regression (GWR) analyses were executed to determine potential demographic and socioeconomic indicators for COVID-19 spread in Malaysia. Highest active case counts were based in the Central, Southern and parts of East Malaysia regions of Malaysia.

METHODS: This is an ecological study. We included all confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 reported between February 24th and March 30th, 2020. For each province, we calculated the trend of contagion as the relative increase in the number of individuals infected between two time endpoints, assuming an exponential growth. Pearsons test was used to correlate the trend of contagion with a set of healthcare-associated, economic, and demographic parameters by province. The viruss spread was input as a dependent variable in a stepwise OLS regression model to test the association between rate of spread and province-level indicators. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that the spread of COVID-19 was correlated negatively with aging index (p-value = 0.003), and positively with public transportation per capita (p-value = 0.012), the % of private long-term care hospital beds and, to a lesser extent (p-value = 0.070), the % of private acute care hospital beds (p-value = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Demographic and socioeconomic factors, and healthcare organization variables were found associated with a significant difference in the rate of COVID-19 spread in 36 provinces of Northern Italy. An aging population seemed to naturally contain social contacts. The availability of healthcare resources and their coordination could play an important part in spreading infection.","output":"Demographic and socio-economic factors, and healthcare resource indicators associated with the rapid spread of COVID-19 in Northern Italy: An ecological study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the surge of online meetings, it has become more critical than ever to provide high-quality speech audio and live captioning under various noise conditions. However, most monaural speech enhancement (SE) models introduce processing artifacts and thus degrade the performance of downstream tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). This paper proposes a multi-task training framework to make the SE models unharmful to ASR. Because most ASR training samples do not have corresponding clean signal references, we alternately perform two model update steps called SE-step and ASR-step. The SE-step uses clean and noisy signal pairs and a signal-based loss function. The ASR-step applies a pre-trained ASR model to training signals enhanced with the SE model. A cross-entropy loss between the ASR output and reference transcriptions is calculated to update the SE model parameters. Experimental results with realistic large-scale settings using ASR models trained on 75,000-hour data show that the proposed framework improves the word error rate for the SE output by 11.82% with little compromise in the SE quality. Performance analysis is also carried out by changing the ASR model, the data used for the ASR-step, and the schedule of the two update steps.","output":"Human Listening and Live Captioning: Multi-Task Training for Speech Enhancement"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Color Duplex sonography (CDS) of temporal arteries and large vessels (LV) is a recently validated diagnostic methodology for Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). CDS combined with a fast-track approach (FTA) has improved the early diagnosis of the disease. Objectives: To assess FTA effects on the prevention of permanent visual loss (PVL), relapse and late complications of GCA compared to conventional practice. To assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on outcomes of GCA patients assessed with FTA. Methods: GCA patients diagnosed up to June 2020 at the Rheumatology Department, University of Pavia, were included. FTA was implemented since October 2016. FTA consists in the referral within 1 working day of a suspected GCA case to an expert rheumatologist who performs clinical evaluation and CDS. Results: One hundred sixty patients were recruited [female 120 (75%), mean age 72.4  8.2 years]. Sixty-three (39.4%) evaluated with FTA, 97 (60.6%) with conventional approach. FTA patients were older (75.1  7.6 vs. 70.6  8.2 years old; p < 0.001). Median follow-up duration was shorter in the FTA group compared to the conventional one (0.9 vs. 5.0 years; p < 0.001). There was no difference between the two cohorts regarding major vessel district involvement (LV-GCA 17.5% vs. 22.7%; p = 0.4). PVL occurred in 8 (12.7%) FTA patients and 26 (26.8%) conventional ones (p = 0.03). The relative risk of blindness in the conventional group was 2.11 (95% C.I. 1.02C4.36; P = 0.04) as compared to FTA. Median symptom latency of patients experiencing PVL was higher in the conventional group (23 days IQR 12C96 vs. 7 days IQR 4C10, p = 0.02). During COVID-19 there was a significant increase in the occurrence of PVL (40%) including bilateral blindness despite a regularly operating FTA clinic. Cumulative incidence of relapses and time to first relapse did not change after FTA introduction (P = 0.2). No difference in late complications (stenosis/aneurysms) was detected. Conclusions: FTA including CDS evaluation contributed to a substantial reduction of PVL in GCA by shortening the time to diagnosis and treatment initiation. Relapse rate did not change upon FTA introduction, highlighting the need for better disease activity monitoring and treatment strategies optimization based on risk stratification that would predict the occurrence of relapse during glucocorticoid de-escalation.","output":"Fast-Track Ultrasound Clinic for the Diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis Changes the Prognosis of the Disease but Not the Risk of Future Relapse"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Disaster is a serious public health issue. Health professionals and community residents are main players in disaster responses but their knowledge levels of disaster medicine are not readily available. This study aimed to evaluate knowledge levels and training needs of disaster medicine among potential disaster responders and presented a necessity to popularize disaster medicine education. METHODS: A self-reporting questionnaire survey on knowledge level and training needs of disaster medicine was conducted in Shanghai, China, in 2012. A total of randomly selected 547 health professionals, 456 medical students, and 1,526 local residents provided intact information. The total response rate was 93.7%. RESULTS: Overall, 1.3% of these participants have received systematic disaster medicine training. News media (87.1%) was the most common channel to acquire disaster medicine knowledge. Although health professionals were more knowledgeable than community residents, their knowledge structure of disaster medicine was not intact. Medical teachers were more knowledgeable than medical practitioners and health administrators (p = 0.002). Clinicians performed better than public health physicians (p<0.001), whereas public health students performed better than clinical medical students (p<0.001). In community residents, education background significantly affected the knowledge level on disaster medicine (p<0.001). Training needs of disaster medicine were generally high among the surveyed. Lecture and practical training were preferred teaching methods. The selected key and interested contents on disaster medicine training were similar between health professionals and medical students, while the priorities chosen by local residents were quite different from health professionals and medical students (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Traditional clinical-oriented medical education might lead to a huge gap between the knowledge level on disaster medicine and the current needs of disaster preparedness. Continuing medical education and public education plans on disaster medicine via media should be practice-oriented, and selectively applied to different populations and take the knowledge levels and training needs into consideration.","output":"Knowledge Levels and Training Needs of Disaster Medicine among Health Professionals, Medical Students, and Local Residents in Shanghai, China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization broadly categorize mass gathering events as high risk for amplification of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread in a community due to the nature of respiratory diseases and the transmission dynamics.

METHODS Retrospective study of all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and ISHPs in England that provided NHS-funded elective surgery. We used data from the England-wide Hospital Episode Statistics to study 18 common surgical procedures performed between 2006 and 2019. In-hospital outcomes included length of stay, emergency transfers to another hospital or death. Posthospital outcomes included readmission or death within 28 days. Outcomes were compared for each operation type by propensity score matching and survival analysis. RESULTS The data set included 3 203 331 operations in 734 NHS hospitals and 468 259 operations in 274 ISHPs.In-hospital outcomes: Across all 18 included operation types, length of stay was significantly longer for patients treated in NHS hospitals compared with ISHPs. Effect sizes ranged from a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.15 (95% CI 1.72 to 2.68) for total hip replacement to 1.07 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.09) for wisdom tooth removal; a mean difference of 2.49 and 0.02 days, respectively.Postdischarge outcomes: Treatment at an ISHP was associated with a lower risk of emergency readmission compared with NHS treatment.

Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses. We developed a model to facilitate hospital planning with estimates of the number of Intensive Care (IC) beds, Acute Care (AC) beds, and ventilators necessary to accommodate patients who require hospitalization for COVID-19 and how these compare to the available resources. Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. We deployed this model as an interactive online tool.6 The model is implemented in R 3.5, RStudio, RShiny 1.4.0 and Python 3.7. The parameters used may be modified as data become available, for use at other institutions, and to generate sensitivity analyses. We illustrate the use of the model by estimating the demand generated by COVID-19+ arrivals for a hypothetical acute care medical center. The model calculated that the number of patients requiring an IC bed would equal the number of IC beds on Day 23, the number of patients requiring a ventilator would equal the number of ventilators available on Day 27, and the number of patients requiring an AC bed and coverage by the Medicine Service would equal the capacity of the Medicine service on Day 21. In response to the COVID-19 epidemic, hospitals must understand their current and future capacity to care for patients with severe illness. While there is significant uncertainty around the parameters used to develop this model, the analysis is based on transparent logic and starts from observed data to provide a robust basis of projections for hospital managers. The model demonstrates the need and provides an approach to address critical questions about staffing patterns for IC and AC, and equipment capacity such as ventilators.","output":"A model to estimate bed demand for COVID-19 related hospitalization"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults) can be hard to reach online.

The envelope (E) protein, one of four structural proteins encoded in the viral genome, is a 75-residue integral membrane protein whose transmembrane domain exhibits ion channel activity and whose cytoplasmic domain participates in protein-protein interactions. These activities contribute to several aspects of the viral replication-cycle, including virion assembly, budding, release, and pathogenesis. Here, we describe the structure and dynamics of full-length SARS-CoV-2 E protein in hexadecylphosphocholine micelles by NMR spectroscopy. We also characterized its interactions with four putative ion channel inhibitors. The chemical shift index and dipolar wave plots establish that E protein consists of a long transmembrane helix (residues 8-43) and a short cytoplasmic helix (residues 53-60) connected by a complex linker that exhibits some internal mobility. The conformations of the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain are unaffected by truncation from the intact protein. The chemical shift perturbations of E protein spectra induced by the addition of the inhibitors demonstrate that the N-terminal region (residues 6-18) is the principal binding site. The binding affinity of the inhibitors to E protein in micelles correlates with their antiviral potency in Vero E6 cells: HMA &#8776; EIPA > DMA >> Amiloride, suggesting that bulky hydrophobic groups in the 5' position of the amiloride pyrazine ring play essential roles in binding to E protein and in antiviral activity. An N15A mutation increased the production of virus-like particles, induced significant chemical shift changes from residues in the inhibitor binding site, and abolished HMA binding, suggesting that Asn15 plays a key role in maintaining the protein conformation near the binding site.

Peer reviewed articles in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL complete and Sociological Abstracts were searched from December 2019 until November 2020. RESULTS: The search and screening identified 45 articles from 513 deduplicated records. The evidence suggests a mixed picture for alcohol use. Overall, there was a trend towards increased alcohol consumption. The proportion of people consuming alcohol during the pandemic ranged from 21.7% to 72.9% in general population samples.

The pandemic risk associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection led us to consider, among other related issues, how stigma and discrimination remain serious barriers to care for people suspected of being infected, even more if they are assisting professions, such as health workers, employed in emergency response. The purpose of this review is to evaluate and promote the importance of psychological aspects of the stigma and social discrimination (SAD) in pandemic realities and, more specifically, nowadays, in the context of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Just as it happened with HIV, HCV, tuberculosis, and Zika, stigma and discrimination undermine the social fabric compromising the ethics and principles of civilization to which each individual in entitled. Recognizing disease stigma history can give us insight into how, exactly, stigmatizing attitudes are formed, and how they are disbanded. Instead of simply blaming the ignorance of people espousing stigmatizing attitudes about certain diseases, we should try to understand precisely how these attitudes are formed so that we can intervene in their dissemination. We should also look at history to see what sorts of interventions against stigma may have worked in the past. Ongoing research into stigma should evaluate what has worked in the past, as above-mentioned, providing us with some clues as to what might work in the current pandemic emergency, to reduce devastating discrimination that keeps people from getting the care they need. We propose a systematic and historical review, in order to create a scientific and solid base for the following SAD analysis. The aim is to propose a coping strategy to face stigma and discrimination (SAD) related to SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, borrowing coping strategy tools and solutions from other common contagious diseases. Furthermore, our study observes how knowledge, education level, and socioeconomic status (SES) can influence perception of SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 risk in a digital world, based on previous research, best practices, and evidence-based research.","output":"Stigma and Discrimination (SAD) at the Time of the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:20,poemsData:D}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=20}}},k={class:"card-container"};function P(r,t,o,h,u,a){const p=f("PoemCard");return i(),n(l,null,[t[1]||(t[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Ask the doctor🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",k,[(i(!0),n(l,null,g(a.visiblePoems,(s,m)=>(i(),y(p,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),a.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:t[0]||(t[0]=(...s)=>a.loadMore&&a.loadMore(...s))},"See more")):v("",!0)])],64)}const V=d(O,[["render",P]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/19.md","filePath":"drive/19.md"}'),R={name:"drive/19.md"},z=Object.assign(R,{setup(r){return(t,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[b(V)]))}});export{E as __pageData,z as default};
