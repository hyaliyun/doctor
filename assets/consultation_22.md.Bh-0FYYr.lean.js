OBJECTIVE: This narrative review outlines the underlying pathophysiology of patients with COVID-19 and discusses approaches to cardiac arrest management in the ED based on the current literature as well as extrapolations from experience with other pathogens. DISCUSSION: Patients with COVID-19 may experience cardiovascular manifestations that place them at risk for acute myocardial injury, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest. The mortality for these critically ill patients is high and increases with age and comorbidities. While providing resuscitative interventions and performing procedures on these patients, healthcare providers must adhere to strict infection control measures and prioritize their own safety through the appropriate use of personal protective equipment. A novel approach must be implemented in combination with national guidelines. The changes in these guidelines emphasize early placement of an advanced airway to limit nosocomial viral transmission and encourage healthcare providers to determine the effectiveness of their efforts prior to placing staff at risk for exposure. CONCLUSIONS: While treatment priorities and goals are identical to pre-pandemic approaches, the management of COVID-19 patients in cardiac arrest has distinct differences from cardiac arrest patients without COVID-19. We provide a review of the current literature on the changes in cardiac arrest management as well as details outlining team composition.","output":"COVID-19 cardiac arrest management: A review for emergency clinicians"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The effects of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on mental health, self-regulatory capacities, and overall resilience are well-known. Given such effects, ACEs may play a role in how individuals adjust to challenges later in life. Of interest in this study is the transition to university, a time of heightened stress when adapting to circumstances is required and when those with ACEs may need additional in-the-moment support to exercise resilience. A smartphone app may provide a worthwhile and readily accessible medium for a resilience intervention, provided behavioral outcomes are adequately evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the impact of an innovative, smartphone appCbased resilience intervention. The JoyPop app was designed to promote resilience through the use of self-regulatory skills such as emotion regulation and executive functioning. Among a sample of first-year undergraduate students, we explored whether use of the app would be associated with positive changes in resilience and related outcomes, and whether these benefits were influenced by level of childhood adversity. METHODS: Participants (N=156) were requested to use the JoyPop app for 4 weeks, at least twice daily. Changes in resilience, emotion regulation, executive functioning, and depression were assessed after 2 and 4 weeks of app usage using multilevel modeling. RESULTS: The sample of 156 participants included 123 females and 33 males, with a mean age of 19.02 years (SD 2.90). On average participants used the app on 20.43 of the possible 28 days (SD 7.14). App usage was associated with improvements in emotion regulation ((2)(1)=44.46; P<.001), such that it improved by 0.25 points on the 18-point scale for each additional day of app usage, and symptoms of depression ((2)(1)=25.12; P<.001), such that depression symptoms were reduced by .08 points on the 9-point scale with each additional day of app usage. An interaction between ACEs and days of app usage existed for emotion regulation, such that participants with more adversity evidenced a faster rate of change in emotion regulation (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight that daily incorporation of an app-based resilience intervention can help youth who have experienced adversity to improve emotion regulation skills and experience reductions in depression. The JoyPop app represents an important step forward in the integration of resilience intervention research with a technology-based medium that provides in-the-moment support.","output":"Adverse Childhood Experiences and Building Resilience With the JoyPop App: Evaluation Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many well-known commercial pharmaceuticals have been used in the therapy against SARS-CoV-2, although in a random and experimental way, since this use is only based on the knowledge about culture cells in vitro But, it is widely known that it is not correlated with assays in vivo conducted with in animals or with clinical trials in humans Knowledge about treatments applied to previous pandemic infections caused by viruses such as MERS and SARS may be the most interesting strategy used to screen products with potential to act against SARS-CoV-2 Mechanistic aspects of virus infections and antiviral action mechanisms were herein analyzed based on the assumption that these commercial pharmaceuticals can eliminate the virus Perspectives about these procedures, as well as about finished clinical trials and the ones yet in progress, were also addressed in the current study Muchos productos farmacuticos comerciales bien conocidos se han utilizado en la terapia contra el SARS-CoV-2, aunque de manera aleatoria y experimental, ya que este uso solo se basa en el conocimiento sobre clulas de cultivo in vitro Pero, es ampliamente conocido que no est correlacionado con ensayos in vivo realizados con animales o con ensayos clnicos en humanos El conocimiento sobre los tratamientos aplicados a infecciones pandmicas previas causadas por virus como MERS y SARS puede ser la estrategia ms interesante utilizada para detectar productos con potencial para actuar contra el SARS-CoV-2 Los aspectos mecanicistas de las infecciones por virus y los mecanismos de accin antivirales se analizaron en este documento basndose en el supuesto de que estos productos farmacuticos comerciales pueden eliminar el virus Las perspectivas sobre estos procedimientos, as como sobre los ensayos clnicos terminados y los que an estn en progreso, tambin se abordaron en el estudio actual Muitos frmacos comerciais bem conhecidos tm sido utilizados na terapia contra SARS-CoV-2, embora de maneira aleatria e experimental, uma vez que esse uso  baseado apenas no conhecimento sobre cultura de clulas in vitro Entretanto, sabe-se o que n?o est correlacionado com ensaios in vivo realizados com animais ou com ensaios clnicos em humanos O conhecimento sobre tratamentos aplicados a infec??es pandmicas anteriores causadas por vrus como MERS e SARS pode ser a estratgia mais interessante usada para rastrear produtos com potencial para agir contra o SARS-CoV-2 Aspectos mecansticos de infec??es por vrus e mecanismos de a??o antiviral foram aqui analisados com base no pressuposto de que esses produtos farmacuticos comerciais podem eliminar o vrus As perspectivas sobre esses procedimentos, bem como sobre os ensaios clnicos concludos e os que ainda est?o em andamento, tambm foram abordados no presente estudo","output":"The Most Prominent Antiviral Pharmaceuticals Used against Covid-19 and Their Perspectives"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Establishing the relationship between the decrease in air traffic and the volume of aviation fuel supplies in the context of Covid-19 pandemic. Design/Methodology/Approach: To establish the relationship between the number of flight operations and the volume of fuel delivered to an airport, the best method is to determine the Pearson coefficient. The use of this coefficient is the most appropriate choice, as the correlation (interdependence of features) concerns the mutual relations between the number of air operations and the volume of aviation fuel deliveries to the airport [l]. Moreover, by analyzing the relationship between these variables by the correlation method, we obtain data in relation to the direction (trend) and the strength of the linear relationship, the impact of air traffic on fuel supplies to aircraft performing air operations. Findings: The analysis of the data presented in the paper shows an increase in the strength of the relationship between the number of air operations performed and the volume of fuel deliveries in the pandemic period, compared to the period before the pandemic.

Antiviral interferon (IFN) responses are critical to outcome of SARS-CoV-2. Yet little is known about the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and innate immunity in this tissue. Here we apply single-cell RNA sequencing and proteomics to a primary cell model of human nasal epithelium differentiated at air-liquid interface. SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates widespread tropism for nasal epithelial cell types. The host response is dominated by type I and III IFNs and interferon-stimulated gene products. This response is notably delayed in onset relative to viral gene expression and compared to other respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, once established, the paracrine IFN response begins to impact on SARS-CoV-2 replication. When provided prior to infection, recombinant IFN or IFN1 induces an efficient antiviral state that potently restricts SARS-CoV-2 viral replication, preserving epithelial barrier integrity. These data imply that the IFN-I/III response to SARS-CoV-2 initiates in the nasal airway and suggest nasal delivery of recombinant IFNs to be a potential chemoprophylactic strategy.","output":"Delayed induction of type I and III interferons mediates nasal epithelial cell permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still increasing worldwide, and as a result, the number of patients with pulmonary fibrosis secondary to COVID-19 will expand over time.

Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela were two of the world's most iconic civil (political) (human) rights advocates and leaders of all time. Both advocated for, and to varying degrees, applied elements of peaceful protests to the achievement of their goals. Both spent time in jail, often concurrently, but eventually forced their respective countries to extend the same rights that white populations had denied Africans and African Americans. For the US, civil rights, voting rights, right to education, housing and housing loans suggested that equality had been achieved, capped in South Africa by the election of Nelson Mandela as the first majority-rule president, and in the US, by Barack Obamas election to the presidency. Yet the historical over-policing, police mistreatment and more generally, the judicial systems inordinate targetingof African Americans, with egregious cases running from Emmett Till to Rodney King to Walter Scott to Breonna Taylor to George Floyd to Rayshard Brooks and thousands of others shows the danger of such magical thinking. The now-persistent global wave pursuing human rights, civil rights and the right to be treated equally, primarily driven by the loosely-organized Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, has become the leading voice in pursuit of equality. Riots such as those in LA, protests in Ferguson and everywhere in summer 2020 has ushered new civil rights campaign. In the US and elsewhere, it has morphed to include historical issues such as monuments to colonialism, the US civil war, slavery and slave owners and traders, institutions, companies and people whose wealth and existence has links to slavery. Instructively, the protests persisted even as COVID-19, the hundred-year plague, continues to ravage the world. Lost in the moment is the absence of central leadership and leaders such as MLK or Mandela. Their charisma and effectiveness has been lacking for 50 years.

This systematic review summarises relevant evidence for skeletal muscle involvement in Covid-19. METHODS: A systematic search of OVID and Medline databases was conducted on 16/3/2021 and updated on 28/10/2021 to identify case reports or observational studies relating to skeletal muscle manifestations of Covid-19 (PROSPERO: CRD42020198637). Data from rhabdomyolysis case reports were combined and summary descriptive statistics calculated. Data relating to other manifestations were analysed for narrative review. RESULTS: 1920 articles were identified. From these, 61 case reports/series met inclusion criteria, covering 86 rhabdomyolysis cases. Median age of rhabdomyolysis patients was 50 years, (range 6-89). 49% had either hypertension, diabetes mellitus or obesity. 77% were male. Symptoms included myalgia (74%), fever (69%), cough (59%), dyspnoea (68%). Median peak CK was 15,783U/L. 28% required intravenous haemofiltration and 36% underwent mechanical ventilation. 62% recovered to discharge and 30% died. Dyspnoea, elevated CRP and need for intravenous haemofiltration increased risk of fatal outcome. Additional articles relating to skeletal muscular pathologies include 6 possible concomitant diagnoses or relapses of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and 10 reports of viral-induced muscle injuries without rhabdomyolysis. Localised myositis and rhabdomyolysis with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Rhabdomyolysis is an infrequent but important complication of Covid-19. Increased mortality was associated with a high CRP, renal replacement therapy and dyspnoea. The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) may have viral environmental triggers.

Covid-19 brought fears for the unknown and required an abrupt shift, creating anxiety for academic staff, students and parents. Amidst this transition, educators had to quickly reconfigure their designs, as specific pedagogical strategies set for in-class arrangements would no longer be appropriate for the new scenario. A whiplash redirect to the online mode introduced new tools and added uncertainties about Internet access and connectivity. People had to deal with remoteness and isolation and with changes to virtual learning. This paper theorizes about what it means to design for transition during an emergency. Drawing on the Activity-Centred Analysis and Design (ACAD) framework, we discuss implications for educational design, detailing how tools, social arrangements and tasks can be carefully orchestrated to support learning activity in emergency remote education. We situate the discussion within the transitioning experiences of students and staff at a Bachelor of Nursing programme, within a three-phased educational design which involved Virtual Happy Hours (VHH). The VHH sessions were run with two cohort groups of first- and second-year students in the Bachelor programmeand included their teaching staff.

Such support may manifest itself via biased recognition of hate crimes. Psychological surveys were conducted in the wakes of mass shootings in the United States, New Zealand, and the Netherlands (total n = 2,332), to test whether factors that typically predict endorsement of violent extremism also predict biased hate crime perceptions. Path analyses indicated a consistent pattern of motivated judgment: hate crime perceptions were directly biased by prejudicial attitudes and indirectly biased by an aggrieved sense of disempowerment and White/Christian nationalism. After the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, disempowerment-fueled anti-Semitism predicted lower perceptions that the gunman was motivated by hatred and prejudice (study 1). After the shootings that occurred at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice similarly predicted lower hate crime perceptions (study 2a). Conversely, after the tram shooting in Utrecht, Netherlands (which was perpetrated by a Turkish-born immigrant), disempowerment-fueled Islamoprejudice predicted higher hate crime perceptions (study 2b). Finally, after the Walmart shooting in El Paso, Texas, hate crime perceptions were specifically biased by an ethnonationalist view of Hispanic immigrants as a symbolic (rather than realistic) threat to America; that is, disempowered individuals deemphasized likely hate crimes due to symbolic concerns about cultural supremacy rather than material concerns about jobs or crime (study 3).

By March 2020, Korea had reported the second largest number of Coronavirus patients in the world. On the anniversary date (2021), however, with a 51.3 M population, Korea has had 73.115 K patients with 1.283 K deaths, and this stands at 86th in the world. On average, Korea has 14.3 patients per 10,000 people. Air-parcel trajectory analysis and airflows show that in the general westerly region, air parcels and pollutants could flow out and in all directions. This suggests initially that Coronaviruses from source areas in China could transmit to many sink regions and sectors including 228 subdivided counties in Korea. However, there were only relatively small numbers of Coronavirus patients in western sea sides of the Korean Peninsula in comparison with large numbers of Coronavirus disease patients in cities and in eastern sides. In particular, three counties in Korea, including Ong-jin, Mooju and Chang-heung, have zero patients of Coronavirus diseases. This suggests that a long-distance transmission of Coronavirus from Wuhan and other infected cities in China to western Korea likely did not occur. Moreover, there was no evidence on the potential transmission of Coronavirus from neighboring large cities to the above-mentioned isolated counties in Korea which are only 10 ~ 50 km away. In the biosphere, during the transmission stage, the inactivation of Coronavirus by UV rays appeared to occur effectively in 30 ~ 120 min, in agreement with the result of satellite and modeling studies. In turn, the air transmission of Coronaviruses and pollution from China and neighboring cities in Korea apparently had no impact to cause Coronavirus diseases at the 228 counties in Korea. The infection and spreading of Coronavirus diseases to other people in Korea mainly appeared to occur in confined indoor air environments. With the absence and lack of UV rays in indoor environments, Coronaviruses would be active there for hours or days longer than in the outdoor environments.","output":"Assessment of the impacts and transmission of coronavirus observed in the Republic of Korea in 2020C2021"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death in children and youth, with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts (referred to as non-fatal suicidal behaviors (NFSB)) being among its strongest predictors. Positive parenting (e.g., warmth, responsiveness), negative parenting (e.g., control, hostility), and parent-child relationship quality (e.g., trust, communication) have been reported to be associated with differences in NFSB in this population. To date, no comprehensive systematic review has considered together the wide range of parenting factors studied in relation to NFSB, and no meta-analysis of existing findings has been conducted. The present study will critically appraise and synthesize the existing evidence from observational studies that examine the relationships between parenting factors and (i) suicidal ideation and (ii) suicide attempt in children and youth. METHODS: Studies will be retrieved from APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library databases. Retrospective, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies, conducted in clinical and population settings, among youth aged less than 25 years and published as articles and dissertations in English or French will be eligible. Two reviewers will select articles using the Covidence Software after title and abstract screening and full-text assessment, will extract information using double data entry, and will appraise studies' quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Any disagreements will be discussed with a third reviewer. Publication bias will be evaluated using funnel plots and Egger's test. In addition to a narrative summary of results, meta-analyses will be conducted using results from at least three studies. Three-level random effect models will allow to derive pooled estimates from dependent effect sizes (from the same sample or study). In case of significant heterogeneity, moderation analyses will be performed considering participants' characteristics and methodological aspects of studies. The results will be reported according to the PRISMA guidelines, and the certainty of evidence will be assessed using the GRADE approach. DISCUSSION: In highlighting parenting factors associated with NFSB and in estimating the overall strength of these associations in children and youth, our results will inform further intervention and prevention strategies designed for young people experiencing NFSB and their families.

Genetic investigation later revealed 20/25 polyalanine expansion of PHOX2B gene in both girls. In this report we highlight the use of non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure ventilators via tracheostomy, overnight end-tidal carbon dioxide trend graphs and outcomes of the patients whose diagnosis and treatment were delayed. CASE PRESENTATION Case 1: A Thai baby girl showed symptoms of apnea and cyanosis from birth and required invasive mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy during sleep. At 5 months, she unfortunately was discharged from the hospital without any ventilatory support due to financial problems. She subsequently developed cor pulmonale, respiratory failure and generalized edema and was referred to us when she was 9-months old. An overnight polysomnogram was consistent with a central hypoventilation disorder, in which the severity of oxygen desaturation and hypercapnia was worsening during non-rapid eye movement compared to rapid eye movement sleep. At 12 months she was allowed to go home with a conventional home ventilator. The ventilator was changed to bi-level positive airway pressure when she was 4-years old. After she received adequate home ventilation, she thrived with normal growth and development. Case 2: A Thai baby girl developed apnea and cyanosis from the age of 5 weeks, requiring ventilatory support (on and off) for 5 months. After being extubated, she had been put on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula for 2 months. She was then referred to us when she was 7-months old. An overnight end-tidal carbon dioxide trend graph revealed marked hypercapnia without increase in respiratory rate. An overnight polysomnogram was consistent with a central hypoventilation disorder. Since 9 months of age she has been on home bi-level positive airway pressure via tracheostomy without any complications. Genetic testing confirmed 20/25 polyalanine expansions of PHOX2B gene in both girls. CONCLUSIONS Bi-level positive airway pressure, originally designed as a non-invasive ventilator, was found to work effectively and safely, and may be used as an invasive ventilator via tracheostomy in young children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.","output":"Using non-invasive bi-level positive airway pressure ventilator via tracheostomy in children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome: two case reports."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The standard curative treatment for patients with esophageal cancer is perioperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by open transthoracic esophagectomy (OTE). Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoracolaparoscopic esophagectomy (RAMIE) may reduce complications. METHODS A single-center randomized controlled trial was conducted, assigning 112 patients with resectable intrathoracic esophageal cancer to either RAMIE or OTE. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of overall surgery-related postoperative complications (modified Clavien-Dindo classification grade 2-5). RESULTS Overall surgery-related postoperative complications occurred less frequently after RAMIE (59%) compared to OTE (80%) [risk ratio with RAMIE (RR) 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.96; P = 0.02]. RAMIE resulted in less median blood loss (400 vs 568 mL, P <0.001), a lower percentage of pulmonary complications (RR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34-0.85; P = 0.005) and cardiac complications (RR 0.47; 95% CI, 0.27-0.83; P = 0.006) and lower mean postoperative pain (visual analog scale, 1.86 vs 2.62; P < 0.001) compared to OTE. Functional recovery at postoperative day 14 was better in the RAMIE group [RR 1.48 (95% CI, 1.03-2.13; P = 0.038)] with better quality of life score at discharge [mean difference quality of life score 13.4 (2.0-24.7, p = 0.02)] and 6 weeks postdischarge [mean difference 11.1 quality of life score (1.0-21.1; P = 0.03)]. Short- and long-term oncological outcomes were comparable at a medium follow-up of 40 months. CONCLUSIONS RAMIE resulted in a lower percentage of overall surgery-related and cardiopulmonary complications with lower postoperative pain, better short-term quality of life, and a better short-term postoperative functional recovery compared to OTE. Oncological outcomes were comparable and in concordance with the highest standards nowadays.","output":"Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Thoracolaparoscopic Esophagectomy Versus Open Transthoracic Esophagectomy for Resectable Esophageal Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Extensive literature in artificial intelligence in education focuses on developing automated methods for detecting cases in which students struggle to master content while working with educational software.

Recent studies indicate that like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also hijacks or usurps various host cell machineries including autophagy for its replication and disease pathogenesis. Double membrane vesicles generated during initiation of autophagy cascade act as a scaffold for the assembly of viral replication complexes and facilitate RNA synthesis. The use of autophagy inhibitors - chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine initially appeared to be as a potential treatment strategy of COVID-19 patients but later remained at the center of debate due to high cytotoxic effects. In the absence of a specific drug or vaccine, there is an urgent need for a safe, potent as well as affordable drug to control the disease spread. Given the intricate connection between autophagy machinery and viral pathogenesis, the question arises whether targeting autophagy pathway might show a path to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Entry requirements for most models include at least six months on treatment and a suppressed viral load. These models thus systematically exclude newly-initiated patients, who instead experience the conventional model of care, which requires frequent, multiple clinic visits that impose costs on both providers and patients. In this open letter, we argue that the conventional model of care for the first six months on ART is no longer adequate. The highest rates of treatment discontinuation are in the first six-month period after treatment initiation. Newly initiating patients are generally healthier than in the past, with higher CD4 counts, and antiretroviral medications are better tolerated, with fewer side effects and substitutions, making extra clinic visits unnecessary. Improvements in the treatment initiation process, such as same-day initiation, have not been followed by innovations in the early treatment period. Finally, the advent of COVID-19 has made it riskier to require multiple clinic visits. Research to develop differentiated models of care for the first six-month period is needed. Priorities include estimating the minimum number and type of provider interactions and ART education needed, optimizing the timing of a patients first viral load test, determining when lay providers can replace clinicians, ensuring that patients have sufficient but not burdensome access to support, and identifying ways to establish a habit of lifelong adherence.","output":"Models of service delivery for optimizing a patients first six months on antiretroviral therapy for HIV: an applied research agenda"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to model the impact of coronavirus (COVID-19) on the clinical academic response in England, and to provide recommendations for COVID-related research. DESIGN: A stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in England, incorporating the following key factors which affect the ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). SETTING: Clinical academics in primary and secondary care in England. PARTICIPANTS: Equivalent of 3200 full-time clinical academics in England. INTERVENTIONS: Four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: \\"Italy model\\" (6%), \\"mitigation\\" (10%), \\"relaxed mitigation\\" (40%) and \\"do-nothing\\" (80%) scenarios.

Methods: We prospectively studied consecutive pediatric patients from our COVID-19 Units (November 2020-March 2021). COVID-19 was confirmed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Patient data were recorded by treating physicians that followed patients up to discharge. DNA was obtained from peripheral blood samples. Probes were designed using the Design studio (Illumina). Amplicons cover exons of complement-associated genes (C3, C5, CFB, CFD, CFH, CFHR1, CFI, CD46, CD55, MBL2, MASP1, MASP2, COLEC11, FCN1, FCN3 as well as ADAMTS13 and HBD) spanning 15 bases into introns. We used 10ng of initial DNA material. Libraries were quantified using Qubit and sequenced on a MiniSeq System in a 2x150 bp run. Analysis was performed using the TruSeq Amplicon application (BaseSpace). Alignment was based on the banded Smith-Waterman algorithm in the targeted regions (specified in a manifest file). We performed variant calling with the Illumina-developed Somatic Variant Caller in germline mode and variant allele frequency higher than 20%. Both Ensembl and Refseq were used for annotation of the output files. A preliminary analysis (A) for the identification of variants of clinical significance was based on annotated ClinVar data, while a further and more selective analysis (B) was performed to identify missense complement coding variants that may biochemically contribute to the deregulation of innate responses during infection. This analysis was mainly based on the dbSNP and UniProt databases and available literature. Results: We studied 80 children and adolescents, 8 of whom developed inflammatory syndromes (MIS-C group). Among them, 41 were hospitalized and eventually all survived. 1.

Among them, 40 patients had a combination of these characterized variants. This combination was significantly associated with the presence of dyspnea (p=0.031) and cough (p=0.042). Furthermore, 27 patients had a pathogenic variant in MBL2 (rs1800450), and 7 a pathogenic deletion in FCN3 that have been previously associated with inflammatory syndromes. 2. The results of our further analysis are summarized in Figure. We identified common variants, some well represented by relatively high frequencies (>70%) (rs11098044 in CFI, rs1061170 in CFH and rs12711521 in MASP2) and others less abundant, but varying considerably between the hospitalized group, the non-admitted group and the MIS-C individuals (rs2230199 in C3, rs1065489 in CFH, rs12614 and rs641153 in CFB, rs1800450 in MBL2, rs2273346 and rs72550870 in MASP2, rs72549154 in MASP3 and rs7567833 in COLEC11, all highlighted in Figure in red).). Structurally, the majority of these common variants of interest encode charge reversal mutations. These may influence protein-protein interactions in complex formations that are important for complement activation and/or regulation. Conclusion: In pediatric COVID-19 we have detected a novel set of complement missense coding variants some of which have been implicated earlier in inflammatory syndromes and endothelial stress responses. Certain combinations of mutations of alternative and/or lectin pathway components may increase the threshold dynamics of complement consumption and therefore alter COVID-19 phenotypes.

However, virtual encounters often face challenges in the care of patients in high-risk categories such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In this study, we explore the patient's satisfaction and the practical effects of a newly established telemedicine program on CKD patients' care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a prior version of an online patient care platform established in 2017, we developed a customized and improved online telemedicine program designed to specifically address the challenges emerging from the pandemic. This included an online, smart phone-based strategy for triage and medical care delivery and psychological support. We invited a total of 278 CKD patients to join the new platform during the pandemic. The subjects in group A were patients utilizing our old online CKD system and were historical users registered at least 3 months before the pandemic. A pilot survey interrogating medical and psychological conditions was conducted. Feedback on the program as well as a psychological assessment were collected after 1 month. In total, 181 patients showed active responses to the program, with 289 person-time medical consultations occurring during the study. The virtual care program provided a rapid triage for 17% (30 out of 181) patients, with timely referral to in-patient medical encounters for their worsening medical conditions or severe psychological problems. Nearly all patients (97.4%) believed the program was helpful. The number of symptoms (OR 1.309, 95%CI 1.113C1.541; P = 0.001) and being enrolled during the pandemic (OR 3.939, 95% CI 1.174C13.221; P = 0.026) were associated with high stress. During the follow-up, the high-stress CKD group at baseline showed a significant decrease in avoidance score (6.9  4.7 vs. 9.8  1.9, P = 0.015). In conclusion, during the pandemic, we established an online telemedicine care program for CKD patients that provides a rapid triage function, effective CKD disease management, and potentially essential psychological support.","output":"Bridging Office-Based Care With the Virtual Practice Care Model: Evolving Care for Chronic Kidney Disease Patients in the COVID-19 PandemicAnd Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A total of 50 poultry farms of commercial broilers (N = 39) and commercial layers (N = 11) suffered from respiratory problems and mortality during the period from January 2016 to December 2017 were investigated. Also, samples were collected from quail (N = 4), Bluebird (Sialis, N = 1), and Greenfinch (Chloris chloris, N = 1) for analysis. Respiratory viral pathogens were screened by PCR and positive samples were subjected to virus isolation and genetic identification. Antigenic relatedness of isolated avian influenza (AI) H5 subtype was evaluated using cross-hemagglutination inhibition. Results revealed that the incidence of single virus infections in commercial broilers was 64.1% (25/39), with the highest incidence for ND (33.3%) and H9N2 (20.5%), followed by H5N1 (7.7%) and H5N8 (2.7). Meanwhile, H9N2/ND mixed infection was the most observed case (7.7%). Other mixed infections H5N1/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND, H5N1/H9N2/ND/IB, H9N2/IB, and H9N2/ILT were also observed (2.6% each). In commercial layers, H5N1 and ILT were the only detected single infections (18.1% each). Mixed H9N2/ND was the most predominant infection in layers (27.3%). Other mixed infections of H9N2/IB, H5N1/H5N8/H9N2, and H9N2/ND/IB were observed in 3 separate farms (9.1% each). The H5N8 virus was detected in one quail farm and 2 out of 3 wild bird's samples. Partial HA gene sequence analysis showed the clustering of the selected AI H5N8 within the 2.3.4.4 clade, while H5N1 clustered with the clade 2.2.1.2. Interestingly, the H5N8 isolated from chickens possessed 6 amino acids substitutions at HA1 compared to those isolated from wild birds with low antigenic relatedness to AI H5N1 clades 2.2.1 or 2.2.1.2. In conclusion, mixed viral infections were observed in both broiler and layer chickens in Egypt. The detected triple H5N1, H9N2, and H5N8 influenza co-infection raises the concern of potential AI epidemic strain emergence. The low genetic and antigenic relatedness between AI H5N1 and H5N8 viruses suggest the need for modification of vaccination strategies of avian influenza in Egypt along with strict biosecurity measures.","output":"Co-infections, genetic, and antigenic relatedness of avian influenza H5N8 and H5N1 viruses in domestic and wild birds in Egypt"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nanobodies are small antibody fragments derived from camelids that selectively bind to antigens. These proteins have marked physicochemical properties that support advanced therapeutics, including treatments for SARS-CoV-2. To realize their potential, bottom-up proteomics via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been proposed to identify antigen-specific nanobodies at the proteome scale, where a critical component of this pipeline is matching nanobody peptides to their begotten tandem mass spectra. While peptide-spectrum matching is a well-studied problem, we show the sequence similarity between nanobody peptides violates key assumptions necessary to infer nanobody peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) with the standard target-decoy paradigm, and prove these violations beget inflated error rates. To address these issues, we then develop a novel framework and method that treats peptide-spectrum matching as a Bayesian model selection problem with an incomplete model space, which are, to our knowledge, the first to account for all sources of PSM error without relying on the aforementioned assumptions. In addition to illustrating our method's improved performance on simulated and real nanobody data, our work demonstrates how to leverage novel retention time and spectrum prediction tools to develop accurate and discriminating data-generating models, and, to our knowledge, provides the first rigorous description of MS/MS spectrum noise.","output":"A novel framework to quantify uncertainty in peptide-tandem mass spectrum matches with application to nanobody peptide identification"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with a plethora of neurological manifestations including polyneuropathy and polyradiculopathy.

According to different epidemic response measures, i.e., mitigation measures, suppression measures, medical treatment, evolutionary trend of epidemic situation under the initial population distribution structure are discussed. Results show that the control effects of different response measures on the number of deaths depend on the timing of the implementation of the measures. For mitigation response measures, the timing of the implementation of the measures has no obvious effect on the final epidemic, while for suppression response measures, the effect of suppression response measures in the early stage of the epidemic is significantly better than that in the middle and late stage of the epidemic development.

Living donations have decreased more than deceased organ donation due to the need to protect the interest of donors. In the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, major professional societies worldwide recommended against the use of organs from donors with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The basis for these recommendations are; SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted to the recipient through organ transplantation and can result in severe manifestations; only limited effective targeted therapies are available, risk of transmission to the healthcare professionals, logistical limitations, and ethical concerns. In addition, end-stage liver disease patients on the waiting list represent vulnerable populations and are at higher risk for severe COVID19 infection. Therefore, deferring life-saving transplants from COVID- positive donors during a pandemic may lead to more collateral damage by causing disease progression, increased death, and dropout from the waitlist. As this SARS-COV- 2 pandemic is likely to stay with us for some time, we have to learn to co-exist with it.

In Study 1, PVD was positively associated with stronger reactions to the threat of COVID-19, including increased anxiety, perceptions that people should alter their typical behavior, as well as reported importance of engaging in proactive and social distancing behaviors. In Study 2, PVD was again associated with increased anxiety, as well as more vigilant behavior when grocery shopping, fewer trips to the store, and fewer face-to-face interactions. These associations remained significant when controlling for the Big-5 personality traits.

The index is based on a Bayesian Poisson model with a random intercept in the linear predictor, allowing for extra-Poisson variation at neighbourhood and town/city scales. This permits within-city differences to be decoupled from broader regional trends in the disease. The research finds that members of ethnic minority groups can be living in areas with higher infection rates but also that the risk of exposure is distributed unevenly across these groups. Initially, in the first wave, the disease disproportionately affected Black residents but, as the pandemic has progressed, especially the Pakistani but also the Bangladeshi and Indian groups have had the highest exposure. This higher exposure of the Pakistani group is not straightforwardly a function of neighbourhood deprivation because it is present across a range of average house prices. We find evidence to support the view, expressed in The Doreen Lawrence Review, that it is linked to occupational and environmental exposure, particularly residential density but, having allowed for these factors, differences between the towns and cities remain.","output":"Measuring the exposure of Black, Asian and other ethnic groups to COVID-infected neighbourhoods in English towns and cities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Research on international students experiences abroad has tended to rely on models of adjustment, integration and/or acculturation to describe their (mis-)encounters with different kinds of people (e.g., co-nationals, locals and other international students).

A trained person can administer it, including women through self-injection. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness and safety of self-injection versus provider-administered subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for improving continuation of contraceptive use. METHODS: We searched for randomized controlled trials on November 1, 2020 in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Open Grey, clinical trials registries, and reference lists of relevant studies. We did not impose any search restrictions. We included randomized trials comparing self- versus provider-administered subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate. Two authors independently screened trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We used risk ratio and 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: We identified 3 randomized trials (9 reports; 1264 participants). The risk of bias in the included studies was low except for performance bias and detection bias of participant-reported outcomes in unmasked trials. Self-administration, compared to provider-administration, increased continuation of contraceptive use (risk ratio 1.35; 95% confidence intervals 1.10C1.66); moderate-certainty evidence). Self-injection appears to be making more of an impact on continuation for younger women compared to women 25 years and older and on women living in low and middle income compared to high income countries. There was no subgroup difference by the type of care provider (community health worker vs. clinic-based provider). CONCLUSIONS: Self-injection of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate probably improves continuation of contraceptive use.

The announcements, declared in the two phases of MarchCApril and JulyCSeptember 2020, were analyzed. The data were collected through document analysis and transferred to the MAXQDA program for qualitative content analysis. Interviews were held with the managers of chain companies to compare and confirm the results obtained. Findings: Chain hotels announced regulations on existing reservations, potential customers, intermediary businesses, suppliers and employees by focusing on maintaining business reputation in the first phase of the pandemic. The hotel units seem to be more open to referrals on emergency measures from chain centers in this phase. In the second stage, announcements to increase sales were shared. The content of the crisis communication is in line with the predictions advocated under the situational crisis communication theory. In addition, some applications that do not comply with the theory are also identified. Research limitations/implications: The effects of the crisis communication on hotels were addressed;the responses of other stakeholders to the communication were not taken into account. Practical implications: Successful response strategies must be considered when developing future crisis preparedness measures. Actors in the hospitality industry can adopt a situational crisis communication approach as an effective strategy to cope with the losses caused by a crisis and possibly speed recovery.

In pursuit of this strategy, most attention has been paid to electric cars. However, substantial, yet untapped, potentials could be realized in urban areas through the large-scale introduction of electric two-wheelers. Here, we review the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers, demonstrating that these are generally more energy efficient and less polluting than conventionally-powered motor vehicles. Electric two-wheelers tend to decrease exposure to pollution as their environmental impacts largely result from vehicle production and electricity generation outside of urban areas. Our analysis suggests that the price of e-bikes has been decreasing at a learning rate of 8%. Despite price differentials of 5000  1800 EUR(2012) kW h(?1) in Europe, e-bikes are penetrating the market because they appear to offer an apparent additional use value relative to bicycles. Mid-size and large electric two-wheelers do not offer such an additional use value compared to their conventional counterparts and constitute niche products at price differentials of 700  360 EUR(2012) kW(?1) and 160  90 EUR(2012) kW(?1), respectively. The large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of urban infrastructure and safety regulations. A case-specific assessment as part of an integrated urban mobility planning that accounts, e.g., for the local electricity mix, infrastructure characteristics, and mode-shift behavior, should be conducted before drawing conclusions about the sustainability impacts of electric two-wheelers.","output":"On the electrification of road transportation C A review of the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced further challenges into Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) decisions. Existing evidence suggests success rates for CPR in COVID-19 patients is low and the risk to healthcare professionals from this aerosol-generating procedure complicates the benefit/harm balance of CPR. METHODS: The study is based at a large teaching hospital in the United Kingdom where all DNACPR decisions are documented on an electronic healthcare record (EHR). Data from all DNACPR/TEAL status forms between 1st January 2017 and 30th April 2020 were collected and analysed. We compared patterns of decision making and rates of form completion during the 2-month peak pandemic phase to an analogous period during 2019. RESULTS: A total of 16,007 forms were completed during the study period with a marked increase in form completion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with a form completed were on average younger and had fewer co-morbidities during the COVID-19 period than in March-April 2019. Several questions on the DNACPR/TEAL forms were answered significantly differently with increases in patients being identified as suitable for CPR (23.8% versus 9.05%; p < 0.001) and full active treatment (30.5% versus 26.1%; p = 0.028). Whilst proportions of discussions that involved the patient remained similar during COVID-19 (95.8% versus 95.6%; p = 0.871), fewer discussions took place with relatives (50.6% versus 75.4%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the emphasis on senior decision making and conversations around ceilings of treatment appears to have changed practice, with a higher proportion of patients having DNACPR/TEAL status documented. Understanding patient preferences around life-sustaining treatment versus comfort care is part of holistic practice and supports shared decision making. It is unclear whether these attitudinal changes will be sustained after COVID-19 admissions decrease.","output":"P29 Bringing into focus treatment limitation and DNACPR decisions: How COVID-19 has changed practice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We consider spectral methods that uncover hidden structures in directed networks.

METHODS: In the present prospective observational study, 225 healthy individuals in Kumamoto General Hospital, Japan, who received two BNT162b2 doses in February 2021, were enrolled. Correlates of BNT162b2-elicited SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity (50% neutralization titer: NT(50); assessed using infectious virions and live target cells) with SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding-IgG and -IgM levels, adverse effects (AEs), ages, and genders were examined. The average half-life of neutralizing activity and the average time length for the loss of detectable neutralizing activity were determined and the potency of serums against variants of concerns was also determined. FINDINGS: Significant rise in NT(50)s was seen in serums on day 28 post-1st dose. A moderate inverse correlation was seen between NT(50)s and ages, but no correlation was seen between NT(50)s and AEs. NT(50)s and IgG levels on day 28 post-1st dose and pain scores following the 2nd shot were greater in women than in men. The average half-life of neutralizing activity in the vaccinees was approximately 67.8 days and the average time length for their serums to lose the detectable neutralizing activity was 198.3 days. While serums from elite-responders (NT(50)s>1,500-fold: the top 4% among all participants NT(50)s) potently to moderately blocked the infectivity of variants of concerns, some serums with moderate NT(50)s failed to block the infectivity of a beta strain. INTERPRETATION: BNT162b2-elicited immune response has no significant association with AEs. BNT162b2-efficacy is likely diminished to under detection limit by 6C7 months post-1st shot. High-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums potently to moderately block the infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants; however, a few moderate-level neutralizing antibody-containing serums failed to do so.

Therefore, the combination of legislation, the judiciary and administration is inevitable. Moreover, public administrations must transform the way they function by using more information and communication technology in order to remain responsive and efficient. This challenge was further revealed during lockdowns in individual countries, which affected their social and economic development. The solution to that challenge is the implementation of e-government in the public sector.

Such impediments relate to challenges by healthcare providers in assessing HIV-related risk and variability in patients motivations for PrEP initiation and continued engagement in care. METHODS: In Ottawa, Canada, a group of researchers implemented Canadas first nurse-led HIV prevention program, known as PrEP-RN. As part of this pilot, qualitative interviews were completed with fourteen patients who had accessed PrEP-RN. The purpose of these interviews was to understand participants perspectives related to HIV prevention and experiences accessing care through a nurse-led service. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis, which were organized into the two major themes of (1) motivations for PrEP initiation and (2) beliefs about the benefits of PrEP. RESULTS: Findings revealed participants motivations for PrEP differed from healthcare providers views of risk, which were influenced by external life factors and personal perceptions of risk. In addition, participants discussed the benefits of PrEP in terms of its ability to manage their potential mistrust of sexual partners, control their sexual health, and liberate fears and anxieties related to HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, health and allied providers should consider incorporating individual motivations and beliefs into patient education and counselling about PrEP to better target HIV prevention care at persons are at elevated risk of HIV.

However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH- > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","output":"A crystallography-based investigation of weak interactions for drug design against COVID-19."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of the new Coronavirus, there was an increase in the generation of contaminated waste.

Understanding differences in the way patients interact with these communication platforms can inform their use and design for hypertension management. OBJECTIVE: Our primary aim was to explore the unique phenotypes of patient interactions with an automated text messaging platform for BP monitoring. Our secondary aim was to estimate associations between interaction phenotypes and BP control. METHODS: This study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial for adults with poorly controlled hypertension. A total of 201 patients with established primary care were assigned to the automated texting platform; messages exchanged throughout the 4-month program were analyzed. We used the k-means clustering algorithm to characterize two different interaction phenotypes: program conformity and engagement style. First, we identified unique clusters signifying differences in program conformity based on the frequency over time of error alerts, which were generated to patients when they deviated from the requested text message format (eg, ###/## for BP). Second, we explored overall engagement styles, defined by error alerts and responsiveness to text prompts, unprompted messages, and word count averages. Finally, we applied the chi-square test to identify associations between each interaction phenotype and achieving the target BP. RESULTS: We observed 3 categories of program conformity based on their frequency of error alerts: those who immediately and consistently submitted texts without system errors (perfect users, 51/201), those who did so after an initial learning period (adaptive users, 66/201), and those who consistently submitted messages generating errors to the platform (nonadaptive users, 38/201). Next, we observed 3 categories of engagement style: the enthusiast, who tended to submit unprompted messages with high word counts (17/155); the student, who inconsistently engaged (35/155); and the minimalist, who engaged only when prompted (103/155). Of all 6 phenotypes, we observed a statistically significant association between patients demonstrating the minimalist communication style (high adherence, few unprompted messages, limited information sharing) and achieving target BP (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified unique interaction phenotypes among patients engaging with an automated text message platform for remote BP monitoring.

Predictors of residual ASCVD risk are not well-delineated. We aimed to develop an ASCVD risk prediction model for patients with prior ASCVD on statin use. We utilized statin-treated patients with ASCVD from the AIM-HIGH trial cohort. A 5-year risk score for subsequent ASCVD events with known ASCVD was developed using Cox regression, including potential risk factors with age, sex, and race forced in the model. Internal discrimination and calibration were evaluated. We included 3,271 patients with ASCVD (85.4% male, mean age 63.6 years, 65% on moderate and 24% on high-intensity statin) with complete risk factor data and mean follow-up of 4.18 years. Overall, the estimated 5-year ASCVD risk was 21.1%: 10.2% of patients had a 5-year risk of >30%, and 38.8% had risk of between 20-30%. In the model, male sex, hemoglobin A1c, alcohol use (inversely), family history of cardiovascular disease, body mass index, serum creatinine, homocysteine, history of heart failure, history of carotid artery disease and lipoprotein(a) predicted residual ASCVD risk. Niacin treatment status did not enter the model. A C-statistic of 0.59 was obtained, with the Greenwood-Nam-D'Agostino test showing excellent calibration. We developed a risk prediction risk model for predicting 5-year residual ASCVD risk in statin-treated patients with known ASCVD that may help in identifying such persons at the highest risk of recurrent events.

Daily use of compression garments on the leg has been recommended to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis, but there is limited evidence from trials regarding its effectiveness. METHODS In this single-center, randomized, nonblinded trial, we assigned participants with chronic edema of the leg and recurrent cellulitis, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive leg compression therapy plus education on cellulitis prevention (compression group) or education alone (control group). Follow-up occurred every 6 months for up to 3 years or until 45 episodes of cellulitis had occurred in the trial. The primary outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis. Participants in the control group who had an episode of cellulitis crossed over to the compression group. Secondary outcomes included cellulitis-related hospital admission and quality-of-life assessments. RESULTS A total of 183 patients were screened, and 84 were enrolled; 41 participants were assigned to the compression group, and 43 to the control group. At the time of a planned interim analysis, when 23 episodes of cellulitis had occurred, 6 participants (15%) in the compression group and 17 (40%) in the control group had had an episode of cellulitis (hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09 to 0.59; P = 0.002; relative risk [post hoc analysis], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.84; P = 0.02), and the trial was stopped for efficacy.

Disruption in antenatal care (ANC) provisions during lockdown is expected due to diversion of public health facilities on pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the proportion of pregnant women who had not completed the ideal number of antenatal visits, availability of iron-folic acid (IFA) supplements and challenges in availing health services during the period of lockdown. METHODS: A concurrent mixed-methods study was conducted among pregnant women in Puducherry, India. Information on obstetric characteristics and details regarding antenatal visits were collected through telephonic interviews. In-depth interviews were conducted to understand the perceived challenges in availing health services during the lockdown period. RESULTS: Out of 150 pregnant women, 62 [41.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 33.6-49.3] did not complete the ideal number of visits and 61 (40.7%, 95% CI 32.7-49.0) developed health problems.

Recent studies suggest that racial minorities and patients with comorbidities are at higher risk of Covid-19. In this study, we analyzed the effects of clinical, regional, and genetic factors on Covid-19 positive status. METHODS: The UK Biobank is a longitudinal cohort study that recruited participants from 2006 to 2010 from throughout the United Kingdom. Covid-19 test results were provided to UK Biobank starting on March 16, 2020. The main outcome measure in this study was Covid-19 positive status, determined by the presence of any positive test for a single individual. Clinical risk factors were derived from UK Biobank at baseline, and regional risk factors were imputed using census features local to each participants home zone. We used robust adjusted Poisson regression with clustering by testing laboratory to estimate relative risk. Blood types were derived using genetic variants rs8176719 and rs8176746, and genomewide tests of association were conducted using logistic-Firth hybrid regression. RESULTS: This prospective cohort study included 397,064 UK Biobank participants, of whom 968 tested positive for Covid-19. The unadjusted relative risk of Covid-19 for Black participants was 3.66 (95% CI 2.83C4.74), compared to White participants. Adjusting for Townsend deprivation index alone reduced the relative risk to 2.44 (95% CI 1.86C3.20). Comorbidities that significantly increased Covid-19 risk included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.18C2.27), ischemic heart disease (ARR 1.48, 95% CI 1.16C1.89), and depression (ARR 1.32, 95% CI 1.03C1.70). There was some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ARR 1.48, 95% CI 1.13C1.93) were associated with increased risk of Covid-19. Each standard deviation increase in the number of total individuals living in a participants locality was associated with increased risk of Covid-19 (ARR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08C1.20). Analyses of genetically inferred blood types confirmed that participants with type A blood had increased odds of Covid-19 compared to participants with type O blood (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.01C1.33). A meta-analysis of genomewide association studies across ancestry groups did not reveal any significant loci. Study limitations include confounding by indication, bias due to limited information on early Covid-19 test results, and inability to accurately gauge disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: When assessing the association of Black race with Covid-19, adjusting for deprivation reduced the relative risk of Covid-19 by 33%. In the context of sociological research, these findings suggest that discrimination in the labor market may play a role in the high relative risk of Covid-19 for Black individuals.

Methods Publicly available data of COVID-19 deaths in March/October 2020 were compared with concentrations of PM2.5 measured in previous years at urban and suburban areas in Thessaloniki. Similar publicly available data of PM2.5 concentrations from Tehran were gathered for comparison. Cross-correlation and Granger causality analysis were performed in order to assess linkage. Results On the one hand, the mean PM2.5 concentrations in Thessaloniki were significantly higher in the winter, however the magnetic fraction of particulate matter in the autumn is twice its annual average, suggesting that traffic-related emissions alone may not explain the entire variability of PM2.5. On the other hand, it is implied that changes in coronavirus-related deaths follow changes in airborne magnetite, with the correlation between the two data sets being maximized at the lag time of one-month. Further insight is provided by the monthly pattern of PM2.5 mass concentrations in Tehran. We find that air pollution Granger causes COVID-19 deaths (p<0.05). Conclusions A significant association has been found between PM2.5 values and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a bunch of regions. Reported links between pollution levels, climate conditions and other factors affecting vulnerability to COVID-19 may instead reflect inhalation exposure to magnetic nanoparticles.

However in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic the necessity of isolation and social distancing prevented families accessing the support they usually would when a relative is on ICU, exacerbating the family's worries and feelings of fear about their loved one. Additionally, in order to increase capacity 4 fold, ICU teams were not able to prioritise communication with families due to clinical pressures. Objectives Paediatricians with pre-existing transferable skills developed and embedded a communication strategy within ICU for the duration of the COVID-19 surge The aim was for all families to be updated at least once daily and offered the option of using video links to speak to their relatives. Methods A proposal was agreed with the ICU matrons. With their approval a team of acute and community paediatricians was assembled. QI methodology was used and 4 PDSA cycles recorded. Results PDSA cycle 1: 3 paediatricians immersed themselves into 3 different clinical subsections of ICU. Ward rounds were attended following which families were phoned with updates. Difficulties for the team included a lack of understanding about a new disease, unfamiliarity in looking after adult patients. Communication with families whilst wearing full PPE was challenging. The team undertook a daily debrief. PDSA cycle 2: 4-5 paediatricians attended daily, in blocks of at least 3 days in a row, which allowed for continuity and comprehensive cover of the ICU patients. A proforma was designed to standardise what information was helpful to record on the ward round based on common recurring questions. PDSA cycle 3: A trial of a video-link virtual visit was conducted in 1 patient per clinical area. Patient feedback was recorded. PDSA cycle 4: The use of video links was expanded. Medical students were trained to facilitate video calls. Numbers of incoming family calls to ICU were monitored. Records were kept as part of a communication daily sheet within the ICU notes. Conclusions Paediatricians and other health professionals have transferable skills which enable them to work in ICU settings The project was successful due to a combination of clinical need, the feeling of 'all being in it together' and building joint resilience when faced with working in unfamiliar environments. Lasting collaborations between colleagues remain. Keeping the team small at the start of the project enabled us to develop profomas, anticipate components of successful phone calls and standardise them accordingly. Medical students were invaluable in setting up and facilitating video calls to families. They were able to schedule shift timings so that calls could be undertaken at a wider range of points in the day. As Covid subsides, the regular calls, video links and holistic thinking about families has been spotlighted within ICU and plans to maintain the service are being developed.

We recently proposed the novel Nakayama-Higashiyama imprint cytological classification (N-H classification) based on small-sized lung adenocarcinoma surgical specimens, which correlated with histological patterns and nodal involvement. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation between STAS and the N-H classification and to validate the N-H classification as an intraoperative predictor of the presence of STAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 164 intraoperative imprint cytologies and their paired histologic specimens from patients undergoing surgical resection for lung adenocarcinoma in our institute in 2017-2019. Using the NH classification, imprint cytological findings were classified into 5 groups (Groups I to V) based on cell cluster shape, cell and nucleus size, and the existence of necrosis. We examined the characteristics of imprint cytology and STAS in the resected tissues and analyzed the relationship between them. RESULTS Tumor STAS was observed in 29 (17.7 %) cases. The presence of STAS was significantly associated with the NH classification (P < 0.0001). STAS was present in 6 of 57 cases (10.5 %) in NH classification Group II, 11 of 42 cases (26.2 %) in Group III, and 12 of 28 cases (42.9 %) in Group IV/V; STAS was not observed in any case in Group I. Logistic regression analysis revealed that tumors with a ground glass opacity rate of <50 % on computed tomography (P = 0.00867) and Groups III-V of the NH classification (P = 0.00201) were significant independent predictors for STAS. CONCLUSION Intraoperative imprint cytology with the N-H classification for lung adenocarcinoma is well correlated with the STAS status of the tumor and might have applications as an intraoperative predictive marker of STAS.

Web-based and mobile phone-based self-management applications have been proven to be effective in improving self-management behaviour of patients with MetS components (i.e., diabetes or hypertension). However, evidence is lacking in terms of their effectiveness specifically for patients with MetS. The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN Self-Management e-Health Intervention in improving activation and self-management behaviours among patients with MetS. This paper presents the study protocol. METHODS: A pilot randomised controlled trial will be conducted in a university primary care clinic. A total of 232 patients aged 18C60 years with MetS will be recruited; 116 will be randomised to receive the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention for 6 months, and another 116 patients will continue with usual care. The EMPOWER-SUSTAIN intervention is a multifaceted chronic disease management strategy based on the Chronic Care Model and persuasive technology theory. It consists of training primary care physicians, nurses and patients to use the EMPOWER-SUSTAIN web-based self-management mobile app, strengthening the patientCphysician relationship and reinforcing the use of relevant clinical practice guidelines to guide management and prescribing. The primary outcome is the mean change in patient activation score using the Patient Activation Measure short form Malay version (PAM-13-M) questionnaire. The secondary outcomes include the changes in waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, patient physical activity level, eating behaviour, perception of chronic illness care, satisfaction with patientCphysician interaction, and perceived absolute 10-year cardiovascular disease risk. Feasibility of implementing the intervention will be evaluated. This includes acceptability of the intervention, estimating the likely rate of participant recruitment and retention, appropriateness of the outcome measures, calculation of sample size, and the interventions potential effectiveness.

METHODS: We conducted a population-based serosurvey, utilizing mailed, home-based SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing along with a demographic and behavioral survey. We weighted data from a random sample to represent the adult California population and estimated period seroprevalence overall and by participant characteristics. Seroprevalence estimates were adjusted for waning antibodies to produce statewide estimates of cumulative incidence, the infection fatality ratio (IFR), and the reported fraction. RESULTS: Californias SARS-CoV-2 weighted seroprevalence during AugustCDecember 2020 was 4.6% (95% CI, 2.8%C7.4%).

Using a Theory of Change approach, we developed such an intervention, the Frailty+ intervention. We present the protocol of a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a process evaluation that aims to assess the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of the Frailty+ intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a pilot RCT in Flanders, Belgium. Frail older people who are discharged to home from hospital will be identified and recruited. Seventy-six will be randomly assigned either to the control group (standard care) or the intervention group (Frailty+ intervention alongside standard care). Data will be collected from patients and family carers. At the core of the Frailty+ intervention is the provision of timely short-term specialised palliative care facilitated by a nurse from the specialised palliative home care service over a period of 8 weeks. We will assess feasibility in terms of recruitment, randomisation, acceptability of the intervention, retention in the programme and data completion. The primary outcome for assessing preliminary effectiveness is a mean score across five key symptoms that are amenable to change (ie, breathlessness, pain, anxiety, constipation, fatigue), measured at baseline and 8 weeks post-baseline. The process evaluation will be conducted in the intervention group only, with measurements at 8C11 weeks post-baseline to evaluate implementation, mechanisms of change and contextual factors.

Fourteen percent of the participants preferred only virtual visits, 24% only conventional visits and 62% preferred a combination of these modalities. Sex, origin, education, duration of diabetes, mode of insulin treatment and distance from the clinic were not associated with patients' preference, but older patients ( 61 years) tended to prefer conventional visits. Sixty-six percent felt confident in their ability to download data from their personal medical devices. CONCLUSIONS Patients from a wide range of treatment modalities are willing to use telemedicine. However, virtual meetings cannot fully replace conventional visits in T1D especially in the older age group.","output":"Is Telemedicine the Preferred Visit Modality in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral methadone or sublingual buprenorphine are first-line medications for pharmacotherapy of opioid use disorders (OUDs).

These include chronic neurological conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, and acute respiratory infections such as that caused by COVID-19. The capsules were fabricated by concentrically dripping oil/alginate droplets, from a coaxial nozzle, into an oppositely charged ionic liquid. This fabrication technique enables full control over the capsule size, the shell thickness and the volume of the encapsulated oil. After formation, liquid capsules were left to dry and form a solid crust surrounding the oil. The prototype test consists of placing a standardized number of capsules between adhesive strips that users crush and pull apart to release the smell. In addition to the fabrication method, a simple mathematical model was developed to predict the volume of encapsulated oil within the capsule in terms of the flow rate ratio and the nozzle size. Tensile tests show that capsule strength is inversely proportional to its size owing to an increase in the shell thickness. By increasing the alginate concentration, the load required to rupture the capsule increases, to the point where capsules are too stiff to be broken by a fingertip grip. Results from a preliminary screening test, within a group of patients with Parkinson's disease, found that smells were detectable using a 'forced choice' paradigm.","output":"A novel capsule-based smell test fabricated via coaxial dripping."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: H3N2 influenza viruses circulating in humans and European pigs originate from the pandemic A/Hong Kong/68 virus. Because of slower antigenic drift in swine, the antigenic divergence between swine and human viruses has been increasing. It remains unknown to what extent this results in a reduced cross\\\\protection between recent human and swine H3N2 influenza viruses. OBJECTIVES: We examined whether prior infection of pigs with an old [A/Victoria/3/75 (A/Vic/75)] or a more recent [A/Wisconsin/67/05 (A/Wis/05)] human H3N2 virus protected against a European swine H3N2 virus [sw/Gent/172/08 (sw/Gent/08)]. Genetic and antigenic relationships between sw/Gent/08 and a selection of human H3N2 viruses were also assessed. RESULTS: After challenge with sw/Gent/08, all challenge controls had high virus titers in the entire respiratory tract at 3 days post\\\\challenge and nasal virus excretion for 5C6 days. Prior infection with sw/Gent/08 or A/Vic/75 offered complete virological protection against challenge. Pigs previously inoculated with A/Wis/05 showed similar virus titers in the respiratory tract as challenge controls, but the mean duration of nasal shedding was 13 days shorter. Unlike sw/Gent/08\\\\ and A/Vic/75\\\\inoculated pigs, A/Wis/05\\\\inoculated pigs lacked cross\\\\reactive neutralizing antibodies against sw/Gent/08 before challenge, but they showed a more rapid antibody response to sw/Gent/08 than challenge controls after challenge. Cross\\\\protection and serological responses correlated with genetic and antigenic differences. CONCLUSIONS: Infection immunity to a recent human H3N2 virus confers minimal cross\\\\protection against a European swine H3N2 virus.

These include an acute increase in one or more of the following cardinal symptoms, beyond day to day variability: dyspnea, increased frequency or severity of cough and increased volume or change in character of sputum, which represent an acute increase in airway inflammation. The role of infection in the pathogenesis of COPD, acute exacerbation and disease progression has been a clinical and research question for many years, and the pendulum has swung from infection as a major cause of acute exacerbation and COPD (British Hypothesis) [2], to infection as an unrelated epiphomenon in acute exacerbation [3C5], and back again to infection as integral in the development of AECOPD and likely an important contributor to COPD progression [6C19]. Upwards of 80 % of AECOPD are driven by infectious stimuli, with 40C50 % associated with bacterial infection and 30C50 % associated with acute viral infection, with some exacerbations having dual bacterial and viral causation [20].

The sample consisted of 889 PSTs enrolled in 9 university campuses of Spain. The statistical analyses performed evidenced that women are more likely to use educational gardens than men and that there is a progressive decrease in the positive perception of PSTs about the usefulness of gardens for CCE as the educational level at which they are being trained increases. Statistics also revealed that the variable connectedness to nature and the rating of the importance of educational gardens in CCE are not significantly related. Nevertheless, the MannCWhitney U test indicated that PSTs who scored higher on connection to nature wished to broaden their knowledge of sustainable agriculture and, thus, connectedness to nature could be considered a predictor of environmental attitudes, each influencing the other.

However, to the best of our knowledge, this has not been examined among minorities in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study, therefore, explores stress among the Arab minority in Israel during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, and its association with the population's perceived COVID-19 threat, trust in the healthcare system, adherence to preventative guidelines, and perceived discrimination.The study analyzed a cross-sectional online survey of 626 Israeli Arabs. Most participants (65%) reported moderate levels of stress, and 10% reported severe levels. The Bedouin population reported significantly higher levels of stress compared to other minority groups. The participants also reported a high degree of perceived threat, a moderate-to-high level of discrimination, a moderate level of trust in the healthcare system, and very high adherence to guidelines.Hierarchical regression analysis showed that age, religion, trust in the healthcare system, perceived threat, and adherence to guidelines were all significant predictors of stress [F(11,600), p < .001]. The model explained 24% of the variance in stress. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that the participants' perceived threat and trust mediated the association between their perceived discrimination and stress [indirect effect = 0.13, SE = 0.03 CI = (0.08, 0.18)], whereby discrimination was negatively associated with trust ( = -0.52), which, in turn, was negatively associated with stress ( = -0.10). Furthermore, discrimination was positively associated with perceived threat ( = 0.21), which, in turn, was positively associated with stress ( = 0.35). Discrimination is an important social determinant of health - especially during health emergencies when trust in healthcare systems and perceived threats are crucial. As such, our findings could assist policymakers in developing fair policies that are tailored to various population groups and that may reduce stress levels among minorities, thereby improving both their mental and physical health.","output":"Stress and perceived discrimination among the Arab population in Israel: the mediation role of the perceived COVID-19 threat and trust in the healthcare system."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Penelitian ini dalam bentuk kajian bagi pelaku usaha dengan klasifikasi ukuran usaha berdasarkan UU No. 20 Tahun 2008 tentang UMKM dan juga Peraturan Menteri Koperasi dan UMKM Nomor 6 Tahun 2020 Pedoman Umum Penyaluran Bantuan Pemerintah bagi Pelaku Usaha Mikro untuk Mendukung Pemulihan Ekonomi Nasional dalam Rangka Menghadapi Ancaman yang Membahayakan Perekonomian Nasional Serta Penyelamatan Ekonomi Nasional pada Masa Pandemi Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) yang bertujuan untuk menggambarkan atau mendefenisikan siapa yang terlibat didalam suatu kegiatan, apa yang dilakukannya, kapan dilakukan, dimana dan bagaimana melakukannya.

METHODS: Using a cross-sectional study design, a survey web link was posted on the social media and messaging platforms Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp by the study investigators. Participants, aged &#8805;18 years, filled out the survey on a voluntary basis. The main outcomes measured were knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, protective measures against COVID-19, and source(s) of information about COVID-19. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine the effects of age, gender, underlying illness, and working or studying in the health care industry on the perceived likelihood of acquiring COVID-19 and getting vaccinated. RESULTS: A total of 5677 subjects completed the survey over the course of 1 week. \\"Fever or chills\\" (n=4973, 87.6%) and \\"shortness of breath\\" (n=4695, 82.7%) were identified as the main symptoms of COVID-19.

However, only few studies have analyzed the costs associated with mHealth solutions for HIV care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the total incremental costs and incremental cost per beneficiary of an interactive SMS text messaging support intervention within a clinical trial. METHODS: The Mobile WAChX trial (NCT02400671) evaluates an interactive semiautomated SMS text messaging intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and retention in care among peripartum women infected with HIV in Kenya to reduce the mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Women were randomized to receive one-way versus two-way SMS text messages. Messages were sent weekly, and these messages included motivational and educational content and visit reminders; two-way messaging enabled prompt consultation with the nurse as needed. Microcosting methods were used to collect resource-use data related to implementing the Mobile WAChX SMS text messaging intervention. At 2 sites (Nairobi and Western Kenya), we conducted semistructured interviews with health personnel to identify startup and recurrent activities by obtaining information on the personnel, supplies, and equipment. Data on expenditures and prices from project expense reports, administrative records, and published government salary data were included to estimate the total incremental costs. Using a public provider perspective, we estimated incremental unit costs per beneficiary and per contact during 2017. RESULTS: The weighted average annual incremental costs for the two-way SMS text messaging group were US $3725 per facility, US $62 per beneficiary, and US $0.85 per contact to reach 115 beneficiaries. For the one-way SMS text messaging group, the weighted average annual incremental costs were US $2542 per facility, US $41 per beneficiary, and US $0.66 per contact to reach 117 beneficiaries. The largest cost shares were for the personnel: 48.2% (US $1794/US $3725) in two-way and 32.4% (US $825/US $2542) in one-way SMS text messaging groups. Costs associated with software development and communication accounted for 29.9% (US $1872/US $6267) of the costs in both intervention arms (US $1042 vs US $830, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Cost information for budgeting and financial planning is relevant for implementing mHealth interventions in national health plans.

A few months after the assay was released to our patients, some materials, reagents, and equipment became in short supply. Alternative protocols were necessary in order to avoid stopping testing to the population. However, the suitability of these alternatives needs to be validated before their use. Here, we investigated if saliva is a reliable alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs; if 0.45% saline is a reliable alternative to guanidine hydrochloride as a collection viral transport media; the stability of SARS-COV-2 in guanidine hydrochloride and in 0.45% saline for 10 and 50 days at room temperature; and if the primers/probe concentration and thermocycling times could be reduced so as to overcome the short supply of these reagents and equipment, without a significant loss of the assay performance. We found that saliva is not an appropriated specimen for our methodnasopharyngeal swabs perform better. Saline (0.45%) and guanidine hydrochloride have a similar SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic capability as tube additives. Reliable SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection can be performed after sample storage for 10 days at room temperature (18C23 C) in both 0.45% saline and guanidine hydrochloride. Using synthetic RNA, and decreasing the concentration of primers by five-fold and probes by 2.5-fold, changed the assay limit of detection (LOD) from 7.2 copies/reaction to 23.7 copies/reaction and the subsequent reducing of thermocycling times changed the assay LOD from 23.7 copies/reaction to 44.2 copies/reaction.

For each article, we calculated STARD summary scores (scale of 0-30, with higher scores reflecting higher-quality reporting). We compared scores by journal, topic, and sample size. RESULTS We screened 819 references of which 61 met inclusion criteria. Nearly two-thirds of studies (39/61%; 63.9%) addressed prostate cancer diagnosis or staging; less than one in ten (6/61%; 9.8%) was conducted in non-oncological disease settings. The major focus for the investigation of new index tests lay in imaging modalities (33/61%; 54.1%); over half of these imaging studies addressed magnetic resonance imaging (18/61%; 29.5%). The average STARD score was 18.9  2.4 (range 12-24). Six criteria had poor reporting compliance and were met by less than 20% of studies. We found no association between reporting quality and topic, journal or study size. CONCLUSIONS The reporting quality of studies of diagnostic accuracy appears modest and independent of topic, journal or study size. There is an urgent need for greater awareness for the reporting quality of these studies among readers, editors, and investigators to raise evidentiary standards on issues of diagnosis.","output":"The reporting quality of studies of diagnostic accuracy in the urologic literature."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"ABSTRACT: COVID-19 has accelerated the dialogue surrounding access to health insurance, including the potential for a public option, \\"Medicare for All,\\" or modification of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.

Muscle weakness and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are commonly encountered in patients with SARS. However, the nature and cause of myopathy associated with a SARS infection are unknown because, to our knowledge, there has been no report of histological or postmortem examination of the skeletal muscle from SARS-infected patients. OBJECTIVE To determine the exact nature of the myopathy associated with SARS. METHOD Postmortem skeletal muscles from 8 consecutive patients who died of SARS in March 2003 were studied under light and electron microscopy as well as immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Focal myofiber necrosis was identified in 4 of 8 cases. Macrophage infiltration and regenerative fiber were scanty. All 4 patients treated with a steroid had significant myofiber atrophy. In situ hybridization for coronavirus was negative in all subjects. Viral cultures for coronavirus and examination for viral particles under electron microscopy were performed in 2 patients. The viral culture yielded no organisms and there were no viral particles seen on electron microscopic examination. CONCLUSIONS There is a spectrum of myopathic changes associated with a SARS infection. Focal myofiber necrosis is common and possibly is immune mediated. Critical illness myopathy and superimposed steroid myopathy may also play an important role in SARS.","output":"Myopathic changes associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome: a postmortem case series."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 infection is caused by a new strain of SARS CoV-2 virus, which transmits directly from person-to-person and has become a pandemic. To counteract this, actions related to mass quarantines or stay-at-home orders have been used termed as lockdown. This study aims to study lifestyle, behaviour, perception and practice of people regarding during the lockdown. METHODS: An online survey was conducted with structured questionnaire in Google forms after ethical approval from Nepal Health Research Council (Ref-2631). The attributes of knowledge, attitude and practices were explored using multiple-choice questions and results were statistically analysed using Microsoft excel. RESULTS: Five hundred fifty-five respondents completed the survey with 280 (50.5%) males and 275 (49.5%) female. The knowledge regarding viral pandemic was increased in 496 (89.3%) respondents. 424 (76.4%) people developed stress due to pandemic. Three hundred fifty three (63.6%) were adversely affected by professional works or suffered economic loss in business. More than 42% participants are using their time for study in personal development, online classes etc. Conclusions: The knowledge of viral pandemic as well as personal hygiene habits have improved in majority of people but many also developed stress. They were convinced that lockdown lowered transmission of infection which in turn affected lifestyle behaviour and practices. Practicing social distancing becomes too difficult for the poor in the absence of proper social security system and government support. E-Learning has become more acceptable due to lockdown.

Numerous reports over the past year have described the clinical and immunological profiles of COVID-19 patients, and while some trends have emerged for risk stratification, they do not provide a complete picture. Therefore, efforts are ongoing to identify genetic susceptibility factors of severe disease. In this issue of the JCI, Povysil et al. performed a large, multiple-country study, sequencing genomes from patients with mild and severe COVID-19, along with population controls. Contrary to previous reports, the authors observed no enrichment of predicted loss-of-function variants in genes in the type I interferon pathway, which might predispose to severe disease. These studies suggest that more evidence is needed to substantiate the hypothesis for a genetic immune predisposition to severe COVID-19, and highlights the importance of considering experimental design when implicating a monogenic basis for severe disease.","output":"Do monogenic inborn errors of immunity cause susceptibility to severe COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pregnant and postpartum women face unique challenges and concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus far, no studies have explored the factors associated with increased levels of worry in this population globally. The current study sought to assess the frequency and sources of worry during the COVID-19 pandemic in an international sample of pregnant and postpartum women. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was available in 12 languages and hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies. Participants were sought mainly on social media platforms and online parenting forums. The survey included questions related to demographics, level of worry, support, stress, COVID-19 exposure, frequency of media usage, and mental health indicators. RESULTS: The study included 7561 participants. Eighty-three percent of all participants indicated that they were either somewhat or very worried. Women 13C28 weeks pregnant were significantly more likely to indicate that they were very worried compared to those who were postpartum or at other stages of pregnancy. When compared with women living in Europe, those in Africa, Asia and Pacific, North America and South/Latin America were more likely to have increased levels of worry, as were those who more frequently interacted with social media. Different forms of support and stress also had an impact upon level of worry, while indicators of stress and anxiety were positively associated with worry level. CONCLUSION: Pregnant and postpartum women are vulnerable to the changes in societal norms brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the factors associated with levels of worry within this population will enable society to address potential unmet needs and improve the current and future mental health of parents and children.

Methods We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) mathematical model to predict the health outcomes under an unmitigated scenario which comprises of air travel restrictions alone, and the current scenario consisting of air travel restrictions along with 8-week lockdown. In addition, we also evaluate the effectiveness of 8-week lockdown along with intensified public health measures at varying level of effectiveness. We assessed the impact of these interventions on COVID-19 related health outcomes in comparison to the unmitigated scenario. Next, we ascertain the need for augmenting infrastructure and the costs of COVID-19 management in India. Findings In the event of a lockdown for 8 weeks, the peak of the epidemic shifts by 34-76 days, and the number of cases at the end of 8-week lockdown reduces by 69% to 97% with varying effectiveness of lockdown. However, the cumulative long-term cases remain the same. Intensification of public health surveillance measures with 60% effectiveness is estimated to reduce the cases at peak and cumulative number of infections by 70% and 26.6% respectively. The requirement of ICU beds and ventilators would reduce by 83% with intensified public health measures. The cost of managing COVID-19 in India is nearly 4.5% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the absence of any intervention which increases to 6.2% with intensified public health measures for COVID-19 response. Conclusion Lockdown measures delay the onset of peak, and give much needed time to health system to prepare. Strengthening the public health system response in terms of testing, isolation treatment of cases, and contact tracing needs would lead to significant gains in terms of case load, and meeting health system needs.","output":"A Model Based Analysis for COVID-19 Pandemic in India: Implications for Health Systems and Policy for Low- and Middle-Income Countries"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An increase in the number of patients and death rates make Covid-19 a serious pandemic situation.

From January 31 to February 2, 2020, a high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety was detected due to COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of somatization among Chinese participants with anxiety receiving online crisis interventions from Feb 14 to Mar 29 during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: A total of 1134 participants who participated in online crisis interventions completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and demographic questions online. Somatization was defined as the average score of each item  2 in SCL-90 somatization subscale. Moderate to severe anxiety was defined as a score  10 in the GAD-7 scale. RESULTS: Among all participants, 8.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and 7.4% reported somatization. After March 1, the prevalence of anxiety with or without somatization did not significantly change (both p > 0.05), while the prevalence of somatization increased significantly (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that somatization was associated with chronic disease history (with an odds ratio of 4.80) and female gender (with an odds ratio of 0.33).

Delay is ordinarily measured on a ratio scale (time), which allows for meaningful division and addition. Social distance is ordinarily measured on an ordinal scale (rank order of social closeness). To convert social distance to a ratio scale we use a psychophysical distance function obtained via magnitude estimation (Stevens, 1956).

As a result of increased exposure to disease, violence, stigma, substance misuse and limited accessibility to health services, individuals experiencing homelessness are disproportionately affected by communicable diseases such as HIV and HCV with prevalence estimates as high as 21% and 36%, respectively. Pharmacists, being some of the most trusted and accessible healthcare providers, are in a unique position to have a significant impact on the nationwide initiatives in Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America and the National Viral Hepatitis Plan by offering preventative testing services and patient-centered risk mitigation counseling and education. This research looks to assess the health impacts associated with pharmacist-led HIV and HCV screening coupled with comprehensive education and risk mitigation counseling in adults experiencing homelessness. METHODS: This study was conducted in a single independent community pharmacy in Spokane, Washington which specializes in mental health services and serves a large proportion of patients who are experiencing homelessness. Study participants are walk-in patients of the pharmacy, over the age of 18, are currently experiencing homelessness, and have not received an HIV or HCV screening within the past 6 months. The study intervention includes a Risk Determination interview, administration of HIV and HCV point-of-care antibody test, comprehensive diseases state education and personalized risk mitigation counseling. Participants are then referred to a local health clinic for confirmatory testing, anonymous partner notification, and evaluation for pre-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. RESULTS: A total of 10 participants were included in the final data analysis. Majority of study participants were male (80%), heterosexual (90%) and over the age 30 (90%). A total of 8 participants (80%) had a reactive HCV screening and there were no reactive HIV screenings. Many of participants reported IV drug use with methamphetamine being the most used illicit substance. Half of all participants (50%) admitted to borrowing a needle for injection drug use within the past 6 months. Two participants admitted to having sexual intercourse with a partner who was known to be HCV-positive and both participants had a reactive HCV screening. All study participants reported at least one serious mental illness diagnosis and ongoing recreational drug use was cited as a coping mechanism in all participants. CONCLUSION: Since efficacy of treatment is no longer the limiting factor in eradicating HCV and suppressing HIV viral load, public health efforts need to be refocused on patient engagement through preventative services in an environment that is less stigmatized than traditional testing sites, such as community pharmacies. Study participants were highly receptive to pharmacist-provided point-of-care screening services in the community pharmacy. Combining HIV and HCV point-of-care testing with comprehensive patient-centered education and risk mitigation counseling may result in lower rates of community transmission, improve linkage to care and may lead to long-term retention of marginalized populations such as those experiencing homelessness.","output":"Pharmacist-led HIV and hepatitis C point-of-care testing and risk mitigation counseling in individuals experiencing homelessness"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: Tumour hypoxia is associated with poor response to radiation (RT) and chemotherapy, and worse treatment outcome. We previously discovered a novel mechanism of metformin in a xenograft model: enhancing tumour RT response by inhibiting tumour cell oxygen consumption. Our population-based study showed that cumulative dose of metformin after cervical cancer diagnosis was independently associated with a decreased risk of cervical cancer-specific mortality in diabetic women. Based on the pre-clinical and retrospective data, we hypothesized that metformin would decrease tumour hypoxia and improve tumour response to RT in locally advanced cervical cancer. Materials and Methods: A window-of-opportunity, Phase II randomized trial was performed in women with Stage IB-IVA cervical adenocarcinoma, squamous cell or adenosquamous carcinoma. Patients underwent screening positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with hypoxia tracer fluoroazomycin arabinoside (FAZA). Those with non-hypoxic tumour (no FAZA uptake) were excluded. Patients with FAZA uptake were randomized centrally in a 2:1 ratio (in favour of metformin) to receive either metformin in combination with standard chemoRT or standard chemoRT alone. Metformin was started at 850mg once daily x 3 days, followed by 850mg twice daily throughout the entire duration of external radiotherapy. A second FAZA-PET/CT scan was performed after one week of metformin or no intervention in control group, just before start of chemoRT. The hypoxic volume was defined as all voxels within a tumour with standardized uptake values (SUVs) greater than three standard deviations (SD) from the mean gluteus maximus muscle SUV value. The hypoxic fraction (HF) was defined as the ratio of the number of hypoxic voxels to the total number of tumour voxels. The primary endpoint was absolute mean change in HF between the two FAZA-PET scans, compared using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the duration of time from randomization to the time of relapse or death, and compared using the log-rank test. Target accrual was 48 patients;the study was closed early to accrual due to FAZA availability and the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Of the twenty patients who consented, six were excluded due to no FAZA uptake and one withdrew. The median age of the 13 enrolled patients was 52;eight (62%) had squamous cell carcinoma and eight had Stage IIB disease. HF of the 10 patients in the metformin arm decreased by an average of 10.2% (from 44.4 to 34.2%)  SD 16.9% after one week of metformin, compared to an average increase of 4.7% (from 29.1 to 33.8%)  11.5% for the three patients in the control arm (p=0.027). With a median followup of 2.8 years, the two-year DFS was 67% for the metformin arm versus 33% for control (p=0.09).

This is an active and affective learning activity that can trigger various emotions. Previous research in SBE has studied student anxiety, which has been frequently measured quantitatively. An understanding of students' emotions can give valuable insight into the learning process and improve nursing educational practice. METHODS: The study took place in four Norwegian universities. It was guided by interpretive descriptions, which involve qualitative methodology. This study was approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data (No: 59059). Data were collected using an interpersonal process interview with eight healthcare professional students after participating in SBE. RESULTS: The results show that students experienced coexisting and changing emotions during the shifting academic scenes in the simulations. During briefing, scenario and debriefing, students experienced being activated and had coexisting pleasant and unpleasant emotions. Unpleasant emotions were found to decrease during the simulation. Numerous identified emotions were found to be valuable for learning.

It has been widely reported that plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) play a critical role in antiviral innate immunity. In contrast, not much is known about the role of pDCs in the interaction between allergy and viral infection. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of RSV infection on pDC function in the regulation of allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of Dermatophagoides farinae-sensitized allergic asthma. METHODS Splenic pDCs isolated from D. farinae-sensitized donor mice were infected with live RSV ex vivo. Subsequently, these pDCs were inoculated into the airways of D. farinae-sensitized recipient mice. Lung pathology, lung tissue cytokine profiles, the number of regulatory T cells (T(reg)) and mDCs as well as the effects of IL-10 neutralization in the lung tissue of recipient mice were determined. RESULTS Intranasal inoculation of D. farinae-sensitized pDCs significantly inhibited the development of allergic airway inflammation and both Th1 and Th2 immunity. Live RSV infection of these pDCs prior to inoculation interfered with their inhibitory effects through decreasing T(reg) and IL-10 and increasing mDCs.

A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials must start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence about clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in between\\"cure\\"and\\"death\\"represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in relating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of\\"recovered\\"vs\\"not recovered.\\"Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials. Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not specify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical power, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal time. Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in advance.

Although the number of large-scale, next-generation-sequencing-based PGx studies has recently increased, little is known about the risks and benefits of returning PGx results to ostensibly healthy individuals in research settings. METHODS: Single-nucleotide variants of three actionable PGx genes, namely, MT-RNR1, CYP2C19, and NUDT15, were returned to 161 participants in a population-based Tohoku Medical Megabank project. Informed consent was obtained from the participants after a seminar on the outline of this study. The results were sent by mail alongside sealed information letter intended for clinicians. As an exception, genetic counseling was performed for the MT-RNR1 m.1555A > G variant carriers by a medical geneticist, and consultation with an otolaryngologist was encouraged. Questionnaire surveys (QSs) were conducted five times to evaluate the participants understanding of the topic, psychological impact, and attitude toward the study. RESULTS: Whereas the majority of participants were unfamiliar with the term PGx, and none had undergone PGx testing before the study, more than 80% of the participants felt that they could acquire basic PGx knowledge sufficient to understand their genomic results and were satisfied with their potential benefit and use in future prescriptions. On the other hand, some felt that the PGx concepts or terminology was difficult to fully understand and suggested that in-person return of the results was desirable.

There are few reports of clinical characteristics of adult measles in the contemporary literature. In this study we aim to describe the clinical characteristics and complications of measles infection in hospitalized adults during the recent epidemic in Greece. METHODS: A multicentre observational retrospective study was conducted in three tertiary hospitals in Greece. All adult hospitalized patients (18 years old) with serologically confirmed and/or clinical features compatible with measles were included. Pediatric patients and patients with missing data were excluded. RESULTS: In total, 93 patients, 40 males (43%) and 53 females (57%), mostly young patients were included. Most of them (87%) had no past medical history. Among women, 4 were pregnant. 56 (60.2%) and 25 (26.9%) patients reported either unknown or incomplete vaccination for measles. Ribavirin was administered in 8 (8.6%) patients. Pneumonitis and hepatic involvement were the most common complications, occurring in 43 (46.2%) and 75 (80.6%) patients respectively. Pneumonitis was significantly associated with male sex, older age, lower lymphocyte counts and higher C-reactive protein (CRP) on admission. One pregnant woman suffered spontaneous fetal miscarriage and one patient died due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and high-risk pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION: Considerable proportions of incompletely vaccinated or unvaccinated adults have led to the re-emergence of measles in countries with reported close-to-elimination rates.

Premise of the study: The small primarily Australian commelinid monocot family Centrolepidaceae displays remarkably high structural diversity that has been hitherto relatively poorly explored. Data on Centrolepidaceae are important for comparison with other Poales, including grasses and sedges. ? Methods: We examined vegetative and reproductive morphology in a global survey of Centrolepidaceae based on light and scanning electron microscopy of 18 species, representing all three genera. We used these data to perform a cladistic analysis to assess character evolution. ? Key results: Each of the three genera is monophyletic; Centrolepis is sister to Aphelia. Some Centrolepidaceae show a change from spiral to distichous phyllotaxy on inflorescence transition. In Aphelia and most species of Centrolepis, several morphologically distinct leaf types develop along the primary shoot axis and flowers are confined to dorsiventral lateral spikelets. Centrolepis racemosa displays secondary unification of programs of leaf development, absence of the leaf hyperphyll and loss of shoot dimorphism. Presence or absence of a leaf ligule and features of inflorescence and flower morphology are useful as phylogenetic characters in Centrolepidaceae. ? Conclusions: Ontogenetic changes in phyllotaxy differ fundamentally between some Centrolepidaceae and many grasses. Inferred evolutionary transformations of phyllotaxy in Centrolepidaceae inflorescences also differ from those in grasses. In contrast with grasses, some Centrolepidaceae possess ligulate leaves where the ligule represents the boundary between the bifacial hypophyll and unifacial hyperphyll. All the highly unusual features of the morphological\\\\misfit species Centrolepis racemosa could result from the same saltational event.

METHODS This was a prospective observational trial with waiver of consent conducted in the intensive care unit of Level I trauma center in 94 mechanically ventilated trauma patients sedated with propofol alone or in combination with midazolam. BIS, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), electromyography, and heart rate variability, as a test of autonomic function, were measured for 45 minutes during daily SATs. Data were evaluated with analysis of variance, linear regression, and nonparametric tests. RESULTS The BIS wave form coincided almost exactly with propofol on/off. Steady-state BIS correlated with RASS (p < 0.0001) and with propofol dose (p < 0.0001), but the strengths of association were relatively low (all r(2) < 0.5). BIS wave form was not altered by age, heart rate, or heart rate variability and was similar with propofol alone or propofol plus midazolam, but the presence of brain injury or the use of paralytics shifted the curve downward (both p < 0.001). The overall test characteristics for BIS versus RASS without neuromuscular blockade were sensitivity: 90% versus 77% (p = 0.034); specificity: 90% versus 75% (p = 0.021); positive predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021), and negative predictive value: 90% versus 76% (p = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS In the first trial in trauma patients and largest trial in any surgical population, the (1) BIS was reliable and has advantages over RASS of being continuous and objective, at least during a propofol SAT; (2) BIS interpretation remains somewhat subjective in patients receiving paralytic agents or with traumatic brain injury.","output":"Bispectral index to monitor propofol sedation in trauma patients."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Basic income has a long history in Canada, going back to the Great Depression.

These challenges can be mitigated by extensive testing. We study testing policies that optimize a fixed budget of tests within a single institution (e.g., business, school, nursing home, etc.) by varying the number of batches that the tests are split into. We prove that, in an exponential spread model and for reasonable parameter values, the expected size of an outbreak at initial detection is smaller when random subgroups of the population are tested frequently, as opposed to periodic testing of the entire population. We also simulate the effect of different policies in a network SEIR model taking into account factors such as variable connectivity between individuals, incubation period, and inaccurate testing results. We show that under a broad set of early-outbreak scenarios, given a certain budget of tests, increasing testing frequency of random samples of the population will reduce the societal risk, defined as the number of infection opportunities until first detection. For example, testing a quarter of the institution members every week is generally better than testing the entire institution every month. In fact, in many settings, sufficiently frequent testing (combined with mitigation once an outbreak is detected) can decrease the risk even compared to the baseline when the institution is closed and testing is not conducted. The bottom-line is a simple policy prescription for institutions: distribute the total tests over several batches instead of using them all at once.","output":"Optimizing testing policies for detecting COVID-19 outbreaks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of our study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of antiviral drugs on COVID\\\\19 pneumonia.

We reconcile these seemingly conflicting facts with four large survey experiments (n = 4,904), demonstrating that self-reported attitudes on political violence are biased upward because of respondent disengagement and survey questions that allow multiple interpretations of political violence. Addressing question wording and respondent disengagement, we find that the median of existing estimates of support for partisan violence is nearly 6 times larger than the median of our estimates (18.5% versus 2.9%). Critically, we show the prior estimates overstate support for political violence because of random responding by disengaged respondents. Respondent disengagement also inflates the relationship between support for violence and previously identified correlates by a factor of 4. Partial identification bounds imply that, under generous assumptions, support for violence among engaged and disengaged respondents is, at most, 6.86%.

Social distancing measures were needed to reduce transmission, and lockdown included restricted access to healthcare facilities. The impact of COVID-19 on transplant recipients is unknown but, considering their immunosuppression status and associated comorbidities, they should be considered a high risk population. Methods A kidney transplant center in Central Italy implemented a strategy to maintain follow-up of kidney transplant recipients by phone and e-mail during lockdown. Telephone interviews were used administer a clinical questionnaire to patients, and e-mail was used to receive the results of diagnostic tests conducted in outpatient settings. Results From March 17 to April 23, 2020, a total of 143 kidney transplant recipients were contacted. Twenty-eight patients needed in-hospital consultation for problems unrelated to COVID-19, 3 of whom needed hospitalization. Eleven patients were managed at home for mild urinary or respiratory diseases, and one was referred to the hematologist. We identified 2 suspected cases of COVID-19 infection, and referred them to hospital care. Immunosuppressive therapy was modulated, and intravenous corticosteroids and potentially effective antiviral therapy were administered, with a favorable outcome.

These effects have been generally explored at a population level in distinct age groups. Potential intra-familial, specific effects in adults and children sharing the same socio-economic, cultural level and living habits have been scarcely explored. We aimed to characterize changes of anthropometric indices in parents and in their children during COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS A cohort of 149 couple parent/children were prospectively enrolled. By a validated questionnaire we explored changes of body mass index (BMI) and individual lifestyle during a 2-month lockdown (May- July 2020). RESULTS BMI increased in 70.5% of parents and in 67.8% of their children, with a -BMI of 1.44+0.09 kg/ m 2 and 0.36+0.02 Kg/m 2 , respectively. BMI increments, however, were only significant in adults and did not correlate in the couple parents/children. Most adults (80.5%) and children (71.4%) did not perform regular physical activity during the lockdown. Direct correlations between dietary changes and BMI variations became evident in children, mainly in terms of a decreased consumption of fresh fruit, pulses, fish, and an increased consumption of cereals, carbohydrates, dairy products, olive oil. In normal weight, overweight and obese children, but not in adults, the increase in sleep hours increased with BMI. CONCLUSIONS Despite marked lifestyle changes imposed by the COVID-19 lockdown, BMI variations in parents were independent from those observed in their children, pointing to different outcomes in response to the same external, critical event.

Primary care providers have been at the forefront of the pandemic response and have needed to rapidly adjust processes and routines around service delivery. The pandemic provides a unique opportunity to understand how general practices prepare for and respond to public health emergencies. We will follow a range of general practices to characterise the changes to, and factors influencing, modifications to clinical and organisational routines within Australian general practices amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a prospective case study of multiple general practices using a participatory approach for design, data collection and analysis. The study is informed by the sociological concept of routines and will be set in six general practices in Melbourne, Australia during the 2020C2021 COVID-19 pandemic. General practitioners associated with the Monash University Department of General Practice will act as investigators who will shape the project and contribute to the data collection and analysis. The data will include investigator diaries, an observation template and interviews with practice staff and investigators. Data will first be analysed by two external researchers using a constant comparative approach and then later refined at regular investigator meetings. Cross-case analysis will explain the implementation, uptake and sustainability of routine changes that followed the commencement of the pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval was granted by Monash University (23950) Human Research Ethics Committees. Practice reports will be made available to all participating practices both during the data analysis process and at the end of the study.

While SH is rare (<1% in the U.S.) and gravely understudied, it is among the most violent, feared, and well publicized forms of murder. Thus, examining predictors is pertinent to identifying targets for prevention and response efforts. Secondary analysis of 2015-2018 National Violent Death Reporting System data on 6461 female homicide victims age 20-64 was conducted to determine if SH represents a unique killing characterized by specific offender, victim, and incident profiles. Law enforcement and coroner/medical examiner narratives were reviewed to identify cases with sexual elements (N=324). Logistic regression estimated odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Findings highlight important differences between SH and non-SH. SH victims were more likely to be single (AOR=1.7,p=.006), have a substance abuse problem (AOR=1.4,p=.04), or engaged in prostitution (AOR=10.4,p<.001). SH suspects were more likely to be male (AOR=2.5,p=.04), use an illicit substance in the preceding hours (AOR=1.6,p=.03), or had recent contact with police (AOR=1.6,p=.01).

Here, we evaluated viral spread in golden Syrian hamsters to define the impact of temporal and environmental conditions on the efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the air. Our data show that exposure periods as brief as one hour are sufficient to support robust transmission. However, the timing after infection is critical for transmission success, with the highest frequency of transmission to contacts occurring at times of peak viral load in the donor animals. Relative humidity and temperature had no detectable impact on transmission when exposures were carried out with optimal timing and high inoculation dose. However, contrary to expectation, trends observed with sub-optimal exposure timing and lower inoculation dose suggest improved transmission at high relative humidity or high temperature. In sum, among the conditions tested, our data reveal the timing of exposure to be the strongest determinant of SARS-CoV-2 transmission success and implicate viral load as an important driver of transmission.","output":"Timing of exposure is critical in a highly sensitive model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: Clinician well-being has been recognised as an important pillar of healthcare. However, research mainly addresses mitigating the negative aspects of stress or burnout, rather than enabling positive aspects. With the added strain of a pandemic, identifying how best to maintain and support the well-being, satisfaction and flourishing of general practitioners (GPs) is now more important than ever. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus from 2000 to 2020. STUDY SELECTION: Intervention studies with more than 50% GPs in the sample evaluating self-reported well-being, satisfaction and related positive outcomes were included. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool was applied. RESULTS: We retrieved 14 792 records, 94 studies underwent full-text review. We included 19 studies in total. Six randomised controlled trials, three non-randomised, controlled trials, eight non-controlled studies of individual or organisational interventions with a total of 1141 participants. There were two quasi-experimental articles evaluating health system policy change. Quantitative and qualitative positive outcomes were extracted and analysed. Individual mindfulness interventions were the most common (k=9) with medium to large within-group (0.37C1.05) and between-group (0.5C1.5) effect sizes for mindfulness outcomes, and small-to-medium effect sizes for other positive outcomes including resilience, compassion and empathy. Studies assessing other intervention foci or other positive outcomes (including well-being, satisfaction) were of limited size and quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is remarkably little evidence on how to improve GPs well-being beyond using mindfulness interventions, particularly for interventions addressing organisational or system factors. This was further undermined by inconsistent reporting, and overall high risk of bias.

OBJECTIVE The aim of this review was to investigate the potential effects of glucose and sucrose, compared with placebo, on cognition in healthy humans. DATA SOURCES The electronic databases PubMed and Web of Science were searched up to December 2019. Reference lists of selected articles were checked manually. STUDY SELECTION Randomized controlled trials or crossover trials that compared glucose or sucrose with placebo for effects on cognition were eligible. DATA EXTRACTION Potentially eligible articles were selected independently by 2 authors. Risk of bias was assessed through the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were obtained from random-effects meta-analyses for a subsample of studies that reported the same outcomes. RESULTS Thirty-seven trials were identified, of which 35 investigated the effect of glucose consumption compared with placebo on cognition. Two studies found no effect of glucose on cognition, while the others found mixed results. Only 3 of the 37 studies investigated the effects of sucrose intake, reporting mixed results. Meta-analyses revealed a significantly positive effect of glucose compared with control, but only when a verbal performance test (immediate word recall) was used in parallel-design studies (SMD = 0.61; 95%CI, 0.20-1.02; I2 = 0%).

However, a longer containment that can eradicate the disease imposes a smaller loss than shorter ones. Earlier, stricter and shorter lockdowns can minimize overall losses. A 'go-slow' approach to lifting restrictions may reduce overall damages if it avoids the need for further lockdowns.

We primarily sought to confirm the mechanical properties and cell compatibility of these ZnO NP infused scaffolds. Methods: The antibacterial property of the ZnO NPs was confirmed by hydroxyl radical generation using ultraviolet (U.V.) photocatalysis. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), a well-known antibacterial compound, was used as a positive control (1% w/v) for the ZnO NP-based alginate constructs and their antibacterial efficacies compared. Among the ZnO group, 3D printed gels containing 0.5% and 1% w/v of ZnO were analyzed and compared with manually casted samples via SEM, swelling evaluation, and rheological analysis. Envisioning an in-vivo application for the 3D printed ZnO NP-based alginates, we studied their antibacterial properties by bacterial broth testing, cytocompatibility via live/dead assay, and moisture retention capabilities utilizing a humidity sensor. Results: 3D printed constructs revealed significantly greater pore sizes and enhanced structural stability compared to manually casted samples. For all samples, the addition of ZnO or TiO2 resulted in significantly stiffer gels in comparison with the alginate control. Bacterial resistance testing on Staphylococcus epidermidis indicated the addition of ZnO NPs to the gels decreased bacterial growth when compared to the alginate only gels. Cell viability of STO-fibroblasts was not adversely affected by the addition of ZnO NPs to the alginate gels. Furthermore, the addition of increasing doses of ZnO NPs to the alginate demonstrated increased humidity retention in gels. Discussion: The customization of 3D printed alginates containing antibacterial ZnO NPs leads to an alternative that allows accessible mobility of molecular exchange required for improving chronic wound healing.

These elements can be seen as the fossils of now-extinct retroviruses, and are called Human Endogenous Retroviruses (HERVs). View as junk DNA for a long time, HERVs constitute 4 times the amount of DNA needed to produce all cellular proteins, and growing evidence indicates their crucial role in primate brain evolution, placenta development, and innate immunity shaping. HERVs are also intensively studied for a pathological role, even if the incomplete knowledge about their exact number and genomic position has thus far prevented any causal association. Among possible relevant HERVs, the HERV-K supergroup is of particular interest, including some of the oldest (HML5) as well as youngest (HML2) integrations. Among HERV-Ks, the HML7 group still lack a detailed description, and the present work thus aimed to identify and characterize all HML7 elements in the human genome. Results showed that the HML7 group includes 23 elements and an additional 160 scars of past infection that invaded in primates mostly between 20 and 30 million years ago, providing an exhaustive background to study their impact on human pathophysiology. ABSTRACT: Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) are ancient relics of infections that affected the primate germ line and constitute about 8% of our genome. Growing evidence indicates that ERVs had a major role in vertebrate evolution, being occasionally domesticated by the host physiology. In addition, human ERV (HERV) expression is highly investigated for a possible pathological role, even if no clear associations have been reported yet. In fact, on the one side, the study of HERV expression in high-throughput data is a powerful and promising tool to assess their actual dysregulation in diseased conditions; but, on the other side, the poor knowledge about the various HERV group genomic diversity and individual members somehow prevented the association between specific HERV loci and a given molecular mechanism of pathogenesis. The present study is focused on the HERV-K(HML7) group thatdifferently from the other HERV-K membersstill remains poorly characterized. Starting from an initial identification performed with the software RetroTector, we collected 23 HML7 proviral insertions and about 160 HML7 solitary LTRs that were analyzed in terms of genomic distribution, revealing a significant enrichment in chromosome X and the frequent localization within human gene introns as well as in pericentromeric and centromeric regions. Phylogenetic analyses showed that HML7 members form a monophyletic group, which based on age estimation and comparative localization in non-human primates had its major diffusion between 20 and 30 million years ago. Structural characterization revealed that besides 3 complete HML7 proviruses, the other group members shared a highly defective structure that, however, still presents recognizable functional domains, making it worth further investigation in the human population to assess the presence of residual coding potential.","output":"HERV-K(HML7) Integrations in the Human Genome: Comprehensive Characterization and Comparative Analysis in Non-Human Primates"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To describe the behaviour of COVID-19 confirmed cases from Santiago de Cuba province between March and April, 2020 Methods: It was carried out a cross-sectional, observational descriptive study taking as studied population 49 COVID-19 positive cases in Santiago de Cuba province between March and April, 2020 There were selected clinic and epidemiologic variables As statistical technique it was applied the implicative statistical analysis with its three forms: similarity, cohesive, and implicative Results: It was obtained a set of all the relations among the studied variables in a graphic way, being highlighted the differences among both sexes since the females were related to the asymptomatic category and the males to symptomatic, seriously ill and deceased categories;while older adults were related with the higher amount of personal pathological background and the deceased ones, and young adults were related to the backgrounds and respiratory systems symptoms Conclusions: This study allows to visualize, as a distinctive feature of COVID-19 cases behaviour in Santiago de Cuba province, that the highest risk sub-group is the one of male 2 older adults with underlying diseases, mainly arterial hypertension, which is similar to what is happening in other regions of the world ? 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas All rights reserved","output":"Covid-19 in santiago de cuba province from an implicative statistical analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this work, a new molecularly imprinted solid phase extraction protocol was developed for the selective extraction and purification of glycyrrhizic acid from liquorice roots in aqueous media.

The results of adsorption experiments illustrated the MIPs had high adsorption capacity of glycyrrhizic acid (69.3 mg g(?1)) with the imprinting factor 3.77, and it took ~5 min to get adsorption equilibrium. The MIPs could be used as an solid phase extraction sorbent absorbent for enrichment and purification of glycyrrhizic acid from the crude extraction of licorice roots, and the results showed promising practical value.","output":"Molecularly Imprinted Solid Phase Extraction using Bismethacryloyl--cyclodextrin and Methacrylic Acid as Double Functional Monomers for Selective Analysis of Glycyrrhizic Acid in Aqueous Media"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been widely implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Effective market segmentation improves the communication and efficacy of health advice. Travel frequency is an important basis for health-related consumer segmentation, as it is closely related to risk of greater exposure to infectious diseases. Theoretically grounded studies of tourist biosecurity behavior and travel frequency have largely been neglected, although insights into practices and attitudes are especially relevant for coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) health responses. Therefore, this research constructed and tested a conceptual model applying Value-Attitude-Behavior theory to US travelers to see whether the frequency of international travel affected tourist COVID-19 related biosecurity behavior. US respondents were drawn from a panel using a quota sampling technique according to the age and gender of American outbound tourists. An online survey was administered in September 2020. The responses (n = 395) of those who traveled internationally within five years were analyzed utilizing partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) with multi-group analysis. Travel frequency significantly affects biosecurity behavior. High travel frequency (&#8805;8 trips) has the strongest effect of value on biosecurity attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and biosecurity social norms, leading to biosecurity behaviors. Biosecurity behaviors pertaining to medium travel frequency (4-7 trips) are significantly influenced by personal norms. At low travel frequency (1-3 trips) levels, biosecurity behaviors are stimulated by biosecurity attitudes and social norms, showing the highest predictive power among the three groups. This work provides insights into international travel consumer biosecurity practices and behavior. From a market segmentation perspective, the levels of international travel frequency have various influences on biosecurity values, attitudes, personal norms, social norms, and behaviors. The biosecurity behaviors of low-frequency travelers are found to be the most significant of the three groups, suggesting that individuals who travel less frequently are more likely to practice responsible COVID-19 biosecurity behavior.","output":"Does International Travel Frequency Affect COVID-19 Biosecurity Behavior in the United States?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"With the spread of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a need to assess the protection conferred by both previous infections and current vaccination.

Published articles from November 1, 2012 until May 18, 2020 were searched. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analysis were also conducted to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: : We found 38 articles with 19,428 individuals met the eligibility criteria. Of these papers, 35 studies were included in meta-analysis. The prevalence of PTSD symptoms was estimated to be about 18% (95%CI: 15% to 20%). These symptoms were more frequent in cohort studies (29%) compared to cross-sectional (15%) and case-control (11%) studies. Prevalence rates of PTSD symptoms in MERS (36%) outbreaks were higher than SARS (18%) and COVID-19 (9%) outbreaks. Meta-regression showed that the geographical location of study was the source of heterogeneity (R(2): 19.8%, P-value: 0.003). Meta-analysis reported that about three in every ten survivors of coronavirus infection, about two in every ten healthcare workers, and about one in every ten individuals of general population experienced PTSD symptoms in outbreaks. LIMITATIONS: : PTSD cannot be objectively assessed and this can lead to information bias of included studies. CONCLUSION: : PTSD symptoms are shown to be common in coronavirus outbreaks.

Drawing on the academic literature, historical data and informed by expert judgement, four scenarios representing possible future courses of economic and demographic recovery. Results suggest that Australias population could be 6 per cent lower by 2040 in a Longer scenario than in the No Pandemic scenario, primarily due to a huge reduction in international migration. Impacts on population ageing will be less severe, leading to a one percentage point increase in the proportion of the population aged 65 and over by 2040. Differential impacts will be felt across Australian States and Territories, with the biggest absolute and relative reductions in growth occurring in the most populous states, Victoria and New South Wales.

The pandemics have led to contemporary practice-related questions, such as: does professionalism entail that health care providers (HCP) be compelled to treat patients without PPE or if patients refuse to wear masks? And what role do HCP play in society when confronted with glaring health disparities and police brutality? The authors propose using care ethics as a theory to view professionalism, as it takes into account broadly encompassing relationships between HCP and society, history and context. Professionalism viewed through a care ethics lens would require professionalism definitions to be expanded to allow for interventions, i.e., not just refrain from doing harm but actively interfere or take action if wrong is being witnessed. Principles related to the primacy of patient welfare need to be re-addressed to prevent systematic self-sacrifice which results in harm to HCP and burnout. Mature care should be a characteristic of professionalism ensuring that HCP care for the sick but be practically wise, highlighting the importance of balancing too little and too much care for self and others. Professionalism needs to be viewed as a bi-directional relational exchange, with society demonstrating solidarity with those providing care. Additionally, given the scale of health disparities, simply stating that HCP need to work towards social justice oversimplifies the problem. Professionalism needs to encompass incorporating critical action and critical pedagogy into health care training and the health care profession to demonstrate solidarity with those impacted by racism.","output":"Professionalism revisited during the pandemics of our time: COVID-19 and racism"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objetivo: Los informes iniciales de la COVID-19 describieron diversas presentaciones clnicas, pero las anomalas de las vas respiratorias bajas son las ms frecuentes y los hallazgos de la tomografa computarizada (TC) de trax difieren entre pacientes adultos y peditricos.

Objective: Initial COVID-19 reports described a variety of clinical presentations, but lower respiratory abnormalities are most common and chest CT findings differ between adult and pediatric patients. We aim to summarize early CT findings to inform healthcare providers on the frequency of COVID-19 manifestations specific to adult or pediatric patients, and to determine if the sensitivity of CT justifies its use in these populations. Methods: PubMed was searched for the presence of the words CT, imaging, COVID-19 in the title or abstract, and 17 large-scale PubMed and/or Scopus studies and case reports published between January 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020 were selected for data synthesis. Results: Initial CT scans identified ground-glass opacities and bilateral abnormalities as more frequent in adults (74%, n=698, and 89%, n=378, respectively) than children (60%, n=25, and 37%, n=46). At 14+ days, CT scans evidenced varied degrees of improvement in adults but no resolution until at least 26 days after the onset of flu-like symptoms. In pediatric patients, a third (n=9) showed additional small nodular GGOs limited to a single lobe 3-5 days after an initial CT scan. Conclusin: Early adult CT findings suggest the limited use of CT as a supplemental tool in diagnosing COVID-19 in symptomatic adult patients, with a particular focus on identifying right and left lower lobe abnormalities, GGOs, and interlobular septal thickening. Early pediatric CT findings suggest against the use of CT if RT-PCR is available given its significantly lower sensitivity in this population and radiation exposure.","output":"Comparacin de las presentaciones de tomografa computarizada de pacientes adultos y peditricos con COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oxytocin (OXT) modulates social interactions, attenuates stressful responses and can decrease drug-seeking and taking behaviors.

However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. METHODS: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. RESULTS: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis.

The time needed for each task was compared to a reference time (by trained physiotherapist familiar with the devices). A time >180 s was considered a task failure. RESULTS For each of the tests on the ventilators, all physicians' times were significantly higher than the reference time (P < 0.001). A mean of 13 +/- 8 task failures (16%) was observed by the ventilator. The most frequently failed tasks were mode and parameter recognition, starting pressure support and finding the NIV mode.

PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health policy makers should focus on enhancing residents knowledge on infectious disease and their awareness of the risk mitigation, and develop personalized measures for different subgroups.","output":"Characterizing Wuhan residents mask-wearing intention at early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Government of Nepal issued a nationwide lockdown from 24 March to 21 July 2020, prohibiting domestic and international travels, closure of the border and non-essential services. There were only two confirmed cases from 610 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests and no fatalities when the government introduced nationwide lockdown. This study aimed to explore the overall scenario of COVID-19 including spatial distribution of cases; government efforts, and impact on public health, socio-economy, and education during the lockdown in Nepal. We collated and analyzed data using official figures from the Nepalese Ministry of Health and Population. Nepal had performed 7,791 RT-PCR tests for COVID-19, the highest number of tests during the lockdown. It has recorded its highest daily rise in coronavirus infections with a total of 740 new cases from the total of 4,483 RT-PCR tests performed on a single day. Nepal had reported a total of 17,994 positive cases and 40 deaths at the end of lockdown. The spatial distribution clearly shows that the cases were rapidly spreading from the southern part of the country where most points of entry and exit from India are located. To contain the spread of the virus, the government has also initiated various preventive measures and strategies during the lockdown. The Government of Nepal needs to allocate more resources, increase its capacity to test and trace, establish dedicated isolation and quarantine facility and impose local restrictions such as a local lockdown based on risk assessment rather than a nationwide lockdown.","output":"Assessment of COVID-19 Pandemic in Nepal: A Lockdown Scenario Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has limited treatment options, concern has been raised over secondary infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns. It has been observed that patients who were infected with COVID-19 were predisposed to develop secondary infections. The purpose of the study is to ascertain the prevalence of the bacterial and fungal coinfections in COVID-19 patients, and also to assess the AMR patterns in the obtained isolates. Methods We have studied 200 clinical samples obtained from 122 COVID-19 positive patients. Pathogens were identified using Vitek 2 system. The demographic and clinical patterns were also observed. Results A total of 122 patients developed secondary infections. Patients aged more than 40 years were majorly affected (p-value < 0.0001). Respiratory samples (n = 96) were predominant. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 68) was the most common pathogen isolated followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (n=54) and an overall 6% rise in the Carbapenem resistance was observed in the isolates.

However, it is unknown whether familial breast cancer history (FBCH) also increases individual susceptibility for breast cancer from radiation exposure. In this cohort study, 17,200 female Swedish hemangioma patients with 1,079 breast cancer cases between 1958-2013, exposed by ionizing radiation in infancy, were linked to their first-degree relatives. The association between FBCH and radiation-induced breast cancer risk was assessed. Further, the relevance for breast cancer radiotherapy and mammography screening was evaluated. On average, the radiation-induced excess relative (ERR) and absolute risk (EAR) at age 50 was ERR = 0.51 Gy-1 (95%CI: 0.33; 0.71), and EAR = 10.8 (104 PYR Gy)-1 (95%CI: 7.0; 14.6).

Modifiable (i.e., hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity, and cigarette smoke) and non-modifiable factors (i.e., duration of diabetes, puberty, pregnancy and genetic susceptibility) are involved in the development of DR. Epigenetic mechanisms, modulating the oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and aging, could influence the course of DR. Herein, we conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating how epigenetics affects type 2 diabetes retinopathy (T2DR). A total of 23 epidemiological studies were included: 14 studies focused on miRNA, 4 studies on lnc-RNA, one study on both miRNA and lnc-RNA, and 4 studies on global or gene-specific DNA methylation. A direct relation between the dysregulation of miR-21, miR-93, and miR-221 and FPG, HbA1c, and HOMA-IR was identified. A panel of three miRNAs (hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-miR-novel-chr5_15976, and hsa-miR-28-3p) demonstrated a good sensitivity and specificity for predicting T2DR. Little evidence is available regarding the possible role of the long non-coding MALAT1 dysregulation and MTHFR gene promoter hypermethylation.

Methods: Retrospective data collection of incidents and complaints reported through Datix(?), and the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), respectively. The setting was the Family Health division in a University teaching hospital in the UK. Primary and secondary outcome measures included: the proportion of incidents reported on Datix(?) from 23 March 2020 to 29 May 2020, compared to the period from 23 March 2019 to 29 May 2019. COVID-19 related incidents and complaints and association with newly published guidelines or pathways from 23 March 2020 to 29 May 2020 were investigated. Results: There was no significant difference in the proportion of overall patient activity resulting in incidents reported on Datix in 2020 (2.08%) compared to 2019 (2.09%), with 98% resulting in no/low harm in 2020. Three incident categories had increases in relative proportions of incidents including the terms COVID or Corona compared to incidents that did not: Child death, delay/failure to treatment and procedure and information governance. One of the child deaths was a miscarriage and we were unable to link the second child death to a change in clinical policy at this stage. We were only able to link two COVID-19 associated incidents with a pathway or procedural change (one to the Childrens Emergency Department admission pathway and the second to the introduction of virtual antenatal clinics). Eighteen complaints related to COVID-19 were logged. However, at this stage, we are unable to link any of these to a published change in clinical policy. Conclusions: New policies introduced in the division, during the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with similar rates of clinical incidents, when compared with the previous year. There were only two COVID-19-related incidents clearly related to a change in pathways and procedures. Continued surveillance and improved metrics for monitoring the impact of changes to pathways and procedures should be sought with the sustained presence of COVID-19 in clinical areas.","output":"Impact of New Clinical Policies during the COVID-19 Pandemic on Clinical Incidents and Complaints at a UK Teaching Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recent research into meningeal lymphatics has revealed a never-before appreciated role of type II innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in modulating neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS).

This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with non-endemic provinces in China during two weeks in February 2020. MATERIAL/METHODS: Questionnaires were completed by 939 individuals (357 men; 582 women), including 33 from Hubei and 906 from non-endemic provinces. The Stress Response Questionnaire (SRQ) determined the emotional state, somatic responses, and behavior. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to measure the duration of sleep and sleep quality. RESULTS: There were 939 study participants, aged 18C24 years (35.89%) and 25C39 years (35.57%); 65.92% were university students. During a two week period in February 2020, the emotional state and behavior of participants in Hubei improved, but the quality of sleep did not. Health workers and business people became increasingly anxious, but other professionals became less anxious. The data showed that most people in Hubei Province developed a more positive attitude regarding their risk of infection and the chances of surviving the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: During a two-week period, front-line health workers and people in Hubei Province became less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine.

This is particularly true of the humoral response generated against influenza A viruses. Although it is known that immunological memory developed against previously encountered influenza A virus strains affects the outcome of subsequent infections, exactly how sequential exposures to antigenically variant viruses shape the humoral immune response in humans remains poorly understood. To address this important question, we performed a longitudinal analysis of antibody titers against various pandemic and seasonal strains of influenza virus spanning a 20-year period (1987 to 2008) with samples from 40 individuals (birth dates, 1917 to 1952) obtained from the Framingham Heart Study. Longitudinal increases in neutralizing antibody titers were observed against previously encountered pandemic H2N2, H3N2, and H1N1 influenza A virus strains. Antibody titers against seasonal strains encountered later in life also increased longitudinally at a rate similar to that against their pandemic predecessors. Titers of cross-reactive antibodies specific to the hemagglutinin stalk domain were also investigated because they are influenced by exposure to antigenically diverse influenza A viruses. These titers rose modestly over time, even in the absence of major antigenic shifts. No sustained increase in neutralizing antibody titers against an antigenically more stable virus (human cytomegalovirus) was observed. The results herein describe a role for antigenic variation in shaping the humoral immune compartment and provide a rational basis for the hierarchical nature of antibody titers against influenza A viruses in humans.","output":"Neutralizing antibodies against previously encountered influenza virus strains increase over time: a longitudinal analysis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Nidoviruses comprise the most complex grouping among other viruses with respect to their multiplicity, phylogeny, systematics, species identification, genetic relationships within a taxon, progressive variability Like other single-stranded RNA viruses, nidoviruses have a relatively high ability to mutate and recombine, which allows them to quickly adapt to new hosts and new ecological niches Although most of the known representatives of nidoviruses are associated with terrestrial hosts, more and more data has recently appeared on nidoviruses recovered from aquatic organisms This review is the analysis of current data on the representatives of the order Nidovirales associated with aquatic animals They are all included in the eight families based on the current classification of viruses The most studied among them are members of the families Coronaviridae, Tobaniviridae and Roniviridae Representatives of the other families of aquatic animal nidoviruses were identified using metagenomic deep sequencing (metagenomics), but their effect on the host organism has not yet been adequately studied Data on the distribution of nidoviruses among aquatic animals in different global aquatic systems are presented, clinical signs of the disease are described, a brief description of nidoviruses and their genomes is given Nidoviruses of aquatic animals as the earliest members of the animal kingdom are supposed to have played a possible role in the evolution of terrestrial animal nidoviruses Therefore, aquatic animal nidoviruses could play a significant role in the formation of new natural reservoirs unknown to science, as well as in their interspecies transfer between marine, freshwater and terrestrial hosts ڧէӧڧ  ߧ֧ߧڧ ڧ ާߧԧڧݧ֧ߧߧ, ڧݧԧ֧ߧ֧٧, ڧ֧ާѧڧܧ, ӧڧէӧ ڧէ֧ߧڧڧܧѧڧ, ԧ֧ߧ֧ڧ֧ܧڧ ӧ٧֧ ӧߧ ѧܧߧ, ԧ֧ڧӧߧ ڧ٧ާ֧ߧڧӧ ӧݧ ߧѧڧҧݧ֧ ݧاߧ ԧڧӧܧ ֧է ڧ ӧڧ ѧ  էԧڧ ӧڧ  էߧڧѧݧߧ , ߧڧէӧڧ ҧݧѧէѧ ѧӧߧڧ֧ݧߧ ӧܧ ҧߧ  ާѧڧ  ֧ܧާҧڧߧѧڧ,  ٧ӧݧ֧ ڧ ҧ ѧէѧڧӧѧ  ߧӧ ٧֧ӧѧ  ߧӧ ܧݧԧڧ֧ܧڧ ߧڧѧ  ҧݧѧ ѧ ڧ٧ӧ֧ߧ ֧էѧӧڧ֧ݧ֧ ߧڧէӧڧ ѧڧڧӧѧߧ  ߧѧ٧֧ާߧާ ٧֧ӧѧާ,  ݧ֧էߧ֧ ӧ֧ާ ӧݧ֧ ӧ ҧݧ ӧ֧է֧ߧڧ  ߧڧէӧڧѧ, ڧ٧ݧڧӧѧߧߧ ڧ ӧէߧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ާ  ҧ٧ ѧߧѧݧڧ٧ڧ֧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧѧ ڧߧާѧڧ  ֧էѧӧڧ֧ݧ է Nidovirales, ѧڧڧӧѧߧߧ  ӧէߧާ اڧӧߧާ ԧݧѧߧ ӧ֧ާ֧ߧߧ ܧݧѧڧڧܧѧڧ ӧڧ ӧ ߧ ӧէ  ѧ ӧާ ֧ާ֧ۧ ѧڧҧݧ֧ ڧ٧֧ߧߧާ ֧է ߧڧ ӧݧ ݧ֧ߧ ֧ާ֧ۧ Coronaviridae, Tobaniviridae  Roniviridae ֧էѧӧڧ֧ݧ ѧݧߧ ֧ާ֧ۧ ߧڧէӧڧ ӧէߧ اڧӧߧ ҧݧ ӧӧݧ֧ߧ ާ֧է ԧݧҧݧ֧ߧߧԧ ֧ܧӧ֧ߧڧӧѧߧڧ (ާ֧ѧԧ֧ߧާڧܧ), ߧ ڧ ӧݧڧߧڧ ߧ ԧѧߧڧ٧ ٧֧ ܧ ڧ٧֧ߧ ߧ֧էѧߧ ڧӧ֧է֧ߧ էѧߧߧ  ѧѧߧ֧ߧڧ ߧڧէӧڧ ֧է ӧէߧ اڧӧߧ  ѧ٧ݧڧߧ ӧէߧ ڧ֧ާѧ ާڧ, ڧѧߧ ܧݧڧߧڧ֧ܧڧ ڧ٧ߧѧܧ ٧ѧҧݧ֧ӧѧߧڧ, էѧߧ ܧѧܧѧ ѧѧܧ֧ڧڧܧ ߧڧէӧڧ  ڧ ԧ֧ߧާ ֧էݧѧԧѧ֧ ӧ٧ާاߧѧ ݧ ߧڧէӧڧ ӧէߧ اڧӧߧ, ܧѧ ߧѧڧҧݧ֧ է֧ӧߧڧ ֧էѧӧڧ֧ݧ֧ اڧӧߧԧ ާڧ,  ӧݧڧ ߧڧէӧڧ ߧѧ٧֧ާߧ اڧӧߧ ާ ߧڧէӧڧ ӧէߧ اڧӧߧ ާԧ ڧާ֧ ҧݧ ٧ߧѧ֧ߧڧ էݧ ѧߧӧݧ֧ߧڧ ߧӧ, ߧ֧ڧ٧ӧ֧ߧ ߧѧܧ ڧէߧ ֧٧֧ӧѧ, ާ֧اӧڧէӧԧ ڧ ֧֧ߧ ާ֧اէ ާܧڧާ, ֧ߧӧէߧާ  ߧѧ٧֧ާߧާ ٧֧ӧѧާ","output":"Nidoviruses associated with aquatic animals"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has proved a globally prevalent outbreak since December 2019.

This paper establishes China's mobility network by a flight dataset and proposes a model without epidemiological parameters to indicate the spread risks through the network, which is termed as epidemic strength. By simply adjusting an intervention parameter, traffic volumes under different travel-restriction levels can be simulated to analyze how the containment strategy can mitigate the virus dissemination through traffic.

Although it is generally accepted that anxiety correlates with clinical and psychosocial stressors, precise quantitative data is limited on the relations among GAD-7, traditional biomarkers, and other measures of health. Even less is known about how GAD-7 relates to race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES).We determined how multiple demographic and socioeconomic data correlate with the participant's GAD-7 results when compared with laboratory, physical function, clinical, and other biological markers. Methods: The Project Baseline Health Study (BHS) is a prospective cohort of adults representing several populations in the USA. We analyzed a deeply phenotyped group of 2502 participants from that study. Measures of interest included: clinical markers or history of medical diagnoses; physical function markers including gait, grip strength, balance time, daily steps, and echocardiographic parameters; psychometric measurements; activities of daily living; socioeconomic characteristics; and laboratory results. Results: Higher GAD-7 scores were associated with female sex, younger age, and Hispanic ethnicity. Measures of low SES were also associated with higher scores, including unemployment, income []$25,000, and []12 years of education. After adjustment for 166 demographic, clinical, laboratory, and symptom characteristics, unemployment and overall higher SES risk scores were highly correlated with anxiety scores. Protective factors included Black race and older age. Limitations: Correlations identified in this cross-sectional study cannot be used to infer causal relationships; further, we were not able to account for possible use of anxiety treatments by study participants.

To overcome deleterious freeze/thaw cycles and to reduce high costs for shipping and storage, we sought to develop a procedure which enables MALDI-MS protein profiling of blood serum proteins without the need for serum freezing. METHODS: Blood sera from patients/donors were divided into portions which after pre-incubation were fast frozen. Thawed aliquots were deposited on filter paper discs and air dried at room temperature. Intact serum proteins were eluted with acid-labile detergent-containing solutions and were desalted by employing a reverse-phase bead system. Purified protein solutions were screened by MALDI-MS using standardized instrument settings. RESULTS: MALDI mass spectra from protein solutions which were eluted from filter paper discs and desalted showed on average 25 strong ion signals (mass range m/z 6000 to m/z 10,000) from intact serum proteins (apolipoproteins, complement proteins, transthyretin and hemoglobin) and from proteolytic processing products. Semi-quantitative analysis of three ion pairs: m/z 6433 and 6631, m/z 8205 and 8916, as well as m/z 9275 and 9422 indicated that the mass spectra from either pre-incubated fast-frozen serum or pre-incubated dried serum spot eluted serum contained the same information on protein composition. CONCLUSIONS: A workflow that avoids the conventional cold-chain and yet enables to investigate intact serum proteins and/or serum proteolysis products by MALDI-MS profiling was developed. The here described protocol tremendously broadens clinical application of MALDI-MS and simultaneously allows to reduce the costs for storage and shipping of serum samples.

We wanted to examine correlations between a selection of sociodemographic variables and infection rates in Oslo's districts. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Aggregated data on districts obtained from Oslo City Government's statistics database were collated with cumulative figures for PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 as of 3 December 2020. We selected some variables from the living conditions indicators that showed a strong correlation with infection rates. The composite variable 'socioeconomic status' included income, education and labour market attachment. 'Household density' included the proportion of people in cramped living conditions and multi-family households. We performed an unadjusted and adjusted standard multiple linear regression analysis of the impact of immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density on infection rates. RESULTS: Immigrant ratio, socioeconomic status and household density were all associated with infection rates in the districts. Pearson's correlation coefficients (95 % CI) were 0.97 (0.93 to 0.99), -0.93 (-0.97 to -0.86) and 0.88 (0.77 to 0.98) respectively, all with p <0.001. In the adjusted model, immigrant ratio was still associated with the infection rate, B = 3.95 (2.16 to 5.73), p <0.001, however there was no longer a statistically significant association between socioeconomic status or household density and infection rates.

A retrospective study of emergency hospitalizations with a diagnosis of acute surgical abdomen between April and July 2020 vs. a similar period in 2019 was performed. The observation sheets and the operating protocols were analyzed. Between April and July 2020, 50 cases of acute surgical abdomen were hospitalized and treated, compared to 43 cases in the same period last year.

This study explored how participants with different profiles of stressful life events, coping resources (i.e., self-esteem and perceived social support) and coping strategies (i.e., maladaptive and adaptive coping) varied in the prevalence of mental, behavioral, and Internet use problems. Methods Data were collected from a large and representative sample of Chinese secondary school students in Hong Kong (n = 3,136) from September to November 2020 (48.1% males;mean age = 13.6 years old). Cluster analysis and logistic regression models were used for analysis. Results The prevalence of suicidal ideation and sleep disturbance was 29.8 and 55.4%, respectively. Behavioral problems were most frequently reported in excessive social media use (53.5%), followed by excessive Internet gaming (43.6%), obesity (34.1%), damaging properties (14.6%), and alcohol or substance abuse (5.1%). The results of cluster analysis yielded three distinctive stress and coping profiles: severe profile (High Risk/Low Protective;17.0%), moderate profile (Moderate Risk/Moderate Protective;35.8%), and mild profile (Low Risk/High Protective;47.2%). Participants with severe and moderate profiles displayed significantly higher levels of mental (range for AOR: 2.08C15.06;all p < 0.001) and behavioral health problems (range for AOR: 1.22C11.22;all p < 0.05) compared to the mild profile cluster. Conclusions Adolescents' mental and behavioral health may be shaped by a combination of stressful life events and variations in coping resources as well as strategies.

Characterizing SARS-CoV-2 mutations, evolution, and effects on infectivity and pathogenicity is crucial to the design of antibody therapies and surveillance strategies. Here, we analyzed 454,443 SARS-CoV-2 spike genes/proteins and 14,427 whole-genome sequences. We demonstrated that the early variant B.1.1.7 may not have evolved spontaneously in the United Kingdom or within human populations. Our extensive analyses suggested that Canidae, Mustelidae or Felidae, especially the Canidae family (for example, dog) could be a possible host of the direct progenitor of variant B.1.1.7. An alternative hypothesis is that the variant was simply yet to be sampled. Notably, the SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome represents a large number of potential co-mutations. In addition, we used an experimental SARS-CoV-2 reporter replicon system to introduce the dominant co-mutations NSP12_c14408t, 5'UTR_c241t, and NSP3_c3037t into the viral genome, and to monitor the effect of the mutations on viral replication.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the accuracy of mass spectrometry diagnostic tests developed so far, across a wide range of biological matrices, and additionally to assess risks of bias and applicability in studies published to date. METHOD: 23 retrospective observational cohort studies were included in the systematic review using the PRISMA-DTA framework, with a total of 2858 COVID-19 positive participants and 2544 controls. Risks of bias and applicability were assessed via a QUADAS-2 questionnaire. A meta-analysis was also performed focusing on sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy and Youden's Index, in addition to assessing heterogeneity. Findings. Sensitivity averaged 0.87 in the studies reviewed herein (interquartile range 0.81C0.96) and specificity 0.88 (interquartile range 0.82C0.98), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic summary curve of 0.93. By subgroup, the best diagnostic results were achieved by viral proteomic analyses of nasopharyngeal swabs and metabolomic analyses of plasma and serum. The performance of other sampling matrices (breath, sebum, saliva) was less good, indicating that these protocols are currently insufficiently mature for clinical application.

There is a rich history of MIDD applications at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). MIDD applications span across the life cycle of the development of new drugs, generics, and biologic products. In new drug development, MIDD approaches are often applied to inform clinical trial design including dose selection/optimization, aid in the evaluation of critical regulatory review questions such as evidence of effectiveness, and development of policy. In the biopharmaceutics space, we see a trend for increasing role of computational modeling to inform formulation development and help strategize future in vivo studies or lifecycle plans in the post approval setting. As more information and knowledge becomes available pre-approval, quantitative mathematical models are becoming indispensable in supporting generic drug development and approval including complex generic drug products and are expected to help reduce overall time and cost. While the application of MIDD to inform the development of cell and gene therapy products is at an early stage, the potential for future application of MIDD include understanding and quantitative evaluation of information related to biological activity/pharmacodynamics, cell expansion/persistence, transgene expression, immune response, safety, and efficacy.

This new simulator is called SIMISGEST-VR (Simulator of Minimally Invasive Surgery mediated by Gestures - Virtual Reality). METHODS: In this prospective observational validity study, the authors looked for multiple sources of evidence (known group construct validity, prior videogaming experience, internal structure, test-retest reliability, and consequences of testing) for the proposed SIMISGEST-VR tasks. Undergraduate students (n=100, reference group), surgical residents (n=20), and experts in minimally invasive surgery (n=28) took part in the study. After answering a demographic questionnaire and watching a video of the tasks to be performed, they individually repeated each task 10 times with each hand. The simulator provided concurrent, immediate, and terminal feedback and obtained the task metrics (time and score). From the reference group, 29 undergraduate students were randomly selected to perform the tasks 6 months later in order to determine test-retest reliability. RESULTS: Evidence from multiple sources, including strong intrarater reliability and internal consistency, considerable evidence for the hypothesized consequences of testing, and partial confirmation for relations to other variables, supports the validity of the scores and the metrics used to train and teach basic psychomotor skills for minimally invasive surgery via a new low-cost portable simulator that utilizes interaction technology mediated by gestures.

A viable candidate in the struggle against the pandemic is antimicrobial polymer, due to their favorable properties of flexibility, lightweight, and ease of synthesis. Polymers are the base material for personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, face mask, face shield, and coverall suit for frontliners. Conducting polymers (CPs) are polymers with electrical properties due to the addition of dopant in the polymer structure. The conductivity of polymers augments their antiviral and antibacterial properties. This review discusses the types of CPs and how their properties could be exploited to ward off bacterial infections in hospital settings, specifically in cases involving COVID-19 patients.

We analyzed the United States cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2018). Chemicals were measured in blood or urine (198 chemicals, 17 families). Immune biomarkers included percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils, and counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, and mean corpuscular volume. We conducted survey-weighted, multivariable linear regressions of log2-transformed chemicals on immune measures, adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, poverty-income ratio, waist circumference, cotinine concentration, creatinine for urinary chemicals, and survey cycle. We accounted for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate (FDR). Among 45,528 adult participants, using survey weights, the mean age was 45.7 years, 51.4% were female, and 69.3% were Non-Hispanic White.

Very recently, also SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has been found to enhance CK2 activity and to induce the phosphorylation of several CK2 substrates (either viral and host proteins). CK2 is also considered an emerging target for neurological diseases, inflammation and autoimmune disorders, diverse ophthalmic pathologies, diabetes, and obesity. In addition, CK2 activity has been associated with cardiovascular diseases, as cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, and cardiac hypertrophy. The hypothesis of considering CK2 inhibition for cystic fibrosis therapies has been also entertained for many years.

On these bases, CK2 is emerging as an increasingly attractive target in various fields of human medicine, with the advantage that several very specific and effective inhibitors are already available.

However, the defense methods that have good effect in natural images may not be suitable for medical diagnostic tasks. The pre-processing methods (e.g., random resizing, compression) may lead to the loss of the small lesions feature in the medical image. Retraining the network on the augmented data set is also not practical for medical models that have already been deployed online. Accordingly, it is necessary to design an easy-to-deploy and effective defense framework for medical diagnostic tasks. In this paper, we propose a Robust and Retrain-Less Diagnostic Framework for Medical pretrained models against adversarial attack (i.e., MedRDF). It acts on the inference time of the pretrained medical model. Specifically, for each test image, MedRDF firstly creates a large number of noisy copies of it, and obtains the output labels of these copies from the pretrained medical diagnostic model. Then, based on the labels of these copies, MedRDF outputs the final robust diagnostic result by majority voting. In addition to the diagnostic result, MedRDF produces the Robust Metric (RM) as the confidence of the result. Therefore, it is convenient and reliable to utilize MedRDF to convert pretrained non-robust diagnostic models into robust ones.

Results Twenty-five observational studies (5360 patients) were included for analyses. A majority of the studies used mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273) with a small number of studies including other types of vaccines (AZD1222, Coronavac, BBV152, Ad26.COV2.S). Serologic response after a single (6 studies) and two doses (17 studies) of mRNA vaccine were 73.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 65.7-79.5) and 83.4% (95%CI 76.8-88.4), respectively. On meta-regression, anti-CD20 therapy was associated with lower response rates (P <0.001) and anti-TNF therapy also showed a trend toward lower response rates (P = 0.058).

We sought to determine whether perioperative hypothermia and other risk factors and clinical outcomes are associated with SSI in the pediatric population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This case-control study took place from January 2014 through December 2016 and included patients at a National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-participant academic children's hospital. All surgical patients were included in this retrospective analysis. SSI rates were determined. A univariate analysis was performed to determine clinical factors associated with SSI. A multivariate regression analysis was then performed to determine the predictive effect of minimum perioperative temperature for SSI. RESULTS: This study included 3541 patients, of which 92 (2.6%) developed SSI. A univariate analysis showed associations among SSI and higher perioperative temperatures, surgical specialty of otolaryngology and general surgery, and wound classification (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] classification III and IV). A multivariate analysis determined the odds of SSI increased by a factor of 1.6 for every 1C increase in minimum perioperative temperature. CONCLUSIONS: Unintended perioperative hypothermia in our pediatric patients was inversely associated with SSI. This finding suggests that pediatric SSI prevention may not require the efforts made for adult patients to maintain normothermia.","output":"Unintended Perioperative Hypothermia and Surgical Site Infection in Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Recently, several single center studies have suggested a protective effect of the influenza vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This study utilizes a continuously updated Electronic Medical Record (EMR) network to assess the possible benefits of influenza vaccination mitigating critical adverse outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients from 56 healthcare organizations (HCOs). METHODS: The de-identified records of 73,346,583 patients were retrospectively screened. Two cohorts of 37,377 patients, having either received or not received influenza vaccination six monthsCtwo weeks prior to SARS-CoV-2 positive diagnosis, were created using Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) and logical observation identifiers names and codes (LOINC) codes. Adverse outcomes within 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis were compared between cohorts. Outcomes were assessed with stringent propensity score matching including age, race, ethnicity, gender, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, heart disease, and lifestyle habits such as smoking. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced decreased sepsis (p<0.01, Risk Ratio: 1.361C1.450, 95% CI:1.123C1.699, NNT:286) and stroke (p<0.02, RR: 1.451C1.580, 95% CI:1.075C2.034, NNT:625) across all time points. ICU admissions were lower in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients receiving the influenza vaccine at 30, 90, and 120 days (p<0.03, RR: 1.174C1.200, 95% CI:1.003C1.385, NNT:435), while approaching significance at 60 days (p = 0.0509, RR: 1.156, 95% CI:0.999C1.338). Patients who received the influenza vaccine experienced fewer DVTs 60C120 days after positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (p<0.02, RR:1.41C1.530, 95% CI:1.082C2.076, NNT:1000) and experienced fewer emergency department (ED) visits 90C120 days post SARS-CoV-2-positive diagnosis (p<0.01, RR:1.204C1.580, 95% CI: 1.050C1.476, NNT:176). CONCLUSION: Our analysis outlines the potential protective effect of influenza vaccination in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients against adverse outcomes within 30, 60, 90, and 120 days of a positive diagnosis. Significant findings favoring influenza vaccination mitigating the risks of sepsis, stroke, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), emergency department (ED) & Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admissions suggest a potential protective effect that could benefit populations without readily available access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thus further investigation with future prospective studies is warranted.","output":"Examining the potential benefits of the influenza vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: A retrospective cohort analysis of 74,754 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Minirhizotrons (paired camera systems and buried observatories) are the best current method to make repeatable measurements of fine root dynamics in the field. Automating data collection is the only way to assess fine-scale temporal changes in fine roots in natural systems. When paired with above-ground proximal remote sensing, automatic minirhizotron data could reveal coordination between above and below ground phenology, supporting both plant allocation and carbon exchange understanding. However, there are many challenges to automating minirhizotrons for field experiments. First, instruments must be cheap enough to replicate given shallow field of view and variable natural environments. Second, automated analysis must be robust to changeable soil and root conditions because image properties extracted must have biological meaning. Here, we demonstrate an automatic minirhizotron scheme, built with off-the-shelf parts and capable to sample at sub-daily resolution paired with a neural network-based image analysis method. As a proof of concept, we tested the instruments and the methodology in a mesocosm study and in two short real-world field trials alongside datasets from other instruments (e.g. proximal remote sensed leaf dynamics). We show that the method produces robust daily time-series of root dynamics in the mesocosm and the field. We applied the same model across multiple instruments, demonstrating good reproducibility of measurements. Temporal variations of root cover were a strong driver of soil CO2 efflux in mesocosm, and vegetation dynamics from above ground proximal remote sensing and minirhizotron data differed both in mesocosm and field. We found sensitivity of root cover extracted to soil moisture and sometimes time of day (potentially relating to soil moisture), which may only affect high frequency imagery and not commonly reported as encountered when training neural networks on traditional, time-distinct minirhizotron studies. We discuss avenues for dealing with such issues in future field applications of minirhizotrons. If such issues are dealt with to a satisfactory manner in the field, timeseries of root biomass and traits from replicated instruments can add a new dimension to phenology studies at the ecosystem level by understanding the dynamics of root properties and traits.","output":"Replicate Sub-Daily Minirhizotron Sampling, Data and Interpretation for Root Dynamics Studies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite substantial inflow of infected cases at the early stage of the pandemic, as of the end of April, Japan manages the outbreak of COVID-19 without systematic breakdown of health care This Japanese paradox C limited fatality despite loose restriction C may have multiple contributing factors, including general hygiene practice of the population, customs such as not shaking hands or hugging, lower prevalence of obesity and other risk factors Along with these societal and epidemiological conditions, health policy options, which are characteristic to Japan, would be considered as one of the contribution factors Some health policy factors relatively unique to Japan are described in this article","output":"Japanese strategy to COVID-19: How does it work?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The activity of influenza A at the end of 2019 was higher than previous two years in children younger than 6 years old in Wuhan, China.

Subject and Method: A nationally-representative household survey was undertaken across Wales (Public Health Wales' COVID-19, Employment and Health in Wales study), with cross-sectional data on home-working being collected between November 2020 and January 2021 from 615 employed working-aged adults in Wales (63.7% female, 32.7% aged 50-59). Respondents were asked about their ability to work from home, their perceptions of its impact on their health and their preferences for time spent home-working in future. Results Over 50% were able to work from home, and showed a preference towards home-working to some capacity, with over a third wishing to work from home at least half the time. However, those living in the most deprived areas, in atypical employment, with high wage precarity or with limiting pre-existing conditions were less likely to report being able to work from home. Of those that could work from home, over 40% reported that it worsened their mental well-being and loneliness, and for people in poorer health, home-working negatively impacted their diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol use. People aged 30 to 39 and those who lived alone were more likely to report wanting to spend some time working in an office/base instead of at home. Conclusion The inequity in the ability to work from home reflects underlying inequalities in Wales, with those facing the greatest insecurity (e.g. those living in most deprived areas, those with more precarious work or financial circumstances) being less able to participate in home-working. Working from home offers greater flexibility, reduces the financial and time costs associated with commuting, and protects individuals from exposure to communicable diseases. However, working from home presents an enormous challenge to preserving the mental-wellbeing of the workforce, particularly for younger individuals and those with low mental well-being. Younger respondents and those in poorer health who could work from home were also more likely to engage in health-harming behaviours, and reduce their engagement in health-protective behaviours such as eating well and moving more. Reflecting on the future, providing pathways for accessing work from home arrangements, integrating hybrid models and preparing targeted health support for at risk groups may be best suited to the working population's preferences and needs.","output":"Exploring the health impacts and inequalities of the new way of working: findings from a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 has become a global pandemic of the highest priority.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to characterize the approach to opioid prescription for persons with spinal cord damage (SCD). SETTING: An international online questionnaire. METHODS: A survey was posted online and circulated among international societies within the field of SCI medicine from August to November 2018. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three physicians responded to the survey. Of these, 107 (92%) managed pain for persons with SCD. Most (82%) felt that opioid prescription was appropriate for uncontrolled acute pain, but fewer (67%) felt it was appropriate for chronic pain. Of those who felt opioids had a role in the treatment of neuropathic pain, 46% did not think there should be a specific upper limit of opioid dose. The majority (85%) would continue prescribing high doses (250 morphine milligram equivalent (MME) doses/day) if that dose were effective. Tramadol was the most common opioid prescribed first line. CONCLUSION: Most physicians who responded to this survey prescribe opioids for intractable pain after SCD. A significant proportion of respondents believed that there should not be a specific upper limit of opioid dose prescribed if the drug is tolerated; this does not align with current recommendations. Most physicians do not feel influenced in their prescribing habits by regulatory bodies. If physicians decide to taper an opioid that is being tolerated well, it is most commonly related to a fear of the patient developing an opioid-use disorder.

We compared the baseline characteristics and in-hospital mortality between hypertensive patients taking RAS inhibitors (N=355) versus non-RAS inhibitors (N=827). Of the 1,182 hypertensive patients (median age 68 years, 49.1% male), 12/355 (3.4%) patients died in the RAS inhibitors group vs. 95/827 (11.5%) patients in the non-RAS inhibitors group (p<0.0001). Adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15-0.52, p<0.0001) at 45 days in the RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. Similar findings were observed when patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (N=289) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (N=66) were separately compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. The RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group had lower levels of C-reactive protein (median 13.5 vs. 24.4 pg/mL; p=0.007) and interleukin-6 (median 6.0 vs. 8.5 pg/mL; p=0.026) on admission.

It serves as an introductory contribution to the Special Issue of this journal on happy and healthy cities, with particular emphasis on the implications of COVID-19 in pluriform cities. There is no doubt that contemporary cities are growing, and have become more dynamic and crowded. The more people, the bigger the challenges are to manage urban growth and to cope withand controldensity frictions, such as pandemics (e.g., COVID-19). Cities have the task to satisfy the essential needs of many heterogeneous people and to develop appropriate people-based strategies in order to make or keep people happy and healthy. The current COVID-19 disaster is a real urban challenge. The deployment of smart cities strategies and the use of digital technology tools in order to capture and provide intelligent internal and external online information and communication opportunities may help citiesin active partnership with their residents (smart citizens voice)to manage shocks and disruptions in the urban system. Clearly, cities are dynamic and adaptive organisms with a high resilience capacity. A key question addressed in this paper is whether urban inhabitants may be inclined to move out of the city due to human health threats, or whether intelligent digital technology tools will be able to overcome the current challenges to the urban way of life. The paper argues that modern information and communication technology offers a range of opportunities for a healthy city life, so that the COVID-19 pandemic will most likely not lead to a massive demographic outflow from urban agglomerations to less densely populated areas in particular rural areas. Instead, what is called the corona crisis may cause just a ripple in the permanent dynamic evolution of cities.","output":"A Post-Corona Perspective for Smart Cities: Should I Stay or Should I Go?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Pedagogical creativity is the development of flexible practices that are responsive to student inquiry, oriented toward risk-taking, and grounded in conceptions of pedagogues as curricular authors.

Data from semistructured interviews were analyzed through a theoretical framework of pedagogical creativity (Abramo & Reynolds, 2015). Attention was paid to the types of practices music educators were exploring, how pedagogical creativity was being implemented within the school culture, and the impact such practices had on music educators understandings of educational purpose. Findings indicate that participants found teaching during the unique context of the pandemic to be an opportunity to explore pedagogical creativity, particularly as public performance pressures were alleviated and social-emotional learning was emphasized. In particular, pedagogical creativity was often practically implemented out of a desire to remain responsive toward who and where participants were teaching, suggesting that responsiveness may be a criterion of pedagogical creativity. ? 2022 Board of Trustees.","output":"Teaching in a Time of Crisis: Pedagogical Creativity in Music Education"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is a global threat, causing high mortality, especially in the elderly. The main symptoms and the primary cause of death are related to interstitial pneumonia. Viral entry also into myocardial cells mainly via the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) receptor and excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however, also make the heart susceptible to injury. In addition to the immediate damage caused by the acute inflammatory response, the heart may also suffer from long-term consequences of COVID-19, potentially causing a post-pandemic increase in cardiac complications. Although the main cause of cardiac damage in COVID-19 remains coagulopathy with micro- (and to a lesser extent macro-) vascular occlusion, open questions remain about other possible modalities of cardiac dysfunction, such as direct infection of myocardial cells, effects of cytokines storm, and mechanisms related to enhanced coagulopathy. In this opinion paper, we focus on these lesser appreciated possibilities and propose experimental approaches that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular bases of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. We first discuss approaches to characterize cardiac damage caused by possible direct viral infection of cardiac cells, followed by formulating hypotheses on how to reproduce and investigate the hyperinflammatory and pro-thrombotic conditions observed in the heart of COVID-19 patients using experimental in vitro systems. Finally, we elaborate on strategies to discover novel pathology biomarkers using omics platforms.","output":"COVID-19 related cardiac complications - from clinical evidences to basic mechanisms.

METHODS: The first case of COVID\\\\19 in our country was seen on March 11th, 2020. The patients operated between March 11th, 2019\\\\and March 10th, 2020 were taken as the pre\\\\COVID group, and those operated between March 11th and May 11th, 2020 were taken as the COVID group. The data was retrospectively collected, and the two periods were compared. RESULTS: Monthly average number of cases which was 52 patients/month (626 patients in 12 months) before COVID decreased to 35 patients/month (70 patients in 2 months) during COVID periods (P < .01). During the pre\\\\COVID period the median postoperative length of hospital stay was 3 (IQR: 1\\\\5) days. During the COVID period, this decreased to 1 (IQR: 1\\\\3) day (P < .01). During the pre\\\\COVID period, the hospital expenses of 17% (8/47) of the foreign nationals were covered by their homeland. The remaining 83% (39/47) were paid from the asylum seekers fund.

Data from large epidemiological studies support the significance of these components in the control of asthma and their contribution to airway remodeling, suggesting the presence of an asthma phenotype with metabolic dysfunction. These components are quite interactive with each other, so it is difficult to reveal the individual role of each. It is well known that asthma is difficult to treat in patients with obesity, due in part to inadequate response to inhaled corticosteroids. Additionally, vitamin D deficiency and insulin resistance have been regarded as aggravating factors of asthma control and airway remodeling.

As pregnancy is characterized by significant changes in cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and immunological systems, there are concerns on issues like the course of disease in pregnant women, safety of medications, route of delivery and risk of obstetric complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current literature in the management of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although more than 90% of pregnant women with COVID-19 recover without serious morbidity, rapid deterioration of disease and higher rates of obstetric complications may be observed. The risk of vertical transmission has not been clearly revealed yet. Decreasing the number of prenatal visits, shortening the time allocated for the examinations, active use of telemedicine services, limiting the number of persons in healthcare settings, combining prenatal tests in the same visit, restricting visitors during the visits, providing a safe environment in healthcare facilities, strict hygiene control, and providing personal protective equipment during the visits are the main strategies to control the spread of disease according to current guidelines. Although new medication alternatives are being proposed every day for the treatment of COVID-19, our knowledge about the use of most of these drugs in pregnancy is limited. Preliminary results are promising for the administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the pregnant population. Timing of delivery should be decided based on maternal health condition, accompanying obstetric complications and gestational age. Cesarean delivery should be performed for obstetric indications. Breast feeding should be encouraged as long as necessary precautions for viral transmission are taken.

Given the importance of the senses to daily functioning and personal experience, the mental health consequences of these symptoms warrant further attention. Methods: A cohort of Reddit users posting within the /r/covid19positive subforum (N=15,821) was leveraged to analyze instantaneous risk of transition to a state of suicidal ideation or depression using Cox proportional-hazards models. Risk transition was defined by posts made in suicide- or depression-related forums, or mentions of relevant phrases with and without mention of anosmia/ageusia in /r/covid19positive. Self-diagnosis of COVID-19 was also modeled as a separate and simultaneous predictor of mental health risk. Results: Mention of anosmia/ageusia was significantly associated with transition to a risk state. Users with a history of anosmia/ageusia-related posts and who self-identified as COVID-19 positive had 30% higher instantaneous risk relative to others. The highest increase in instantaneous risk of suicidal ideation or depression occurred more than 100 days after first posting in /r/covid19positive. Limitations: Use of self-diagnosed disease as well as a broad array of anosmia/ageusia-related terminology may entail both information bias and overestimates of symptom incidence.

While animal research suggests these biological processes are related to one another, our knowledge of brain development in humans is largely based on age-related processes. Thus, the current study characterized puberty-related changes in human brain structure, by combining data from two longitudinal neuroimaging cohorts. Beyond normative changes in cortical thickness, we examined whether individual differences in the rate of pubertal maturation (or pubertal tempo) was associated with variations in cortical trajectories. Participants (N = 192; scans = 366) completed up to three waves of MRI assessments between 8.5 and 14.5 years of age, as well as questionnaire assessments of pubertal stage at each wave. Generalized additive mixture models were used to characterize trajectories of cortical development. Results revealed widespread linear puberty-related changes across much of the cortex. Many of these changes, particularly within the frontal and parietal cortices, were independent of age-related development. Males exhibiting faster pubertal tempo demonstrated greater thinning in the precuneus and frontal cortices than same-aged and -sex peers.

The lack of a clear human epidemic suggests that the basic reproductive number R0 is below or very close to one for all three infections. However, robust cluster-based estimates for low R0 values are still desirable so as to help prioritise scarce resources between different emerging infections and to detect significant changes between clusters and over time. We developed an inferential transmission model capable of distinguishing the signal of human-to-human transmission from the background noise of direct spillover transmission (e.g. from markets or farms). By simulation, we showed that our approach could obtain unbiased estimates of R0, even when the temporal trend in spillover exposure was not fully known, so long as the serial interval of the infection and the timing of a sudden drop in spillover exposure were known (e.g. day of market closure). Applying our method to data from the three largest outbreaks of influenza A/H7N9 outbreak in China in 2013, we found evidence that human-to-human transmission accounted for 13% (95% credible interval 1%C32%) of cases overall. We estimated R0 for the three clusters to be: 0.19 in Shanghai (0.01-0.49), 0.29 in Jiangsu (0.03-0.73); and 0.03 in Zhejiang (0.00-0.22). If a reliable temporal trend for the spillover hazard could be estimated, for example by implementing widespread routine sampling in sentinel markets, it should be possible to estimate sub-critical values of R0 even more accurately.

INTERVENTIONS Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS Two nights of in-home PSG; 9 nights of wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries; retrospective sleep questionnaires; and measures of sociodemographic, psychosocial, and adiposity characteristics. RESULTS All measures of sleep duration differed significantly, with modest associations between PSG-assessed and retrospective questionnaire-assessed sleep duration. Individuals estimated their habitual sleep duration about 20-30 minutes longer by questionnaire and their prospective sleep diaries compared with both PSG- and actigraphy-assessed sleep duration. Persons reporting higher hostility had smaller associations between PSG-assessed sleep duration and other methods compared with those with lower hostility; those reporting more depressive symptoms and poorer overall health had smaller associations between actigraphy-assessed sleep duration and questionnaire and diary measures. Apnea-hypopnea index was not related to differences among estimates of sleep duration.

These findings may be useful in understanding the health consequences of short or long self-reported sleep duration and for guiding investigator decisions about choices of measures in specific populations.","output":"Similarities and differences in estimates of sleep duration by polysomnography, actigraphy, diary, and self-reported habitual sleep in a community sample."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Considering the changing landscape of internet use and rising ownership of digital technology by young people, new methods could be considered to improve the current model of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) management. OBJECTIVE This systematic review aims to evaluate the usability of eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) interventions currently available for young people living with JIA. METHODS The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used to oversee this review. We systematically searched 15 databases for 252 potential studies; 2 authors independently screened all quantitative studies reporting the use of eHealth and mHealth interventions for young people (aged 1-18 years) diagnosed with JIA. Studies were excluded if they did not report outcome measures or were reviews, commentaries, or qualitative studies. Study methodological quality was scored using the Down and Black (modified) checklist. A narrative descriptive methodology was used to quantify the data because of heterogeneity across the studies. RESULTS A total of 11 studies were included in this review, reporting 7 eHealth and mHealth interventions for young people (aged 4-18 years) living with JIA, targeting health issues such as pain, health-related quality of life, physical activity, and chronic disease self-management. The usability of the interventions was facilitated through training and ongoing support. The engagement was promoted by a combination of persuasive influences, and barriers preventing adherence were removed through personal reminders and flexible program schedules to cater to JIA and non-JIA illnesses or other commonly seen activities in childhood. The feedback obtained was that most young people and their parents liked the interventions. CONCLUSIONS The results of this review need to be considered cautiously because of the lack of rigorous testing and heterogeneity, which limits the detailed descriptions of data synthesis. Further research is needed to consider gender differences, associated costs, and the effectiveness of the interventions on health outcomes to better support young people living with JIA.","output":"Usability of eHealth and Mobile Health Interventions by Young People Living With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper develops a tractable model of a society hit by a viral pandemic It is sufficiently rich so as to relate the optimal decisions of the policymaker to","output":"One Foe, so Many Fights Making Sense of Covid-19 Policies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID19 pandemic has highlighted the lack of resilience in supply chains, as global networks fail from disruptions at single nodes and connections. Through an overview of the existing vaccine and pharmaceutical supply chain publications focusing on resilience, as well as recent papers reporting modeling of resilience in supply chains across multiple fields, we find that models for supply chain resilience are few and most of them are focused on individual dimensions of resilience rather than on comprehensive strategy necessary for scaling up vaccine production and distribution in emergency settings. We find that COVID19 resulted in a wave of interest to supply chain resilience, but publications from 2020 are narrow in focus and largely qualitative in nature;evidence-based models and measures are rare. Further, publications often focus exclusively on specific portions of the specific supply chain of interest, excluding associated supporting networks, such as transportation, social and command and control (C2) necessary for vaccine production and equitable distribution. This lack of network analysis is a major gap in the literature that needs to be bridged in order to create methods of real-time analysis and decision tools for the COVID19 vaccine supply chain. We conclude that a comprehensive, quantitative approach to network resilience that encompasses the supply chain in the context of other social and physical networks is needed in order to address the emerging challenges of a large-scale COVID-19 vaccination program. We further find that the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the necessity of positioning supply chain resilience within a multi-network context and formally incorporating temporal dimensions into analysis through the NAS definition of resilience, plan, absorb, recover, adapt, to ensure essential needs are met across all dimensions of society.","output":"The Vaccine Supply Chain: A Call for Resilience Analytics to Support COVID-19 Vaccine Production and Distribution"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Social distancing and stay-at-home orders were implemented as a quick response to the public health crisis created by COVID-19 However, these measures led to competing concerns for public health versus the wellbeing of the economy during the pandemic This drove polarized views and attitudes towards these measures in the US that threatened their effectiveness in controlling the spread of infections Our study addresses this point by investigating uptake of messaging treatments that highlight the health risks of COVID-19 We also investigate how priming economic risk of COVID-19 affects responsiveness to the health information messaging A sample of 1,200 US respondents were randomly assigned to a control and four messaging treatments that included information about risks of COVID-19 on own health, public health, the economy, and combination of public health and the economy, respectively Our results indicate a significant difference in messaging uptake based on political partisanship Individuals identifying as Democrats increased their social distancing and stay-at-home decisions in response to all information treatments, contrary to Republicans who showed no significant change in their behavior Using a latent class analysis model, we classify individuals into three main types (dismissive, amenable, and conscious) that differ in their perceptions of the risks associated with COVID-19 We show that only amenable individuals, who account for approximately 34% of the sample, respond significantly to the messaging treatments","output":"Promoting Higher Social Distancing and Stay-at-Home Decisions During COVID-19: the Underlying Conflict Between Public Health and the Economy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The large number of spike substitutions in Omicron lineage variants (BA.1, BA.1.1. and BA.2) could jeopardize the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.

RECENT FINDINGS A compilation of previous and new studies of olfactory disorders suggests associated complaints of poor quality of life, depression, and various specific consequences. Epidemiological studies show that loss in odor sensitivity is common in both general and clinical populations, whereas dysosmia is less common in general populations but frequent in clinical populations. The most common etiologies are post-upper respiratory infection, nasal/sinus disease and head trauma. SUMMARY Procedures to diagnose olfactory disorders and to identify etiologies are available. Depending on etiology, certain types of treatment are often successful, such as endoscopic sinus surgery and corticosteroid administration in nasal/sinus disease. In post-upper respiratory infection and head trauma, spontaneous recovery is fairly high. In any case, it is advisable to counsel the patient with regards to strategies to cope with olfactory disorders.","output":"Complaints of olfactory disorders: epidemiology, assessment and clinical implications."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A COVID-19 outbreak occurred among residents of a Roma settlement in Greece (8 April-4 June 2020). The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with an increased risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures implemented. Data were analyzed from individuals that were tested for SARS-CoV-2 during contact tracing, population screening or hospital visits. RT-PCR was used for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in oropharyngeal samples. Risk factors for household secondary attack rates (SAR) and hospitalization with COVID-19 were examined using chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests and logistic regression analyses. During the outbreak, 142 cases, 20 hospitalizations and 1 death were recorded, with a total of 2273 individuals tested. The risk of hospitalization was associated with age (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07) and Cycle threshold (Ct) values (OR for a decrease in Ct values by 1: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.07-1.31). Household SAR was estimated at 38.62% (95% CI: 32.50-45.01%). After the designation of an isolation facility for cases, household SAR declined from 74.42% to 31.03%. Household size was associated with the risk of infection (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: 1.00-7.07). The presence of COVID-19 symptoms among index cases was correlated with higher transmission (OR: 23.68, 95% CI 2.21-253.74) in multivariate analysis, while age was found to be associated with SAR only in univariate analysis.

Thus, we aimed to examine ED utilization among pediatric patients and the impact of COVID-19 in one large city affected by the outbreak. METHODS: This retrospective study included data from six EDs in Daegu, Korea. We compared the demographic and clinical data of patients presenting to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic (February 1stCJune 30th 2020) with those of patients who visited the ED in this period during 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Fewer patients, particularly children visited the EDs during the study period in 2020 than those in the previous (2018/2019) year period: the number of adult patient decreased by 46.4% and children by 76.9%. Although the number of patients increased from the lowest point of the decrease in March 2020, the number of pediatric patients visiting the ED remained less than half (45.2%) in June 2020 compared with that of previous years. The proportion of patients with severe conditions increased in adults, infants, and school-aged children, and consequently resulted in increased ambulance use and higher hospitalization rates. Fewer infants and young children but more school-aged children visited the ED with febrile illnesses in 2020 than in 2018/2019.

We aimed to compare the accuracy of ASTP and TBI and establish optimal threshold values of ASTP and TBI with reference to the internationally accepted ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) screening test, for a multiethnic diabetic population in Singapore. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study of DFS results from January 2017 to December 2017 was conducted. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted for ASTP and TBI using the internationally accepted ABPI cut-off value of 0.9 to indicate PAD. RESULTS: A total of 1,454 patients with mean (standard deviation) age of 63.1 (12.4) years old were included. There were 50.8% men and 49.2% women, comprising 69.7% Chinese, 13.5% Indian, 10.1% Malay and 6.7% other ethnicities.

Manual chart review can be used to identify the occurrence of delirium; however, it is labor-intensive and impractical for large-scale studies.

We developed and validated NLP algorithms to automatically identify the occurrence of delirium from EHRs. METHODS: This study used a randomly selected cohort from the population-based Mayo Clinic Biobank (N = 300, age 65). We adopted the standardized evidence-based framework confusion assessment method (CAM) to develop and evaluate NLP algorithms to identify the occurrence of delirium using clinical notes in EHRs. Two NLP algorithms were developed based on CAM criteria: one based on the original CAM (NLP-CAM; delirium vs no delirium) and another based on our modified CAM (NLP-mCAM; definite, possible, and no delirium). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used for concordance in delirium status between NLP algorithms and manual chart review as the gold standard. The prevalence of delirium cases was examined using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), NLP-CAM, and NLP-mCAM. RESULTS: NLP-CAM demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.919, 1.000, and 0.967, respectively.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature to scope and assess the effects of specific strategies for the management of the bodies. METHODS: We searched five general, three Chinese and four coronavirus disease (COVID-19)-specific electronic databases. We searched registries of clinical trials, websites of governmental and other relevant organisations, reference lists of the included papers and relevant systematic reviews, and Epistemonikos for relevant systematic reviews. We included guidance documents providing practical advice on the handling of bodies of deceased persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Then, we sought primary evidence of any study design reporting on the efficacy and safety of the identified strategies in coronaviruses. We included evidence relevant to contextual factors (ie, acceptability). A single reviewer extracted data using a pilot-tested form and graded the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. A second reviewer verified the data and assessments. RESULTS: We identified one study proposing an uncommon strategy for autopsies for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. The study provided very low-certainty evidence that it reduced the risk of transmission. We identified 23 guidance documents providing practical advice on the steps of handling the bodies: preparation, packing, and others and advice related to both the handling of the dead bodies and the use of personal protective equipment by individuals handling them. We did not identify COVID-19 evidence relevant to any of these steps. CONCLUSION: While a substantive number of guidance documents propose specific strategies, we identified no study providing direct evidence for the effects of any of those strategies.

After import into mitochondria, these targeting signals are cleaved off by the mitochondrial processing peptidase MPP, giving rise to shorter mature proteins. Using the mitochondrial tandem protein Arg5,6 as a model substrate, we demonstrate that MPP has an additional role in preprotein maturation, beyond the removal of presequences. Arg5,6 is synthesized as a polyprotein precursor that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix and subsequently separated into two distinct enzymes that function in arginine biogenesis. This internal processing is performed by MPP, which cleaves the Arg5,6 precursor both at its N-terminus and at an internal site between the Arg5 and Arg6 parts. The peculiar organization and biogenesis of Arg5,6 is conserved across fungi and might preserve the mode of co-translational subunit association of the arginine biosynthesis complex of the polycistronic arginine operon in prokaryotic mitochondrial ancestors. Putative MPP cleavage sites are also present at the junctions in other mitochondrial fusion proteins from fungi, plants and animals. Our data suggest that, in addition to its role as ticket canceller for the removal of presequences, MPP exhibits a second, widely conserved activity as internal processing peptidase for complex mitochondrial precursor proteins.","output":"More than just a ticket canceller: The mitochondrial processing peptidase matures complex precursor proteins at internal cleavage sites"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The development of ICT usage in households, by individuals or in enterprises is submitted to the requirements of security This paper aims a statistical analysis of ICT security aspects from several perspectives: ICT policies, staff awareness of ICT security related issues, ICT security related activities The methodology used for testing the hypotheses is based on descriptive statistics, chart case study, correlation and factor analysis The results emphasize the importance of investing resources in cyber security, moreover, in the current pandemic situation generated by COVID-19","output":"ICT Security Measures for the Companies within European Union Member States - Perspectives in COVID-19 Context"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is an important immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory virus that primarily infects immune cells and strongly suppresses the proliferation of infected cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation and suppression mediated by HHV-6 are still unknown. In this study, we examined the ability of HHV-6A to manipulate cell cycle progression in infected cells and explored the potential molecular mechanisms. We demonstrated that infection with HHV-6A imposed a growth-inhibitory effect on HSB-2 cells by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase. We then showed that the activity of the Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex was significantly decreased in HHV-6A-infected HSB-2 cells. Furthermore, we found that inactivation of Cdc2-cyclin B1 in HHV-6A-infected cells occurred through the inhibitory Tyr15 phosphorylation resulting from elevated Wee1 expression and inactivated Cdc25C. The reduction of Cdc2-cyclin B1 activity in HHV-6-infected cells was also partly due to the increased expression of the cell cycle-regulatory molecule p21 in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, HHV-6A infection activated the DNA damage checkpoint kinases Chk2 and Chk1. Our data suggest that HHV-6A infection induces G(2)/M arrest in infected T cells via various molecular regulatory mechanisms. These results further demonstrate the potential mechanisms involved in immune suppression and modulation mediated by HHV-6 infection, and they provide new insights relevant to the development of novel vaccines and immunotherapeutic approaches.","output":"Human herpesvirus 6 suppresses T cell proliferation through induction of cell cycle arrest in infected cells in the G2/M phase."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To better understand dynamic disease processes, integrated multi-omic methods are needed, yet comparing different types of omic data remains difficult. Integrative solutions benefit experimenters by eliminating potential biases that come with single omic analysis. We have developed the methods needed to explore whether a relationship exists between co-expression network models built from transcriptomic and proteomic data types, and whether this relationship can be used to improve the disease signature discovery process. A na?ve, correlation based method is utilized for comparison. Using publicly available infectious disease time series data, we analyzed the related co-expression structure of the transcriptome and proteome in response to SARS-CoV infection in mice. Transcript and peptide expression data was filtered using quality scores and subset by taking the intersection on mapped Entrez IDs. Using this data set, independent co-expression networks were built. The networks were integrated by constructing a bipartite module graph based on module member overlap, module summary correlation, and correlation to phenotypes of interest. Compared to the module level results, the na?ve approach is hindered by a lack of correlation across data types, less significant enrichment results, and little functional overlap across data types. Our module graph approach avoids these problems, resulting in an integrated omic signature of disease progression, which allows prioritization across data types for down-stream experiment planning. Integrated modules exhibited related functional enrichments and could suggest novel interactions in response to infection.

To reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks, the development of a risk index for infectious diseases can be effective, by shifting infectious disease control from emergency response to early detection and prevention. In this study, we introduce a methodology to construct and validate an epidemic risk index using only open data, with a specific focus on scalability. The external validation of our risk index makes use of distance sampling to correct for underreporting of infections, which is often a major source of biases, based on geographical accessibility to health facilities. We apply this methodology to assess the risk of dengue in the Philippines. The results show that the computed dengue risk correlates well with standard epidemiological metrics, i.e. dengue incidence (p = 0.002). Here, dengue risk constitutes of the two dimensions susceptibility and exposure. Susceptibility was particularly associated with dengue incidence (p = 0.047) and dengue case fatality rate (CFR) (p = 0.029). Exposure had lower correlations to dengue incidence (p = 0.211) and CFR (p = 0.163). Highest risk indices were seen in the south of the country, mainly among regions with relatively high susceptibility to dengue outbreaks. Our findings reflect that the modelled epidemic risk index is a strong indication of sub-national dengue disease patterns and has therefore proven suitability for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely epidemiological data. The presented methodology enables the construction of a practical, evidence-based tool to support public health and humanitarian decision-making processes with simple, understandable metrics. The index overcomes the main limitations of existing indices in terms of construction and actionability. Author summary Why Was This Study Done? C Epidemics are among the most costly and destructive natural hazards occurring globally; currently, the response to epidemics is still focused on reaction rather than prevention or preparedness. C The development of an epidemic risk index can support identifying high-risk areas and can guide prioritization of preventive action and humanitarian response. C While several frameworks for epidemic risk assessment exist, they suffer from several limitations, which resulted in limited uptake by local health actors - such as governments and humanitarian relief workers - in their decision-making processes What Did the Researchers Do and Find? C In this study, we present a methodology to develop epidemic risk indices, which overcomes the major limitations of previous work: strict data requirements, insufficient geographical granularity, validation against epidemiological data. C We take as a case study dengue in the Philippines and develop an epidemic risk index; we correct dengue incidence for underreporting based on accessibility to healthcare and show that it correlates well with the risk index (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.69, p-value 0.002). What Do These Findings Mean? C Our methodology enables the development of disease-specific epidemic risk indices at a sub-national level, even in countries with limited data availability; these indices can guide local actors in programming prevention and response activities. C Our findings on the case study show that the epidemic risk index is a strong indicator of sub-national dengue disease patterns and is therefore suitable for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely and complete epidemiological data.","output":"Constructing and validating a transferable epidemic risk index in data scarce environments using open data: a case study for dengue in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A total of 482 veal cutlet, 555 ground veal, and 540 ground beef samples were purchased from retail establishments in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. over a non-contiguous, two-year period between 2014 and 2017. Samples (325 g each) were individually enriched and screened via real-time PCR for all seven regulated serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). Presumptive STEC positive samples were subjected to serogroup-specific immunomagnetic separation and plated onto selective media. Up to five isolates typical for STEC from each sample were analyzed via multiplex PCR for both the virulence genes (i.e., eae , stx 1 and/or stx 2 , and ehxA ) and serogroup-specific gene(s) for the seven regulated STEC serogroups. The recovery rates of non-O157 STEC from veal cutlets (3.94%, 19 of 482 samples) and ground veal (7.03%, 39 of 555 samples) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that from ground beef (0.93%, 5 of 540 samples). In contrast, only a single isolate of STEC O157:H7 was recovered; this isolate originated from one (0.18%) of 555 samples of ground veal.

Since U.S. COVID-19 vaccination coverage is increasing, we investigate the role of vaccination in controlling future COVID-19 outbreaks. METHODS: We developed a stochastic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a theoretical 100-bed NH with a staff of 99 healthcare personnel (HCP) in a community of 20,000 people. We modeled admission and discharge of residents (parameterized with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data), assuming the following: temporary replacement of HCP when tested positive; daily visits to NH residents; isolation of COVID-19 positive residents; personal protective equipment (PPE) use by HCP; and symptom-based testing of residents and staff plus weekly asymptomatic testing of HCP and facility-wide outbreak testing once a COVID-19 case is identified. We systematically varied coverage of an mRNA vaccine among residents and HCP, and in the community. Simulations also varied PPE adherence, defined as the percentage of time in the facility that HCP properly used recommended PPE (25%, 50% or 75% of the time). Infection was initialized in the community with 40 infectious cases, and initial infection in the NH was allowed after 14 days of vaccine dose 1. Simulations were run for 6 months after dose 2 in the NH. Results were summarized over 1000 simulations. RESULTS: At 60% community coverage, expected cumulative symptomatic resident cases over 6 months were 5, due to low importation of COVID-19 infection from the community, with further reduction at higher coverage among HCP (Figure 1). Uncertainty bounds narrowed as NH resident coverage or PPE adherence increased. Results were similar if testing of staff and residents stopped. Probability of an outbreak within 4 weeks of dose 2 remained below 5% with high community coverage (Figure 2). Figure 1. Drop in symptomatic cases in nursing home (NH) residents with rise in COVID-19 vaccine coverage in the community, increase in personal protective equipment (PPE) adherence, or increase in coverage among NH residents. [Image: see text] In each panel, we plotted the mean number of cumulative symptomatic cases of COVID-19 in NH residents after 6 months since vaccine dose 2 (given 28 days after dose 1) and their 90% confidence interval (CI) for three healthcare personnel (HCP) coverage scenarios: 40%, 60%, or 80%. Coverage in HCP was independently modeled of community coverage. The top row is for NH resident coverage of 65%, the middle for 75%, and the bottom row for 85%. The columns (left to right) are for facility-level PPE adherence of 25% (low adherence), 50% (intermediate adherence), and 75% (high adherence). Weekly asymptomatic testing of HCP and twice-weekly outbreak testing in the facility were modeled with an assumed point-of-care test sensitivity of 80% (symptomatic persons) and 60% (asymptomatic persons) and with specificity of 100% and test turnaround time of 15 minutes. Figure 2. Probability of a COVID-19 outbreak in a nursing home (NH) decreased with increase in vaccine coverage in the community or in healthcare personnel (HCP). [Image: see text] An outbreak is defined as an occurrence of 2 or more cases within 4 weeks of dose 2. Probability of no outbreak was calculated by counting how many simulations out of a total of 1000 simulations had 1 symptomatic case in NH residents or HCP within 4 weeks after dose 2 was administered in the nursing home. The first vaccine dose in residents and HCP was assumed to be given on day 1, and the second dose 28 days later. A probability value and its 90%-confidence interval (CI) at a given community and HCP coverage was calculated by pooling model outputs for 9 sets (3 PPE adherence values X 3 resident coverage levels) of model simulations. Simulations were performed assuming no asymptomatic testing or facility-wide outbreak testing. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that increasing community vaccination coverage leads to fewer infections in NH residents. Testing asymptomatic residents and staff may have limited value when vaccination coverage is high. High adherence to recommended PPE may increase the likelihood that future COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained. DISCLOSURES: John A. Jernigan, MD, MS, Nothing to disclose","output":"433.

This study aims to examine whether complication and FTR are different across low- and high-mortality hospitals for trauma care. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study performed at trauma care hospitals registered at Japan Trauma Data Bank (JTDB) from 2004 to 2017. Trauma patients aged  15 years with injury severity score (ISS) of  3 and those who survived for > 48 h after hospital admission were included. The hospitals in JTDB were categorized into three groups by standardized mortality rate. We compared trauma complications, FTR, and in-hospital mortality by a standardized mortality rate (divided by the institute-level quartile). RESULTS: Among 184,214 patients that were enrolled, the rate of any complication was 12.7%. The overall mortality rate was 3.7%, and the mortality rate among trauma patients without complications was only 2.8% (non-precedented deaths). However, the mortality rate among trauma patients with any complications was 10.2% (FTR). Hospitals were categorized into high- (40 facilities with 44,773 patients), average- (72 facilities with 102,368 patients), and low- (39 facilities with 37,073 patients) mortality hospitals, using the hospital ranking of a standardized mortality rate. High-mortality hospitals showed lower ISS than low-mortality hospitals [10 (IQR, 9C18) vs. 11 (IQR, 9C20), P < 0.01]. Patients in high-mortality hospitals showed more complications (14.2% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.01), in-hospital mortality (5.1% vs. 2.5%, P < 0.01), FTR (13.6% vs. 7.4%, P < 0.01), and non-precedented deaths (3.6% vs. 1.9%, P < 0.01) than those in low-mortality hospitals.

RESULTS: There was a decrease of 93.86% in indoor admissions of urology patients during the COVID-19 lockdown. Indoor admissions for stone disease, haematuria, malignancy accounted for 53.65%, 15.85%, 9.75%, respectively. Elective surgeries had the highest percentage decrease followed by emergency and semi-emergency procedures. There was a reduction of more than 80% in patients attending outpatient clinics. Stone disease and its consequences were the main reasons for visiting outdoor clinics (39%). A substantial number of patients presented with flank and abdominal pain (14.8%) and benign enlargement of the prostate (10.23%).

For the first time, to best of our knowledge, we report on the predominance of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii in COVID-19 non-survival diabetic patients The two species were significantly associated to COVID-19 case fatality rates (p-value = 0.02186). Coinfection rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii in non-survivors were 93% and 73%, respectively. Based on standard definitions for antimicrobial resistance, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii were classified as multidrug resistant and extremely drug resistant, respectively. All patients died at ICU with similar clinical characterisitics. Of the 28 major coinfections, 24 (85.7%) were in non-survivor diabetic patients, implying aggravating and worsening the course of COVID-19. The rates of other comorbidities varied: asthma (47%), hypertension (79.4%), ischemic heart disease (71%), chronic kidney disease (35%), and chronic liver disease (32%); however, the rates were higher in K. pneumoniae and were all concomitantly associated to diabetes.

METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed a case series of COVID\\\\19Cpositive/suspected patients admitted between February 1, 2020, and April 4, 2020, who were treated with azithromycin, hydroxychloroquine, or a combination of both drugs. We evaluated baseline and postmedication QT interval (corrected QT interval [QTc]; Bazett) using 12\\\\lead ECGs. Critical QTc prolongation was defined as follows: (1) maximum QTc 500 ms (if QRS <120 ms) or QTc 550 ms (if QRS 120 ms) and (2) QTc increase of 60 ms. Tisdale score and Elixhauser comorbidity index were calculated. Of 490 COVID\\\\19Cpositive/suspected patients, 314 (64%) received either/both drugs and 98 (73 COVID\\\\19 positive and 25 suspected) met study criteria (age, 6217 years; 61% men). Azithromycin was prescribed in 28%, hydroxychloroquine in 10%, and both in 62%. Baseline mean QTc was 44829 ms and increased to 45936 ms (P=0.005) with medications. Significant prolongation was observed only in men (1843 ms versus ?0.228 ms in women; P=0.02). A total of 12% of patients reached critical QTc prolongation. Changes in QTc were highest with the combination compared with either drug, with much greater prolongation with combination versus azithromycin (1739 ms versus 0.540 ms; P=0.07).

METHODS The data on 8,958 twin pairs (3,108 MZ twin pairs and 5,850 DZ twin pairs) from the Twins Early Development Study were analysed. CU traits were assessed at ages 7, 9, 12 and 16 by mothers and analysed using a biometric latent growth model. RESULTS Individual differences in the baseline level of CU traits were highly heritable (76.5%), while the heritability of the developmental course of CU traits was moderate (43.6%). The genetic influences on baseline level and developmental course of CU traits were mostly nonoverlapping. Nonshared environment made a modest contribution to the baseline level of CU traits (21.7%). Nonshared environmental influences on the developmental course of CU traits were moderate (43.2%), with nearly half of them being the same as those influencing the baseline level and just over half being specific. Shared environmental effects did not contribute to systematic change across childhood and adolescence but were rather age-specific. CONCLUSIONS Our findings demonstrate that rather than only being conceptualized as factors of stability, genes also play a dynamic role in explaining systematic change in CU traits. Genetic effects for the initial risk and subsequent development of CU traits are not the same. In addition to genetic factors, nonshared environmental influences play an important role in explaining why some children will increase or maintain their CU traits over time, whereas other will desist. New genetic and environmental influences with age suggest that repeated, age-tailored interventions may be required throughout development to make a lasting difference in the presentation of CU traits and associated outcomes.","output":"Genetic and environmental influences on the developmental trajectory of callous-unemotional traits from childhood to adolescence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Adolescent obesity is a public health problem in the UK. The Weight-Specific Adolescent Instrument for Economic Evaluation (WAItE) has been developed as the first weight-specific health-related quality of life measure appropriate for economic evaluation, but currently cannot be used to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which are the basis of cost-utility analysis.

An online survey was conducted among 2,992 adults in China from February 1st 2020 to February 10th 2020. The study uses binary logistic regression to analyze the potential factors associated with PTSD, depression, and insomnia. The results indicate that the prevalence of PTSS, depression, and insomnia are 19.5, 26.9, and 19.6% respectively during the COVID-19. Men and women show different rates of PTSS and depression, whereas no insomnia is found in both males and females.

Understanding the effectiveness of the various strategies used for POR is, therefore, of vital importance to countries certified as malaria-free or to the countries to be thus certified in the near future. This review is based on extensive review of literature on both the POR strategies and elimination schemes of countries, (i) that have reached malaria-free status (e.g. Armenia, Mauritius, Sri Lanka), (ii) those that are reaching pre-elimination stage (e.g. South Korea), and (iii) countries at the control phase (e.g. India). History has clearly shown that poorly implemented POR programmes can result in deadly consequences (e.g. Sri Lanka); conversely, there are examples of robust POR programmes that have sustained malaria free status that can serve as examples to countries working toward elimination. Countries awaiting malaria elimination status should pre-plan their POR strategies. Malaria-free countries face the risk of resurgence mostly due to imported malaria cases; thus, a robust passenger screening programme and cross border collaborations are crucial in a POR setting. In addition, sustained vigilance, and continued funding for the national anti-malarial campaign programme and for related research is of vital importance for POR. With distinct intrinsic potential for malaria in each country, tailor-made POR programmes are built through continuous and robust epidemiological and entomological surveillance, particularly in countries such as Sri Lanka with increased receptivity and vulnerability for malaria transmission.

During this period, the US COVID-19 response was highly decentralised, with stay-at-home directives issued by state and local officials, subject to varying levels of enforcement. The absence of a centralised policy and timeline combined with the complex dynamics of human mobility and the variable intensity of local outbreaks makes assessing the effect of large-scale social distancing on COVID-19 transmission in the USA a challenge. METHODS: We used daily mobility data derived from aggregated and anonymised cell (mobile) phone data, provided by Teralytics (Zrich, Switzerland) from Jan 1 to April 20, 2020, to capture real-time trends in movement patterns for each US county, and used these data to generate a social distancing metric. We used epidemiological data to compute the COVID-19 growth rate ratio for a given county on a given day. Using these metrics, we evaluated how social distancing, measured by the relative change in mobility, affected the rate of new infections in the 25 counties in the USA with the highest number of confirmed cases on April 16, 2020, by fitting a statistical model for each county. FINDINGS: Our analysis revealed that mobility patterns are strongly correlated with decreased COVID-19 case growth rates for the most affected counties in the USA, with Pearson correlation coefficients above 07 for 20 of the 25 counties evaluated. Additionally, the effect of changes in mobility patterns, which dropped by 35-63% relative to the normal conditions, on COVID-19 transmission are not likely to be perceptible for 9-12 days, and potentially up to 3 weeks, which is consistent with the incubation time of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 plus additional time for reporting. We also show evidence that behavioural changes were already underway in many US counties days to weeks before state-level or local-level stay-at-home policies were implemented, implying that individuals anticipated public health directives where social distancing was adopted, despite a mixed political message. INTERPRETATION: This study strongly supports a role of social distancing as an effective way to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in the USA. Until a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, social distancing will remain one of the primary measures to combat disease spread, and these findings should serve to support more timely policy making around social distancing in the USA in the future.

Growing anecdotal evidence suggests increasing incidence of cases of anosmia during the current pandemic, suggesting that COVID-19 may cause olfactory dysfunction. The objective was to characterise patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic METHODOLOGY: Design: Survey of 2428 patients reporting new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING Volunteer sample of patients seeking medical advice of recent onset self-diagnosed loss of sense of smell RESULTS: 2428 surveys were completed within 7 days; 64% respondents were under 40. The majority of respondents reported onset of their anosmia in the last week. Of the cohort, 17% did not report any other symptom thought to be associated with COVID-19. In patients who reported other symptoms, 51% reported either cough or fever and therefore met current guidelines for self-isolation. CONCLUSIONS Anosmia is reported in conjunction with well-reported symptoms of coronas virus, but 1 in 6 patients with recent onset anosmia report this as an isolated symptom. This might help identify otherwise asymptomatic carriers of disease and trigger targeted testing. Further study with COVID-19 testing is required to identify the proportion of patients in whom new onset anosmia can be attributed to COVID-19.","output":"Presentation of new onset anosmia during the COVID-19 pandemic."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 antibody tests have imperfect accuracy. There has been lack of clarity on the meaning of reported rates of false positives and false negatives. For risk assessment and clinical decision making, the rates of interest are the positive and negative predictive values of a test. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the chance that a person who tests positive has been infected. Negative predictive value (NPV) is the chance that someone who tests negative has not been infected. The medical literature regularly reports different statistics, sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the chance that an infected person receives a positive test result. Specificity is the chance that a non-infected person receives a negative result. Knowledge of sensitivity and specificity permits one to predict the test result given a person's true infection status. These predictions are not directly relevant to risk assessment or clinical decisions, where one knows a test result and wants to predict whether a person has been infected. Given estimates of sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV can be derived if one knows the prevalence of the disease, the rate of illness in the population. There is considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of COVID-19. This paper addresses the problem of inference on the PPV and NPV of COVID-19 antibody tests given estimates of sensitivity and specificity and credible bounds on prevalence.

DESIGN: We will carry out a two-week, individually randomized, parallel group, controlled trial. Participants will be individually randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention or control App intervention. METHODS: The PsyCovidApp intervention will include five modules: emotional skills, lifestyle behaviour, work stress and burnout, social support, and practical tools. Healthcare workers having attended patients with COVID-19 will be randomized to receive the PsyCovidApp intervention (intervention group) or a control App intervention (control group). A total of 440 healthcare workers will be necessary to assure statistical power. Measures will be collected telephonically by a team of psychologists at baseline and immediately after the 2 weeks intervention period. Measures will include stress, depression and anxiety (DASS-21 questionnaire-primary endpoint), insomnia (ISI), burnout (MBI-HSS), post-traumatic stress disorder (DTS), and self-efficacy (GSE). The study was funded in May 2020, and was ethically approved in June 2020. Trial participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be blinded to group allocation. DISCUSSION: Despite the increasing use of mobile health interventions to deliver mental health care, this area of research is still on its infancy. This study will help increase the scientific evidence about the effectiveness of this type of intervention on this specific population and context. IMPACT: Despite the lack of solid evidence about their effectiveness, mobile-based health interventions are already being widely implemented because of their low cost and high scalability. The findings from this study will help health services and organizations to make informed decisions in relation to the development and implementation of this type of interventions, allowing them pondering not only their attractive implementability features, but also empirical data about its benefits.

PURPOSE: To determine the difference in sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva and estimate the incremental cost per additional SARS-CoV-2 infection detected with nasopharyngeal swabs. DATA SOURCES: Embase, Medline, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched from 1 January to 1 November 2020. Cost inputs were from nationally representative sources in Canada and were converted to 2020 U.S. dollars. STUDY SELECTION: Studies including at least 5 paired nasopharyngeal swab and saliva samples and reporting diagnostic accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 detection. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted using standardized forms, and study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven studies with 7332 paired samples were included. Against a reference standard of a positive result on either sample, the sensitivity of saliva was 3.4 percentage points lower (95% CI, 9.9 percentage points lower to 3.1 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons with previously confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, saliva's sensitivity was 1.5 percentage points higher (CI, 7.3 percentage points lower to 10.3 percentage points higher) than that of nasopharyngeal swabs. Among persons without a previous SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, saliva was 7.9 percentage points less (CI, 14.7 percentage points less to 0.8 percentage point more) sensitive. In this subgroup, if testing 100 000 persons with a SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 1%, nasopharyngeal swabs would detect 79 more (95% uncertainty interval, 5 fewer to 166 more) persons with SARS-CoV-2 than saliva, but with an incremental cost per additional infection detected of $8093. LIMITATION: The reference standard was imperfect, and saliva collection procedures varied. CONCLUSION: Saliva sampling seems to be a similarly sensitive and less costly alternative that could replace nasopharyngeal swabs for collection of clinical samples for SARS-CoV-2 testing.

Thus far, a spectrum of disease severity has been observed ranging from asymptomatic to severe;most commonly increased pain and acute chest syndrome (ACS) are observed. Hyperhemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a rare but highly fatal condition characterized by hemolysis of donor and patient red blood cells (RBCs) post-transfusion. We present a case of COVID-19 infection in a patient with SCD complicated by HHS, ACS and multi-organ system failure. Case: A 39-year-old female with hemoglobin (Hb) SS disease, post-capillary pulmonary hypertension (PH), recurrent venous thromboembolism on apixaban, and chronic kidney disease, presented with epistaxis, vaginal bleeding, and progressive dyspnea. Laboratory findings included a white blood cell count 13.6 K/mL, Hb 2.4 g/dL (baseline 7 g/dL), platelet count 215 K/mL, bilirubin 4.8 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase 1485 U/L, blood urea nitrogen 70 mg/dL and creatinine 4.06 mg/dL (baseline 0.9 mg/dL). Anti-coagulation was held and she was transfused 8 units of packed RBCs without an appropriate response despite cessation of hemorrhage. Labs revealed a rising ferritin (peak 1912 ng/mL), bilirubin (peak 11.2 mg/dL) and LDH (peak 2202 U/L). Serial hemoglobin electrophoreses demonstrated a stable HbA/HbS ratio, direct antiglobulin and alloantibody tests were negative, supporting the diagnosis of HHS. On hospital day (HD) 2, SAR-CoV-2 PCR resulted positive. Over 6 days, she developed worsening acute on chronic renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, progressive acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and severe ACS with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography (Figure 1). After intubation on HD 8 due to worsening hypoxemia, she sustained a cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity and was unable to be resuscitated.Discussion: This is the first known case of COVID-19 infection in a patient with SCD presenting with hemorrhage, HHS, severe ACS and multi-organ system failure. While the hypercoagulability of SCD and severe COVID- 19 infections are well known, presentation with hemorrhage is unusual. HHS can occur from multiple transfusions, but also can be triggered by infections. ACS, renal failure, and PH may be risk factors for mortality in SCD patients infected with COVID-19.

Given the consequences of these policies, it is important to assess their effects. We evaluate the effects on epidemic case growth of more restrictive NPIs (mrNPIs), above and beyond those of less\\\\restrictive NPIs (lrNPIs). METHODS: We first estimate COVID\\\\19 case growth in relation to any NPI implementation in subnational regions of 10 countries: England, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, South Korea, Sweden and the United States. Using first\\\\difference models with fixed effects, we isolate the effects of mrNPIs by subtracting the combined effects of lrNPIs and epidemic dynamics from all NPIs. We use case growth in Sweden and South Korea, 2 countries that did not implement mandatory stay\\\\at\\\\home and business closures, as comparison countries for the other 8 countries (16 total comparisons). RESULTS: Implementing any NPIs was associated with significant reductions in case growth in 9 out of 10 study countries, including South Korea and Sweden that implemented only lrNPIs (Spain had a nonsignificant effect). After subtracting the epidemic and lrNPI effects, we find no clear, significant beneficial effect of mrNPIs on case growth in any country. In France, for example, the effect of mrNPIs was +7% (95% CI: ?5%\\\\19%) when compared with Sweden and + 13% (?12%\\\\38%) when compared with South Korea (positive means pro\\\\contagion). The 95% confidence intervals excluded 30% declines in all 16 comparisons and 15% declines in 11/16 comparisons.

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, using data collected via an online self-reported questionnaire, from 3,388 participants. To assess the differences in mean scores, and identify factors associated with knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19, the data were run through univariate and multivariable regression analyses, respectively. Results: The majority of the study participants were knowledgeable about COVID-19. The mean COVID-19 knowledge score was 17.96 (SD = 2.24, range: 3C22), indicating a high level of knowledge.

Bacterial contamination (BC) of platelet components (PCs) can lead to transfusion-transmitted bacterial infections (TTBI), central line-associated bloodstream infections, and sepsis, with long-term complications and/or death. In the US, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients require transfusion support until engraftment and together with hematology/oncology (hemonc.) patients receive the highest number of PCs/patient. FDA's Guidance recommends approaches to reduce BC risk including the use of enhanced bacterial culture screening (EBSC) or pathogen reduction (PR) of platelets. Methods: The Miami Cancer Institute (MCI) implemented PR-PCs for all allogeneic HSCT patients. Irradiation, CMV testing, and bacterial screening have been discontinued for PR-PCs. Transfusion outcomes are being monitored using active hemovigilance (HV) reporting. Results: Considering the fatality risk associated with BC of PCs (1:200,000 -1:1,000,000) despite the use of optimal skin cleansing, initial sample diversion, and primary bacterial culture, 1/2,880 PCs are still contaminated (Bloch et al.);further steps towards BC mitigation are needed. As the UK and US reported a residual BC risk of 5.4-9.4/million PCs after implementation of EBSC, PR may represent an alternative approach with other cumulative benefits. Indeed, national HV data from France, Switzerland and Belgium reported no sepsis transfusion reactions since PR implementation (Benjamin et al.). In addition, the risk of TA-GVHD and other TTI including emerging infectious diseases (EID) may be decreased after the inactivation of pathogens and leukocytes (Lanteri et al.). At MCI, the percentage of transfused PR-PCs has been increasing steadily from 7.9% in July 2019 to 22.2% in January 2021. Over a 19 month-period, a total of 9,296 PC were transfused including 1,677 PR-PCs. While non-PR-PCs were all irradiated and bacterially screened, PR-PC were neither irradiated nor bacterially screened. No cases of TA-GVHD or TTI were reported. A total of 27 mild, non-life-threatening platelet transfusion reactions were reported including 22 (81.5%) after non-PR PCs transfusion and 5 (18.5%) after PR-PC transfusion. In addition, the early release of transfusionready fresh PR-PCs 24-48 hours after collection has proven invaluable in providing clinicians and patients with blood continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: Though certain measures have improved blood safety, the risk of TTI associated with PC transfusion remains a concern for vulnerable hemonc. patients.

A significant rearrangement of host cell vimentin around Toxoplasma parasitophorous vacuoles is observed during the course of infection. ROP18 (TgROP18) is a serine-threonine kinase secreted by T. gondii rhoptry and a major virulence factor; however, the mechanisms by which this kinase modulates host factors remain poorly understood. Different and dynamic patterns of vimentin solubility, phosphorylation, and expression levels were observed in host cells infected with T. gondii strain RH and RH rop18 strains, suggesting that TgROP18 contributes to the regulation of these dynamic patterns. Additionally, host cell vimentin was demonstrated to interact with and be phosphorylated by TgROP18. A significant increase in T. gondii infection rate was observed in vimentin knockout human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC), while vimentin knockout or knock down in host cells had no impact on parasite proliferation and egress. These results indicate that host cell vimentin can inhibit T. gondii invasion.

In concert with its metabolizing enzymes, particularly sphingomyelinases, it has key roles in regulating the physical properties of biological membranes, including the formation of membrane microdomains. Thus, ceramide and its related molecules have been attributed significant roles in nearly all steps of the viral life cycle: they may serve directly as receptors or co-receptors for viral entry, form microdomains that cluster entry receptors and/or enable them to adopt the required conformation or regulate their cell surface expression. Sphingolipids can regulate all forms of viral uptake, often through sphingomyelinase activation, and mediate endosomal escape and intracellular trafficking. Ceramide can be key for the formation of viral replication sites. Sphingomyelinases often mediate the release of new virions from infected cells. Moreover, sphingolipids can contribute to viral-induced apoptosis and morbidity in viral diseases, as well as virus immune evasion. Alpha-galactosylceramide, in particular, also plays a significant role in immune modulation in response to viral infections. This review will discuss the roles of ceramide and its related molecules in the different steps of the viral life cycle. We will also discuss how novel strategies could exploit these for therapeutic benefit.","output":"Ceramide and Related Molecules in Viral Infections"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dendritic cells express lectins receptors, like DC-SIGN, which allow these cells to sense glycans that are present on various bacterial and viral pathogens.

Uptake of pathogens by dendritic cells may lead to cross-presentation of antigens or infection of these cells, which ultimately results in activation of virus-specific T cells in draining lymph nodes. Little is known about the interaction of DC-SIGN with influenza A viruses. Here we show that a virus with a non-functional receptor binding site in its hemagglutinin, can replicate in cells expressing DC-SIGN. Also in the absence of sialic acids, which is the receptor for influenza A viruses, these viruses replicate in DC-SIGN expressing cells including human dendritic cells. Furthermore, the efficiency of DC-SIGN mediated infection is dependent on the extent of glycosylation of the viral hemagglutinin.","output":"Binding of DC-SIGN to the Hemagglutinin of Influenza A Viruses Supports Virus Replication in DC-SIGN Expressing Cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: : During the first wave of the pandemic, stroke care suffered globally and there were reduced stroke admissions and delays in time metrics. Stroke care was reorganized during the second wave learning from the experience of previous wave. This study shares our experience in stroke time metrics during the second wave of pandemic compared to the first wave. METHODS: : We did a single-center prospective study, where consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms and aged more than 18 years, who presented to Stroke Unit, Department of Neurology, Government Medical College, Thiruvananthapuram from June 1st to 31st August, 2020 and June 1st to 31st August in 2021 were included. In-hospital time metrics (door to CT time and door to Needle time) were compared during the two time periods. We also compared functional outcomes at discharge and in-hospital mortality during the two periods. Functional outcome at discharge was assessed by modified Rankin scale (mRS). RESULTS: : From June to August 2021 (second wave of the COVID 19 pandemic), compared to the same months during the first wave (2020), our study demonstrated better in-hospital time metrics (door to CT time and door to needle time). We also found lower admission systolic blood pressure and higher baseline CT early ischemic changes during the second wave. There was no difference in functional outcome at discharge and in-hospital mortality. Intravenous thrombolysis rates also remained the same during the two periods. CONCLUSION: : Our study has confirmed that time metrics in stroke care can be improved through system rearrangement even during the pandemic.

In order to identify these areas, the authors prepared an index of vulnerability to severe cases of COVID-19 based on the construction, weighting, and integration of three levels of information: mean number of residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older (both per census tract) and neighborhood tuberculosis incidence rate in the year 2018. The data on residents per household and density of persons 60 years or older were obtained from the 2010 Population Census, and data on tuberculosis incidence were taken from the Brazilian Information System for Notificable Diseases (SINAN). Weighting of the indicators comprising the index used analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the levels of information were integrated via weighted linear combination with map algebra. Spatialization of the index of vulnerability to severe COVID-19 in the city of Rio de Janeiro reveals the existence of more vulnerable areas in different parts of the city's territory, reflecting its urban complexity. The areas with greatest vulnerability are located in the North and West Zones of the city and in poor neighborhoods nested within upper-income parts of the South and West Zones. Understanding these conditions of vulnerability can facilitate the development of strategies to monitor the evolution of COVID-19 and orient measures for prevention and health promotion.","output":"Vulnerabilidade a formas graves de COVID-19: uma anlise intramunicipal na cidade do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil./ Vulnerabilidade a formas graves de COVID-19: uma anlise intramunicipal na cidade do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil./ Vulnerability to severe forms of COVID-19: an intra-municipal analysis in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can affect multiple organ systems with variable severity and is known to frequently have a major impact on the respiratory system.

The fast speed of publication has challenged researchers and other stakeholders to keep up with the volume of published articles. To search the literature effectively, researchers use databases such as PubMed. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of different searches for COVID-19 records in PubMed and to assess the complexity of searches required. METHODS: We tested PubMed searches for COVID-19 to identify which search string performed best according to standard metrics (sensitivity, precision, and F-score). We evaluated the performance of 8 different searches in PubMed during the first 10 weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic to investigate how complex a search string is needed. We also tested omitting hyphens and space characters as well as applying quotation marks. RESULTS: The two most comprehensive search strings combining several free-text and indexed search terms performed best in terms of sensitivity (98.4%/98.7%) and F-score (96.5%/95.7%), but the single-term search COVID-19 performed best in terms of precision (95.3%) and well in terms of sensitivity (94.4%) and F-score (94.8%). The term Wuhan virus performed the worst: 7.7% for sensitivity, 78.1% for precision, and 14.0% for F-score. We found that deleting a hyphen or space character could omit a substantial number of records, especially when searching with SARS-CoV-2 as a single term. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive search strings combining free-text and indexed search terms performed better than single-term searches in PubMed, but not by a large margin compared to the single term COVID-19. For everyday searches, certain single-term searches that are entered correctly are probably sufficient, whereas more comprehensive searches should be used for systematic reviews. Still, we suggest additional measures that the US National Library of Medicine could take to support all PubMed users in searching the COVID-19 literature.","output":"Searching PubMed to Retrieve Publications on the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparative Analysis of Search Strings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Physical activity is known to decline during pregnancy and the postnatal period, yet physical activity is recommended during this time due to the significant health benefits for mothers and their offspring.

Symptoms include neurocognitive impairment and fatigue. Two potential mechanisms could be responsible for these long-term unremitting symptoms: hypercoagulability, which increases the risk of blood vessel occlusion, and an uncontrolled continuous inflammatory response. Currently, no known treatment is available for long COVID. One of the options to reverse hypoxia, reduce neuroinflammation, and induce neuroplasticity is hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In this article, we present the first case report of a previously healthy athletic individual who suffered from long COVID syndrome treated successfully with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 55-year-old Caucasian man presented 3 months after severe coronavirus disease 2019 infection with long COVID syndrome. His symptoms included a decline in memory, multitasking abilities, energy, breathing, and physical fitness. After evaluation that included brain perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, computerized cognitive tests, and cardiopulmonary test, he was treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Each session included exposure to 90 minutes of 100% oxygen at 2 atmosphere absolute pressure with 5-minute air breaks every 20 minutes for 60 sessions, 5 days per week. Evaluation after completing the treatment showed significant improvements in brain perfusion and microstructure by magnetic resonance imaging and significant improvement in memory with the most dominant effect being on nonverbal memory, executive functions, attention, information procession speed, cognitive flexibility, and multitasking. The improved cognitive functions correlated with the increased cerebral blood flow in brain regions as measured by perfusion magnetic resonance imaging. With regard to physical capacity, there was a 34% increase in the maximum rate of oxygen consumed during exercise and a 44% improvement in forced vital capacity. The improved physical measurements correlated with the regain of his pre-COVID physical capacity. CONCLUSIONS: We report the first case of successfully treated long COVID symptoms with hyperbaric oxygen therapy with improvements in cognition and cardiopulmonary function. The beneficial effects of hyperbaric oxygen shed additional light on the pathophysiology of long COVID.

If the face exists in the database indicating that the subject is an established patient, the patients records will be retrieved. Else, a new patient registration will be performed to register a new account. The efficiency of the system is assessed using our self-collected database.

DESIGN Retrospective review of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation data collected from routine clinical care. SETTING Forty-three hospitals contributing coronavirus disease 2019 patient data between March 14, and June 17, 2020, and 132 hospitals in the United States contributing data on viral pneumonia patients to the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation database between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS One thousand four hundred ninety-one patients with diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 infection and 4,200 patients with a primary (n = 2,544) or secondary (n = 1,656) admitting diagnosis of noncoronavirus disease viral pneumonia receiving ICU care. A subset of 202 viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome was examined separately. INTERVENTIONS None. MAIN RESULTS Mean age was 63.4 for coronavirus disease (p = 0.064) versus 64.1 for viral pneumonia. Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV scores were similar at 56.7 and 55.0, respectively (p = 0.060), but gender and ethnic distributions differed, as did PaO2 to FIO2 ratio and WBC count at admission. The hospital standardized mortality ratio (95% CI) was 1.52 (1.35-1.68) for coronavirus disease patients and 0.82 (0.75-0.90) for viral pneumonia patients. In the coronavirus disease group, ICU and hospital length of stay were 3.1 and 3.0 days longer than in viral pneumonia patients. Standardized ICU and hospital length of stay ratios were 1.13 and 1.46 in the coronavirus disease group versus 0.95 and 0.94 in viral pneumonia patients. Forty-seven percent of coronavirus disease patients received invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support on their first ICU day versus 65% with viral pneumonia. Ventilator days in survivors were longer in coronavirus disease (10.4 d) than in viral pneumonia (4.3 d) patients, except in the viral pneumonia-acute respiratory distress syndrome subgroup (10.2 d) CONCLUSIONS:: Severity-adjusted mortality and length of stay are higher for coronavirus disease 2019 patients than for viral pneumonia patients admitted to ICU. Coronavirus disease patients also have longer time on ventilator and ICU length of stay, comparable with the subset of viral pneumonia patients with concurrent acute respiratory distress syndrome.

However, the pandemic has triggered a massive uncertainty in several dimensions, leading to disruptive economic and social changes that could affect trends in fertility rates in more than 170 countries. Given that the pandemic could have significant consequences for the future population, this paper proposes some approximations on future scenarios in fertility trends.Methods: Based on a VAR model, we exploit the variations in total fertility rates and changes in real GDP observed in recent years, as well as the economic growth projections by the Monetary Fund International.Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic will accelerate declining fertility trends in several high- and middle-income countries, perhaps to unprecedented levels, thus uncovering major failures in motherhood policies and institutions. In low-income countries, the effects of the pandemic would be less. Total fertility rates in the world could be below the replacement level of 2.1 by 2040. Portugal, Spain, Greece, Finland, Italy, Ireland, and the United States could even have total fertility rates below 1. The possible patterns of fertility convergence observed in recent years could also be significantly altered.Interpretation: Unlike other lethal plagues in history, in which high mortality rates determined subsequent birth behaviors, we suggest that uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 would play a central role in explaining future fertility patterns, as the economic and social consequences of the pandemic extend for several years.

However, most patients eventually relapse despite the initial high response rate to chemotherapy. Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is a well-known biomarker that reflects severe inflammation, critical illness, and mortality in various diseases. Chemotherapy response score (CRS) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) have been identified as potential biomarkers of platinum resistance and disease prognosis. We retrospectively evaluated 132 patients with stage IIIc or IV ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer who had received NACT followed by IDS from 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2018. CRS was assessed on omental specimens collected from IDS according to ICCR guidelines. RESULTS: Median age was 64.57 years (SD: 9.72; range 39.2-87.1). Most ovarian tumors were serous epithelial (90.9%; 120/132). An elevated NLR (defined as > 3) was observed in 72% (95/132) of patients in contrast with 28% (37/132) of patients characterized by low NLR status. Median PFS (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) were 13.05 months (95% CI: 11.42-14.67)) and 34.69 months (95% CI: 23.26-46.12) respectively. In univariate analysis, CRS3 score was significantly associated with prolonged mPFS (CRS1/2: 12.79 months vs CRS3: 17.7 months; P = 0.008). CRS score was not associated with mOS (P = 0.876). High NLR was not significantly associated with mPFS (P = 0.128), however it was significantly associated with poor mOS (P = 0.012). In multivariate analysis, only performance of surgery maintained its statistical significance with both PFS (P = 0.001) and OS (P = 0.008).

We hypothesized that early administration of tissue-plasminogen activator(tPA) followed by therapeutic heparin would improve pulmonary function in these patients.Methods: Adults with COVID-19-induced respiratory failure were randomized May14, 2020-March 3, 2021 in two phases: Phase-1(n=36): control (standard-of-care) vs tPA-Bolus (50mg tPA IV-bolus followed by 7 days of heparin (goal aPTT=60-80s);Phase-2(n=14): control vs tPA-Drip (50 mg of tPA IV-bolus, followed by tPA drip 2mg/hr plus heparin 500U/hour over 24 hours, then heparin to maintain aPTT 60-80s/7 days). The primary outcome was PaO2/FiO2 improvement at 48 hours post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included: PaO2/FiO2 improvement>50% or PaO2/FiO2>=200 at 48hrs(COMPOSITE), ventilator-free days(VFD) and mortality.Findings: Fifty patients were randomized: Phase 1:17 control, 19 tPA-Bolus;Phase 2: 8 control, 6 tPA-Drip. There were no severe bleeding events in intervention groups. In tPA-Bolus patients, PaO2/FiO2 was significantly(p<0.017) higher than baseline at 6 through 168 hours post-randomization;controls experienced no significant improvements. Compared to controls, tPA-Bolus patients showed larger, but non-significant, improvements in PaO2/FiO2 at 48hours[16.9%(-8.3C36.8) vs 29.8%(4.5C88.7),p=0.11], resulting in more patients reaching the COMPOSITE outcome (11.8% vs 47.4%,p=0.03).

This single-network, multi-hospital study examines PaoP in a retrospective COVID-19 cohort, including patient characteristics and overall incidence. In addition, risk factor determination is conducted using case-matched COVID-19 controls, hypothesizing that the need for mechanical ventilation and pulmonary comorbidities are associated with PaoP. METHODS: This is an IRB-exempt, retrospective case-control study involving patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction and admitted to the hospital network 03/01/2020-11/30/2020. A total of 25 patients who developed PaoP were matched to COVID-19 patients without PaoP in 1:4 ratio according to age, gender and APACHE 2 score. Detailed chart review included patient demographics, BRIXIA, MuLBSTA, supplemental oxygen use, mechanical ventilation, inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, IL-6), pulmonary comorbidities (asthma, COPD, OSA, tobacco use), nonpulmonary comorbidities (diabetes, morbid obesity, malignancy, cardiovascular and renal diseases), and hospitalization characteristics (hospital length of stay or HLOS, ICU admission). Univariate results (Table 1) with significance level of P&lt;0.20 were included in subsequent binary logistic regression to determine factors independently associated with PaoP.RESULTS: A total of 125 patients were evaluated (25 PaoP cases and 100 matched controls). Group characteristics included median age of 72 years [IQR 58-80];84% male sex;56% Caucasian;Median APACHE II 15.6 [6.8-41.0]. There were no significant differences in terms of CRP, ferritin, or IL-6 between the two groups. Patients with PaoP underwent chest tube placement in 76% cases and had significantly higher mortality (68% vs. 43%, p&lt;0.025). In our multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with PaoP included longer hospitalization (OR 1.047, 95%CI 1.001-1.096) and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.271, 95%CI 1.066-10.035). CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that longer HLOS and the requirement for mechanical ventilation are independently associated with PaoP. However, our data do not support the hypothesis that pulmonary comorbidities (asthma, COPD, OSA, tobacco use) are significantly associated with PaoP. This, combined with the finding that the level of PEEP did not appear to be a significant risk factor for PaoP, highlights the need for better understanding of the underlying pulmonary pathology. The current series is among the largest studies of this important phenomenon in COVID-19 patients, and provides important insight into our understanding of this rare but prognostically important complication.","output":"Pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in patients with COVID-19 infection: A case-control study of risk factors and patient characteristics"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"IntroductionDue to COVID-19 all acute paediatric services and staff were relocated from UCLH Despite redirection pathways, children continued to present to the Emergency Department (ED) A learning needs analysis identified a requirement to rapidly upskill the ED nursing and medical team As a result, paediatric ED fellows and nurse educators designed an adaptable and rapidly deliverable simulation training model to meet a range of training needs Secondary objectives of this project were to identify any latent safety threats relating to paediatric patients MethodsWe designed four low-fidelity, in-situ scenarios Learning objectives were the initial management of an unwell child and familiarising staff with equipment and the environment Sessions were restricted to a maximum of six participants to enable social distancing Short 30 minute sessions were scheduled after morning handover to encourage participation and minimise disruption to the working environment Participants completed a post-session feedback questionnaire Results78 participants (26 medical, 52 nursing) attended at least one of 16 simulations over a 4 week period Participants appreciated learning in small multi-disciplinary (MDT) groups in a non-judgemental environment 99% reported that this was a supportive learning environment As faculty were familiar with participants, the scenarios were adapted to meet individual learning needs depending on the mix of participants at each session Faculty noted that the low-fidelity simulations reduced distractions and focused attention on key objectives Sessions were easy to plan and set-up, enabling delivery of multiple simulations in a short timeframe Environmental threats were identified and addressed in a timely manner DiscussionED staff were intrinsically motivated to participate in this programme as they identified a gap in knowledge and skills By maintaining small groups we created a safe learning space, encouraging participant engagement without the fear of performing in front of an audience Gaining early buy-in from nursing and medical leads and holding short, regular sessions enabled the programme to become embedded in the departments culture, thus encouraging participation By designing simple scenarios with focused learning objectives, we were able to ensure a consistent standard of delivery whilst adapting sessions to meet individual learning needs Faculty noted the importance of role-modelling a good multi-disciplinary working relationship for the participants This approach has established an MDT training culture of the department and helped foster positive relationships between staff members This simulation model enabled us to train large numbers of staff over a short period of time under challenging and novel conditions","output":"PG28 Just in time: developing a micro-simulation training programme"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Maternal stress has debilitating implications for both mother and child, including increased risk for anxiety. The current COVID-19 pandemic escalates these phenomena, thus, urging the need to further explore and validate feasible therapeutic options. Unlike the protracted nature of clinical studies, animal models could offer swift evidence. Prominent candidates for treatment are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) to the mother, that putatively accommodate maternal functioning, and, thereby, also protect the child. However, SSRIs might have deleterious effects. It is important to assess whether SSRIs and other pharmacotherapies can moderate the transference of anxiety by soothing maternal anxiety and to examine the extent of offspring's exposure to the drugs via lactation. To our knowledge, the possibility that antenatal stress exacerbates lactation-driven exposure to SSRIs has not been tested yet. Thirty ICR-outbred female mice were exposed to stress during gestation and subsequently administered with either the SSRI, escitalopram, or the novel herbal candidate, shan-zha, during lactation. Upon weaning, both dams' and pups' anxiety-like behavior and serum escitalopram levels were assessed. The major findings of the current study show that both agents moderated the antenatal stress-induced transgenerational transference of anxiety by ameliorating dams' anxiety. Interestingly though, pups' exposure to escitalopram via lactation was exacerbated by antenatal stress. The latter finding provides a significant insight into the mechanism of lactation-driven exposure to xenobiotics and calls for a further consideration vis--vis the administration of other drugs during breastfeeding.","output":"Moderation of the transgenerational transference of antenatal stress-induced anxiety"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives To assess performance of different swab types and specimen collection sites for SARS-CoV-2 testing, compared to reference standard RT-PCR and viral culture. Methods Symptomatic adults attending routine COVID-19 testing sites self-collected anterior nares and tongue specimens, using spun polyester and FLOQSwabs. We evaluated the anterior nares and tongue swabs by RT-PCR, nucleocapsid (N), or spike (S) antigen of SARS-CoV-2, compared to RT-PCR and viral culture from nurse-collected nasopharyngeal swabs. Results Diagnostic sensitivity was highest for RT-PCR testing by anterior nares FLOQSwabs (84%; 95% CI 68-94%) and spun polyester swabs (82%; 95% CI 66-92%), relative to RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swabs. Relative to viral culture from nasopharyngeal swabs, diagnostic sensitivities were higher for RT-PCR and antigen testing of anterior nares swabs (91-100%) than of tongue swabs (18-81%). Antigen testing of anterior nares swabs had higher sensitivities against viral culture (91%), than against nasopharyngeal RT-PCR (38-70%). All investigational tests had high specificity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR. Spun polyester swabs performed as well as FLOQswabs for anterior nasal RT-PCR testing.

The incidence of COVID-19 has also been higher in males compared with their female counterparts. This trend could be attributed to a better responsive and robust immune system in females. Cytokine storm is one of the pathophysiological features of severe COVID-19, and it occurs as a result of over-activation of immune cells leading to severe inflammation and tissue damage. Nevertheless, it is well modulated in females compared to their male counterparts. Severe inflammation in males is reported to facilitate progression of mild to severe COVID-19. The sex hormones, estrogens and androgens which exist in varying functional levels respectively in females and males are cited as the underlying cause for the differential immune response to COVID-19. Evidence abounds that estrogen modulate the immune system to protect females from severe inflammation and for that matter severe COVID-19. On the contrary, androgen has been implicated in over-activation of immune cells, cytokine storm and the attendant severe inflammation, which perhaps predispose males to severe COVID-19. In this review efforts are made to expand understanding and explain the possible roles of the immune system, the sex hormones and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) systems in male bias to severe COVID-19. Also, this review explores possible therapeutic avenues including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), estrogen-based therapy, and ACE inhibitors for consideration in the fight against COVID-19.","output":"Male predisposition to severe COVID-19: Review of evidence and potential therapeutic prospects"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vaxign is the first web-based vaccine design system that predicts vaccine targets based on genome sequences using the strategy of reverse vaccinology.

However, less is known about the vaccine efficacy in immune-suppressed individuals. This study sought to explore whether humoral immunity to the COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 is altered in RA patients treated with Janus kinase inhibitors by analysing their antibodies titre, neutralization activity and B cell responses. METHODS: We collected plasma samples from 12 RA patients who were treated with Janus kinase inhibitors and received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine, as well as 26 healthy individuals who were vaccinated with the same vaccine. We analysed the quantity of the anti-spike IgG and IgA antibodies that were elicited following the BNT162b2 vaccination, the plasma neutralization capacity and the responsiveness of the B-lymphocytes. We used ELISA to quantify the antibody titres, and a plasma neutralization assay was used to determine the virus neutralization capacity. Alteration in expression of the genes that are associated with B cell activation and the germinal centre response were analysed by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Reduced levels of anti-spike IgG antibodies and neutralization capacity were seen in the RA patients who were treated with JAK inhibitors in comparison with healthy individuals. Furthermore, B cell responsiveness to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was reduced in the RA patients. CONCLUSION: RA patients who are treated with JAK inhibitors show a suppressed humoral response following BNT162b2 vaccination, as revealed by the quantity and quality of the anti-spike antibodies.","output":"Rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with Janus kinase inhibitors show reduced humoral immune responses following BNT162b2 vaccination"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On 5 July 2014, a suicide terrorist set a crowded bus on fire in Hangzhou, injuring 33 passengers. Among these, 19 adult victims with the most severe burns were triaged to our center. This is a single-center, descriptive study recording the prehospital response and in-hospital treatment of these patients. METHODS: Information on the attack, on-scene rescue, and patient triage was collected from public media, governmental, and hospital reports. Information on patient injury and our in-hospital procedures was collected from the emergency registry and patient records. RESULTS: Of the 80 passengers in the burning bus, 33 were injured. The total burn surface area (TBSA) of the 19 most severely injured patients triaged to our hospital ranged from 25% to 95% (mean 48.3  2.08%). Two patients had a TBSA of >90% (92% and 95%) and eight had a TBSA of >60%. Nineteen cases of inhalation injury were diagnosed, eight of which were severe. The emergency center performed 14 bedside escharotomies, 14 central venous catheter (CVC) implantations, and one cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Approximately 131 000 ml of resuscitation fluid was infused within the first 24 h and 111 000 ml within the second; further, 160 230 ml of plasma and 4100 ml of red blood cells were infused during the antishock stage. All victims were transported to the burn ward to receive burn-centered multidisciplinary care. The respiratory team conducted 121 bronchoscopies. A total of 89 operations were performed, and the residual wound area decreased dramatically. After 124 days of extensive therapy, complete wound healing was observed and all patients entered the rehabilitation stage. CONCLUSION: Adequate preparation, including planning and disaster drills, is crucial for handling mass casualty events. Efficient and precise first rescue and triage can reduce prehospital mortality, and burn-centered multidisciplinary care and hospitalCgovernment cooperation helps reduce in-hospital mortality.

However, curcumin has drawbacks such as low water-solubility, poor absorption, fast metabolism, quick systemic elimination, low bioavailability, poor pharmacokinetics, low stability, and low penetration targeting efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a common method used is encapsulating curcumin in nanocarriers for targeted delivery. However, the degraded products of nanocarriers have raised concerns. In this research, we synthesized nanoparticles of curcumin, nanocurcumin without using nanocarriers. To do so, curcumin was soxhlet extracted from raw turmeric rhizome. The stock solutions of different curcumin concentrations prepared in dichloromethane were added to boiling water at different flow rates and sonicated for different time intervals. An average particle size of 82  04 nm was obtained with 5.00 mg/mL stock solution concentration, at 0.10 mL/min flow rate and 30 min sonication time. The particle size tends to increase with the flow rate and the concentration of curcumin in the stock solution but decreases with the sonication time. X-ray diffraction shows sharp and intense diffraction peaks for curcumin, indicating its identity and high crystallinity, but nanocurcumins are amorphous. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra confirm the presence of all the functional groups of curcumin in nanocurcumin.

Complementary and Alternative Medicines (CAM) are gaining rapid acceptance among individuals. Therefore, the aim was to study the pattern of CAM use for prophylaxis of COVID-19. Methods: A survey was conducted amongst 456 individuals to assess the use of various CAM modalities for the prevention of COVID-19. Respondents who gave consent were assessed by a pre-structured questionnaire. Results: Out of 456 respondents enrolled in the study, the use of CAM was almost equal in both males (49.34%) and Females (50.65%). Homeopathy (30.48%) was the most common type of CAM used, and Ayurveda was used by 22.80% of respondents. Social media was used by 44.51%, and Official govt. Web sites were least used (20.61%). The most common reason for using CAM was to buildup immunity (21.05%) . 92.98% and 91.22% of CAM users have shown improvement in overall well-being, and stress reduction respectively, but results were not statistically significant. Conclusions: High percentage of the participants demonstrated awareness towards most of the CAM modalities. They considered using multiple CAM modalities in the prevention of Covid-19 but consultation with qualified CAM health care professionals should be advocated.","output":"An observational study to assess the role of complementary and alternative medicine in the prophylaxis of covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Within a short period of time, COVID-19 has spread globally, wreaking havoc in various facets of life. This study sought to measure the level of COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the Nigerian public. This was a cross-sectional online survey of the general population of educated Nigerians who had Internet access. Sociodemographic data and participants knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to COVID-19 were collected. Scores assessing knowledge, attitudes, and practices were allocated and graded based on specific stratified demarcations. Students t-test, analysis of variance, and logistic regression analysis were used where appropriate. Of the total 1,015 respondents, most of them exhibited good knowledge of COVID-19, with a mean knowledge grade of 78%; this significantly affected their attitude and practice grades (66% and 60.4%, respectively). Most respondents expressed positive attitudes toward foreigners and other stigma-prone groups, while also practicing appropriate preventive measures. Those aged 21C30 years and those with medical-related occupations had significantly higher knowledge scores (P < 0.001); and having a medical-related occupation increased the likelihood of having good knowledge compared with being unemployed (odds ratio [95% CI]: 6.6 [2.5C17.3]). Male participants aged 21C30 years and those with medical-related occupations had significantly higher attitude scores (P < 0.05).

CCNUW1 isolated from a shaded freshwater pond, which produces Chl f under far-red light, to the genus Kovacikia and named this taxon Kovacikia minuta sp. nov. This strain was morphologically similar to Leptolyngbya-like strains. The thin filaments were purplish brown under white light but became grass green under far-red light. The 31-gene phylogeny grouped K. minuta CCNU0001 into order Synechococcales and family Leptolyngbyaceae. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequences further showed that K. minuta CCNU0001 was clustered into Kovacikia with similarities of 97.2-97.4% to the recently reported type species of K. muscicola HA7619-LM3. Additionally, the internal transcribed spacer region between 16S-23S rRNA genes had a unique sequence and secondary structure compared with other Kovacikia strains and phylogenetically related taxa. Draft genome sequences of K. minuta CCNU0001 (8,564,336 bp) were assembled into one circular chromosome and two circular plasmids.

In this study, we sought to gain insights for vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2 by considering the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, which caused the outbreak in 2003, and leveraging existing immunological studies of SARS-CoV. By screening the experimentally-determined SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes in the immunogenic structural proteins of SARS-CoV, we identified a set of B cell and T cell epitopes derived from the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins that map identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. As no mutation has been observed in these identified epitopes among the 120 available SARS-CoV-2 sequences (as of 21 February 2020), immune targeting of these epitopes may potentially offer protection against this novel virus. For the T cell epitopes, we performed a population coverage analysis of the associated MHC alleles and proposed a set of epitopes that is estimated to provide broad coverage globally, as well as in China.

In this study, data for all shoulder arthroplasties (hemiarthroplasty, reverse/anatomic shoulder arthroplasty) from the nationwide inpatient statistics of Germany (2010C2019) and population forecasts until 2040 were gathered. A Poisson and a negative binomial approach using monotone B-splines were modeled for all types of prostheses to project the annual number and incidence of primary and revision arthroplasty. Additionally, trends in main indicators were also gathered and expected changes were calculated. Overall, the number of primary shoulder replacements is set to increase significantly by 2040, reaching at least 37,000 (95% CI 32,000C44,000) procedures per year. This trend is mainly attributable to an about 10-fold increased use of fracture-related reverse shoulder arthroplasty in patients over 80 years of age, although the number of procedures in younger patients will also rise substantially. In contrast, hemiarthroplasties will significantly decrease. The number of revision procedures is projected to increase subsequently, although the revision burden is forecast to decline. Using these country-specific projection approaches, a massive increase of primary and revision shoulder arthroplasties is expected by 2040, mainly due to a rising number of fracture-related procedures. These growth rates are substantially higher than those from hip or knee arthroplasty. As these trends are similar in most Western countries, this draws attention to the international issue, of: if healthcare systems will be able to allocate human and financial resources adequately, and if future research and fracture-prevention programs may help to temper this rising burden in the upcoming decades.","output":"Projections of Primary and Revision Shoulder Arthroplasty until 2040: Facing a Massive Rise in Fracture-Related Procedures"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Self-rated health (SRH) has been used to predict cognitive decline in various populations; however, this relationship has not been examined in Latinos.

RESULTS: Among the 23 patients who used HFNC as first-line therapy, 10 experienced HFNC failure and used NIV as rescue therapy. Among the 13 patients who used NIV as first-line therapy, one (8%) used HFNC as rescue therapy due to NIV intolerance. The duration of HFNC + NIV (median 7.1, IQR: 3.5C12.2 vs. 7.3, IQR: 5.3C10.0 days), intubation rate (17% vs. 15%) and mortality (4% vs. 8%) did not differ between patients who used HFNC and NIV as first-line therapy.

Despite advances in surgical repair of hiatus hernias, there remains a high radiological recurrence rate. We performed a novel technique incorporating bilateral oesophageal fixation and evaluated outcomes, principally symptom improvement and hernia recurrence. Methods. A retrospective study was performed on a prospective database of patients undergoing hiatus hernia repair with bilateral oesophageal fixation. Retrospective and prospective quality of life (QOL), PPI usage, and patient satisfaction data were obtained. Hernia recurrence was assessed by either barium swallow or gastroscopy. Results. 87 patients were identified in the database with a minimum of 3 months followup. There were significant improvements in QOL scores including GERD HRQL (29.13 to 4.38, P < 0.01), Visick (3 to 1), and RSI (17.45 to 5, P < 0.01). PPI usage decreased from a median of daily to none, and there was high patient satisfaction (94%). 57 patients were assessed for recurrence with either gastroscopy or barium swallow, and one patient had evidence of recurrence on barium swallow at 45 months postoperatively. There was an 8% complication rate and no mortality or oesophageal perforation. Conclusions.

However, controversy exists around whether non-obstructive chronic bronchitis (NOCB) is associated with airflow obstruction, lung function decline, and all-cause mortality in ever smoker or never smoker. RESEARCH QUESTION: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to clarify the relationship between NOCB and incident COPD, lung function decline, and all-cause mortality, and to quantify the magnitude of these associations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published up to October 1, 2021. Eligibility screening, data extraction, and quality assessment of the retrieved articles were conducted independently by two reviewers. Studies were included if they were original articles comparing incident COPD, lung function decline, and all-cause mortality in normal spirometry with and without chronic bronchitis. The primary outcomes were incident COPD and all-cause mortality. The secondary outcomes were respiratory disease-related mortality and lung function decline. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model. RESULTS: We identified 17,323 related references and included 14 articles. Compared with individuals without NOCB, individuals with NOCB had an increased risk of incident COPD (odds ratio: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.21C3.22, I(2) = 76.3% and relative risk: 1.44, 95%CI: 1.13C1.85, I(2) = 56.1%), all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.38, 95%CI: 1.26C1.51, I(2) = 29.4%), and respiratory disease-related mortality (HR: 1.88, 95%CI: 1.37C2.59, I(2) = 0.0%). Data on the decline in lung function could not be quantitatively synthesized, but the five articles that assessed the rate of decline in lung function showed that lung function declines faster in individuals with NOCB. The mean difference in the additional decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s ranged from 3.6 to 23.2 mL/year. INTERPRETATION: Individuals with NOCB are at a higher risk of incident COPD and all-cause mortality than individuals without NOCB, highlighting the crucial need for strategies to screen for and reduce NOCB risk.

However, little is known with respect to how pharmaceuticals influence the epitranscriptome. Here we define how acetaminophen (APAP) induces epitranscriptomic reprogramming and how the writer Alkylation Repair Homolog 8 (Alkbh8) plays a key gene regulatory role in the response. Alkbh8 modifies tRNA selenocysteine (tRNASec) to translationally regulate the production of glutathione peroxidases (Gpxs) and other selenoproteins, with Gpx enzymes known to play protective roles during APAP toxicity. We demonstrate that APAP increases toxicity and markers of damage, and decreases selenoprotein levels in Alkbh8 deficient mouse livers, when compared to wildtype. APAP also promotes large scale reprogramming of 31 RNA marks comprising the liver tRNA epitranscriptome including: 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U), isopentenyladenosine (i6A), pseudouridine (), and 1-methyladenosine (m1A) modifications linked to tRNASec and many others. Alkbh8 deficiency also leads to wide-spread epitranscriptomic dysregulation in response to APAP, demonstrating that a single writer defect can promote downstream changes to a large spectrum of RNA modifications. Our study highlights the importance of RNA modifications and translational responses to APAP, identifies writers as key modulators of stress responses in vivo and supports the idea that the epitranscriptome may play important roles in responses to pharmaceuticals.","output":"Epitranscriptomic reprogramming is required to prevent stress and damage from acetaminophen"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Describe preferences toward COVID-19 testing features (method, location, hypothetical monetary incentive) and simulate the effect of monetary incentives on willingness to test.

Given their causal role in VITT, identification of the molecular composition of anti-PF4 antibodies is crucial for developing better diagnostics and treatments. Here, we utilised a novel proteomic workflow to analyse the immunoglobulin variable (IgV) region composition of anti-PF4 antibodies at the level of the secreted proteome. Serum anti-PF4 IgG antibodies from five patients with VITT triggered by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination were affinity purified by PF4-coupled magnetic beads and sequenced by mass spectrometry. We revealed a single IgG heavy (H)-chain species paired with a single lambda light (L)-chain species in all five unrelated patients. Remarkably, all L-chains were encoded by the identical IGLV3-21*02 gene subfamily with identical L-chain third complementarity determining region (LCDR3) lengths. Moreover, striking stereotypic features were also identified in heavy-chains anti-PF4 antibodies characterised by identical HCDR3 length and homologous sequences. In summary, we unravelled the molecular signature of highly stereotyped clonotypic anti-PF4 antibodies, indicating shared pathways of antibody production in VITT patients. These discoveries are critical to understand the molecular basis of this serious condition and develop novel therapies aimed at removing pathogenic clones.

Release of drops from different seat positions was evaluated to analyze the decontamination performance of the ventilation system. The results showed an overall good performance, with an average of 24.1% of droplets removed through the exhaust in the first 40 s. The droplets' distribution revealed that higher concentrations were less prevalent along the center of the domain where the passengers sit. Longitudinal contamination between rows was noted, which is a negative aspect for containing the risk of infection in a given row but has the benefit of diluting the concentration of infectious droplets. Droplets from the window seat raised more vertically and invaded the space of other passengers to a lesser extent. In contrast, droplets released from the middle seat contaminated more the aisle passenger's space, indicating that downward flow from personal ventilation could move down droplets to its breathing region. Droplets released from the aisle were dragged down by the ventilation system immediately. The distance of drops to the mouth of the passengers showed that the majority passed at a relatively safe distance.

Search strategy: We searched PubMed, Embase, APA PsycInfo, Wanfang Med, SinoMed, CINAHL, Ovid Emcare, Scopus, ProQuest, CNKI, NICE, AHRQ, CADTH, JBI EBP and Cochrane DSR for English and Chinese language articles published between January 2011 and March 2022. Publications on administration approaches, models and appraisal tools of nursing assistants in hospitals, including qualitative, quantitative, mix-methods studies and evidence syntheses, were considered eligible. Results: 36 eligible studies were included for the review with an acceptable quality. We identified one administration model, nine administration methods, fifteen educational programmes and seven appraisal tools from the included studies. The frequency effect size analysis yielded 15 topics of main focus at four levels, whilst suggesting that the previous articles were mostly (33%) focused on the competency of nursing assistants, and the lectures were the most (80%) used strategy in quality improvement projects. The evidence-based quality of the original studies was considerably low, indicating the huge gaps between the evidence-based research and the management practice. Conclusions: A series of practical intrahospital administration approaches was revealed, and fifteen mostly focused topics were identified. We need probe more thoroughly in this area, based more on effective management theories and frameworks, and employing methods of higher quality.

Due to their central role in intercellular communication and their variable cargo, EVs are involved in several biological processes. The possibility of isolating them from different biofluids makes EVs valuable biomarkers to be analyzed for the diagnosis or prognosis of several conditions. Moreover, these natural nanoparticles have been investigated as therapeutic tools in many pathological conditions. In this context, EVs have shown innate immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties when isolated from stem/progenitor cells and have also been considered vehicles to be edited for drug delivery. The aim of the review is to report some of the pre-clinical and clinical studies distinguishing those in which EVs have been examined as biomarkers from those in which they have been used as therapeutics. ABSTRACT: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are ubiquitous masters of intercellular communication, being detectable in tissues, circulation, and body fluids. Their complex cargo reflects the (patho)physiologic status of the cells from which they originate. Due to these properties, the potential of EVs, and in particular exosomes, to serve as biomarkers or therapeutics has grown exponentially over the past decade. On one side, numerous studies have demonstrated that EV-associated nucleic acids and proteins are implicated in cancer progression, as well as neurodegenerative, infectious, and autoimmune disorders. On the other, the therapeutic use of EVs secreted by various cell types, and in particular stem/progenitor cells, present significant advantages in comparison to the corresponding parental cells, such as the less complex production and storage conditions. In this review, we examine some of the major pre-clinical studies dealing with EVs and exosomes, that led to the development of numerous completed clinical trials.","output":"Extracellular Vesicles as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Tools: From Pre-Clinical to Clinical Applications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic persists, pregnant women have been increasingly affected worldwide.

We aimed to delineate the evolution of CT findings and outcome in OP of COVID-19. Materials and Methods: 106 COVID-19 patients with OP based on CT findings were retrospectively included and categorized into non-severe (mild/common) and severe (severe/critical) groups. CT features including lobar distribution, presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, linear opacities and total severity CT score were evaluated at three time intervals from symptom-onset to CT scan (day 0-7, day 8-14, day>14). Discharge or adverse outcome (admission to ICU or death), and pulmonary sequelae (complete absorption or lesion residuals) on CT after discharge were analyzed based on the CT features at different time interval. Results: 79(74.5%) patients were non-severe and 103(97.2%) were discharged at median day 25 (range, day 8-50) after symptom-onset. Of 67 patients with revisit CT at 2-4 weeks after discharge, 20(29.9%) had complete absorption of lesions at median day 38 (range, day 30-53) after symptom-onset. Significant differences between complete absorption and residuals groups were found in percentages of consolidation (1.5% vs. 13.8%, P=0.010), number of involved lobe >3 (40.0% vs. 72.5%, P=0.030), CT score >4 (20.0% vs. 65.0%, P=0.010) at day 8-14. Conclusions: Most OP cases had good prognosis. Approximately one-third of cases had complete absorption of lesions during 1-2 months after symptom-onset while those with increased frequency of consolidation, number of involved lobe>3, and CT score >4 at week 2 after symptom-onset may indicate lesion residuals on CT.","output":"Organizing Pneumonia of COVID-19: Time-dependent Evolution and Outcome in CT Findings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We presented the rationale for the use of thymosin 1 as prophylaxis of severe COVID-19 in cancer patients undergoing active treatment, constituting the background for the PROTHYMOS study, a prospective, multicenter, open-label, Phase II randomized study, currently in its start-up phase (Eudract no. 2020-006020-13).

Participants alluded to historical and structural differences for the observed disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Many struggled with lockdown measures which impeded cultural and religious gatherings that were deemed to be integral to the community. Cultural and social practices led to many suffering on their own as discussion of mental health was still deemed a taboo within many communities. Many expressed their community reluctance to report symptoms for the fear of financial and physical health implications. They reported increase in hate crime which was deemed to be exacerbated due to perceived insensitive messaging from authority officials and historical structural biases.

Points of support such as food banks were vital in ensuring essential supplies during the pandemic. Many could not afford masks and sanitisers. Conclusion: The study highlights the perceived impact of COVID-19 pandemic on BAME communities. Government agencies and public health agencies need to integrate with the community, and community leaders to penetrate the key messages and deliver targeted yet sensitive public health advice which incorporates cultural and religious practices. Addressing route cause of disparities is imperative to mitigate current and future pandemics.","output":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities: a qualitative study on the perspectives of BAME community leaders"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: Physical distancing behavior (PDB) is a key disease prevention strategy for limiting the spread of COVID-19. In order to effectively encourage it among adolescents, it is necessary to understand the associated mental mechanisms. Health behavior theories suggest that emotions, personality, motivation, and moral disengagement could all play a role. On the basis of a longitudinal study, we investigated the importance of these factors in predicting PDB. METHODS: The participants were 347 adolescents residing in Italy. Data were collected in four waves starting from 1 year before the pandemic. A structural equation model based on health behavior theory was tested. RESULTS: After the COVID-19 national lockdown, adolescents experienced fewer positive emotions and more negative emotions compared with 1 year earlier. Nevertheless, these emotional changes, and adolescents' personality (except for openness to experiences), were not related to the adoption of PDB. Instead, the autonomous motivation of adolescents significantly predicted a higher likelihood to adopt PDB by increasing the intention to engage in this behavior and, more indirectly, by substantially decreasing moral disengagement, which was negatively related to PDB. In contrast, controlled motivation corresponded to significantly higher levels of moral disengagement and predicted less likelihood of adopting PDB. CONCLUSIONS: Messages and interventions targeted at adolescents should be oriented towards supporting autonomy, emphasizing the personal and social value of PDB. Communications should avoid the use of coercive strategies based on eliciting emotions such as shame and guilt in adolescents who do not adopt PDB, which appear to trigger off mechanisms of moral disengagement.","output":"Physical Distancing Behavior: The Role of Emotions, Personality, Motivations, and Moral Decision-Making"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To understand the incidence trend and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province. Methods: The incidence data of COVID-19 reported in Shaanxi as of 22 February, 2020 were collected for an epidemiological descriptive analysis. Results: A total of 245 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Shaanxi. Most cases were mild (87.76%). As time passed, the areas where confirmed cases were reported continued to increase. The case number in Xi'an was highest, accounting for nearly half of the total reported cases in the province. The epidemic pattern in Shaanxi had gradually shifted from imported case pattern to local case pattern, and the transmission of local cases was mainly based on family cluster transmission. The confirmed cases from different sources had caused the secondary transmission in Shaanxi. After February 7, the number of reported cases began to fluctuate and decrease stably, indicating a decrease-to-zero period. Conclusions: At present, the overall epidemic of COVID-19 in Shaanxi has gradually been mitigated.

Here, we describe a stepwise engineering approach to generate a set of affinity optimized, enzymatically inactivated ACE2 variants that potently block SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells. These optimized receptor traps tightly bind the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and prevent entry into host cells. We first computationally designed the ACE2CRBD interface using a two-stage flexible protein backbone design process that improved affinity for the RBD by up to 12-fold. These designed receptor variants were affinity matured an additional 14-fold by random mutagenesis and selection using yeast surface display. The highest-affinity variant contained seven amino acid changes and bound to the RBD 170-fold more tightly than wild-type ACE2. With the addition of the natural ACE2 collectrin domain and fusion to a human immunoglobulin crystallizable fragment (Fc) domain for increased stabilization and avidity, the most optimal ACE2 receptor traps neutralized SARS-CoV-2Cpseudotyped lentivirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) in the 10- to 100-ng/mL range. Engineered ACE2 receptor traps offer a promising route to fighting infections by SARS-CoV-2 and other ACE2-using coronaviruses, with the key advantage that viral resistance would also likely impair viral entry.

METHODS The study was conducted in HIV Clinic Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in September-October 2021, specifically targeting adults HIV-infected patients routinely using ARV. Demographic and clinical data, including COVID-19 and vaccine history, were taken from clinic survey and hospital medical records data. RESULTS 554 of 1275 patients (43.5%) reported using any type of ingested CAM during COVID-19 pandemic, mostly vitamins and/or minerals. Factors related to CAM use were history of COVID-19 infection (aOR 2.28; 95% CI 1.65-3.14) and 2-5 years ARV duration compared to more than 10 years (aOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.02-1.91). Five known potential interactions involving 20 patients and two potential weak interactions involving 8 patients were found, but many of other interactions categorized as unknown. Only limited number of patients (3.8%) were aware about the drug interaction between ARV and CAM that they used.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age-standardised rates of MS-2 Step prescriptions dispensed by year for 2015-2019, and age-standardised rates by state, remoteness area, and level 3 statistical areas (SA3s) for 2019. Numbers and proportions of SA3s in which MS-2 Step was not prescribed by a GP or dispensed by a community pharmacy during 2019 (unweighted and weighted by number of women of reproductive age), by state and remoteness area. RESULTS During 2015-2019, 91 643 PBS prescriptions for MS-2 Step were dispensed; the national age-standardised rate increased from 1.63 in 2015 to 3.79 prescriptions per 1000 women aged 15-54 years in 2019.

Various markers and tests have been evaluated and found to have a strong association with the worse prognosis of the disease. Common coagulation markers like D-dimer and fibrinogen give more of a static picture of coagulation, whereas viscoelastic tests like thromboelastography (TEG) provide an understanding of the coagulation function and help in better interpretation. We conducted a retrospective analysis of TEG values of 32 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Hypercoagulation as defined by TEG-coagulation index (CI) higher than the upper limit of the normal reference range (NRR) is found in 62.5% of the patients. There is also a clear representation of hypercoagulability as reflected by TEG-R, TEG-K, and TEG-LY30 values lower than or toward the lower limit of NRR, and TEG-ANGLE, TEG-MA, and TEG-CI values higher than or toward the upper limit of NRR which is more pronounced in severe forms of the disease, both in comparison to NRRs and other non-COVID ICU patients. Findings are similar to that of earlier studies in patients with COVID-19 except for the LY30, which is retained in the majority of our patients. Thromboelastography can be a useful tool to understand and screen for COVID-19-related hypercoagulability and may help predict VTE events. The potential of TEG to determine the optimal anticoagulant therapy needs to be evaluated in larger prospective studies. How to cite this article: Saseedharan S, Talla VB, Chiluka A.

We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures. Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-50 years), and older (65-85 years) adults' self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules. Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged. Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.","output":"Age-related differences in the perception of COVID-19 emergency during the Italian outbreak."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The real-world problems and ever-changing challenges currently confronting the future of nursing education and healthcare require a problem-based learning approach using simulation strategy. This is exacerbated by the increasing burden of diseases such as tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) and more recently the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as advancing technology and changing regulations and policies. Problem-based learning is a student-centred learning strategy, where students are presented with situations drawn from practice, which can be used to bridge the theoryCpractice gap. OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions and views of healthcare educators on how problem-based learning can be facilitated through simulation. METHOD: A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was used. Thirteen educators from the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Johannesburg, with 5 years teaching experience, were purposively selected from the Deans office, the Nursing Department, emergency medical care and the departments of podiatry, somatology and radiography. The participants were selected based on their extensive knowledge of problem-based learning and the use of simulation. Data were collected through in-depth, individual, semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis provided six themes and 13 related sub-themes. The article focuses on the perceptions and views of educators regarding problem-based learning through simulation. RESULTS: Problem-based learning through simulation allows students to work together in teams, which demonstrates a new modus operandi and renders a holistic approach to patient care. CONCLUSION: Problem-based learning through simulation should be utilised to encourage reflective knowledge exchange. Students from various departments can learn about new innovations, creativity and develop critical thinking when solving complex health-related problems.","output":"Educators perceptions and views of problem-based learning through simulation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Assisted living (AL), is a long-term care service that provides housing and care for over 800,000 older adults in 30,000 residences.

Its origins are within the essentialist point of view on the nature of diseases, which dates back at least to 18th-century taxonomy studies. In this article, we propose a model of nosological diagnosis as a two-phase process composed of the categorization of inductive inferences and argumentations by analogy. In the inductive phase, disease entities are identified by means of typicality-based categorization processes, and meaningful clinical samples are learned (abstract clinical cases, i.e., syndromes and actual cases); in the subsequent phase, those samples are used as the bases of argumentations by analogy to obtain a diagnosis for a given patient. This model extends the prototype resemblance theory of disease including also the exemplar theory proposed in cognitive science and, moreover, it frames the clinical activity of nosological diagnosis and how it can be explained within the theory of argumentation. According to it, diagnosis based on the recognition of a typical syndrome is explained in terms of the prototype theory of categorization and the antisymmetrical argumentation by analogy, while diagnosis based on a comparison with a previous clinical case is explained by the exemplar theory of categorization and by the symmetrical argumentation by analogy.","output":"Nosological Diagnosis, Theories of Categorization, and Argumentations by Analogy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Many tropical countries are currently experiencing dengue (DEN), chikungunya (CHIK) and also more recently Zika (ZIKA) epidemics (particularly in Latin America). Although the risk of transmission and spread of these infections in temperate regions remains a controversial issue, vector-borne diseases have been widely reported in the media and have been the focus of preventive strategies by national and international policy-makers and public health authorities. In this context, we wanted to determine the extent of risk perception in infectious diseases (ID) physicians of the current and future risk of arboviral disease introduction, autochthonous case development and epidemic scenarios in France, Western Europe. METHODS: To this aim, we developed an original standardized questionnaire survey which was disseminated by the French Infectious Diseases Society to ID physician members. RESULTS: We found that ID physicians perceived the risk of introduction and outbreak development of DEN, CHIK and ZIKA in France to be low to medium-low. Generalized Linear Model(s) identified medical school training, the extent of professional experience, and awareness of the French national plan regarding arboviral infections as significant predictors for lower risk perception among respondents. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that arboviral diseases are increasingly being imported into France, sometimes resulting in sporadic autochtonous transmission, French ID physicians do not perceive the risk as high. Better communication and education targeting health professionals and citizens will be needed to enhance the effectiveness of the French national plan to prepare against arboviral diseases.

Antigens expressed in maize (Zea mays) are particularly attractive since they can be deposited in the natural storage vessel, the corn seed, and can be conveniently delivered to any organism that consumes grain. We have previously demonstrated high level expression of the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin and the spike protein of swine transmissible gastroenteritis in corn, and have demonstrated that these antigens delivered in the seed elicit protective immune responses.

The selected features were then validated of the classification performance in terms of consistency and accuracy through supervised machine learning methods. Results showed that 24 linguistic features such as the overlapping of content words between adjacent sentences, the use of third-person pronouns, auxiliary verbs, tense, emotional words provide consistent and accurate predictions for journal articles with different academic impacts. Lastly, the random forest model is shown to be the best model to fit the relationship between these 24 features and journal articles with high and moderate impacts.

This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the formers interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim holding legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant permission for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","output":"A Key, Not a Straitjacket: The Case for Interim Mental Health Legislation Pending Complete Prohibition of Psychiatric Coercion in Accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Inferior olive (IO), a nucleus in the ventral medulla, is the only source of climbing fibers that form one of the two input pathways entering the cerebellum. IO has long been proposed to be crucial for motor control and its activity is currently considered to be at the center of many hypotheses of both motor and cognitive functions of the cerebellum. While its physiology and function have been relatively well studied on single-cell level in vitro, presently there are no reports on the organization of the IO network activity in living animals. This is largely due to the extremely challenging anatomical location of the IO, making it difficult to subject to conventional fluorescent imaging methods, where an optic path must be created through the entire brain located dorsally to the region of interest. Here we describe an alternative method for obtaining state-of-the-art -level calcium imaging data from the IO network. The method takes advantage of the extreme ventral location of the IO and involves a surgical procedure for inserting a gradient-refractive index (GRIN) lens through the neck viscera to come into contact with the ventral surface of the calcium sensor GCaMP6s-expressing IO in anesthetized mice. A representative calcium imaging recording is shown to demonstrate the feasibility to record IO neuron activity after the surgery. While this is a non-survival surgery and the recordings must be conducted under anesthesia, it avoids damage to life-critical brainstem nuclei and allows conducting large variety of experiments investigating spatiotemporal activity patterns and input integration in the IO. This procedure with modifications could be used for recordings in other, adjacent regions of the ventral brainstem.","output":"In vivo Calcium Imaging in Mouse Inferior Olive."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Disinfection of contaminated or potentially contaminated surfaces has become an integral part of the mitigation strategies for controlling coronavirus disease 2019. Whilst a broad range of disinfectants are effective in inactivating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), application of disinfectants has a low throughput in areas that receive treatments. Disinfection of large surface areas often involves the use of reactive microbiocidal materials, including ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, chlorine dioxide, and hydrogen peroxide vapor. Albeit these methods are highly effective in inactivating SARS-CoV-2, the deployment of these approaches creates unacceptable health hazards and precludes the treatment of occupied indoor spaces using existing disinfection technologies. Deployment of dry hydrogen peroxide (DHP) is an emerging pathogen reduction technology, which produces hydrogen peroxide in the ambient atmosphere at 5 and 25 parts per billion using a commercially available catalytic unit. The low concentration of hydrogen peroxide released using DHP technology has been found to be tolerated by humans in indoor spaces and is effective in inactivating bacterial pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections. In this study, the feasibility of using DHP in inactivating SARS-CoV-2 on contaminated surfaces in large indoor spaces was evaluated. Methods. Glass slides were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with DHP for up to 24 hours. Residual infectious virus samples were eluted and titrated in African green monkey VeroE6 cells. Results. In comparison with the observed relatively high stability of SARS-CoV-2 on contaminated glass slides in the control group, residual infectious titers of glass slides inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 were significantly reduced after receiving 120 minutes of DHP treatment. Conclusions. The accelerated decay of SARS-CoV-2 on contaminated glass slides suggests that treatment with DHP can be an effective surface disinfection method for occupied indoor spaces.","output":"Treatment with Dry Hydrogen Peroxide Accelerates the Decay of Severe Acute Syndrome Coronavirus-2 on Non-porous Hard Surfaces"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic that has, at present, infected more than 11 million people globally.

This paper applies a mixed-method approach to map the post-COVID-19 SDGs targets on a fuzzy action priority surface at the country level in Iran, as a developing country, by taking the following four main steps: (1) using a modified Delphi method to make a list of the SDGs targets influenced by COVID-19; (2) using the best-worst method, as a multi-criteria decision-making tool, to weight the COVID-19 effects on the SDGs targets achievement; also (3) to weight the impact of the SDGs targets on the sustainable development implementation; and finally (4) designing a fuzzy inference system to calculate the action priority scores of the SDGs targets. As a result, reduction of poor people proportion by half (SDG 1.2), development-oriented policies for supporting creativity and job creation (SDG 8.3), end the pandemics and other epidemics (SDG 3.3), reduction of deaths and economic loss caused by disasters (SDG 11.5), and financial support for small-scale enterprises (SDG 9.3) were identified as the highest priorities for action, respectively, in the recovery agenda for sustainable development post COVID-19. The provided fuzzy action priority surface supports the UN's SDGs achievement and implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Iran.

They must also motivate members of the public to cooperate with the guidelines, specifically by changing their usual behavior. Policy makers have traditionally adopted a didactic and formalistic stance by conveying dry, statistics-based health information to the public. They have not yet considered the alternative of providing health information in the form of narrative evidence, using stories that address both cognitive and emotional aspects. The aim of this viewpoint paper is to introduce policy makers to the advantages of using narrative evidence to provide health information during a disease outbreak or pandemic such as COVID-19. Throughout human history, authorities have tended to employ apocalyptic narratives during disease outbreaks or pandemics. This viewpoint paper proposes an alternative coping narrative that includes the following components: segmentation; barrier reduction; role models; empathy and support; strengthening self-efficacy, community efficacy, and coping tools; preventing stigmatization of at-risk populations; and communicating uncertainty. It also discusses five conditions for using narrative evidence to produce an effective communication campaign on social media: (1) identifying narratives that reveal the needs, personal experiences, and questions of different subgroups to tailor messaging to produce targeted behavioral change; (2) providing separate and distinct treatment of each information unit or theory that arises on social networks; (3) identifying positive deviants who found creative solutions for stress during the COVID-19 crisis not found by other members of the community; (4) creating different stories of coping; and (5) maintaining a dialogue with population subgroups (eg, skeptical and hesitant groups).

However, existing drug repositioning methods that are based on computational analysis are limited by sparse data and classic fusion methods; thus, we use autoencoders and adaptive fusion methods to calculate drug repositioning. RESULTS: In this study, a drug repositioning algorithm based on a deep autoencoder and adaptive fusion was proposed to mitigate the problems of decreased precision and low-efficiency multisource data fusion caused by data sparseness. Specifically, a drug is repositioned by fusing drug-disease associations, drug target proteins, drug chemical structures and drug side effects. First, drug feature data integrated by drug target proteins and chemical structures were processed with dimension reduction via a deep autoencoder to characterize feature representations more densely and abstractly. Then, disease similarity was computed using drug-disease association data, while drug similarity was calculated with drug feature and drug-side effect data. Predictions of drug-disease associations were also calculated using a top-k neighbor method that is commonly used in predictive drug repositioning studies. Finally, a predicted matrix for drug-disease associations was acquired after fusing a wide variety of data via adaptive fusion. Based on experimental results, the proposed algorithm achieves a higher precision and recall rate than the DRCFFS, SLAMS and BADR algorithms with the same dataset.

Our objective was to document the experiences of these front-line healthcare professionals during the pandemic. Design Electronic survey of long-term care staff. This report summarizes qualitative data from open-ended questions for the subset of respondents working in nursing homes. Setting and Participants 152 nursing home staff from 32 states, including direct-care staff and administrators. Methods From May 11 through June 4, 2020, we used social media and professional networks to disseminate an electronic survey with closed- and open-ended questions to a convenience sample of long-term care staff. Four investigators identified themes from qualitative responses for staff working in nursing homes. Results Respondents described ongoing constraints on testing and continued reliance on crisis standards for extended use and reuse of personal protective equipment. Administrators discussed the burden of tracking and implementing sometimes confusing or contradictory guidance from numerous agencies. Direct-care staff expressed fears of infecting themselves and their families, and expressed sincere empathy and concern for their residents. They described experiencing burnout due to increased workloads, staffing shortages, and the emotional burden of caring for residents facing significant isolation, illness, and death. Respondents cited the presence or lack of organizational communication and teamwork as important factors influencing their ability to work under challenging circumstances. They also described the demoralizing impact of negative media coverage of nursing homes, contrasting this with the heroic public recognition given to hospital staff. Conclusions and Implications Nursing home staff described working under complex and stressful circumstances during the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges have added significant burden to an already strained and vulnerable workforce and are likely to contribute to increased burnout, turnover, and staff shortages in the long-term.","output":"Front-line Nursing Home Staff Experiences During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Behavioral immune system (BIS) describes psychological mechanisms that detect cues to infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, trigger disease-relevant responses and facilitate behavioral avoidance/escape BIS activation elicits a perceived vulnerability to disease (PVD) which can result in conformity with social norms However, a response to superficial cues can result in aversive responses to people that pose no actual threat, leading to an aversion to unfamiliar others, and likelihood of prejudice Pathogen-neutralizing behaviors, therefore, have implications for social interaction as well as illness behaviors and responses to health communications In this study, we investigate how PVD influences conformity, attitudes to other people and to lockdown regulations through the lens of the Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) RST describes personality in terms of biologically-driven approach and avoidance motivations which support personal goals Participants from the United Kingdom public (N = 605) completed an RST personality questionnaire and then read either (a) coronavirus morbidity-mortality statistics and current United Kingdom government lifestyle regulations, (b) just the regulations (as presented in most government publicity materials), or (c) no information at all They all completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale to assess BIS-relevant Germ Aversion and Perceived Infectability, followed by questions measuring social conformity, warmth toward others and attitudes toward lockdown measures Significantly lower PVD scores were observed in the no-information condition, with the other conditions showing no difference In terms of RST, approach behaviors related to goal-drive persistence work alongside fear in explaining conformity to social norms Reward related approach behaviors partially explained warmth toward others, indicating that social rewards gained through interaction continue to be strong drivers of behavior We found no role for RST traits in attitudes toward lockdown Overall, coronavirus-related behavior is not driven purely by fear, but also by social and/or protection goals regulated by approach motivation This study presents new insights into public perceptions of coronavirus and government regulated lifestyle restrictions, helping to explain social behaviors in terms of biologically driven mechanisms Such understanding is vital if we are to successfully motivate public behavior to constrain spread of the virus","output":"Behavioral Immune System Responses to Coronavirus: A Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory Explanation of Conformity, Warmth Toward Others and Attitudes Toward Lockdown"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Kinderen met otitis media acuta krijgen nogal eens -oorpijn, waartegen pijnstillers vaak geen soelaas bieden.

However, it is unclear whether insomnia sustains during the later phases of the pandemic. METHODS: We searched PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from the 27(th) December 2019 to the 2(nd) February 2021. As early stage studies on COVID-19 pandemic in China were defined as those conducted prior to April 1(st), 2020, while late stage studies were those conducted after April 1(st), 2020. RESULTS: A total of 98 studies with 193,889 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of insomnia symptoms among all populations was 39.1%; the pooled prevalence of insomnia symptoms during the early and late stages of COVID-19 in China were 37.0% (95% CI 34.1-39.9%) and 41.8% (95% CI 33.6-50.0%), respectively. Importantly, there was no significant difference regarding the prevalence of insomnia symptoms between the early and late stages of COVID-19. Meta-regression showed that healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients, patients with chronic medical conditions and patients with mental disorders had a higher prevalence of insomnia symptoms compared to the general population. This association remained significant in healthcare workers and patients with chronic medical conditions after adjusting for age, gender, areas of high or low prevalence of COVID-19 cases, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Over one third of our sample presented insomnia symptoms during the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic in China. Interestingly, prevalence of insomnia symptoms sustained high during the late stage of the pandemic despite the control of the disease and the amelioration of its adverse effects.

We explored whether Kawasaki-like disease (KD), when associated with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, has specific characteristics. METHODS: We included children and adolescents with KD criteria admitted in the department of general pediatrics of a university hospital in Paris, France, between January 1, 2018, and May 26, 2020. The incidence of KD was compared between the outbreak and a pre-outbreak control period (January 1, 2018, to April 25). Characteristics of patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 testing (KD-SARS-CoV-2) were compared to those of the pre-outbreak period (classic KD). RESULTS: A total of 30 and 59 children with KD were admitted during the outbreak and pre-outbreak periods, respectively (incidence ratio 13.2 [8.3-21.0]). During the outbreak, 23/30 (77%) children were diagnosed as KD-SARS-CoV-2. When compared with patients with classic KD, those with KD-SARS-CoV-2 were more frequently of sub-Saharan African ancestry (OR 4.4 [1.6-12.6]) and older (median 8.2 vs. 4.0 years, p < 0.001), had more often initial gastrointestinal (OR 84 [4.9-1456]) and neurological (OR 7.3 [1.9-27.7] manifestations, and shock syndrome (OR 13.7 [4.2-45.1]).

This study examined CC implementation at a Canadian institution, documenting the shared and unique challenges that CCs faced and overcame over a three-year period. METHODS This study consisted of three phases, which were conceptually and analytically linked using Moran-Ellis and colleagues' notion of 'following a thread.' Phase 1 examined the early perceptions and experiences of 30 key informants using a survey and semi-structured interviews. Phase 2 provided insight into CCs' operations through a survey sent to 35 CC chairs one-year post-implementation. Phase 3 invited 20 CC members to participate in semi-structured interviews to follow up on initial themes two years post-implementation. Detailed observation notes from 16 CC meetings across nine disciplines were used to corroborate the findings from each phase. RESULTS Response rates in each phase were 83% (n=25), 43% (n=15), and 60% (n=12), respectively. Despite the high degree of support for CCs among faculty and resident members, several ongoing challenges were highlighted: adapting to program size, optimizing membership, engaging residents, maintaining capacity among members, sharing and aggregating data, and developing a clear mandate. DISCUSSION Findings of this study reinforce the importance of resident engagement and information sharing between disciplines. Challenges faced by CCs are discussed in relation to the existing literature to inform a better understanding of group decision-making processes in medical education.

The impact on workers is equally profound, including job loss, divorce and family disruption, and potentially imprisonment, injury, illness, and death. Pain from occupational injuries and illnesses and stress are important pathways to opioid use disorder. Effective workplace programs that incorporate the public health approach to prevention offer a significant opportunity to prevent and respond to the opioid crisis. To date, the nation's efforts at combating the crisis have not included the necessary policy reforms to transform the workplace from a pathway to opioid misuse to a pathway to prevention, including education of workers, unions, employers, and health care providers and treatment and recovery of affected workers. Several key policy interventions are recommended to address this disconnect, including prevention of workplace injury, illness, and emotional distress; worker education and training; and replacement of stigmatizing, punitive workplace substance use programs with supportive programs. Increasing access to alternative pain treatment and preventing opioid misuse in workers' compensation systems are other key policy recommendations.","output":"A Public Health Approach to Protecting Workers from Opioid Use Disorder and Overdose Related to Occupational Exposure, Injury, and Stress : APHA Policy Statement Number 202012, Issued October 24, 2020."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Several researches and evidence show the increasing likelihood of pandemics (large-scale outbreaks of infectious disease) which has far reaching sequels in all aspects of human lives ranging from rapid mortality rates to economic and social disruption across the world.

Although SARS-CoV-2, and other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are highly similar genetically and at the protein production level, there are significant differences between them. Research has shown that the structural spike (S) protein plays an important role in the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. So far, studies have shown that various genes encoding primarily for elements of S protein undergo frequent mutation. We have performed an in-depth review of the literature covering the structural and mutational aspects of S protein in the context of SARS-CoV-2, and compared them with those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Our analytical approach consisted in an initial genome and transcriptome analysis, followed by primary, secondary and tertiary protein structure analysis. Additionally, we investigated the potential effects of these differences on the S protein binding and interactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and we established, after extensive analysis of previous research articles, that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV use different ends/regions in S protein receptor-binding motif (RBM) and different types of interactions for their chief binding with ACE2. These differences may have significant implications on pathogenesis, entry and ability to infect intermediate hosts for these coronaviruses.

Here, we examine the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication by determining the cryo-EM structures of the stalled pre- and post- translocated polymerase complexes. Compared with the apo complex, the structures show notable structural rearrangements happening to nsp12 and its co-factors nsp7 and nsp8 to accommodate the nucleic acid, whereas there are highly conserved residues in nsp12, positioning the template and primer for an in-line attack on the incoming nucleotide. Furthermore, we investigate the inhibition mechanism of the triphosphate metabolite of remdesivir through structural and kinetic analyses. A transition model from the nsp7-nsp8 hexadecameric primase complex to the nsp12-nsp7-nsp8 polymerase complex is also proposed to provide clues for the understanding of the coronavirus transcription and replication machinery.","output":"Structural Basis for RNA Replication by the SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RNA interference (RNAi), also known as gene silencing, is a biological process that prevents gene expression in certain diseases such as cancer. It can be used to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of treatments, particularly genetic therapies. However, challenges such as delivery of oligonucleotide drug to less accessible parts of the body and the high incidence of toxic side effects are encountered. It is therefore imperative to improve their delivery to target sites and reduce their harmful effects on noncancerous cells to harness their full potential. In this study, the role of RNAi in the treatment of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus disease plaguing many countries, has been discussed. This review aims to ascertain the mechanism and application of RNAi and explore the current challenges of RNAi therapy by identifying some of the cancer delivery systems and providing drug information for their improvement. It is worth mentioning that delivery systems such as lipid-based delivery systems and exosomes have revolutionized RNAi therapy by reducing their immunogenicity and improving their cellular affinity.

The aim of this study was to define the distribution of lymph node metastases and relation to the radiation field in patients following nCRTx and esophagectomy. METHODS Between April 2014 and August 2015 esophageal adenocarcinoma patients undergoing transthoracic esophagectomy with 2-field lymphadenectomy following nCRTx were included in this prospective observational study. Lymph node stations according to AJCC 7 were separately investigated. The location of lymph node metastases in relation to the radiation field was determined. The primary endpoint was the distribution of lymph node metastases and relation to the radiation field, the secondary endpoints were high-risk stations and risk factors for lymph node metastases and relation to survival. RESULTS Fifty consecutive patients were included. Lymph node metastases were found in 60% of patients and most frequently observed in paraesophageal (28%), left gastric artery (24%), and celiac trunk (18%) stations. Fifty-two percent had lymph node metastases within the radiation field. The incidence of lymph node metastases correlated significantly with ypT-stage (p = 0.002), cT-stage (p = 0.005), lymph angioinvasion (p = 0.004), and Mandard (p = 0.002). The number of lymph node metastases was associated with survival in univariable analysis (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.068-1.173, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Esophageal adenocarcinoma frequently metastasizes to both the mediastinal and abdominal lymph node stations. In this study, more than half of the patients had lymph node metastases within the radiation field. nCRTx is therefore not a reason to minimize lymphadenectomy in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma.","output":"Distribution of lymph node metastases in esophageal adenocarcinoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy: a prospective study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique challenges for the clinical trial community, both in the rapid establishment of COVID-19 clinical trials and many existing non-COVID-19 studies either being temporarily paused (whether that is a complete pause or pause in some activities) and/or adapting their processes. Trial managers have played a key role in decision-making, undertaking risk assessments and adapting trial processes, working closely with other members of the research team. This article presents some of the ways in which trial management processes have been altered and the key role that trial managers have played. It has been born out of discussions between trial managers in the UK who are members of the UK Trial Managers' Network (UKTMN), a national network of trial management professionals managing non-commercial trials.In these unprecedented times, clinical trials have faced many uncertainties and broad-ranging challenges encompassing a range of activities including prioritising patient safety amidst the pandemic, consenting and recruiting new participants into trials, data collection and management and intervention delivery. In many cases, recruitment has been paused whilst mitigations have been put in place to continue data collection. Innovative solutions have been implemented to ensure we continue, where possible, to deliver high-quality clinical trials. Technology has provided many solutions to these challenges, and trial managers have adapted to new ways of working whilst continuing to deliver their clinical trials. Trial management groups are now faced with new uncertainties around re-starting clinical trials, and it is unclear currently how this will go, though working together with sponsors, funders and site teams is clearly a priority.Clinical trial teams have worked together to ensure their trials have adapted quickly whilst ensuring participant safety is given utmost importance.

In the second step, the implants were used in the 6 eyes of 6 patients with end-stage glaucoma with uncontrolled IOP and poor visual acuity. The tube was made of two-layer of PTFE membrane measuring 8 * 6 mm with a thickness of 1.8 mm and a silicone tube. The rabbits and the human eyes underwent surgical implantation of the tube in the anterior chamber. The histopathologic evaluation was done using H&E staining. Visual acuity, intraocular pressure and the number of glaucoma medications were assessed before and after the surgery. Results: In the histopathologic evaluation, subconjunctival polarizing fibers of a synthetic mesh infiltrated by fibrovascular septa was seen. A granulomatous inflammatory reaction composed of histiocytes, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells were seen around and between the synthetic bundles. The average age of patients was 63  5.5 years. The mean IOP reached from 36.6  5.7 mmHg at baseline to 16.2  8.9 mmHg at the final follow-up. Patients were followed for an average of 6.6  4.5 months.

When the virus was formally identified as Ebola, epidemiologists started to investigate the chains of transmission, while local people were trying to make sense out of these deaths. The epidemic control measures taken by national and international health agencies were soon faced by strong reluctance and a sometimes aggressive attitude of the affected communities. Based on ethnographic work in Macenta (Forest region) in the autumn of 2014 for the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN) of the World Health Organization, this chapter shows that while epidemiologists involved in the outbreak response attributed the first Ebola deaths in the Forest region to the transmission of a virus from an unknown animal reservoir, local citizens believed these deaths were caused by the breach of a taboo. Epidemiological and popular explanations, mainly evolving in parallel, but sometimes overlapping, were driven by different explanatory models: a biomedical model embodying nature in the guise of an animal disease reservoir, which in turn poses as threat to humanity, and a traditional-religious model wherein nature and culture are not dichotomized. The chapter will argue that epidemic responses must be flexible and need to systematically document popular discourse(s), rumours, codes, practices, knowledge and opinions related to the outbreak event. This precious information must be used not only to shape and adapt control interventions and health promotion messages, but also to trace the complex biosocial dynamics of such zoonotic disease beyond the usual narrow focus on wild animals as the sources of infection.","output":"Contesting the (Super)Natural Origins of Ebola in Macenta, Guinea: Biomedical and Popular Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Diarrhea in the pediatric solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipient is a frequent complaint that is associated with significant morbidity and impaired quality of life.

METHOD: Participants included patient-family caregiver dyads who were enrolled in ongoing yoga trials and 2 certified yoga therapists who delivered the yoga sessions. We summarized their experiences using recordings of the yoga sessions and interventionists' progress notes. RESULTS: Out of 7 dyads participating in the parent trial, 1 declined the videoconferenced sessions. Participants were between the ages of 55 and 76 and mostly non-Hispanic White (83%). Patients were mainly male (83%), all had stage III or IV cancer and were undergoing radiotherapy. Caregivers were all female. Despite challenges in the areas of technology, location, and setting, instruction and personal connection, the overall acceptability was high among patients, caregivers, and instructors. Through this transition process, solutions to these challenges were found, which are described here. CONCLUSION: Although in-person interventions are favored by both the study participants and the interventionists, videoconference sessions were deemed acceptable. All participants had the benefit of a previous in-person experience, which was helpful and perhaps necessary for older and advanced cancer patients requiring practice modifications.

Although health systems adopted protocols that addressed pregnant women and their neonates during the pandemic, limited research has assessed the validity of Apgar scores for determining neonatal conditions in the context of COVID-19. Therefore, this scoping review was conducted on the first 2 years of the pandemic and included mothers with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 and their resulting positive or negative neonates. In total, 1,966 articles were assessed for eligibility, yielding 246 articles describing 663 neonates. Neonates who tested negative had median Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 mins, respectively, while test-positive neonates had median Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at the same time points. The proportions of test-negative neonates with Apgar scores below 7 were 29 (4%) and 11 (2%) at 1 and 5 mins, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.327, (2) = 0.961).

Severe COVID-19 is characterized by dysregulated cytokine release profile, dysfunctional immune responses, and hypercoagulation with a high risk of progression to multi-organ failure and death. Unraveling the fundamental immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and design of more effective therapeutic interventions for individuals at the highest risk of severe outcomes.

Research suggests SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to the function of multiple caspases, both mechanistically in vitro as well as in observational studies of individuals with severe COVID-19, which may further the impact on disease severity. We also highlight immunological mechanisms that occur in severe COVID-19 pathology upstream and downstream of activated caspase pathways, including innate recognition receptor signaling, inflammasomes, and other multiprotein complex assembly, inflammatory mediators IL-1 and IL-18, and apoptotic and pyroptotic cell death.

Because of their richness and complexity, they have great potential as medicinal remedies and biological exploratory probes. Unfortunately, such toxins are still at the preclinical and clinical stages of development. Phytoplankton toxins are harmful to other organisms and are hazardous to animals and human health. However, they may be effective as therapeutic pharmacological agents for numerous disorders, including dyslipidemia, obesity, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. In this review, we have focused on the properties of different toxins produced by phytoplankton, as well as their beneficial effects and potential biomedical applications. The anticancer properties exhibited by phytoplankton toxins are mainly attributed to their apoptotic effects.

We compared Mepilex Ag (M), a silver-impregnated foam dressing, and Suprathel (S), a DL-lactid acid polymer, in the outpatient treatment of partial-thickness burns in pediatric and adult patients. Patients were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial. We monitored time to reepithelialization, wound pain, discomfort during dressing changes, and treatment cost. Objective scar characteristics (elasticity, transepidermal water loss, hydration, and pigmentation) and subjective assessments (Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale) were measured at 1 month post burn. Data are presented as mean  SEM, and significance was accepted at P < 0.05. Sixty-two patients (S n = 32; M n = 30) were enrolled; age, sex, and burn size were comparable between the groups. Time to reepithelialization was not different between the groups (12 days; P = 0.75). Pain ratings were significantly reduced during the first 5 days after burn in the Suprathel group in all patients (P = 0.03) and a pediatric subgroup (P < 0.001). Viscolelasticity of burned skin was elevated compared with unburned skin in the Mepilex Ag group at 1 month post burn. Patients treated with Suprathel reported better overall scar quality (S: 2; M: 4.5; P < 0.001). The cost of treatment per square centimeter for Mepilex Ag was considerably lower than that of Suprathel. Both dressings are feasible and efficacious for the outpatient treatment of minor and selected moderate partial-thickness burns.

RESULTS Comparison of 113 open versus 103 laparoscopic colorectal surgeries for various indications and short-term outcomes was made. There was an expected overall increase in the laparoscopic colorectal resections. The mean age was 73 years for open and 68 years for laparoscopic surgeries. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to age, sex, and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists. Of the 103 patients who were initially treated with laparoscopy-assisted colectomy, 12 (11.7%) were shifted to open procedures. Perioperative recovery was faster in the laparoscopic-surgery group than in the open-colectomy group, as reflected by a shorter hospital stay (median, 8 vs. 13 d). The overall complication rate was significantly less in the laparoscopy-assisted colectomy group than in the open-colectomy group (33% vs. 46%, P=0.05).

METHODS: This online survey study investigated mental health, subjective experience, and behaviour (health, learning/teaching) among university students studying in Egypt or Germany shortly after the first pandemic lockdown in May 2020. Psychological assessment included stable personality traits, self-concept and state-like psychological variables related to (a) mental health (depression, anxiety), (b) pandemic threat perception (feelings during the pandemic, perceived difficulties in describing, identifying, expressing emotions), (c) health (e.g., worries about health, bodily symptoms) and behaviour including perceived difficulties in learning. Assessment methods comprised self-report questions, standardized psychological scales, psychological questionnaires, and linguistic self-report measures. Data analysis comprised descriptive analysis of mental health, linguistic analysis of self-concept, personality and feelings, as well as correlational analysis and machine learning. N = 220 (107 women, 112 men, 1 = other) studying in Egypt or Germany provided answers to all psychological questionnaires and survey items. RESULTS: Mean state and trait anxiety scores were significantly above the cut off scores that distinguish between high versus low anxious subjects. Depressive symptoms were reported by 51.82% of the student sample, the mean score was significantly above the screening cut off score for risk of depression. Worries about health (mental and physical health) and perceived difficulties in identifying feelings, and difficulties in learning behaviour relative to before the pandemic were also significant. No negative self-concept was found in the linguistic descriptions of the participants, whereas linguistic descriptions of feelings during the pandemic revealed a negativity bias in emotion perception. Machine learning (exploratory) predicted personality from the self-report data suggesting relations between personality and subjective experience that were not captured by descriptive or correlative data analytics alone. CONCLUSION: Despite small sample sizes, this multimethod survey provides important insight into mental health of university students studying in Egypt or Germany and how they perceived the first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in May 2020. The results should be continued with larger samples to help develop psychological interventions that support university students across countries and cultures to stay psychologically resilient during the pandemic.

Recently, TXA has gained interest in isolated traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with variable results. There are limited data on TXA in polytrauma with associated TBI. This study investigated the role of TXA in severely injured patients with associated severe TBI. METHODS: A 7.5-year prospective cohort study was performed to investigate the relation between prehospital TXA and mortality in consecutive trauma patients with associated severe TBI (Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)head  3) admitted to a Level-1 Trauma Center ICU. Indication for prehospital TXA administration was (suspicion of) hemorrhagic shock, and/or systolic blood pressure (SBP)  90 mmHg. Demographics, data on physiology, resuscitation, and outcomes were prospectively collected. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-four patients (67% males) with median age of 49 years and ISS 33 (98% blunt injuries) were included. Thirteen patients (6%) developed thromboembolic complications; mortality rate was 24%. Fifty-one percent of patients received prehospital TXA. TXA patients were younger, had more deranged physiology on arrival, and received more crystalloids and blood products  24 h. There was, however, no difference in overall outcome between TXA patients and no-TXA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having a more deranged physiology TXA patients had similar outcome compared to no-TXA patients who were much older. Thromboembolic complication rate was low.

In this context, remote sensing and Earth Observation (EO) approaches can help to monitor damages and local conditions before and after extreme weather events, such as flooding. Recently, the increasing availability of Google Street View (GSV) coverage offers additional potential ways to assess the vulnerability and resilience to such events. GSV is available at no cost, is easy to use, and is available for an increasing number of locations. This exploratory research focuses on the use of GSV and EO data to assess exposure, sensitivity, and adaptation to flooding in urban areas in the cities of Belem and Rio Branco in the Amazon region of Brazil. We present a Visual Indicator Framework for Resilience (VIFOR) to measure 45 indicators for these characteristics in 1 km2 sample areas in poor and richer districts in the two cities. The aim was to assess critically the extent to which GSV-derived information could be reliable in measuring the proposed indicators and how this new methodology could be used to measure vulnerability and resilience where official census data and statistics are not readily available. Our results show that variation in vulnerability and resilience between the rich and poor areas in both cities could be demonstrated through calibration of the chosen indicators using GSV-derived data, suggesting that this is a useful, complementary and cost-effective addition to census data and/or recent high resolution EO data. Furthermore, the GSV-linked approach used here may assist users who lack the technical skills to process raw EO data into usable information. The ready availability of insights on the vulnerability and resilience of diverse urban areas by straightforward remote sensing methods such as those developed here with GSV can provide valuable evidence for decisions on critical infrastructure investments in areas with low capacity to cope with flooding.","output":"Assessing Urban Vulnerability to Flooding: A Framework to Measure Resilience Using Remote Sensing Approaches"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: NHS Highland covers a wide geographical region encompassing the Isle of Skye, and Ben Nevis. Tourism is a significant contributor to the local economy and in 2017 the Highlands welcomed 534,000 visitors. Health services across the region treat tourists in addition to the local population. We investigated how many tourists accessed the Trauma and Orthopaedic (T&O) Department at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study with data collected over one year (2017). The number of tourists referred to T&O including patient demographics, country of origin, type of injury and their clinical outcome were recorded. A freedom of information (FOI) request to NHS Highland was sought to investigate associated costs incurred by tourists. RESULTS: 376 tourists accessed T&O services in 2017. Country of origin: 47 (12.5%) Scotland; 177 (47.1%) rest of UK; 74 (19.7%) EU; 45 (12.0%) non-EU. Highest referral month August (61), lowest referral month November (8). Injuries: 224 (59.6%) fracture; 62 (16.5%) soft tissue injury; 20 (5.3%) laceration. Commonest sites of injury were ankle, distal radius and finger.

It is especially deleterious in organs with space constraints such as lung and the CNS. Indeed, a number of viruses that infect lungs, such as avian influenza virus, SARS-associated coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, elicit a very high level of proinflammatory cytokines; however, it is unclear what triggers their production. In this study, we show that IL-17 commonly produced during viral infection specifically augments a proinflammatory response by directly synergizing with antiviral signaling. Costimulation of primary human fibroblasts with IL-17 greatly enhanced respiratory syncytial virus-induced or synthetic dsRNA-based viral mimic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid-induced expression of proinflammatory genes without affecting expression of IFN--stimulated or IFN-stimulated genes. Knockdown of expression of known mediators of the antiviral signaling pathway revealed that the IL-17-poly(I:C) synergy depends on the presence of the transcriptional factors RelA and IFN regulatory factor 3 and IB kinases. Moreover, this synergy was blocked by an IB kinase inhibitor, BAY 11-7082.

In summary, these results confirm the previously observed subjective symptomatology trends, and for the first time show that objectively measured cardiovascular and sleep parameters are altered the night after vaccination. Moreover, these results suggest that the response may be different between vaccine manufacturers and may be modified by age and larger after the second dose.

Basic science and clinical faculty were surveyed on factors impacting their motivation to teach using validated scales of motivation as well as open-ended questions which were coded using self-determination theory (SDT) as a guiding framework. RESULTS: Faculty reported that teaching activities often meet their basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Professors were more likely than associate professors to report that teaching met their need for autonomy. Faculty were more motivated by intrinsic as compared to external factors, although basic science faculty were more likely than clinical faculty to be motivated by external factors. Motivating and de-motivating factors fell into the themes Resources, Recognition and Rewards, Student Factors, Self-Efficacy, Curriculum, Contribution, and Enjoyment. The majority of factors tied to the facultys need for relatedness. Based on these findings, a conceptual model for understanding medical school faculty motivation to teach was developed. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing faculty motivation to teach provided valuable insights into how faculty relate to their teaching roles and what factors influence them to continue in those roles. This information may be useful in guiding future faculty development and research efforts.

Indian Armed Forces launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on 16 Jan 2021. This study evaluated the effect of vaccination on mortality amongst hospitalized COVID patients. METHODS: A cross sectional study was done on all admitted moderate to severe COVID-19 patients at a designated COVID hospital in New Delhi. The primary outcome assessed the association of being fully vaccinated with mortality. Unadjusted odds ratios (OR) (with 95% CI) was performed for each predictor. Logistic regression was used for multivariable analysis and adjusted odds ratios obtained. RESULTS: The 1168 patients included in the study had a male preponderance with a mean age of 54.6 ( 17.51) years. A total of 266 (23%) patients were partially vaccinated with COVISHIELD? and 184 (16%) were fully vaccinated. Overall, 518 (44.3%) patients had comorbidities and 332 (28.4%) died. Among those fully vaccinated, there was 12.5% (23/184) mortality while it was 31.45 % (309/984) among the unvaccinated (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.5, p<0.0001). In a logistic regression model, complete vaccination status and younger age were found to be associated with survival.

SARS-CoV2 is an enveloped virus and E proteins present in them are reported to form ion channels, which is mainly associated with pathogenesis. Thus, there is always a quest to inhibit these ion channels, which in turn may help in controlling diseases caused by SARS-CoV2 in humans. Considering this, in the present study, authors employed computational approaches for studying the structure as well as function of the human 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein as well as its interaction with various phytochemicals. Result obtained revealed that &#945;-helix and loops present in this protein experience random movement under optimal condition, which in turn modulate ion channel activity; thereby aiding the pathogenesis caused via SARS-CoV2 in human and other vertebrates. However, after binding with Belachinal, Macaflavanone E, and Vibsanol B, the random motion of the human 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein gets reduced, this, in turn, inhibits the function of the 'SARS-CoV2 E' protein. It is pertinent to note that two amino acids, namely VAL25 and PHE26, play a key role while interacting with these three phytochemicals. As these three phytochemicals, namely, Belachinal, Macaflavanone E & Vibsanol B, have passed the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity) property as well as 'Lipinski's Rule of 5s', they may be utilized as drugs in controlling disease caused via SARS-COV2, after further investigation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We conducted a cross-sectional survey to quantify and characterize non-household contact and to identify the effect of shielding and isolating on contact patterns. Methods Through an online questionnaire, the CoCoNet study measured daily interactions and mobility of 5143 participants between 28 July and 14 August 2020. Negative binomial regression modelling identified participant characteristics associated with contact rates. Results The mean rate of non-household contacts per person was 2.9 d-1. Participants attending a workplace (adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR) 3.33, 95%CI 3.02 to 3.66), self-employed (aIRR 1.63, 95%CI 1.43 to 1.87) or working in healthcare (aIRR 5.10, 95%CI 4.29 to 6.10) reported significantly higher non-household contact rates than those working from home. Participants self-isolating as a precaution or following Test and Trace instructions had a lower non-household contact rate than those not self-isolating (aIRR 0.58, 95%CI 0.43 to 0.79). We found limited evidence that those shielding had reduced non-household contacts compared to non-shielders. Conclusion The daily rate of non-household interactions remains lower than pre-pandemic levels, suggesting continued adherence to social distancing guidelines. Individuals attending a workplace in-person or employed as healthcare professionals were less likely to maintain social distance and had a higher non-household contact rate, possibly increasing their infection risk.

We aimed to determine whether serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels measured with a highly sensitive assay [high sensitivity cTnT (HS-cTnT)] may predict cardiovascular events (CVEs) in SLE. METHOD All SLE patients included between 2007 and 2010 in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre PLUS trial were screened. Patients with no past history of CVE at inclusion and a follow-up period of >20 months were analysed. HS-cTnT concentration was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method on serum collected at PLUS inclusion. The primary outcome was the incident CVE. Factors associated with the primary outcome were identified and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS Overall, 442 SLE patients (of the 573 included in the PLUS study) were analysed for the primary outcome with a median follow up of 110 (interquartile range: 99-120) months. Among them, 29 (6.6%) experienced at least one CVE that occurred at a median of 67 (interquartile range: 31-91) months after inclusion. Six out of 29 patients had more than one CVE. In the multivariate analysis, dyslipidaemia, age and HS-cTnT were associated with the occurrence of CVE. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a concentration of HS-cTnT > 4.27 ng/l at inclusion increased by 2.7 [hazard ratio 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3, 5.6), P =0.0083] the risk of CVE in SLE.

Low cost, high throughput, easy quantitation, and rich descriptions have made gene expression profiling generated by DNA microarrays an optimal approach for describing host transcriptional responses (HTRs). However, efforts to characterize the landscape of HTRs to diverse pathogens are far from offering a comprehensive view. Here, we developed an HTR Connectivity Map based on systematic assessment of pairwise similarities of HTRs to 50 clinically important human pathogens using 1353 gene-expression profiles generated from >60 human cells/tissues. These 50 pathogens were further partitioned into eight robust HTR communities (i.e., groups with more consensus internal HTR similarities). These communities showed enrichment in specific infection attributes and differential gene expression patterns. Using query signatures of HTRs to external pathogens, we demonstrated four distinct modes of HTR associations among different pathogens types/class, and validated the reliability of the HTR community divisions for differentiating and categorizing pathogens from a host-oriented perspective. These findings provide a first-generation HTR Connectivity Map of 50 diverse pathogens, and demonstrate the potential for using annotated HTR community to detect functional associations among infectious pathogens.","output":"Inferring Infection Patterns Based on a Connectivity Map of Host Transcriptional Responses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the economics of Africa's emerging air cargo supply chains, taking floriculture as a case study. Floriculture is an important employer, and earner of foreign exchange for several regions of central/southern and eastern Africa including more recently Ethiopia. Air transportation often plays a critical role when the supply-chain involves high-value, non-durable, relatively light-weight, and compact consignments such as flowers, and geographically when regions are difficult to access by other trunk modes. The success of air cargo chains, however, depend as much on the quality of surface modes serving various last mile access and egress functions, as well as efficient nodal interchange points and the availability of suitable airport and airline capacity. The last, because of the important role of belly-hold space, includes consideration of passenger as well as cargo specific services. To meet the needs of Africa's floriculture sector, a variety of supply-chain models have emerged that embrace air and surface links, as well as storage at various points in the chain.

SSIM is one of the most popular image quality metrics in use in the medical image synthesis community because of its alleged superiority over voxel-by-voxel measurements like the average error or the peak signal noise ratio (PSNR). It has seen massive adoption since its introduction, but its limitations are often overlooked. Notably, SSIM is designed to work on a strictly positive intensity scale, which is generally not the case in medical imaging. Common intensity scales such as the Houndsfield units (HU) contain negative numbers, and they can also be introduced by image normalization techniques such as the z-normalization. METHODS We created a series of experiments to quantify the impact of negative values in the SSIM computation. Specifically, we trained a 3D U-Net to synthesize T2 weighted MRI from T1 weighted MRI using the BRATS 2018 dataset. SSIM was computed on the synthetic images with a shifted dynamic range. Next, to evaluate the suitability of SSIM as a loss function on images with negative values, it was used as a loss function to synthesize z-normalized images. Finally, the difference between 2D SSIM and 3D SSIM was investigated using multiple 2D U-Nets trained on different planes of the images. RESULTS The impact of the misuse of the SSIM was quantified; it was established that it introduces a large downward bias in the computed SSIM. It also introduces a small random error that can change the relative ranking of models. The exact values for this bias and error depend on the quality and the intensity histogram of the synthetic images. Although small, the reported error is significant considering the small SSIM difference between state-of-the-art models. It was shown therefore that SSIM cannot be used as a loss function when images contain negative values due to major errors in the gradient calculation, resulting in under-performing models. 2D SSIM was also found to be overestimated in 2D image synthesis models when computed along the plane of synthesis, due to the discontinuities between slices that is typical of 2D synthesis methods. CONCLUSION Various types of misuse of the SSIM were identified and their impact was quantified. Based on the findings, this paper proposes good practices when using SSIM, such as reporting the average over the volume of the image containing tissue and appropriately defining the dynamic range.

Although most infections resolve without clinical sequalae, persistent HPV infection can cause cervical, other anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers and anogenital warts. HPV vaccination has been recommended in the United States at age 11-12 years since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males. Catch-up vaccination is recommended through age 26 years.* A quadrivalent vaccine (4vHPV) targeting types 6, 11, 16, and 18 was mainly used until 2015, when a 9-valent vaccine (9vHPV), targeting the same four types as 4vHPV and five additional types (31, 33, 45, 52, and 58), was introduced; 9vHPV has been the only vaccine available in the United States since the end of 2016 (2). HPV vaccination coverage has increased but remains lower than that of other vaccinations recommended for adolescents (3). A decrease in prevalence of 4vHPV types detected in cervicovaginal swabs among young females from the prevaccine era (2003-2006) to 2007-2010 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was an early indicator of vaccine impact (2) and was also observed in later periods (4,5). NHANES data from 2017-2018 were included in this analysis to update HPV prevalence estimates among females aged 14-34 years. From the prevaccine era to 2015-2018, significant decreases in 4vHPV-type prevalence occurred among females aged 14-19 years (88%) and 20-24 years (81%). In sexually experienced females, 4vHPV-type prevalence decreased in those who reported receiving 1 HPV vaccine dose (97% among those aged 14-19 years, 86% among those aged 20-24 years) and in those who reported no vaccination (87% among those aged 14-19 years, 65% among those aged 20-24 years). Significant declines among unvaccinated females suggest herd effects. These data show increasing impact of HPV vaccination in the United States.

However, data show that only a small proportion of these patients utilise rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES First, to assess interventions provided to increase patient enrolment in, adherence to, and completion of cardiac rehabilitation. Second, to assess intervention costs and associated harms, as well as interventions intended to promote equitable CR utilisation in vulnerable patient subpopulations. SEARCH METHODS Review authors performed a search on 10 July 2018, to identify studies published since publication of the previous systematic review. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); the National Health Service (NHS) Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD) databases (Health Technology Assessment (HTA) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)), in the Cochrane Library (Wiley); MEDLINE (Ovid); Embase (Elsevier); the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost); and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S) on Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics). We checked the reference lists of relevant systematic reviews for additional studies and also searched two clinical trial registers. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with myocardial infarction, with angina, undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention, or with heart failure who were eligible for cardiac rehabilitation. Interventions had to aim to increase utilisation of comprehensive phase II cardiac rehabilitation. We included only studies that measured one or more of our primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were harms and costs, and we focused on equity. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all identified references for eligibility, and we obtained full papers of potentially relevant trials. Two review authors independently considered these trials for inclusion, assessed included studies for risk of bias, and extracted trial data independently. We resolved disagreements through consultation with a third review author. We performed random-effects meta-regression for each outcome and explored prespecified study characteristics. MAIN RESULTS Overall, we included 26 studies with 5299 participants (29 comparisons). Participants were primarily male (64.2%). Ten (38.5%) studies included patients with heart failure. We assessed most studies as having low or unclear risk of bias. Sixteen studies (3164 participants) reported interventions to improve enrolment in cardiac rehabilitation, 11 studies (2319 participants) reported interventions to improve adherence to cardiac rehabilitation, and seven studies (1567 participants) reported interventions to increase programme completion. Researchers tested a variety of interventions to increase utilisation of cardiac rehabilitation. In many studies, this consisted of contacts made by a healthcare provider during or shortly after an acute care hospitalisation.Low-quality evidence shows an effect of interventions on increasing programme enrolment (19 comparisons; risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 1.42). Meta-regression revealed that the intervention deliverer (nurse or allied healthcare provider; P = 0.02) and the delivery format (face-to-face; P = 0.01) were influential in increasing enrolment. Low-quality evidence shows interventions to increase adherence were effective (nine comparisons; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.38, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.55), particularly when they were delivered remotely, such as in home-based programs (SMD 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76). Moderate-quality evidence shows interventions to increase programme completion were also effective (eight comparisons; RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25), but those applied in multi-centre studies were less effective than those given in single-centre studies, leading to questions regarding generalisability. A moderate level of statistical heterogeneity across intervention studies reflects heterogeneity in intervention approaches. There was no evidence of small-study bias for enrolment (insufficient studies to test for this in the other outcomes).With regard to secondary outcomes, no studies reported on harms associated with the interventions. Only two studies reported costs. In terms of equity, trialists tested interventions designed to improve utilisation among women and older patients. Evidence is insufficient for quantitative assessment of whether women-tailored programmes were associated with increased utilisation, and studies that assess motivating women are needed. For older participants, again while quantitative assessment could not be undertaken, peer navigation may improve enrolment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Interventions may increase cardiac rehabilitation enrolment, adherence and completion; however the quality of evidence was low to moderate due to heterogeneity of the interventions used, among other factors. Effects on enrolment were larger in studies targeting healthcare providers, training nurses, or allied healthcare providers to intervene face-to-face; effects on adherence were larger in studies that tested remote interventions. More research is needed, particularly to discover the best ways to increase programme completion.","output":"Interventions to promote patient utilisation of cardiac rehabilitation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, rapid diagnostics are paramount to contain the current pandemic. The routinely used realtime RT-PCR is sensitive, specific and able to process large batches of samples. However, turnaround time is long and in cases where fast obtained results are critical, molecular point of care tests (POCT) can be an alternative. Here we report on a multicenter evaluation of the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test. STUDY DESIGN: The Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay was evaluated against the routine in-house real-time RT-PCR assays in three medical microbiology laboratories in The Netherlands. A sensitivity and specificity panel was tested consisting of a dilution series of SARS-CoV-2 and ten samples containing SARS-CoV-2 and a range of other seasonal respiratory viruses. Additionally, 58 samples of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 with different viral loads and 30 tested negative samples in all three Dutch laboratories using an in-house RT-PCR, were evaluated using Cepheids Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges. RESULTS: Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 point of care test showed equal performance compared to routine in-house testing with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.26 copies/mL. Other seasonal respiratory viruses were not detected. In clinical samples Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 reaches an agreement of 100 % compared to all in-house RT-PCRs CONCLUSION: Cepheids GeneXpert Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 is a valuable addition for laboratories in situations where rapid and accurate diagnostics are of the essence.","output":"Multi-center evaluation of cepheid xpert? xpress SARS-CoV-2 point-of-care test during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The earliest immune responses activated in acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (AHI) exert a critical influence on subsequent virus spread or containment. During this time frame, components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs, NK cells, -defensins, complement and other anti-microbial factors, which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection, may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV-1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique plasma donor panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5C7 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA, considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore, a proteolytic fragment of alphaC1-antitrypsin (AAT), termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP), was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma levels indicated that circulating concentrations are likely to be within the range of their inhibitory activity. Our results provide evidence for a first wave of host anti-viral defense occurring in the eclipse phase of AHI prior to systemic activation of other immune responses. Insights gained into the mechanism of action of acute-phase reactants and other innate molecules against HIV and how they are induced could be exploited for the future development of more efficient prophylactic vaccine strategies.","output":"Elevation of Intact and Proteolytic Fragments of Acute Phase Proteins Constitutes the Earliest Systemic Antiviral Response in HIV-1 Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Steven Soderberghs Contagion (2011) positions the vaccine as the end point of the arc of ?pandemic, marking both the containment of an elusive virus and ?the resumption of a life not fundamentally different from ?before the disease outbreak. ?The film reinforces the ?assumption that a pandemic will awaken ?all of us to the urgency of vaccination?, persuading us to put aside our reservations and anxieties ?and the idea that compliance is the inevitable outcome of quarantine.

Typically, SPMs are thought to be formed via consecutive steps of oxidation of polyenoic fatty acids such as arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid or docosahexaenoic acid. One hallmark of SPM formation is that reported levels of these lipid mediators are much lower than typical pro-inflammatory mediators including the monohydroxylated fatty acid derivatives (e.g., 5-HETE), leukotrienes or certain cyclooxygenase-derived prostaglandins. Thus, reliable detection and quantification of these metabolites is challenging. This paper is aimed at critically evaluating i) the proposed biosynthetic pathways of SPM formation, ii) the current knowledge on SPM receptors and their signaling cascades and iii) the analytical methods used to quantify these pro-resolving mediators in the context of their instability and their low concentrations. Based on current literature it can be concluded that i) there is at most, a low biosynthetic capacity for SPMs in human leukocytes. ii) The identity and the signaling of the proposed G-protein-coupled SPM receptors have not been supported by studies in knock-out mice and remain to be validated. iii) In humans, SPM levels were neither related to dietary supplementation with their -3 polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors nor were they formed during the resolution phase of an evoked inflammatory response. iv) The reported low SPM levels cannot be reliably quantified by means of the most commonly reported methodology.

The active form of remdesivir acts as a nucleoside analog and inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir is incorporated by the RdRp into the growing RNA product and allows for addition of three more nucleotides before RNA synthesis stalls. Here we use synthetic RNA chemistry, biochemistry and cryo-electron microscopy to establish the molecular mechanism of remdesivir-induced RdRp stalling. We show that addition of the fourth nucleotide following remdesivir incorporation into the RNA product is impaired by a barrier to further RNA translocation. This translocation barrier causes retention of the RNA 3?-nucleotide in the substrate-binding site of the RdRp and interferes with entry of the next nucleoside triphosphate, thereby stalling RdRp. In the structure of the remdesivir-stalled state, the 3?-nucleotide of the RNA product is matched and located with the template base in the active center, and this may impair proofreading by the viral 3?-exonuclease.

The N protein partitioned into SGs through liquid-liquid phase separation with G3BP, and blocked the interaction of G3BP1 with other SG-related proteins. Moreover, the N protein domains important for phase separation with G3BP and SG disassembly were required for SARS-CoV-2 viral production.

However, an optimal cardiac biomarker for predicting COVID-19 prognosis has not been identified. Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched for published articles between December 1, 2019 and September 8, 2021. Eligible studies that examined the anomalies of different cardiac biomarkers in patients with COVID-19 were included. The prevalence and odds ratios (ORs) were extracted. Summary estimates and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were obtained through meta-analyses. Results: A total of 63 studies, with 64,319 patients with COVID-19, were enrolled in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and myoglobin (Mb) in the general population with COVID-19 was 22.9 (19C27%) and 13.5% (10.6C16.4%), respectively. However, the presence of elevated Mb was more common than elevated cTnI in patients with severe COVID-19 [37.7 (23.3C52.1%) vs.30.7% (24.7C37.1%)]. Moreover, compared with cTnI, the elevation of Mb also demonstrated tendency of higher correlation with case-severity rate (Mb, r = 13.9 vs. cTnI, r = 3.93) and case-fatality rate (Mb, r = 15.42 vs. cTnI, r = 3.04). Notably, elevated Mb level was also associated with higher odds of severe illness [Mb, OR = 13.75 (10.2C18.54) vs. cTnI, OR = 7.06 (3.94C12.65)] and mortality [Mb, OR = 13.49 (9.3C19.58) vs. cTnI, OR = 7.75 (4.4C13.66)] than cTnI. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 and elevated Mb levels are at significantly higher risk of severe disease and mortality. Elevation of Mb may serve as a marker for predicting COVID-19-related adverse outcomes.

Evaluating ICU care, and what is effective in improving outcomes for these patients is critical. Care bundles, a small set of evidence-based interventions, delivered together consistently, may improve patient outcomes. To identify the extent of the available evidence on the use of care bundles in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, the World Health Organization (WHO) commissioned a scoping review to inform WHO guideline discussions. This review does not assess the effectiveness of the findings, assess risk of bias, or assess the certainty of the evidence (GRADE). As this review was commissioned to inform guideline discussions, it was done rapidly over a three-week period from 26 October to 18 November 2020. OBJECTIVES To identify and describe the available evidence on the use of care bundles in the ICU for patients with COVID-19 or related conditions (acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) viral pneumonia or pneumonitis), or both. In carrying out the review the focus was on characterising the evidence base and not evaluating the effectiveness or safety of the care bundles or their component parts. SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 26 October 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Studies of all designs that reported on patients who are critically ill with COVID-19, ARDS, viral pneumonia or pneumonitis, in the ICU setting, where a care bundle was implemented in providing care, were eligible for inclusion. One review author (VS) screened all records on title and abstract. A second review author (DR) checked 20% of excluded and included records; agreement was 99.4% and 100% respectively on exclude/include decisions. Two review authors (VS and DR) independently screened all records at full-text level. VS and DR resolved any disagreements through discussion and consensus, or referral to a third review author (AN) as required. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author (VS) extracted the data and a second review author (DR) checked 20% of this for accuracy. As the review was not designed to synthesise effectiveness data, assess risk of bias, or characterise the certainty of the evidence (GRADE), we mapped the extracted data and presented them in tabular format based on the patient condition; that is patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, patients with ARDS, patients with any influenza or viral pneumonia, patients with severe respiratory failure, and patients with mixed conditions. We have also provided a narrative summary of the findings from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS We included 21 studies and identified three ongoing studies. The studies were of variable designs and included a systematic review of standardised approaches to caring for critically ill patients in ICU, including but not exclusive to care bundles (1 study), a randomised trial (1 study), prospective and retrospective cohort studies (4 studies), before and after studies (7 studies), observational quality improvement reports (4 studies), case series/case reports (3 studies) and audit (1 study). The studies were conducted in eight countries, most commonly China (5 studies) and the USA (4 studies), were published between 1999 and 2020, and involved over 2000 participants in total. Studies categorised participant conditions patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (7 studies), patients with ARDS (7 studies), patients with another influenza or viral pneumonia (5 studies), patients with severe respiratory failure (1 study), and patients with mixed conditions (1 study). The care bundles described in the studies involved multiple diverse practices. Guidance on ventilator settings (10 studies), restrictive fluid management (8 studies), sedation (7 studies) and prone positioning (7 studies) were identified most frequently, while only one study mentioned chest X-ray. None of the included studies reported the prespecified outcomes ICU-acquired weakness (muscle wasting, weight loss) and users' experience adapting care bundles. Of the remaining prespecified outcomes, 14 studies reported death in ICU, nine reported days of ventilation (or ventilator-free days), nine reported length of stay in ICU in days, five reported death in hospital, three reported length of stay in hospital in days, and three reported adherence to the bundle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS This scoping review has identified 21 studies on care bundle use in critically ill patients in ICU with COVID-19, ARDS, viral influenza or pneumonia and severe respiratory failure. The data for patients with COVID-19 specifically are limited, derived mainly from observational quality improvement or clinical experiential accounts. Research is required, urgently, to further assess care bundle use and optimal components of these bundles in this patient cohort. The care bundles described were also varied, with guidance on ventilator settings described in 10 care bundles, while chest X-ray was part mentioned in one care bundle in one study only. None of the studies identified in this scoping review measured users' experience of adapting care bundles. Optimising care bundle implementation requires that the components of the care bundle are collectively and consistently applied. Data on challenges, barriers and facilitators to implementation are needed. A formal synthesis of the outcome data presented in this review and a critical appraisal of the evidence is required by a subsequent effectiveness review. This subsequent review should further explore effect estimates across the included studies.","output":"Care bundles for improving outcomes in patients with COVID-19 or related conditions in intensive care - a rapid scoping review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of baseline clinical and high resolution CT (HRCT) findings in patients with severe COVID-19.

STUDY DESIGN: ANSIRH's Abortion Facility Database is a systematic collection of data on all publicly-advertising abortion facilities in the United States, updated annually through online searches and mystery shopper phone calls. Research staff updated the database in May-August 2020, assessing the number of facilities that closed, limited or stopped providing abortions, and provided telehealth options in summer 2020 due to COVID-19. We describe these changes using frequencies and highlighting themes and examples from coded qualitative data. RESULTS: Located primarily in the South and Midwest, 24 of 751 facilities that were open in 2019 temporarily closed due to the pandemic, with 9 still closed by August 2020. Other facilities described suspending abortions, referring abortion patients to other facilities, or limiting services to medication abortion. While most facilities required in-person visits for reasons like state abortion restrictions, 22% (n = 150) offered phone or telehealth consultations, no-test visits, or medication abortion by mail to reduce or eliminate patient time in the clinic. Some facilities used creative strategies to reduce COVID-19 risk like allowing patients to wait for visits in their cars or offering drive-through medication pick-up. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic caused several disruptions to abortion service availability, including closures. To reduce in-person visit time, some clinics shifted to offering medication abortion (versus procedural) or telehealth. While the pandemic and abortion restrictions increased barriers to abortion provision, facilities were resilient and adapted to provide safe care for their patients. IMPLICATIONS: Barriers to abortion access were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in areas of the country with more restrictive policies toward abortion. Telehealth care protocols offered by many abortion facilities provide an option to reduce or eliminate in-person visits.","output":"Abortion service availability during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results from a national census of abortion facilities in the U.S."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The current investigation was conducted to test the correlation between fear due to coronavirus (COVID-19) and mental health outcomes (stress, depression, and anxiety) and the mediating role of social support during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Palestine.

METHODS We conducted a literature search in the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO (January 2008 through April 2019). The inclusion criteria were quantitative studies that included peer-to-peer use of social media for self-care of diabetes mellitus (with all subtypes) and CVD, including stroke. RESULTS After an initial yield of 3066 citations, we selected 91 articles for a full-text review and identified 7 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 studies focused on type 1 diabetes, 1 study included both type 1 and 2 diabetes, and 2 studies included multiple chronic conditions (eg, CVD, diabetes, depression, etc). Our search did not yield any individual studies on CVD alone. Among the selected papers, 2 studies used commercial platforms (Facebook and I Seek You), 3 studies used discussion forums developed specifically for each study, and 2 surveyed patients through different platforms or blogs. There was significant heterogeneity in the study designs, methodologies, and outcomes applied, but all studies showed favorable results on either primary or secondary outcomes. The quality of studies was highly variable. CONCLUSIONS The future landscape of social media use for patient self-care is promising. However, current use is nascent. Our extensive search yielded only 7 studies, all of which included diabetes, indicating the most interest and demand for peer-to-peer interaction on diabetes self-care. Future research is needed to establish efficacy and safety in recommending social media use among peers for diabetes self-care and other conditions.","output":"Patients' Use of Social Media for Diabetes Self-Care: Systematic Review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The compounded impact of the COVID-19 lockdowns on self-perception of health (SPoH) and physical activity (PA) levels among U.S. adults remains to be explored. We sought to: (1) describe the SPoH and PA levels among U.S. adults; (2) explore the relationship between SPoH and PA before and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from the 2019 and 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS). COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11th, 2020. This date was chosen to demarcate the responses as before and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Weighted prevalence estimates were presented alongside adjusted odds ratios from multivariable logistic regression of general SPoH and PA levels for U.S. adults before and amidst COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data for 9328 participants. Over half of the U.S. adult population reported performing no muscle strengthening exercise in 2019. The number of inactive people has slightly increased in 2020 (27.8%), compared to 2019 (26.5%). Overall, levels of PA for active people were comparable in 2020 pre and post the WHO pandemic declaration date (36.4% and 39.8%; respectively). Higher odds of negative SPoH were observed among black individuals, current cigarettes smokers, with annual income less than $35,000, physically inactive individuals, people who do not perform muscle-strengthening exercise, and who were very obese. Negative SPoH were associated with lack of moderate exercise, and lack of muscle-strengthening training among U.S. adults before and amidst the pandemic. Pandemic policies and recommendations should include and facilitate PA, specifically among vulnerable populations.","output":"Self-perception of health and physical activity among adults before and amidst the COVID-19 pandemic: United States, 2019C2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The delivery of care in the inpatient rehabilitation setting was disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a 150 bed freestanding inpatient rehabilitation facility in the epicenter of the pandemic, Burke Rehabilitation Hospital was required to increase overall bed capacity for regional overflow needs and still maintain our mission to provide inpatient rehabilitation for patients with and without COVID-19. During the period between March and September 2020, Burke Rehabilitation Hospital treated over 300 COVID-19 positive rehabilitation patients, and at one point had a census that was greater than 50% COVID-19 positive. A model grounded in five priorities: communication, personal protective equipment, clinical service delivery, discharge planning, and patient/staff support was implemented to re-prioritize daily operations and ensure patient and staff safety while providing valuable rehabilitation services. The delivery of physical, occupational, speech, and recreational therapy services transformed, and a number of innovative clinical practices were developed. During the study period, 100% of our patients continued to be scheduled to receive therapy services. Patient length of stay values did increase during the pandemic (from 16.38 to 19.93 days), and slightly more patients were discharged to home (68.7% compared to 68.3%). Despite modifications to rehabilitation care delivery, patients continued to make functional gains in the areas of self-care, mobility, and walking. Flexible leadership was pivotal in the development and implementation of new processes and procedures to meet the evolving needs of patients, staff, and the organization as a whole.","output":"A Retrospective Quality Improvement Study to Describe Operational Management Strategies in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility during the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Cyber security MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) can enable lifelong learning and increase the cyber security competence of experts and citizens.

Wandering through dreamy Europe made him aware of the attachment to the Russian homeland and revealed love and allusion of peace;he falls in love with Ana by dictating the text of the Gambler, which will provide them with bread and shelter in the days of losing the gambling luck and questionable existence. In his wandering through Europe as the land of holy wonders, Dostoevsky informs us through the confessions of the gambler Alexei about the temptations of the world addicted to the gambling table. The significance of divisive passions is questioned: those towards women, love and even more, gambling, destructive, demonic. In 27 days while he was presenting Ana with the thoughts of the main character of the Gambler, and she was recording them in a transcript, the writer was going through his own agony. The novel will see the light of day, but unlike Alexei, a character waiting for a new tomorrow to decide on ending a life driven by an unhealthy ad-dictive habit, Dostoevsky, after the novel ends, experiences catharsis and sails into economic security by taking royalties for this and subsequent novels. As when after a stormy night at sea, a sunny morning dawns, a hint of love, happiness and the desired family peace is prayed to the author. Ana will focus the writer, a gambler, on family life and caring for children, and abduct him from addiction by sailing with him to the next storm. The basic theme of the novel C the obsession with gambling C is the experience of Dostoevsky, a writer with a heart in which God and Satan fight, and the pledge is human life. In the days when in the hustle and bustle of mod-ern life, COVID-19, complete human alienation and escalation of violence we turn to the spiritual, looking for a way out in the metaphysical, surreal, healing and nurturing, and rational and explainable does not offer a final answer, someone seeks a way out of addiction and someone in a classic, something familiar and valuable.

Despite substantial economic development and scientific innovation, however, progress in addressing this global challenge has been inadequate. Paradoxically, the last half-century also saw the rapid emergence of obesity, first in high-income countries but now also in low- and middle-income countries. Traditionally, these problems were approached separately, but there is increasing recognition that they have common drivers and need integrated responses. The new nutrition reality comprises a global double burden of malnutrition, where the challenges of food insecurity, nutritional deficiencies and undernutrition coexist and interact with obesity, sedentary behaviour, unhealthy diets and environments that foster unhealthy behaviour. Beyond immediate efforts to prevent and treat malnutrition, what must change in order to reduce the future burden? Here, we present a conceptual framework that focuses on the deeper structural drivers of malnutrition embedded in society, and their interaction with biological mechanisms of appetite regulation and physiological homeostasis. Building on a review of malnutrition in past societies, our framework brings to the fore the power dynamics that characterise contemporary human food systems at many levels. We focus on the concept of agency, the ability of individuals or organisations to pursue their goals. In globalized food systems, the agency of individuals is directly confronted by the agency of several other types of actor, including corporations, governments and supranational institutions. The intakes of energy and nutrients by individuals are powerfully shaped by this competition of agency, and we therefore argue that the greatest opportunities to reduce malnutrition lie in rebalancing agency across the competing actors. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on food systems and individuals illustrates our conceptual framework. Efforts to improve agency must both drive and respond to complementary efforts to promote and maintain equitable societies and planetary health.","output":"The future of human malnutrition: rebalancing agency for better nutritional health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV-induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial.

Although Title VI of the OAA provides culturally responsive strategies to support elders through home- and community-based nutrition services, these programs have not been the subject of a national evaluation; our study is the first. METHODS We conducted a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of the Title VI programs on elders. We used quantitative data from a national survey of Indigenous elders (n = 1175) and qualitative data collected through interviews (n = 36) and focus groups (18, n = 161) with a subgroup of elders receiving services. We compared outcomes for social and cultural connectedness and physical and mental well-being for different subgroups within our sample of elders based on elders' use of Title VI services and the level of services provided to these elders. Results were adjusted for community characteristics. RESULTS Elders receiving Title VI services had significantly fewer hospitalizations and falls per year (hospitalizations: 0.9 vs. 1.2, p < 0.05; falls: 1.0 versus 1.1, p < 0.05) and significantly more social and cultural engagements per month (social engagements: 92.6% vs. 75.6%, p < 0.05; cultural practices: 78.8% vs. 64.8%, p < 0.05) compared with elders who did not participate in Title VI services.

No specific treatments exist for COVID-19 at this time. New evidence suggests that therapeutic options focusing on antiviral agents may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms as well as those that lead to the decrease in the inflammatory responses. Flavonoids, as phenolic compounds, have attracted considerable attention due to their various biological properties. In this review, the promising effects and possible mechanisms of action of naringenin, a citrus-derived flavonoid, against COVID-19 were discussed. We searched PubMed/Medline, Science direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases up to March 2020 using the definitive keywords. The evidence reviewed here indicates that naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 through the inhibition of COVID-19 main protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), and reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme receptors activity. One of the other mechanisms by which naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 is, at least partly, by attenuating inflammatory responses. The antiviral activity of the flavanone naringenin against some viruses has also been reported. On the whole, the favorable effects of naringenin lead to a conclusion that naringenin may be a promising treatment strategy against COVID-19.","output":"Naringenin, a flavanone with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects: A promising treatment strategy against COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Antibodies against viral pathogens represent promising therapeutic agents for the control of infection, and their antiviral efficacy has been shown to require the coordinated function of both the Fab and Fc domains(1).

Methods This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study was conducted in January 2021 in the emergency departments of two hospitals in Hamadan and Kermanshah, Iran. Participants were 487 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and CA who had undergone CPR during the one-year period between January 20, 2020 and January 20, 2021. Data were collected using the available CPR documentation forms developed based on the Utstein Style. Data analysis was performed via the Chi-square, Fishers exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests and the logistic regression analysis. Results Participants age was 69.31  14.73 years and most of them were male (61.8%) and suffered from at least one underlying disease (58.1%). The rate of total and in-hospital CA was 9.67% and 9.39%, respectively. The most prevalent first documented rhythm was asystole and the highest responsivity to CPR was for shockable rhythms. The rate of the return of spontaneous circulation was 9% and the rate of survival to hospital discharge was 2%. The significant predictors of CPR success were age, epinephrine administration time interval, and CPR duration. Conclusion CPR outcomes among patients with COVID-19 are poor, particularly among those with asystole and bradycardia.

Subgroup analysis suggests these changes occur predominantly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease. Use of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses is becoming widespread but there is a lack of evidence to inform the choice between multiplex syndromic panels versus POCT for influenza only. MATERIALS/METHODS: We evaluated patients from the ResPOC study with exacerbation of asthma or COPD who were treated with antibiotics. The duration of antibiotics and proportion with early discontinuation were compared between patients testing positive and negative for viruses by POCT, and controls. Patients testing positive for viruses by POCT were compared according to virus types. RESULTS: 118 patient with exacerbation of airways disease received antibiotics in the POCT group and 111 in the control group. In the POCT group 49/118 (42%) patients tested positive for viruses. Of those testing positive for viruses 17/49 (35%) had early discontinuation of antibiotics versus 9/69 (13%) testing negative and 7/111 (6%) of controls, p<0.0001. Of those positive for viruses by POCT 10/49 (20%) were positive for influenza, 21/49 (43%) for rhinovirus and 18/49 (37%) for other viruses.

This might be expected to particularly affect older adults and people living with dementia (PLWD), and to reduce their well-being. AIMS: To explore how social support service use by older adults, carers and PLWD, and their mental well-being changed over the first 3 months since the pandemic outbreak. METHODS: Unpaid dementia carers, PLWD and older adults took part in a longitudinal online or telephone survey collected between April and May 2020, and at two subsequent timepoints 6 and 12 weeks after baseline. Participants were asked about their social support service usage in a typical week prior to the pandemic (at baseline), and in the past week at each of the three timepoints. They also completed measures of levels of depression, anxiety and mental well-being. RESULTS: 377 participants had complete data at all three timepoints. Social support service usage dropped shortly after lockdown measures were imposed at timepoint 1 (T1), to then increase again by T3. The access to paid care was least affected by COVID-19. Cases of anxiety dropped significantly across the study period, while cases of depression rose. Well-being increased significantly for older adults and PLWD from T1 to T3. CONCLUSIONS: Access to social support services has been significantly affected by the pandemic, which is starting to recover slowly. With mental well-being differently affected across groups, support needs to be put in place to maintain better well-being across those vulnerable groups during the ongoing pandemic.","output":"COVID-19-related social support service closures and mental well-being in older adults and those affected by dementia: a UK longitudinal survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An outbreak of coronavirus pneumonia was firstly documented in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China (December 2019), with an indication of human-to-human transmission.

Nurse practitioners surveyed on readiness for practice report a lack of confidence and education preparation for performing selected advanced diagnostic and skills. As NPs gain independent, full practice scope, it is imperative advanced diagnostic and procedure skills used in practice are taught in nurse practitioner curriculum. The purpose of this review is to document a systematic review of the literature, answering the following question: Among primary care NPs, does current program curriculum align with current procedures and skills in theclinical setting? METHODS PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, CINAHL, and Embase were searched between inception and 2018 using the search terms \\"advanced practice nursing, clinical competence, diagnostic techniques or procedures, and primary health care.\\" Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines, nine articles were included in the synthesis. CONCLUSION There is scant research regarding NP educational preparation of skills and procedures. Study findings indicate that programs are not teaching all the procedures deemed important. Education should promote improved congruence between the skills and procedures taught in program curricula and those used in clinical practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE It is critical to complete an education practice survey measuring skill and procedure preparation and competency at graduation. Survey results will determine whether skill and procedure guidelines are indicated for NP education.

METHODS We searched Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials and reference lists of relevant articles for studies that assessed the prognostic value of cell-free DNA detection in trauma patients in the intensive care unit. Outcomes of interest included survival, posttraumatic complications and severity of trauma. Due to considerable heterogeneity between the included studies, a checklist was formed to assess quality of cell-free DNA measurement. RESULTS A total of 14 observational studies, including 904 patients, were eligible for analysis. Ten studies were designed as prospective cohort studies; three studies included selected patients from a cohort while one study was of a retrospective design. We found a significant correlation between higher values of cell-free DNA and higher mortality. This significant correlation was evident as early as on intensive care unit admission. Likewise, cell-free DNA predicted the severity of trauma and posttraumatic complications in a majority of patients. CONCLUSION The amount of cell-free DNA can function as a prognostic tool for mortality and to a lesser extent severity of trauma and posttraumatic complications.

More than 1 year into the pandemic, as resources have reached a point of depletion, grouping samples in pools of certain sizes appears to be a reasonable method to reduce both the costs and the processing time without necessitating additional training, equipment, or materials. AIMS: To assess whether the pooling strategy that was used in past outbreaks and is used in blood tests prior to transfusion for screening large populations can also be used in SARS CoV-2 tests. STUDY DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy study. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted with 2815 samples, sent to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Laboratory of our hospital between February 12 and 21, 2021, to be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The samples were examined individually and in pools of five 100 l taken from each sequential sample, using 3 different SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits, the Allplex? 2019-nCoV Assay kit (Seegene, Republic of Korea), the GeneMAP? 2019-nCoV detection V.3 kit (GenMark, Trkiye), and the Bio-Speedy? SARS-CoV-2 Double Gene? RT-qPCR kit (Bioeksen, Trkiye) on the BioRAD CFX96? Touch (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) platform available in our laboratory. RESULTS: Following the extraction of serial dilutions prepared from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive (cycle of threshold: 20) sample, the standard curves of RT-PCR were analyzed. By evaluating the efficiency (E) values, all 3 kits showed high sensitivity and similar results; while the highest level was detected with the Allplex? 2019-nCoV Assay kit in the nucleocapsid (N) gene (E: 124%), the lowest was detected with the Double Gene? RT-qPCR kit in the N and ORF 1ab genes (E: 90%). Of the samples included in the study, only 1 positive sample with low viral load was found to be negative when studied by pooling. The total number of kits to be used in pooled tests and then to individually retest the 5 samples in positive pools was calculated as 827 and the savings rate as 69.91% (1968/2815). CONCLUSION: The pooling strategy is an effective approach to extend the impact of limited testing resources and reagents available in certain periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing by pooling samples requires improvement of RNA extraction methods and careful monitoring of RT-PCR test sensitivity to avoid missing low-positive entities. Therefore, based on the prevalence of COVID-19 in their regions, laboratories should conduct their own validation of pooling studies for RNA extraction and amplification methods they use.","output":"Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Upper Respiratory Swap Samples by Pooling Method"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Despite descriptions of various cardiovascular manifestations in patients with COVID\\\\19, there is a paucity of reports of new onset brady\\\\arrhythmias, and the clinical implications of these events are unknown.

METHODS: Vaccination status and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results from adults in the Capital Region of Denmark (n=1,549,488) were obtained from national registries. PCR testing was free and widely available. The number of positive PCR tests per individual at risk were calculated as weekly rates. Time to positive PCR test was modelled using Kaplan-Meier methods and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox regression. RESULTS: 1,119,574 individuals received first dose of BNT162b2 and 1,088,879 received a second dose of BNT162b2. Individuals were followed up to 8.7 months after first dose (median: 5.5 months, IQR:4.1-8.7).

RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 can occur in a wide range of presentation, from asymptomatic to severe forms. Among the major risk factors for worse severity, overnutrition, undernutrition and body composition play a role in the ability to respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Excess fat accumulation (i.e. obesity) or lean mass loss and functionality (i.e. sarcopenia) or a combination of both (i.e. sarcopenic obesity) can affect whole-body functioning. These body composition alterations in the short-term can influence susceptibility and immunological responses to the virus, inflammatory reaction, metabolic and respiratory distress, while in the long-term can modulate disease outcomes, namely length of stay, time required for recovery, risk of ICU-acquired weakness and long-term disabilities, and potentially increase the risk of death.

Acrylamide was administered in drinking water throughout the 106-week study at concentrations required to provide a dose of 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.0 mg/kg/day to males or 0, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg/day to females. Complete necropsy and gross pathology examinations were performed on all study animals. Histopathology examinations were conducted on selected tissues of all high-dose and control animals. Selected tissues from intermediate and low-dose groups were subjected to histopathological examinations as required to clarify high- and controldose group observations. There was no visual observation of neurotoxicity in any study animal but sciatic nerve degeneration was observed in the male and female high-dose groups. Increased mortality related to acrylamide was observed in the high- dose male group from Month 17 to the end of the study and in the high-dose females during Month 24. Mesotheliomas of the testicular tunic were significantly increased in the high-dose male group. The combined incidence of mammary gland adenocarcinomas and fibroadenomas was significantly increased in both acrylamide-dosed female groups. Males and females in the high-dose groups as well as females of the low-dose group had significantly (p<0.001) increased thyroid follicular cell adenomas and adenocarcinomas. A variety of other tumor types observed with increased incidence in a previous acrylamide onco genicity study (i.e., combined CNS glial neoplasms, papillomas of the oral cavity, adenomas of the clitoral gland, and uterine adenocarcinomas) were not observed to be present at increased incidence in this study. This study confirms previously described acrylamide induction of benign tumors of the thyroid and mammary glands as well as mesotheliomas of the testis. By using a larger number of animals with an unbalanced study design, this study showed that acrylamide did not induce glial tumors and demonstrated that the no-observable-effect level for scrotal mesotheliomas is 0.5 mg/kg. It also demonstrated that the in creased incidence of mammary tumors was again within historical control ranges.","output":"A Lifetime Oncogenicity Study in Rats with Acrylamide"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Mass asymptomatic testing for COVID-19 was piloted for the first time in the UK in Liverpool in November 2020. There is limited evidence on uptake of mass testing and previously where surge testing has been deployed, uptake has been low. Objective: There was an urgent need to rapidly evaluate acceptance of asymptomatic testing, specifically identifying barriers and motivators to taking part. Methods: As part of the wider evaluation, we conducted a rapid thematic analysis of local community narratives on social media to provide insights from people unlikely to engage in testing or other standard evaluation techniques, such as surveys or interviews. Three publicly available data sources were identified;the comments section of a local online newspaper, the city council Facebook page and Twitter. Data were collected between 2 and 8 November 2020, to cover the period between announcement of mass testing in Liverpool and the first week of testing. Overall 1096 comments were sampled;219 newspaper comments, 472 Facebook comments and 405 Tweets. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Results: Key barriers were accessibility, including site access and concerns over queuing. Queues were also highlighted as a concern due to risk of transmission. Consequences of testing, including an increase in cases leading to further restrictions and financial impact of the requirement to self-isolation were also identified as barriers. In addition, a lack of trust in authorities and the test (including test accuracy and purpose of testing) was identified. Lack of trust was particularly apparent in those with a strong sense of collective identity with the city of Liverpool, which led to a feeling of marginalisation and feeling like test subjects. However, this sense of identity with Liverpool had a dual role and also acted a motivator to engage in testing and encourage others to do so;for this group being part of a pilot was seen as a positive experience and an opportunity to demonstrate the city could successfully manage the virus. Conclusions: Our analysis highlights the importance of promoting honest and open communication to encourage and harness existing community identities to enhance the legitimacy of asymptomatic testing as a policy. In addition, adequate and accessible financial support needs to be in place prior to the implementation of community asymptomatic testing to mitigate any concerns surrounding financial hardship. Rapid thematic analysis of social media is a pragmatic method to gather insights from communities around acceptability of public health interventions, such as mass testing or vaccination uptake.","output":"Local community response to mass asymptomatic COVID-19 testing in Liverpool, England: a social media analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Contemporary theories about the reciprocal interactions of human beings with the environment are only fully intelligible in the light of the historical roots of such theories.

To understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, it is therefore necessary to understand cell function during hypoxia. We investigated aspects of human monocyte activation under hypoxic conditions. HMGB1 is an alarmin released by stressed cells. Under normoxic conditions, HMGB1 activates interferon regulatory factor (IRF)5 and nuclear factor-&#954;B in monocytes, leading to expression of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and interleukin 1?, respectively. When hypoxic monocytes are activated by HMGB1, they produce proinflammatory cytokines but fail to produce type I IFN. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945;, induced by hypoxia, functions as a direct transcriptional repressor of IRF5 and IRF3. As hypoxia is a stressor that induces secretion of HMGB1 by epithelial cells, hypoxia establishes a microenvironment that favors monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines but not IFN. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","output":"HIF-1 is a negative regulator of interferon regulatory factors: Implications for interferon production by hypoxic monocytes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Coronaviruses are worldwide distributed RNA-viruses affecting several species, causing a broad spectrum of diseases with a zoonotic potential and the ability to jump from one host species to a different one, including humans. In the perspective of One Health and the well-known recent Coronavirus-associated epidemics and pandemic, the aim of this review is to list all the animal species affected by Coronaviruses and to describe the lesions and the target organs. Information is given on the pathogenesis and the gross and histological lesions of pets, ferrets, bovines, sheep, goats, equine, swine, wild animals, non-human primates, marine mammals, laboratory animals, fish, reptiles, amphibian, and, briefly, humans. ABSTRACT: Coronaviruses (CoVs) are worldwide distributed RNA-viruses affecting several species, including humans, and causing a broad spectrum of diseases. Historically, they have not been considered a severe threat to public health until two outbreaks of COVs-related atypical human pneumonia derived from animal hosts appeared in 2002 and in 2012. The concern related to CoVs infection dramatically rose after the COVID-19 global outbreak, for which a spill-over from wild animals is also most likely. In light of this CoV zoonotic risk, and their ability to adapt to new species and dramatically spread, it appears pivotal to understand the pathophysiology and mechanisms of tissue injury of known CoVs within the One-Health concept. This review specifically describes all CoVs diseases in animals, schematically representing the tissue damage and summarizing the major lesions in an attempt to compare and put them in relation, also with human infections. Some information on pathogenesis and genetic diversity is also included. Investigating the lesions and distribution of CoVs can be crucial to understand and monitor the evolution of these viruses as well as of other pathogens and to further deepen the pathogenesis and transmission of this disease to help public health preventive measures and therapies.","output":"Pathology of Coronavirus Infections: A Review of Lesions in Animals in the One-Health Perspective"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As of May 2021, the United States remains the world leader with 33 million of 165 million cases worldwide (20%) and 590,000 of 3.4 million deaths worldwide (17%) from COVID-19. Achieving herd immunity by disease spread and vaccination may result in 2 million to 4 million total US deaths. The future perfect of the vaccine should not be the enemy of the present good, which is masking. Masking, especially when combined with social distancing, crowd avoidance, frequent hand and face washing, increased testing capabilities, and contact tracing, is likely to prevent at least as many premature deaths as the widespread utilization of an effective and safe vaccine. Worldwide, masking is the oldest and simplest engineered control to prevent transmission of respiratory pathogens. Masking has been a cornerstone of infection control in hospitals, operating rooms, and clinics for more than a century. Unfortunately, since the epidemic began in the United States, masking has become politicized. All countries, but especially the United States, must adopt masking as an urgent necessity and a component of coordinated public health strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Any economic advantages of pandemic politics are short-lived and shortsighted in comparison with public health strategies of proven benefit that can prevent needless and mostly avoidable premature deaths from COVID-19. During the worst epidemic in more than 100 years, most Americans (75%) trust their health care providers. As competent and compassionate health care professionals, we recommend that effective strategies, especially masking, and not pandemic politics, should inform all rational clinical and public health decision-making.","output":"COVID-19 control in the United States: The case for masking"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Faced with many challenges resulting in learners poor performance at the matriculation level, emphasis on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education is in its infancy in South Africans high schools. However, studies have shown that mobile learning (m-learning) can be used to mitigate the challenges of STEM education. Despite, the benefits of mobile learning to rural STEM learners, its full potential has not been realized because the adoption of m-learning depends on users acceptance. Prior studies focused on teachers and learners acceptance of mobile learning. However, little is known about parents acceptance of m-learning, especially in rural areas. This study explores the acceptance of m-learning by parents of rural high school STEM learners. The study proposes the parents acceptance of m-learning model, which extends the technology acceptance model by introducing perceived social influence and perceived resources. Stratified random sampling was used to select 200 parents in the survey. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PSL-SEM) was used to analyze data from 129 valid questionnaires. The proposed model explained 41% of the variance in parents acceptance of mobile learning. Attitude towards the use was found to be the best predictor and the only factor that have a direct effect on behavioral intention to use mobile learning. However, all other factors have an indirect influence on behavioral intention.

Triage via telemedicine could deter unnecessary ED transfers. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention for emergency triage in an independent living community. METHODS: In the intervention community, a 950-resident independent senior living community, when a resident called for help, emergency medical technicianCtrained staff could engage an emergency medicine physician via telemedicine to assist with management and triage. We compared trends in the proportion of calls resulting in transport to the ED (ie, primary outcome) in the intervention community to two control communities. Secondary outcomes were telemedicine use and posttransport disposition. Semistructured focus groups of residents and staff were conducted to examine attitudes toward the intervention. Qualitative data analysis used thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although the service was offered at no cost to residents, use was low and we found no evidence of fewer ED transfers. The key barrier to program use was resistance from frontline staff members, who did not view telemedicine triage as a valuable tool for emergency response, instead perceiving it as time-consuming and as undermining their independent judgment. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of, and acceptance by, frontline providers is a key consideration in using telemedicine triage to reduce unnecessary ED transfers.","output":"Use of Telemedicine for Emergency Triage in an Independent Senior Living Community: Mixed Methods Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Towards eradicating COVID19, developing vaccines that induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies is a main goal.

Herein we monitored ability of convalescent or Pfizer-BTN162b2 post-vaccination sera to neutralize wide-type SARS- CoV2 or its UK-B.1.1.7 and SA-B.1.351 variants. Relative to convalescent sera, post- vaccination sera exhibited higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against wild-type or mutated viruses. However, while SARS-CoV2 wild-type and UK-N501Y were similarly neutralized by tested sera, the SA-N501Y/K417N/E484K variant moderately escaped neutralization. Significant contribution to infectivity and sensitivity to neutralization was attributed to each of the variants and their single or combined mutations, highlighting alternative mechanisms by which prevalent variants with either N501Y or E484K/K417N mutations spread.

Thus, this study investigated the application of an advanced hybrid Z-score bankruptcy prediction model in selecting financial ratios of listed companies in eight related electronics industries (semiconductor, computer, and peripherals, photoelectric, communication network, electronic components, electronic channel, information service, and other electronics industries) using data from 2000 to 2019. Based on 22 financial ratios of condition attributes and one decision attribute recommended and selected by experts and in the literature, this study used five classifiers for binary logistic regression analysis and in the decision tree. The experimental results show that for the Z-score model, samples analyzed using the five classifiers in five groups (1:1C5:1) of different ratios of companies, the bagging classifier scores are worse (40.82%) than when no feature selection method is used, while the logistic regression classifier and decision tree classifier (J48) result in better scores. However, it is significant that the bagging classifier score improved to over 90% after using the feature selection technique. In conclusion, it was found that the feature selection method can be effectively applied to improve the prediction accuracy, and three financial ratios (the liquidity ratio, debt ratio, and fixed assets turnover ratio) are identified as being the most important determinants affecting the prediction of financial bankruptcy in providing a useful reference for interested parties to evaluate capital allocation to avoid high investment risks.","output":"Comparable Studies of Financial Bankruptcy Prediction Using Advanced Hybrid Intelligent Classification Models to Provide Early Warning in the Electronics Industry"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: As part of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) control strategies, entry screening was established at International airports.

In-hospital mortality were observed. Cardiac damage was defined as plasma hypersensitive troponin I (hsTnI) over 34.2 pg/ml and/or N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) above 450 pg/ml at the age < 50, above 900 pg/ml at the age < 75, or above 1800 pg/ml at the age  75. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old. 69 (69.0%) had comorbidities, mainly presenting hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Fever (69 [69.0%]), cough (63 [63.0%]), chest distress (13 [13.0%]), and fatigue (12 [12.0%]) were the common initial symptoms. Cardiac damage occurred in 25 patients. In the subgroups, hsTnI was significantly higher in elder patients ( 60 years) than in the young (median [IQR], 5.2 [2.2C12.8] vs. 1.9 [1.9C6.2], p = 0.018) and was higher in men than in women (4.2 [1.9C12.8] vs. 2.9 [1.9C7.4], p = 0.018).

Therefore, the objective of this work is to estimate the under-reporting of cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the Infogripe on notification of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology is based on the concepts of inertia and the use of event detection techniques to study the time series of hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent years (2016 to 2019) derived from a seasonal exponential moving average.

We wish to determine if our preoperative frailty screen would predict postoperative LOI. METHODS: This single-institutional study included demographical, procedural, and outcome data from patients 65 years who underwent frailty screening prior to a surgical procedure. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frailty Score (EFS). The Operative Severity Score was used to categorize procedures. The Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk-adjustment score as calculated by CMS was included. LOI was defined as an increase in support outside of the home following discharge. Univariable, multivariable logistic regressions, and adjusted post-estimation analyses for predictive probabilities of best fit were performed. RESULTS: 535 patients met inclusion and LOI was seen in 38 (7%) patients. Patients with LOI were older, had a lower BMI, a higher EFS score (7vs.3.0, p<0.001), and a higher HCC score than patients without LOI. Being frail and undergoing a procedure with an OSS  3 was independently associated with an increased risk of LOI. In addition, social dependency, depression, and limited mobility was associated with an increased risk for LOI. On multivariable modeling, frailty status, undergoing a surgery with an OSS  3, and having an HCC score  1 was the most predictive of LOI (OR 12.72, 95% CI: 12.04, 13.44, p<0.001). In addition, self-reported depression, weight loss, and limited mobility was associated with a nearly 11-fold increase risk in postoperative LOI. CONCLUSIONS: This study is novel as it identifies clear, generalizable risk factors for LOI.

Information on cardiac injury is scarce. We aimed to evaluate cardiovascular damage in patients with COVID-19 and determine the correlation of high-sensitivity cardiac-specific troponin T (hs-cTnT) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) with the severity of COVID-19. Methods: We included 872 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19 from February to April 2020. We tested 651 patients for high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and 506 for NT-proBNP on admission. Cardiac injury was defined as hs-TnT > 14ng/L, the upper 99th percentile. Levels of NT-proBNP > 300 pg/mL were considered related to some extent of cardiac injury. The primary composite endpoint was 30-day mortality or mechanical ventilation (MV). Results: Cardiac injury by hs-TnT was observed in 34.6% of our COVID-19 patients. Mortality or MV were higher in cardiac injury than noncardiac injury patients (39.1% vs 9.1%). Hs-TnT and NT-proBNP levels were independent predictors of death or MV (HR, 2.18; 95%CI, 1.23-3.83 and 1.87 (95%CI, 1.05-3.36), respectively) and of mortality alone (HR, 2.91; 95%CI, 1.211-7.04 and 5.47; 95%CI, 2.10-14.26, respectively). NT-ProBNP significantly improved the troponin model discrimination of mortality or MV (C-index 0.83 to 0.84), and of mortality alone (C-index 0.85 to 0.87). Conclusions: Myocardial injury measured at admission was a common finding in patients with COVID-19. It reliably predicted the occurrence of mortality and need of MV, the most severe complications of the disease.

RESULTS: Access to health and food/nutrition resources were explicit in eight (8) and twelve (12) policies/plans, respectively. Themes that reflect potential policy contributions to social inclusion and equitable access to health resources were: Provision of functional and improved health infrastructure; Primary Health Care strengthening for quality health service delivery; Provision of safety nets and social health insurance; Community participation and integration; and Public education and enlightenment. With respect to nutrition resources, emergent themes were: Provision of accessible and affordable land to farmers; Upscaling local food production, diversification and processing; Provision of safety nets; Private-sector participation; and Special considerations for vulnerable groups. CONCLUSION: There is sub-optimal consideration of access to health and nutrition resources in urban development policies in Nigeria. Equity and social inclusivity in access to health and nutrition resources should be underscored in future policies.

Currently, there is no vaccine for this disease, and because of this, containing COVID\\\\19 is not an easy task. It is noticed that elderly people got severely affected by this disease specially in Europe. In the present paper, we propose and analyze a mathematical model for COVID\\\\19 virus transmission by dividing whole population in old and young groups. We find disease\\\\free equilibrium and the basic reproduction number (R (0)). We estimate the parameter corresponding to rate of transmission and rate of detection of COVID\\\\19 using real data from Italy and Spain by least square method. We also perform sensitivity analysis to identify the key parameters which influence the basic reproduction number and hence regulate the transmission dynamics of COVID\\\\19. Finally, we extend our proposed model to optimal control problem to explore the best cost\\\\effective and time\\\\dependent control strategies that can reduce the number of infectives in a specified interval of time.","output":"Modeling and optimal control analysis of COVID\\\\19: Case studies from Italy and Spain"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Around the globe, moderate cases account for the largest proportion of all coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and deteriorated moderate patients contribute the most in mortality. However, published articles failed to address the deterioration details of moderate cases, especially on when and how they deteriorated. Methods: All moderate COVID-19 patients hospitalized in Guangdong Province from January 14 to March 16, 2020, were included in this multicenter retrospective cohort study and were divided into deteriorated and non-deteriorated groups according to clinical status. Symptoms and demographic, therapeutic, and laboratory test result characteristics were collected to explore the features of disease deterioration. Results: Of 1,168 moderate patients included, 148 (13%) deteriorated to severe (130 cases) or critical (18 cases) status. Over 20% of the older subgroup (>50 years old) showed deterioration. The median time for deterioration was 11 days after onset [interquartile range (IQR) 9C14 days]. In addition, 12.2% severe cases could further develop to critical status after 3 days (IQR 2C6.5 days) of having a severe condition. Respiratory dysfunction and hypoxia were the major manifestations as disease deterioration, while 76 cases (52.1%) showed respiratory rate >30 breaths/min, 119 cases (80.4%) showed SaO(2) <93%, 100 cases (67.5%) had 201 < PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 300, and 27 cases (18.9%) had blood lactic acid >2.0 mmol/L. In view of multiple organ dysfunction, 87.8% of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 20.2% of acute kidney injury (AKI), 6.8% of coagulopathy, 4% of acute heart failure (AHF), 3.4% of acute hepatic injury (AHI), and 5.4% of shock occurred in deteriorated patients, while organ injury occurred in the following sequence: ARDS, AKI, AHF, coagulopathy, AHI, and shock. Conclusions: The deteriorated pattern of moderate COVID-19 patients is characterized as the 11th day from onset (IQR 9C14 days) being an important time point of disease deterioration with further exacerbation to critical condition in 3 days (IQR 2C6.5 days), A RDS followed by AKI being the typical modes of sequential organ damage.","output":"Patterns of Deterioration in Moderate Patients With COVID-19 From Jan 2020 to Mar 2020: A Multi-Center, Retrospective Cohort Study in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Breastfeeding is available to nearly all women and has well-established short-term and long-term health benefits for mothers and infants.

Pharmacy organizations publish routinely updated versions of professional competencies that help pharmacy schools integrate advances into their curricula. In Lebanon, no national framework for pharmacy education is officially adopted yet. In 2017, the Official Pharmacists Association in Lebanon [OPL - Order of Pharmacists of Lebanon] took the initiative to develop a pharmacy core competency framework. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this survey was to evaluate graduates perceptions of pharmacy-related competencies taught across Lebanese pharmacy schools/faculties, based on the suggested Lebanese Pharmacy Competencies Framework. This study also explored the association between graduates demographics, university attributes, and self-assessed competency performance. METHODS: A cross-sectional study involving pharmacists who graduated from Lebanese universities was performed through a 40-minute online questionnaire distributed over social media platforms and groups of pharmacists. RESULTS: Pharmacists perceived their competence as moderate upon graduation, the lowest scores being in fundamental knowledge and medicine supply; the highest reported scores were in personal skills and safe/rational use of medicines. Moreover, females, younger graduates, PharmD holders, and pharmacists working in hospitals/clinical settings and academia had the highest perception of their competencies. Pharmacists in the public sector and medical laboratory directors had the lowest perception of competence. CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the taught curriculum to the suggested Lebanese Pharmacy Competency Framework, all domains need to be improved to optimize the perception, education, and practice of pharmacists.

AIM This comprehensive systematic review provides an up-to-date compilation of clinical trials, reported between 2014 and 2020, assessing hand hygiene interventions in order to inform healthcare leaders and practitioners regarding approaches for reduction of healthcare-associated infections using hand hygiene. METHODS We searched CINAHL, Cochrane, EMbase, Medline, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases for clinical trials published between March 2014 and December 2020 on the topic of hand hygiene compliance among healthcare professionals. From these searches, a total of 332 papers were identified of which 57 studies met criteria. FINDINGS Forty-five of the 57 studies (79%) included were conducted in Asia, Europe and the USA. A large majority of these clinical trials were conducted in acute care facilities, including hospital wards and intensive care facilities. Nurses were the largest group of healthcare workers studied followed by physicians, represented in 44 (77%) and 41 (72%) studies, respectively. Thirty-six studies (63%) adopted the World Health Organisation multimodal framework or a variation of it, and many of these recorded hand hygiene opportunities at each of the five moments, although recording of hand hygiene technique was not common.

OBJECTIVE: To explore PCPs perspectives about the impact of stay-at-home orders and the increased use of telemedicine on interactions and working relationships with their practice staff during the first 9 months of the pandemic. DESIGN: Qualitative research. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included PCPs from family and community medicine, general internal medicine, and pediatrics. APPROACH: One-on-one, semi-structured video interviews with 42 PCPs were conducted between July and December 2020. Physicians were recruited from 30 primary care practices in Massachusetts and Ohio using a combination of purposeful, convenience, and snowball sampling. Interview questions focused on work changes and work relationships with other staff members during the pandemic as well as their experiences delivering telemedicine. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive approaches. KEY RESULTS: Across respondents and states, the context of the pandemic was reported to have four major impacts on primary care teamwork: (1) staff members roles were repurposed to support telemedicine; (2) PCPs felt disconnected from staff; (3) PCPs had difficulty communicating with staff; and (4) many PCPs were demoralized during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of in-person contact, and less synchronous communication, negatively impacted PCP-staff teamwork and morale during the pandemic.

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the safety of vaccines recommended for children, adults, and pregnant women in the United States. METHODS: We searched the literature in November 2020 to update a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review by integrating newly available data. Studies of vaccines that used a comparator and reported the presence or absence of key adverse events were eligible. Adhering to Evidence-based Practice Center methodology, we assessed the strength of evidence (SoE) for all evidence statements. The systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020180089). RESULTS: Of 56,603 reviewed citations, 338 studies reported in 518 publications met inclusion criteria. For children, SoE was high for no increased risk of autism following measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. SoE was high for increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR. There was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine at the latest follow-up (moderate SoE), nor of diabetes (high SoE). There was no evidence of increased risk or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for newer vaccines such as 9-valent human papillomavirus and meningococcal B vaccines. For adults, there was no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for the new adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine. We found no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) for key adverse events among pregnant women following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine, including stillbirth (moderate SoE).

All patients received anlotinib (12 mg daily, orally for 2 weeks, discontinued for 1 week, repeated every 3 weeks) combined with dose-dense TMZ (100 mg/m(2), 7 days on with 7 days off) until the disease progressed (PD) or adverse effects (AEs) above grade 4 appeared. Grade 3 AEs need to be restored to grade 2 before continuing treatment, and the daily dose of anlotinib is reduced to 10 mg. The patients were reexamined by head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every 1 to 3 months. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria. The survival rate was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis. The baseline of all survival index statistics was the start of anlotinib combined with dose-dense of TMZ. National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE 4.0) was used to evaluate AEs. RESULTS: Twenty cases of rGBM were evaluated according to the RANO criteria after treatment with anlotinib and dose-dense TMZ, including five cases of stable disease (SD), thirteen cases of partial response (PR), one case of complete response (CR), and one case of PD. The median follow-up time was 13.4 (95% CI, 10.5C16.3) months. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 47.7%. The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 55%. In the IDH wild type group, the median PFS and median OS were 6.1 and 11.9 months, respectively. We observed that AEs associated with treatment were tolerable. One patient stopped taking the drug because of cerebral infarction. There were no treatment-related deaths. CONCLUSION: Anlotinib combined with dose-dense TMZ for the first-line therapy showed good efficacy in OS, PFS, ORR, and DCR in the treatment of rGBM, and the AEs were tolerant.

Coronaviruses infect many animal species, but disease severity varies between strains. Viral accessory proteins are generally implicated in increased infectivity, pathogenicity, and virulence. The accessory protein open reading frame 8 (ORF8), although not essential for viral replication, appears to play a critical role in disease severity by inhibiting multiple pathways of the immune response. Furthermore, the ORF8 gene is found within a highly variable portion of the genome, increasing the possibility of dangerous mutant forms arising. Structure-based design of therapeutics holds great promise for effective targeting of such rapidly evolving threats. Thus, we designed physical models and computer representations of ORF8, based on the published structure 7JTL, to better evaluate the structural features responsible for viral pathogenicity. ORF8 exists as a homodimer held together by amino acid residues that interact through hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, a salt bridge, and a disulfide bond. These interactions occur in a region referred to as the covalent interface. Another interface, referred to as the noncovalent interface, exists between separate homodimers and results in oligomerization. The homodimers in the oligomer are held together by an intermolecular beta sheet that is stabilized by an extensive hydrophobic surface. These two dimerization interfaces are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and have been proposed to be involved in the protein's ability to evade and suppress the host immune response. The computer and physical representations allow for better visualization of the ORF8 structure to evaluate the role of the multimeric structure. ORF8 has been found to interact with various host proteins, including Interleukin-17 Receptor A (IL17RA), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. To further corroborate the existence of this interaction and to better understand the role oligomerization might play in pathogenicity, we assessed the possible interactions of ORF8 (7JTL) and IL17RA (5N9B) through theoretical modeling using available tools such as HDOCK. A better understanding of these inter-subunit interactions may improve our understanding of the unique mechanism the virus uses to evade the immune system and may be instrumental in the development of effective therapeutics.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 Accessory Protein Dimerization Domains and Protein-Protein Host Interaction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence and severity of ketoacidosis (DKA) at type 1 diabetes diagnosis during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Israel. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based study the product of a national collaboration of Israeli pediatric diabetes centers investigated the presentation of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. The frequencies of DKA and severe DKA observed during the COVID-19 period from March 15, 2020 (commencement of the first nationwide lockdown) until June 30, 2020 were compared with the same periods in 2019, 2018, and 2017 using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, sex, and socioeconomic position. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 period, DKA incidence was 58.2%, significantly higher than in 2019 (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.18 [95% CI, 1.31-3.60], P = 0.003); 2018 (aOR 2.05 [95% CI, 1.26-3.34], P = 0.004); and 2017 (aOR, 1.79 [95% CI,1.09-2.93], P = 0.022). The incidence of severe DKA was 19.9%, significantly higher than in 2018 (aOR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.20-5.19], P = 0.015) and 2017 (aOR, 2.73 [95% CI,1.28-5.82], P = 0.009).

One of the most dramatic outcomes of the crisis is the increase in poverty, but its extent will remain unknown until household income data is collected and analyzed. We propose a simple approach to provide early estimates, micro-simulating the short-run effect of the crisis on the poverty rate. It combines household level micro-data, estimates on the feasibility of working from home, information on key public policies (e.g., cash-transfers, unemployment insurance), and forecasts of GDP contraction. This approach, which can be easily adapted and applied to different countries, allows to nowcast the current poverty level and the poverty-reducing effect of public policies, while providing full micro-macro consistency between heterogeneous impacts on households and the shock to aggregate GDP. Moreover, it enables to estimate the effect on informal and self-employed workers, of utmost importance in developing countries. We illustrate the methodology with an application for Uruguay, finding that during the first full trimester of the crisis, the poverty rate grew by more than 38%, reaching 11.8% up from 8.5%. Moreover, cash transfers implemented by the government in the period had a positive but very limited effect in mitigating this poverty spike, which could be neutralized with additional transfers worth under 0.5% of Uruguays annual GDP.","output":"Too little but not too late: nowcasting poverty and cash transfers incidence during COVID-19s crisis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: Background: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can induce an exaggerated inflammatory response. Vitamin D is a key modulator of the immune system. We hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency (VDD) could increase the risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection. Methods: patients with confirmed COVID-19 seen at the emergency department of our hospital with recent measurements of 25(OH)D were recruited. We explored the association of vitamin D deficiency (VDD), defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/mL, with a composite of adverse clinical outcomes. Results: we included 80 patients, of which 31 (39 %) presented the endpoint. VDD tended to predict an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 after adjusting for age, gender, obesity, cardiac disease, and kidney disease [OR 3.2 (95 % CI: 0.9-11.4), p = 0.07]. Age had a negative interaction with the effect of VDD on the composite outcome (p = 0.03), indicating that the effect was more noticeable at younger ages. Furthermore, male gender was associated with VDD and with severe COVID-19 at younger ages. Conclusions: in this retrospective study, vitamin D deficiency showed a signal of association with severe COVID-19 infection. A significant interaction with age was noted, suggesting VDD may have a greater impact in younger patients.

A prime example of this is the emergence of the Nipah virus (NiV). Due to high rate of mortality specifically in India and Bangladesh, there is an urgent need for accelerated research for NiV involving the development of vaccines or drugs. The genome of NiV consists of six genes (N, P, M, F, G and L) encoding yielding nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein and large RNA polymerase. We have used these six genes for in silico assessment of DNA codon optimization in Escherichia coli. It was observed that the codon adaptation index (CAI) and GC content of the genes in optimized DNA were enhanced significantly as compared to wild-type strain. On an average, CAI and GC content of N gene in optimized DNA was enhanced by 2.3 (135.1%) and 1.2(9.9 %) fold respectively, while in P/V/C it was increased by 2.0 (98.3 %) and 1.1(7.8%) fold respectively. Further, the CAI and GC content in optimized DNA of M gene and F gene was enhanced by 2.0(99.0%) and 1.1(7.2%) fold respectively for gene M and 2.4(142.5 %), 1.2(15.4%) fold respectively for gene F.

We compared cytokines in COVID-19 versus influenza in order to define differentiating features of the inflammatory response to these pathogens and their association with severe disease. Because elevated body mass index (BMI) is a known risk factor for severe COVID-19, we examined the relationship of BMI to cytokines associated with severe disease. METHODS: Thirty-seven cytokines and chemokines were measured in plasma from 135 patients with COVID-19, 57 patients with influenza, and 30 healthy controls. Controlling for BMI, age, and sex, differences in cytokines between groups were determined by linear regression and random forest prediction was utilized to determine the cytokines most important in distinguishing severe COVID-19 and influenza. Mediation analysis was utilized to identify cytokines that mediate the effect of BMI and age on disease severity. RESULTS: IL-18, IL-1?, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were significantly increased in COVID-19 versus influenza patients while GM-CSF, IFN-?3, IFN-&#955;1, IL-10, IL-15, and MCP-2 were significantly elevated in the influenza group. In subgroup analysis based on disease severity, IL-18, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; were elevated in severe COVID-19, but not severe influenza. Random forest analysis identified high IL-6 and low IFN-&#955;1 levels as the most distinct between severe COVID-19 and severe influenza. Finally, IL-1RA was identified as a potential mediator of the effects of BMI on COVID-19 severity.

The World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel on SARS treatment requested a systematic review and comprehensive summary of treatments used for SARS-infected patients in order to guide future treatment and identify priorities for research. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In response to the WHO request we conducted a systematic review of the published literature on ribavirin, corticosteroids, lopinavir and ritonavir (LPV/r), type I interferon (IFN), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and SARS convalescent plasma from both in vitro studies and in SARS patients. We also searched for clinical trial evidence of treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Sources of data were the literature databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to February 2005. Data from publications were extracted and evidence within studies was classified using predefined criteria. In total, 54 SARS treatment studies, 15 in vitro studies, and three acute respiratory distress syndrome studies met our inclusion criteria. Within in vitro studies, ribavirin, lopinavir, and type I IFN showed inhibition of SARS-CoV in tissue culture. In SARS-infected patient reports on ribavirin, 26 studies were classified as inconclusive, and four showed possible harm. Seven studies of convalescent plasma or IVIG, three of IFN type I, and two of LPV/r were inconclusive. In 29 studies of steroid use, 25 were inconclusive and four were classified as causing possible harm. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an extensive literature reporting on SARS treatments, it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Some may have been harmful.

Systemic inflammation constitutes a major component of postCcardiac arrest syndrome, and IL-6 (interleukin-6) levels are associated with postCcardiac arrest syndrome severity. The IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab could potentially dampen inflammation in postCcardiac arrest syndrome. The objective of the present trial was to determine the efficacy of tocilizumab to reduce systemic inflammation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of a presumed cardiac cause and thereby potentially mitigate organ injury. METHODS: Eighty comatose patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest were randomly assigned 1:1 in a double-blinded placebo-controlled trial to a single infusion of tocilizumab or placebo in addition to standard of care including targeted temperature management. Blood samples were sequentially drawn during the initial 72 hours. The primary end point was the reduction in C-reactive protein response from baseline until 72 hours in patients treated with tocilizumab evaluated by mixed-model analysis for a treatment-by-time interaction. Secondary end points (main) were the marker of inflammation: leukocytes; the markers of myocardial injury: creatine kinase myocardial band, troponin T, and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide; and the marker of brain injury: neuron-specific enolase. These secondary end points were analyzed by mixed-model analysis. RESULTS: The primary end point of reducing the C-reactive protein response by tocilizumab was achieved since there was a significant treatment-by-time interaction, P<0.0001, and a profound effect on C-reactive protein levels. Systemic inflammation was reduced by treatment with tocilizumab because both C-reactive protein and leukocyte levels were markedly reduced, tocilizumab versus placebo at 24 hours: C84% [C90%; C76%] and C34% [C46%; C19%], respectively, both P<0.001. Myocardial injury was also reduced, documented by reductions in creatine kinase myocardial band and troponin T; tocilizumab versus placebo at 12 hours: C36% [C54%; C11%] and C38% [C53%; C19%], respectively, both P<0.01. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide was similarly reduced by active treatment; tocilizumab versus placebo at 48 hours: C65% [C80%; C41%], P<0.001.

Individual (age, sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, insurance) and census tract-level (demographics, insurance, income, education, employment, occupation, household crowding and occupancy, built home environment, and transportation) variables were analyzed using linear mixed models predicting infection, hospitalization, and death from SARS-CoV-2. Among 57,865 individuals, per capita testing rates, individual (older age, male sex, non-White race, non-English preferred language, and non-private insurance), and census tract-level (increased population density, higher household occupancy, and lower education) measures were associated with likelihood of infection.

It is estimated that each adult in the United States experiences two to four respiratory infections annually. The morbidity of these infections is measured by an estimated 75 million physician visits per year, almost 150 million days lost from work, and more than $10 billion In costs for medical care. Serotypes of the rhinoviruses account for 20 to 30 percent of episodes of the common cold. However, the specific causes of most upper respiratory infections are undefined. Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality for nonhospitalized adults despite the widespread use of effective antimicrobial agents. There are no accurate figures on the number of episodes of pneumonia that occur each year in ambulatory patients. In younger adults, the atypical pneumonia syndrome Is the most common clinical presentation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae is the most frequently Identified causative agent. Other less common agents include Legionelia pneumophila, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and Chiamydia. More than half a million adults are hospitalized each year with pneumonia. Persons older than 65 years of age have the highest rate of pneumonia admissions, 11.5 per 1,000 population. Pneumonia ranks as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. The pathogens responsible for community-acquired pneumonlas are changing. Forty years ago, Streptococcus pneumoniae accounted for the majority of infections. Today, a broad array of community-acquired pathogens have been implicated as etiologic agents Including Leglonella species, gram-negative bacilli, Hemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and nonbacterial pathogens. Given the diversity of pathogenic agents, it has become imperative for clinicians to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis before initiating therapy or to consider the diagnostic possibilities and treat with antimicrobial agents that are effective against the most likely pathogens.","output":"Epidemiology of community-acquired respiratory tract infections in adults Incidence, etiology, and impact"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients is debated due to its uncertain benefits and risks of aerosol dispersion. This retrospective study was aimed to assess the outcome of treatment with HFNC therapy in adult COVID-19 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) admitted in intensive care units (ICU) and to assess the factors affecting outcome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrieved electronic medical records of all COVID-19 patients who received HFNC for respiratory support after failure to maintain adequate oxygenation with conventional oxygen devices, between June 1 and August 31, 2020. The data retrieved were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: A total number of 558 COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICUs, out of which 139 patients were identified to be on HFNC and 85 met the inclusion criteria for the study. The success rate of 48.2% with HFNC was observed in these patients. The patients recorded to experience HFNC success were of young age and having higher baseline oxygen saturation compared to those who had its failure. The ROX indices post-initiation were observed to be significantly higher in the success group (p 0.001). Awake-prone positioning while receiving HFNC was followed by around more patients in the success group (p <0.001). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, baseline oxygen saturation, awake-prone positioning, and number of days on HFNC were found to be independently affected outcome with HFNC. CONCLUSION: Almost half of the cases of moderate-to-severe COVID-19 pneumonia can be managed successfully with HFNC, without the need of mechanical ventilation.

This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement appropriateness. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Select cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources.

In vitro, we demonstrated that the EGFR-specific scFv could specifically deliver Fe(3)O(4)/Au to EGFR-positive NSCLC cells. In vivo experiments showed that the accumulation of scFv@Fe(3)O(4)/Au in tumor tissue was detectable by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the indicated time points after systemic injection.

The antivaccine movement uses Facebook to promote messages on the alleged dangers and consequences of vaccinating, leading to a reluctance to immunize against preventable communicable diseases. OBJECTIVE: We would like to know more about the messages these websites are sharing via social media that can influence readers and consumers. What messages is the public receiving on Facebook about immunization? What content (news articles, testimonials, videos, scientific studies) is being promoted? METHODS: We proposed using a social media audit tool and 3 categorical lists to capture information on websites and posts, respectively. The keywords \\"vaccine,\\" \\"vaccine truth,\\" and \\"anti-vax\\" were entered in the Facebook search bar. A Facebook page was examined if it had between 2500 and 150,000 likes. Data about beliefs, calls to action, and testimonials were recorded from posts and listed under the categories Myths, Truths, and Consequences. Website data were entered in a social media audit template. RESULTS: Users' posts reflected fear and vaccine hesitancy resulting from the alleged dangers of immunization featured on the website links. Vaccines were blamed for afflictions such as autism, cancer, and infertility. Mothers shared testimonies on alleged consequences their children suffered due to immunization, which have influenced other parents to not vaccinate their children. Users denied the current measles outbreaks in the United States to be true, retaliating against the government in protests for fabricating news. CONCLUSIONS: Some Facebook messages encourage prevailing myths about the safety and consequences of vaccines and likely contribute to parents' vaccine hesitancy.

PARTICIPANTS Respondents to the International Food Policy Study who provided information on all variables of interest in November-December 2019 aged 10-17 years (n=9171). OUTCOME MEASURES Self-reported exposure to screen-based media (screen time by media channel), use of social media platforms and self-reported location and frequency of exposure to unhealthy food and beverage advertising. RESULTS The average amount of time spent in front of various screens ranged from 7.6 hours to 10.2 hours across countries per week day, which may include possible viewing of multiple media channels simultaneously. Overall, Instagram was the most popular social media platform (52%-68% by country), followed by Facebook (42%-79%) and Snapchat (28%-52%). The percentage of respondents who self-reported having seen unhealthy food advertisements in the past 30 days was highest on television (43%-69%), followed by digital media (27%-60%) and gaming applications (10%-17%). Self-reported daily exposure to advertising varied between countries for sugary drinks (10%-43%) and fast food (19%-44%) and was positively associated with self-reported screen time. Self-reported exposure to screen-based media and social media platforms differed by sociodemographic characteristics and was higher among older adolescents than younger adolescents.

Although it is a minimally invasive treatment, it is associated with complications, the most common being pneumothorax. Pneumothorax occurs due to the rapid target lobe volume reduction and may be a predictor of clinical benefit despite this complication. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to conduct an exploratory data analysis of patients who developed a pneumothorax following endoscopic valve therapy for emphysema. MATERIALS AND METHODS This study performed a retrospective evaluation of pneumothorax management and the impact of pneumothorax on clinical outcomes in 70 patients following valve therapy in 381 consecutive patients. RESULTS Pneumothorax rate following valve therapy was 18%. Pneumothorax management consisted of chest tube insertion, valve removal, and surgical intervention in 87% (61/70), 44% (31/70), and 19% (13/70) of the patients, respectively. Despite pneumothorax, patients experienced modest but significant improvements in lung function parameters (forced expiratory volume in 1 second: 55148 mL, residual volume: -390964 mL, total lung capacity: -348876; all P<0.05). Persistent lobar atelectasis 3 months after recovering from pneumothorax, which was associated with relevant clinical improvement, was observed in only 21% (15/70) of the patients. CONCLUSION Pneumothorax is a frequent severe complication following valve therapy that requires further intervention. Nevertheless, the pneumothorax does not impair the clinical status in the majority of patients.

Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRa?=a?0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pa?=a?0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRa?=a?0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pa?=a?0.03).

There has been limited literature on whether NPS improved or worsened during the current pandemic. The current study examines the prevalence of NPS and changes in NPS profile during the pandemic. Loneliness, cognition, function, and caregiver distress were also studied. METHODS: The COVID Dementia study is an ongoing cross-sectional study of community dwelling cognitively impaired older adults (N=102). Loneliness was assessed with the 3-item loneliness questionnaire, cognition with the Tele-Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA), and functional status with the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Neuropsychiatry symptoms including severity and distress were collected using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and change during COVID was also recorded for each symptom. RESULTS: Mean age was 73.0 (8.0) years, 96.1% male, 42.2% rural, 75.2% Caucasian, and 24.8% non-Caucasian. T-MoCA and FAQ mean scores were 15.2 (4.6) and 8.0 (9.3), respectively.

Given the diversity of outbreak pathogens, particularly those prioritised by the World Health Organization Research and Development Blueprint, a more flexible and proactive approach to epidemic preparedness is needed to expand access to critical molecular diagnostic tests in peripheral and resource-constrained deployment settings. OBJECTIVE: New and more sustainable directives are needed to spur the development of high-quality products, particularly for epidemics more often found in low- and middle-income countries. To leverage and de-risk the development process, we present the benefits and challenges of an open-source business model for co-development of molecular diagnostic tests for decentralised settings. METHODS: We identify key outbreak pathogens that are available only for testing in high infrastructure laboratories and compare in-country installed base platforms that could be leveraged for menu expansion. Key strengths and challenges for development are highlighted for both platform and assay developers, with discussion of how to leverage and de-risk the process through an open-source development model. RESULTS: Depending on the specific partner strengths, options for partnership roles are presented. The proposed open-source business model addresses the particular challenges in the detection of outbreak- and epidemic-prone pathogens in low- and middle-income countries, reduces development and deployment risks to support outbreak response, strengthens diagnostic capacity and creates a viable market for product developers.

This work reminds responders about their professional mission and purpose, but its extreme physical and mental demands can take a toll on their well-being and health. In CEs, the sheer volume of work and the emotional over-engagement tend to produce toxic fantasies (eg, rescuer or helper fantasies), acting upon which threatens integrity of care and increases risks for both patients and providers. Accumulated fatigue and exposure to mass suffering and mortality can change the perceived value of life and increase reckless, risk-taking, and suicidal behaviors. Introducing a self-awareness framework prioritizes the awareness of the available choices and making situation-appropriate and informed decisions about balancing ones own and others needs. The COVID-19 response has demonstrated that fostering peer supports, changing organizational culture, addressing self-awareness within a training and supervisory context, and strengthening supports for managers are important parts of disaster preparedness.

The 8-week intervention consists of two components: (1) The electronic Social Network Assessment Program, a web-based tool to visualize existing social support resources and provide a tailored list of additional resources; and (2) Caregiver Navigation, including weekly phone sessions with a Caregiver Navigator to address caregiver social support needs. Outcomes are assessed by questionnaires completed by the caregiver (baseline, 4-week, 8-week) and the cancer patient (baseline, and 8-week). At 8 weeks, caregivers in the wait-list condition may opt into the intervention. Our primary outcome is caregiver well-being; we also explore patient well-being and caregiver and patient health care utilization. DISCUSSION: This protocol describes a study testing a novel social support intervention that pairs a web-based social network visualization tool and resource list (eSNAP) with personalized caregiver navigation. This intervention is responsive to a family-centered model of care and calls for clinical and research priorities focused on informal caregiving research.

However, little is known about regulation of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane, is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H2O2 in mammalian cells. H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase in vivo and selectively decreases formation of PTS1 receptor Pex5-mediated ternary complex of Pex14 with catalase in vitro. Phosphomimetic Pex14-S232D mutant elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins, conferring higher cell resistance to H2O2. We thus suggest that H2O2-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the increase of cytosolic catalase.","output":"Peroxisome counteracts oxidative stresses by suppressing catalase import via Pex14 phosphorylation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"An evident underestimation of the targeted prevention of dental diseases is strongly supported by alarming epidemiologic statistics globally. For example, epidemiologists demonstrated 100% prevalence of dental caries in the Russian population followed by clinical manifestation of periodontal diseases. Inadequately provided oral health services in populations are caused by multi-factorial deficits including but not limited to low socio-economic status of affected individuals, lack of insurance in sub-populations, insufficient density of dedicated medical units. Another important aspect is the participatory medicine based on the active participation of population in maintaining oral health: healthcare will remain insufficient as long as the patient is not motivated and does not feel responsible for their oral health. To this end, nearly half of chronically diseased people do not comply with adequate medical services suffering from severely progressing pathologies. Noteworthy, the prominent risk factors and comorbidities linked to the severe disease course and poor outcomes in COVID-19-infected individuals, such as elderly, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are frequently associated with significantly altered oral microbiome profiles, systemic inflammatory processes and poor oral health. Suggested pathomechanisms consider potential preferences in the interaction between the viral particles and the host microbiota including oral cavity, the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Since an aspiration of periodontopathic bacteria induces the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and production of inflammatory cytokines in the lower respiratory tract, poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease have been proposed as leading to COVID-19 aggravation. Consequently, the issue-dedicated expert recommendations are focused on the optimal oral hygiene as being crucial for improved individual outcomes and reduced morbidity under the COVID-19 pandemic condition. Current study demonstrated that age, gender, socio-economic status, quality of environment and life-style, oral hygiene quality, regularity of dental services requested, level of motivation and responsibility for own health status and corresponding behavioural patterns are the key parameters for the patient stratification considering person-tailored approach in a complex dental care in the population. Consequently, innovative screening programmes and adapted treatment schemes are crucial for the complex person-tailored dental care to improve individual outcomes and healthcare provided to the population.","output":"Making a complex dental care tailored to the person: population health in focus of predictive, preventive and personalised (3P) medical approach"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Average time from manuscript submission to the final decision (including review, revision, and re-review) has been reduced from the 2016 baseline of 202 days to 96 days in 2018 and further optimized to 79 days in 2019 Because of an increased number of submissions, despite maintaining a steady acceptance rate, the number of published articles has gradually increased C from 268 in 2016 to 713 in 2019 [Figure 2] Case reports, photo essays, and ophthalmic images increase the denominator for the calculation of the impact factor and potentially drive it down because of their relatively lower citations as compared to original articles and review articles In February 2020, the General Body of the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) wisely approved to provide a dedicated channel for case reports, photo essays, and ophthalmic images by initiating a companion journalC IJO Case Reports, while the main IJO will concentrate on original articles and reviews","output":"Indian Journal of Ophthalmology - A new direction"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corporate Social Responsibility is a voluntary strategy by companies, which integrates a set of actions that contribute to sustainable development.

Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of the nucleic acid test as well as long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examination, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at the fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms. Methods We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from Jan 31 to Feb 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls. We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups, and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection and made relevant comparisons to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (9?5 109/L) or lymphopenia (<1?1 109/L). Findings Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (9?5 109/L), lymphopenia (<1?1 109/L), eosinopenia (<0?02 109/L), and elevated hs-CRP (4 mg/L) were presented in 95?0%, 52?2%, 74?7% and 86?7% of COVID-19 patients, much higher than 87?2%, 28?8%, 31?3% and 45?2% of the controls, respectively. The eosinopenia produced a sensitivity of 74?7% and specificity of 68?7% for separating the two groups with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0?717. The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP yielded a sensitivity of 67?9% and specificity of 78?2% (AUC=0?730). The addition of eosinopenia alone or the combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP into the guideline-recommended diagnostic parameters for COVID-19 improved the predictive capacity with higher than zero of both net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Interpretation The combination of eosinopenia and elevated hs-CRP can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic with COVID-19-like initial symptoms. This finding would be particularly useful for designing triage strategies in an epidemic region having a large number of patients with COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases while limited medical resources for nucleic acid tests and radiographic examination.

However, data showing little improvement in the overall proportion of URMs in many health professions, despite widespread use of holistic review, suggest that relatively few programs using holistic review admit substantial proportions of underrepresented minorities. Therefore, more research is needed to understand factors that facilitate holistic review practices that successfully promote diverse student enrollment. The literature suggests that a supportive organizational culture is necessary for holistic review to be effective; yet, the influence of culture on admissions has not been directly studied. This study employs a qualitative, multiple case study approach to explore the influence of a culture that values diversity and inclusion ('diversity culture') on holistic review practices in two physician assistant educational programs that met criteria consistent with a proposed conceptual framework linking diversity culture to holistic admissions associated with high URM student enrollment (relative to other similar programs). Data from multiple sources were collected at each program during the 2018-2019 admissions cycle, and a coding manual derived from the conceptual framework facilitated directed content analysis and comparison of program similarities and differences. Consistent with the conceptual framework, diversity culture appeared to be a strong driver of holistic admissions practices that support enrolling diverse classes of students.

Given that there is neither a vaccine nor proven treatment for COVID-19, there is currently an urgent need for effective pharmacotherapy. To address the need for an effective treatment of SARS-CoV-2 during the worldwide pandemic, this systematic review of intravenous (IV) remdesivir was performed. Remdesivir, an anti-viral prodrug originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease, has shown broad spectrum activity against the Coronavirus family. A recent case report reported improvement of clinical symptoms with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19. After conducting a systematic search of 18 clinical trial registries and three large scientific databases, we identified 86 potentially eligible items. Following removal of duplicates (n = 21), eligible studies were reviewed independently by two authors. After the first round of screening, inter-rater agreement was 98.5% (&#954; = 0.925).

Acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalitis (AHNE), though rare, can be seen in patients with severe infection and is associated with devastating neurologic outcomes. The true prevalence of this syndrome is unknown due to underrecognition, difficulty in timely acquisition of neuroimaging, and high mortality in this subset of patients escaping detection. It is a distinct clinicoradiological syndrome, with patients suffering from rapidly worsening encephalopathy and coma within the first two weeks of severe illness and hemorrhagic necrotizing parenchymal changes on neuroimaging. The pathophysiology of this syndrome is unclear but hypothesized to occur due to cytokine storm, blood-brain-barrier dysfunction, and direct viral-mediated endotheliopathy. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion in patients who have unexplained persistent severe encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 infection. Most patients have elevated systemic inflammatory markers and severe lung disease with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. MRI is the imaging modality of choice, with a distinct neuroimaging pattern. CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) studies have a low yield for viral particle detection with currently available testing.

However, it is unknown whether the pandemic has changed mortality rates for people with epilepsy. We aimed to compare mortality rates in people with epilepsy in Wales during the pandemic with pre-pandemic rates. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study using individual-level linked population-scale anonymised electronic health records. We identified deaths in people with epilepsy (DPWE), i.e. those with a diagnosis of epilepsy, and deaths associated with epilepsy (DAE), where epilepsy was recorded as a cause of death on death certificates. We compared death rates in 2020 with average rates in 2015C2019 using Poisson models to calculate death rate ratios. RESULTS: There were 188 DAE and 628 DPWE in Wales in 2020 (death rates: 7.7/100,000/year and 25.7/100,000/year). The average rates for DAE and DPWE from 2015 to 2019 were 5.8/100,000/year and 23.8/100,000/year, respectively. Death rate ratios (2020 compared to 2015C2019) for DAE were 1.34 (95%CI 1.14C1.57, p<0.001) and for DPWE were 1.08 (0.99C1.17, p = 0.09).

Leucomethylene Blue (reduced form of MB, colorless) may be applied for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the scientific evidences. In severe patients, there is a cytokine storm (hyperinflammation) and high oxidative stress (OS). Inflammation and OS has a mutual correlation and exacerbate each other. In human body, MB first induces OS through absorbing electron (like a free radical) from other molecules, if the body could counteract to this OS, then reduced MB decreases OS through other mechanisms. Reduced MB could prevent inflammation, propagation of the virus RNA, and also improves hypoxia through reducing methemoglobin. Therefore, to avoid the increment of OS, we suggest using Leucomethylene Blue through the following protocol: The IV cocktail contains 50 mg MB (1mg/kg, 50-kg weight), 1000-2000 mg vitamin C, 500-1000 mg N-Acetylcysteine (or glutathione or cysteine or a-lipoic acid) and 10-20 gr urea (optional) in 100 ml dextrose 5%.

In order to evaluate this trend, we analyzed the literature data published since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, in addition to our intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU) experience. This analysis showed (i) a reduction of the overall ICCU admissions up to 50%; (ii) a 40-50% reduction of ACS admissions, greater for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) than for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); (iii) a reduction greater than 50% of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary angioplasty; (iv) a higher time delay of STEMI; and (v) a higher number of ICCU admissions for non-primarily cardiac problems. In conclusion, the lockdown imposed due to the spread of COVID-19 infection has led to a change in the number and type of cardiology admissions. It seems therefore necessary that patients, especially for time-dependent diseases such as ACS, continue to refer to hospital care; that contemporary standard of care for acute cardiac disease should be guaranteed, and that intensivist cardiologists acquire specific skills for the treatment of patients with clinical conditions normally treated by other specialists.","output":"Impatto della pandemia COVID-19 sui ricoveri per sindrome coronarica acuta: revisione della letteratura ed esperienza monocentrica./ [Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on admissions for acute coronary syndrome: review of the literature and single-center experience]"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) caused a global panic due to its high morbidity and mortality during 2002 and 2003. Soon after the deadly disease outbreak, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional cellular receptor in vitro and in vivo for SARS-CoV spike protein. However, ACE2 solely is not sufficient to allow host cells to become susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, and other host factors may be involved in SARS-CoV spike protein-ACE2 complex. RESULTS: A host intracellular filamentous cytoskeletal protein vimentin was identified by immunoprecipitation and LC-MS/MS analysis following chemical cross-linking on Vero E6 cells that were pre-incubated with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Moreover, flow cytometry data demonstrated an increase of the cell surface vimentin level by 16.5 % after SARS-CoV permissive Vero E6 cells were treated with SARS-CoV virus-like particles (VLPs). A direct interaction between SARS-CoV spike protein and host surface vimentin was further confirmed by far-Western blotting. In addition, antibody neutralization assay and shRNA knockdown experiments indicated a vital role of vimentin in cell binding and uptake of SARS-CoV VLPs and the viral spike protein. CONCLUSIONS: A direct interaction between vimentin and SARS-CoV spike protein during viral entry was observed.

However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this complication remain unclear. A better understanding of causative processes by which COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment is essential for developing preventive interventions. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a network-based, multimodal genomics comparison of COVID-19 and neurologic complications. We constructed the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome from protein-protein interaction assay and CRISPR-Cas9 based genetic assay results, and compared network-based relationships therein with those of known neurological manifestations using network proximity measures. We also investigated the transcriptomic profiles (including single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing) of Alzheimers disease (AD) marker genes from patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the brains of AD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found significant network-based relationships between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and brain microvascular injury pathways and processes which are implicated in AD. We also detected aberrant expression of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with COVID-19. While transcriptomic analyses showed relatively low expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in human brain, neuroinflammatory changes were pronounced. In addition, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors (BSG and FURIN) and antiviral defense genes (LY6E, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFNAR1) was significantly elevated in brain endothelial cells of AD patients and healthy controls relative to neurons and other cell types, suggesting a possible role for brain microvascular injury in COVID-19-mediated cognitive impairment. Notably, individuals with the AD risk allele APOE E4/E4 displayed reduced levels of antiviral defense genes compared to APOE E3/E3 individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest significant mechanistic overlap between AD and COVID-19, strongly centered on neuroinflammation and microvascular injury. These results help improve our understanding of COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations and provide guidance for future development of preventive or treatment interventions.","output":"Network medicine links SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection to brain microvascular injury and neuroinflammation in dementia-like cognitive impairment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article presents the results of research aimed at analysing the share of fractions suitable for recycling and pollutants in waste collected in a yellow bag.

METHODS: Inpatients from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, in seven hospitals in Shandong Province were studied. The random number table was used to randomly divide the seven hospitals into two groups (training set and verification set). In the training set, the least absolute shrinkage selection operator regression was first used to screen the independent variables. Logistic regression was then applied to construct a survival prediction model. The following nomogram visualizes the prediction model results. Finally, C-indices, calibration curves, and decision curves were used to discriminate and calibrate the established model and evaluate its practicability in the clinic. Bootstrap resampling and the verification set were used for internal and external verification, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 424 eligible patients were included in the model construction and verification. In this 5-year survival prediction model of patients with CHF induced by CHD, eight independent predictors were included. The series of C-indices for the training set, bootstrap resamples, and verification set was 0.885, 0.867, and 0.835, respectively, demonstrating the credibility of our model. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and clinical decision curve analysis of the training and verification sets showed that this 5-year survival prediction model was good in discrimination, calibration, and clinical practicability. CONCLUSION: This work highlights eight independent factors affecting 5-year mortality in patients with CHF induced by CHD after discharge and further helps reallocate medical resources rationally by precisely identifying high-risk groups. The constructed prediction model not only plays a credible role in prediction but also demonstrates TCM intervention as a protective factor for the 5-year death of patients with CHF induced by CHD, thereby advancing the use of TCM in CHF.","output":"A 5-Year Survival Prediction Model for Chronic Heart Failure Patients Induced by Coronary Heart Disease with Traditional Chinese Medicine Intervention"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Differential diagnosis between Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy can be difficult, especially because in early phase they might present with overlapping clinical features.

These coinfections may increase the risk of disease severity and pose challenges to the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of COVID-19. There have been limited SARS-CoV-2 coinfection studies. In this retrospective study, residual nucleic acid extracts from 796 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-positive specimens, collected between March 2020 and February 2021, were analyzed using a Luminex NxTAG respiratory pathogen panel (RPP). Of these, 745 returned valid results and were used for analysis; 53 (7.1%) were positive for one or more additional pathogens. Six different respiratory viruses were detected among the 53 SARS-CoV-2-positive patient specimens, and 7 of those specimens tested positive for more than one additional respiratory virus. The most common pathogens include rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) (n = 22, 41.51%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (n = 18, 33.9%), and adenovirus (n = 12, 22.6%).

These protective measures intensified after the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to reduce the risk of viral transmission. It is the rationale that this practice reduces nosocomial infections. We evaluated the impact of these protective measures on nosocomial infections in our center with more than 20,000 records of annual patient admission. In a retrospective study, we evaluated the incidence of nosocomial infections in Sina hospital for 9 months (AprilCDecember 2020) during the COVID-19 period and compared it with the 8 months in the pre-COVID period (AprilCNovember 2019). Despite decreasing the number of admissions during the COVID era (hospitalizations showed a reduction of 43.79%), the total hospital nosocomial infections remained unchanged; 4.73% in the pre-COVID period versus 4.78% during the COVID period. During the COVID period the infection percentages increased in the cardiovascular care unit (p-value = 0.002) and intensive care units (p-value = 0.045), and declined in cardiology (p-value = 0.046) and neurology (p-value = 0.019) wards.

Still, we saw increased nosocomial infection in some wards, e.g., the intensive care unit (ICU) and coronary care unit (CCU). Thus, enhanced infection prevention protocols implemented in hospitals to prevent the spread of a pandemic infection may not always decrease rates of other hospital-acquired infections during a pandemic.

Mechanical forces are implicated in the progression of emphysema that is a major pathologic feature of COPD. We hypothesized that resistive breathing exacerbates emphysema. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 0.75 units of pancreatic porcine elastase intratracheally to develop emphysema. Resistive breathing was applied by suturing a nylon band around the trachea to reduce surface area to half for the last 24 or 72 hours of a 21-day time period after elastase treatment in total. Following RB (24 or 72 hours), lung mechanics were measured and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Emphysema was quantified by the mean linear intercept (Lm) and the destructive index (DI) in lung tissue sections. Results: Following 21 days of intratracheal elastase exposure, Lm and DI increased in lung tissue sections [Lm (m), control 39.090.76, elastase 62.052.19, p=0.003 and DI, ctr 30.952.75, elastase 73.121.75, p<0.001].

For general communities, epidemic modeling based on social networks is being recognized as a useful tool. However, disease propagation may occur in a healthcare facility in a manner different from that in a urban community setting due to different network architecture. We simulate stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered dynamics on social networks, which are based on observations in a hospital in Tokyo, to explore effective containment strategies against nosocomial infection. The observed social networks in the hospital have hierarchical and modular structure in which dense substructure such as departments, wards, and rooms, are globally but only loosely connected, and do not reveal extremely right-skewed distributions of the number of contacts per individual. We show that healthcare workers, particularly medical doctors, are main vectors (i.e. transmitters) of diseases on these networks. Intervention methods that restrict interaction between medical doctors and their visits to different wards shrink the final epidemic size more than intervention methods that directly protect patients, such as isolating patients in single rooms. By the same token, vaccinating doctors with priority rather than patients or nurses is more effective. Finally, vaccinating individuals with large betweenness centrality (frequency of mediating connection between pairs of individuals along the shortest paths) is superior to vaccinating ones with large connectedness to others or randomly chosen individuals, which was suggested by previous model studies.","output":"Controlling nosocomial infection based on structure of hospital social networks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article documents, contextualizes, and theorizes the significance of technological divides and inequalities of access, along with diverse accommodations, adaptations, resistances, and alternatives to health and communications technologies that have unfolded in two South American countries during the COVID-19 emergency: Ecuador and Argentina.

While interview data from both countries emphasize deepening crises of poverty and inequality that reverberate in differential access and usage of communications technologies, there are distinct patterns with regard to confidence in medical systems and public health information. In Argentina, citizens may question or doubt official sources of information and public health systems but, on the whole, tend to maintain higher levels of cautious trust, while in Ecuador, an erosion of trust, along with higher levels of cultural diversity, drives an adaptive response towards systems and practices of medical pluralism, particularly in indigenous and rural contexts.

We provide analytical results that accurately predict the expected epidemic size and probability of emergence as functions of the characteristics of the spreading process (e.g., transmission probabilities, inward and outward efficiency of the masks, etc.), the proportion of mask-wearers in the population, and the structure of the underlying contact network. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we also conduct extensive simulations on random networks. We also comment on the analogy between the mask-model studied here and the multiple-strain viral spreading model with mutations studied recently by Eletreby et al. ? 2021 American Automatic Control Council.","output":"Analysis of the Impact of Mask-wearing in Viral Spread: Implications for COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"What written consolations might we turn to in this time of COVID-19?","output":"Literature and science converge in a pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a relapsing brain disorder characterized by compulsion and chronicity.

In vitro studies demonstrated how anti-A and anti-B antibodies neutralized the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, here we describe the inflammatory response of COVID-19 patients in the context of the blood group aiming to assess the lower severity status found in group O patients.Methods: Prospective and consecutive study including blood samples from 108 adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted to the Hospital Clnico Universitario Valladolid, Spain between March 24 and April 11 2020. Patients were divided according to their ABO blood group. Plasma aliquots were analyzed, in duplicate, for the quantification of 45 mediators by MAGPIX system (Luminex). Statistical analysis was performed using the R statistical package version 4.0.2 Findings: We found a lower risk (2.16 times) of mechanical ventilation or death in patients with blood group O [Log Rank: p=0.042, Hazard Ratio: 0.463, CI 95% (0.213-1.004), p=0.050]. Moreover, 15 cytokines were significantly over-expressed (and only one under-expressed) in blood group O. Last, a multivariate model found BDNF, IL-13 and IL-27 as the best cytokines able to differentiate the immune profile based on blood group. Interpretation: Our cohort showed how blood group O was associated with both lower rates of hospital admission and a lower risk of intubation or death. Indeed, these patients produced higher amounts of cytokines in response to SARS-CoV-2, hence mounting an effective immune response which allowed them to control the viral infection and therefore decrease the risk of further complications.Funding Statement: This research was funded by Instituto de Salud Carlos III, grant number COV20/00491.Declaration of Interests: Alvaro Tamayo-Velasco declares no conflict of interest. - Mara Jess Pe?arrubia-Ponce declares no conflict of interest. - Francisco Javier lvarez declares no conflict of interest. - Hugo Gonzalo-Benito declares no conflict of interest. - Ignacio de la Fuente declares no conflict of interest. - Sonia Prez Gonzlez declares no conflict of interest. - Luca Rico declares no conflict of interest. - Mara Teresa Jimnez-Garca declares no conflict of interest. - Alba Snchez-Rodrguez declares no conflict of interest. - Milagros Hijas-Villaizan declares no conflict of interest. - Marta Martn Fernndez declares no conflict of interest. - Carlos Due?as declares no conflict of interest. - Esther Gmez-Snchez declares no conflict of interest. - Mara Heredia-Rodrguez declares no conflict of interest. - scar Gorgojo-Galindo declares no conflict of interest. - Itziar Fernndez declares no conflict of interest. - Lourdes del Ro declares no conflict of interest. - Irene Carnicero-Frutos declares no conflict of interest. - Mara Fe Mu?oz-Moreno declares no conflict of interest. - Eduardo Tamayo declares no conflict of interest. - David Bernardo declares no conflict of interest. - Pedro Martnez-Paz declares no conflict of interest.Ethics Approval Statement: The study was approved by the Hospital's Clinical Ethics Committee (CEIm) and approval was obtained from all study participants (cod: PI 20-1717).","output":"High Cytokine Levels in O Blood Group Determine Protection Against Mechanical Ventilation or Mortality Risk in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Nonunion after posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) is associated with poor long-term outcomes in terms of health-related quality of life. Biomechanical factors in the fusion segment may influence spinal fusion rates. There are no reports on the relationship between intervertebral union and the absorption of autografts or vertebral endplates. Therefore, the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the risk factors of nonunion after PLIF and identify preventive measures. METHODS The authors analyzed 138 patients who underwent 1-level PLIF between 2016 and 2018 (75 males, 63 females; mean age 67 years; minimum follow-up period 12 months). Lumbar CT images obtained soon after the surgery and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up were examined for the mean total occupancy rate of the autograft, presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate (more than 50% of vertebral diameter), cage subsidence, and screw loosening. Complete intervertebral union was defined as the presence of both upper and lower complete fusion in the center cage regions on coronal and sagittal CT slices at 12 months postoperatively. Patients were classified into either union or nonunion groups. RESULTS Complete union after PLIF was observed in 62 patients (45%), while nonunion was observed in 76 patients (55%). The mean total occupancy rate of the autograft immediately after the surgery was higher in the union group than in the nonunion group (59% vs 53%; p = 0.046). At 12 months postoperatively, the total occupancy rate of the autograft had decreased by 5.4% in the union group and by 11.9% in the nonunion group (p = 0.020). A translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery was observed in 14 and 38 patients (23% and 50%) in the union and nonunion groups, respectively (p = 0.001). The nonunion group had a significantly higher proportion of cases with cage subsidence and screw loosening at 12 months postoperatively in comparison to the union group (p = 0.010 and p = 0.009, respectively). CONCLUSIONS A lower occupancy rate of the autograft and the presence of a translucent zone between the autograft and endplate immediately after the surgery were associated with nonunion at 12 months after PLIF. It may be important to achieve sufficient contact between the autograft and endplate intraoperatively for osseous union enhancement and to avoid excessive absorption of the autograft. The achievement of complete intervertebral union may decrease the incidence of cage subsidence or screw loosening.","output":"Impact of sufficient contact between the autograft and endplate soon after surgery to prevent nonunion at 12 months following posterior lumbar interbody fusion."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Haemodialysis (HD) patients are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection. Although all dialysis patients meet government criteria for shielding, only those on home treatment can comply. Patients attending incentre HD units represent a large and vulnerable group, who are unable to rigorously adhere to this advice. The need to adopt strategies to protect these patients is of great importance. We report our experience of delivering dialysis during the COVID-19 outbreak, describing the interventions taken to try to protect patients from virus transmission whilst maintaining optimal treatment. METHODS: We implemented measures, including use of; a system of active triage and isolation of suspected cases, separate transportation, a dedicated COVID-19 HD unit, personal protective equipment, active repatriation of patients back to base units. We collected data from all COVID-19 positive HD patients in our cohort, between 14/03/2020 - 20/04/2020. Data were compared to national reports of other units, and values obtained from a dialysis-specific Susceptible-Infectious-Removed model which predicted the impact of COVID-19 on our cohort. RESULTS: Results showed 76/670 (11.3%) tested positive for COVID-19. The majority were male (61.8%) and from a minority background (61.8%). 7/76 (9.2%) patients died following infection. The model projections overestimated the incidence of COVID-19, 221 vs 76 total number of infections by 20/4/20. Our incidence of COVID-19 and mortality are lower compared to other units across London.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

The findings reveal significant negative economic consequences of the COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020 and show that most cities will converge to a level of disposable income which is much less than the Pre-COVID level if the COVID pandemic persists. Regional income inequality has intensified in the cities that have a longer duration of stringent social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic and disappeared in the cities with policies of short duration. Disposable income per capita for urban residents recovered quickly when the transmission of coronavirus was effectively contained; and yet the impact of the pandemic on rural residents remains unresolved, if not intensified. This study demonstrates a significant divergence of the trend of disposable income across cities with different durations of social distancing policies and between urban and rural residents. It also highlights the importance of stringent social distancing policies in containing the spread of virus in a short time and calls for special policy attention for rural regions in the recovery from the COVID-19.","output":"COVID-19 and Regional Income Inequality in China"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Activity and safety of the SARS-CoV2 BNT162b2 vaccine in actively treated patients with solid tumors is currently unknown. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 326 patients with solid tumors treated with anti-cancer medications to determine the proportion of cancer patients with immunogenicity against SARS-CoV2, following two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Control group was comprised of 164 vaccinated healthy adults. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S IgG (Immunoglobulin G) antibodies (Abs) were measured, using level>50 AU/ml as cutoff for seropositivity. Adverse effects were collected using a questionnaire. All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Most patients (205, 62.9%) were treated with chemotherapy, either alone or with additional therapy, 55 (16.9%) were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and 38 (11.7%) with targeted therapy alone, 28 (8.6%) received other combinations. The vaccine was well tolerated and no severe side effects were reported. Among patients with cancer 39 (11.9%) were seronegative, compared to 5 (3.0%) of the control group (P=0.001). Median IgG titers were statistically significant lower among patients with cancer compared to control (931 AU/ml vs. 2817 AU/ml, P=0.003). Seronegativity proportions were higher in the chemotherapy treated group (19, 18.8%) compared to the ICI-treated patients (5, 9.1%) and to those treated with targeted therapy (1, 2.6%) (P=0.02. Titers were also statistically significant different among treatment types (P=0.002). CONCLUSION: The BNT162b2 vaccine is safe and effective in actively treated patients with cancer. The relatively lower antibody titers and lower proportion of seropositive patients, especially among chemotherapy treated patients, call for continuing the use of personal protective measures in these patients, even following vaccination.","output":"Immunogenicity and Safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine Among Actively Treated Cancer Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The article dwells on the changes that the information society has brought to all spheres of human life, education being one of them.

The sitting position is known to cause physiological changes related to cardiovascular adaptation. Interscalene nerve blocks (ISB) are the most commonly used techniques and are considered gold standard regional anesthesia methods for shoulder surgeries. Cerebral vessels located around sympathetic ganglia provide sympathetic system integrity. This local anesthetic spreading during ISB could be a side effect or provide a protective effect on cerebral ischemia. Our study aimed to investigate the cerebral protective effect of the ISB in arthroscopic shoulder surgeries in a sitting position. Material and methods After the approval of Ko? University Clinical Research Ethics Committee (2020.020.IRB1.011), records of patients between January and December 2019 with shoulder arthroscopy at the Vehbi Ko? Foundation (VKV) American hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Records of the hemodynamic response, INVOSTM (Medtronic, Minneapolis, USA) (rSO2) parameters, pain scores, and additional analgesic needs of all cases were examined in the intraoperative and postoperative period. Results Data of 40 patients who met the criteria to be included in the study was analyzed. Our study showed that the sitting position leading to hypotension coincided with a decrease in INVOS values. Nevertheless, we did not record any significant hypotension after ISB, and this may be due to the use of a minimal dose of local anesthetic. There was a certain increase in near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) values ??after ISB. We saw that the value of regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) increased on both the ISB side and the non-ISB side. This shows that the ISB can have a global impact on the brain. Specificially, the increase in rSO2 values ??in the ISB side compared to the other side suggests that ISB has possible positive effects on cerebral blood flow. Conclusion Our study has shown that ISB may transiently increase the rSO2 levels in the sitting position during shoulder surgery.","output":"Could Interscalene Block Possibly be Protective Against Cerebral Ischemia During Shoulder Surgery in a Beach Chair Position?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Although some epidemiological studies have investigated the association between Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and the development of kidney cancer, the results are far from consistent. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to determine the association. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane database were searched from January 1, 1975 to January 7, 2020. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were performed independently by 2 authors. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. In all, 16 studies (11 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) involving a total of 391,071 HCV patients and 38,333,839 non-HCV controls were included. The overall analysis showed a 47% higher risk to develop kidney cancer among the patients with HCV infection (pooled OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 87.6%); The multivariable meta-regression showed that study design, age, sample size, and HIV coinfection were significant sources of variance, and totally accounted for 82% of the I2 . The risk of KC in HCV patients was further increased in studies without HCV/HBV- and HCV/HIV- co-infection (pooled OR 1.66; 95%CI 1.23-2.24). Multiple sensitivity analyses did not change the significant association. The present meta-analysis indicated that HCV infected patients have a significantly higher risk of developing kidney cancer.

We describe the role of a medical recovery site for isolation of recently released inmates with active COVID-19 infection in reducing household transmission of cases tied to the correctional facility. METHODS: On April 16(th), an individual was contact traced to the correctional facility and was laboratory-confirmed positive, an asymptomatic index case in the jail. Testing of all inmates continued from April 16(th)-30(th). On April 24(th), decarceration began. All inmates released from facility April 24(th)-April 30(th) were contact traced for 14 days to monitor for new household cases. On April 30(th), the tribe opened a medical recovery site for isolation. After opening, all individuals with active infection agreed to go to site after release. RESULTS: Between April 24(th)-30(th), 16 inmates were released from facility, seven were laboratory-confirmed positive. Secondary infections only occurred in households of positives. Of the seven households, four experienced secondary transmission of virus. There were 27 household contacts, six secondary infections (secondary attack rate of 30.0%). There were four hospitalizations and one death, though cause of death was not due to COVID-19 despite incidental finding. After opening of medical recovery site, all individuals with active infection (12 cases) agreed to isolation at site.

SARS-CoV-2 has continued to evolve with the emergence of several novel variants, and amino acid changes in the RBD have been implicated with increased fitness and potential for immune evasion. Reliably predicting the effect of amino acid changes on the ability of the RBD to interact more strongly with the hACE2 can help assess the implications for public health and the potential for spillover and adaptation into other animals. Here, we introduce a two-step framework that first relies on 48 independent 4-ns molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of RBD?hACE2 variants to collect binding energy terms decomposed into Coulombic, covalent, van der Waals, lipophilic, generalized Born solvation, hydrogen bonding, ? packing, and self-contact correction terms. The second step implements a neural network to classify and quantitatively predict binding affinity changes using the decomposed energy terms as descriptors. The computational base achieves a validation accuracy of 82.8% for classifying singleCamino acid substitution variants of the RBD as worsening or improving binding affinity for hACE2 and a correlation coefficient of 0.73 between predicted and experimentally calculated changes in binding affinities. Both metrics are calculated using a fivefold cross-validation test. Our method thus sets up a framework for screening binding affinity changes caused by unknown singleC and multipleCamino acid changes offering a valuable tool to predict host adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 variants toward tighter hACE2 binding.","output":"Computational prediction of the effect of amino acid changes on the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD and human ACE2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"At the outset of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, New York City faced the highest burden of COVID-19 cases in the United States.

Children with CAS with this pattern still evidenced procedural learning gains by the fifth sequenced block. In contrast, children with SSD and typical development with this pattern showed poor procedural learning outcomes and were characterized by lower scores on language and motor assessments as well. Conclusions This research provides partial support for the procedural learning deficit hypothesis in children with CAS and for a subset of children with SSD as well. Future research should examine the role of a serial reaction time task in identifying children at risk of multisystem communication and motor deficits.

The underlying immunopathology of that failure and how it compares to other causes of severe respiratory distress, such as influenza virus infection, are not fully understood. Here we addressed this by developing a prospective observational cohort of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with varying degrees of disease severity and assessing the quality and magnitude of their immune responses at the cellular and protein level. Additionally, we performed single-cell RNA transcriptional profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from select subjects. The cohort consists of 79 COVID-19 subjects, 26 influenza subjects, and 15 control subjects, including 35 COVID-19 and 7 influenza subjects with acute respiratory failure. While COVID-19 subjects exhibited largely equivalent or greater activated lymphocyte counts compared to influenza subjects, they had fewer monocytes and lower surface HLA-class II expression on monocytes compared to influenza subjects and controls. At least two distinct immune profiles were observed by cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients: 3 of 71 patients were characterized by extreme inflammation, with greater than or equal to ~50% of the 35 cytokines measured greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean level of other severe patients (both influenza and COVID-19); the other immune profile, which characterized 68 of 71 subjects, had a mixed inflammatory signature, where 28 of 35 cytokines in COVID-19 patients had lower mean cytokine levels, though not all were statistically significant. Only 2 cytokines were higher in COVID-19 subjects compared to influenza subjects (IL-6 and IL-8). Influenza and COVID-19 patients could be distinguished statistically based on cytokine module expression, particularly after controlling for the significant effects of age on cytokine expression, but again with lower levels of most cytokines in COVID-19 subjects. Further, high circulating levels of IL-1RA and IL-6 were associated with increased odds of intubation in the combined influenza and COVID-19 cohort [OR = 3.93 and 4.30, respectively] as well as among only COVID-19 patients. Single cell transcriptional profiling of COVID-19 and influenza subjects with respiratory failure identified profound suppression in type I and type II interferon signaling in COVID-19 patients across multiple clusters. In contrast, COVID-19 cell clusters were enriched for alterations in metabolic, stress, and apoptotic pathways. These alterations were consistent with an increased glucocorticoid response in COVID-19 patients compared to influenza. When considered across the spectrum of innate and adaptive immune profiles, the immune pathologies underlying severe influenza and COVID-19 are substantially distinct. The majority of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure do not have a cytokine storm phenotype but instead exhibit profound type I and type II IFN immunosuppression when compared to patients with acute influenza. Upregulation of a small number of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, predicts acute respiratory failure in both COVID-19 and influenza patients.","output":"Targeted Immunosuppression Distinguishes COVID-19 from Influenza in Moderate and Severe Disease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To recover from the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on construction and to avoid further losses to the industry in future pandemics, the resilience of construction industry needs to be enhanced against infectious diseases.

Objective: In this cohort study, we aimed to report the disease characteristics and variables associated with COVID-19 outcome among Turkish patients with IRDs. Methods: Between April and June, 2020, 167 adult IRD patients with COVID-19 were registered from 31 centers in 14 cities in Turkey. Disease outcome was classified in 4 categories; (i) outpatient management, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen requirement, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen requirement, and (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine variables associated with a worse outcome. Results: 165 patients (mean age: 50  15.6 years, 58.2% female) were included. Twenty-four patients (14.5%) recovered under outpatient management, 141 (85.5%) were hospitalized, 49 (30%) required inpatient oxygen support, 22 (13%) were treated in the ICU (17 received invasive mechanic ventilation) and 16 (10%) died.

ALF has different causes, but the clinical characteristics are strikingly similar. In clinical practice, however, inconsistency in the definition of ALF worldwide and confusion regarding the existence of pre-existing liver disease raise diagnostic dilemmas. ALF mortality rates used to be over 80% in the past; however, survival rates on medical treatment have significantly improved in recent years due to a greater understanding of pathophysiology and advances in critical care management. The survival rates in acetaminophen-associated ALF have become close to the post-transplant survival rates. Given that liver transplantation (LT) is an expensive treatment that involves a major surgical operation in critically ill patients and lifelong immunosuppression, it is very important to select accurate patients who may benefit from it. Still, emergency LT remains a lifesaving procedure for many ALF patients. However, there is a lack of consistency in current prognostic models that hampers the selection of transplant candidates in a timely and precise manner. The other problems associated with LT in ALF are the shortage of graft, development of contraindications on the waiting list, vaguely defined delisting criteria, time constraints for pre-transplant evaluation, ethical concerns, and comparatively poor post-transplant outcomes in ALF. Therefore, there is a desperate need to establish accurate prognostic models and explore the roles of evolving adjunctive and alternative therapies, such as liver support systems, plasma exchange, stem cells, auxiliary LT, and so on, to enhance transplant-free survival and to fill the void created by the graft shortage","output":"Liver transplantation in acute liver failure: Dilemmas and challenges"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolisms (PE) are life\\\\threatening medical events, and early identification of patients experiencing a PE is essential to optimizing patient outcomes. Current tools for risk stratification of PE patients are limited and unable to predict PE events before their occurrence. OBJECTIVE: We developed a machine learning algorithm (MLA) designed to identify patients at risk of PE before the clinical detection of onset in an inpatient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three machine learning (ML) models were developed on electronic health record data from 63,798 medical and surgical inpatients in a large US medical center. These models included logistic regression, neural network, and gradient boosted tree (XGBoost) models. All models used only routinely collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory information as inputs. All were evaluated for their ability to predict PE at the first time patient vital signs and lab measures required for the MLA to run were available. Performance was assessed with regard to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity. RESULTS: The model trained using XGBoost demonstrated the strongest performance for predicting PEs. The XGBoost model obtained an AUROC of 0.85, a sensitivity of 81%, and a specificity of 70%. The neural network and logistic regression models obtained AUROCs of 0.74 and 0.67, sensitivity of 81% and 81%, and specificity of 44% and 35%, respectively.

The aim of this study is to examine: (i) how two different dimensions of trust (general/institutional) are associated with alcohol use among adolescents; (ii) how these dimensions interact with alcohol use; and (iii) whether the associations are moderated by sex, parenting, health, school satisfaction or economic disadvantage. METHODS A nationwide sample of 5549 adolescents (aged 15-16 years) in Sweden answered a questionnaire in school. General and institutional trust were measured with five items each. Logistic regressions were used to examine associations between drinking and the trust dimensions, and the cross-combinations of these. Moderation by sex, parenting, health, school satisfaction and economic disadvantage was tested. RESULTS General and institutional trust were both significantly associated with drinking. High scores on both dimensions simultaneously were associated with the lowest probability of drinking, and low scores on both with the highest. Low institutional trust had a stronger association than low general trust. The combination of high institutional/low general trust was more protective than low institutional/high general trust. The association between general trust and drinking was moderated by school satisfaction, and the relationship between institutional trust and drinking was moderated by parental support and control.

Oxygen saturation (SpO2) and other measures were tested as predictors of in-hospital mortality in survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 140 patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia, 72 (51.4%) were men, with a median age of 60 years. Patients with SpO2 values of 90% or less were older and were more likely to be men, to have hypertension, and to present with dyspnea than those with SpO2 values greater than 90%. Overall, 36 patients (25.7%) died during hospitalization after median 14-day follow-up. Higher SpO2 levels after oxygen supplementation were associated with reduced mortality independently of age and sex (hazard ratio per 1-U SpO2, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.91 to 0.95; P<.001). The SpO2 cutoff value of 90.5% yielded 84.6% sensitivity and 97.2% specificity for prediction of survival.

The purpose of this study is to identify any specific placental histopathologic abnormalities associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, compare differences between mothers with symptomatic and asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and determine the frequency of vertical transmission. METHODS/CASE REPORT: Placentas from mothers diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy and delivered at Stony Brook University Hospital were identified. A control group of mothers with a negative COVID-19 test was selected from the same period. The frequency of histopathologic characteristics defined by the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group Consensus was compared using chi-square tests between the following cohorts: COVID-19 positive mothers against COVID-19 negative mothers and symptomatic COVID-19 mothers against asymptomatic COVID-19 positive mothers. RESULTS (IF A CASE STUDY ENTER NA): A retrospective study reviewed 23 placentas from mothers with COVID-19 for features of maternal vascular malperfusion, fetal vascular malperfusion, and inflammatory changes. 11 mothers displayed symptomatic COVID-19, and 12 mothers were asymptomatic. One neonate tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. No significant differences were identified in the frequency of the examined placental histopathologic characteristics between COVID-19 positive and negative mothers. The degree of COVID-19 severity did not significantly impact the frequency of examined histopathologic features. Interestingly, in the case with vertical transmission, the placenta demonstrated the only finding of chronic histiocytic intervillositis (CHI) with associated trophoblast necrosis.

We document the lessons learned through the impact on coordination and collaboration; workforce development and institutional capacity building; data use and dissemination; advocacy and policy impact; financial sustainability and community impact. Key lessons learned include the importance of multisectoral collaboration, vital role of data to support key populations visibility and advocacy efforts, and institutional capacity building of government agencies and key populations organizations. Given that traditional surveillance methodologies from routine data often do not capture these hidden populations, it will be important to ensure that Biobehavioral Surveillance Surveys are an integral part of ongoing HIV surveillance activities in Mozambique.","output":"Recognizing the hidden: strengthening the HIV surveillance system among key and priority populations in Mozambique"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present, to our knowledge, the first case of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) application in a 12-year-old child with arrhythmogenic inflammatory cardiomyopathy resulting from the overlap between autoimmune myocarditis and primary arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

CTX is a polycyclic neurotoxin produced by single-celled, photosynthetic dinoflagellates in the Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa genera which are found in close association with benthic autotrophs. CTX enters the food web when these dinoflagellates are inadvertently consumed by herbivores grazing on their preferred substrates. The toxin biomagnifies up the food chain to the top predators and if humans consume seafood with high levels of CTX it can cause a variety of flu-like symptoms. The best way to avoid CFP is to avoid toxic fishes. However, CTX is undetectable by physical inspection. This study investigated local fishers knowledge of ciguatera hotspots and coldspots along Puerto Rican coral reefs using toxic-dinoflagellate cell counts and by estimating fish toxicity in those sites using a cell-based Neuro-2a cytotoxicity assay. The fishers identified regions of high and low risk for CFP based on their local ecological knowledge (LEK) which were deemed hotspots and coldspots, respectively. There is a 35-fold difference in dinoflagellate cell counts of low-toxicity Gambierdiscus species in samples in the identified hotspot compared to the coldspot. Also, higher trophic level fishes (>3.4 ETL) had higher median estimates of CTX in their tissues at the hotspot than the same species in the coldspot.

In 2019, 263 such procedures were performed (77.7% more) in this facility. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pancreatic cancer surgery type, number and outcome in our center. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective data analysis of medical documentation in a hospital database from January 2019 till December 2020. RESULTS: In 2020, we observed an increase of tumors localized in the tail of the pancreas (P) - 29 cases (19.9%) in 2020 compared to 26 cases (9.9%) in 2019 (p = 0.005). In 2020, our patients presented with much greater advancement of the disease illustrated by the increased tumor size (median 3.5 cm in 2020 compared to 3.0 cm in 2019), although it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.073). In 2020, we performed more palliative procedures, e.g., bypassing anastomoses (17 (11.6%) in 2020 compared to 8 (3%) in 2019 (p < 0.001)), more open biopsies of P (21 (14.4%) in 2020 compared to 21 (7.9%) in 2019 (p = 0.041)), and more percutaneous biopsies of P (7 (4.8%) in 2020 and 0 in 2019 (p = 0.001)). We observed a significant decrease in the number of Whipple procedures (53 (36.3%) in 2020 and 125 (47.5%) in 2019 (p = 0.037)). The most common histopathological finding was adenocarcinoma of the P, accounting for 50% in 2020 and almost 52% of all tumor cases in 2019. In a group of 148 patients operated on due to a P tumor during the COVID-19 pandemic, only 6 patients died, which resulted in a mortality rate of 4.1% compared to 13.4% mortality rate in 2019 (34 deaths/263 patients; p = 0.005). We observed less leakage of gastrointestinal anastomosis (0/148 in 2020 and 10/263 in 2019 (p = 0.038)).

We illustrate its potential through consideration of optimising the balance between reducing the reproductive rate (R) of the virus and further opening of the economy. The framework accommodates both perspectives in the health-vs-economy debate whereby, depending on where we are within the marginal analysis framework, either health issues are allowed to dominate or, below some threshold of R and/or background level of infection, health and economic considerations can be traded off against each other. Given the inevitability of such trade-offs, the framework exposes crucial questions to be addressed, such as: the critical value of R and/or background infection, above which health considerations predominate, and which may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; and the value of lives forgone resulting from the small increases in R and/or background infection levels that may have to be tolerated as the economy is gradually opened.","output":"Health economics and emergence from COVID-19 lockdown: the great big marginal analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Many reports have documented that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the influents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) correlates with the actual epidemic situation in a given city.

Various locations such as residential areas of various sizes, hospitals, city center areas, student dormitories, transportation hubs (airport, bus terminal), and commercial areas were monitored together with four of the main Prague sewers. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by reverse transcription C multiplex quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-mqPCR) after the precipitation of nucleic acids with PEG 8,000 and RNA isolation with TRIzol?

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who developed chronic respiratory disease (CRD) following ECMO therapy, and investigate the association between newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRDs and 5-year all-cause mortality among ECMO survivors. METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health Insurance Service in South Korea. All adult patients who underwent ECMO therapy in the intensive care unit between 2006 and 2014 were included. ECMO survivors were defined as those who survived for 365 days after ECMO therapy. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, interstitial lung disease, lung cancer, lung disease due to external agents, obstructive sleep apnea, and lung tuberculosis were considered as CRDs. RESULTS: A total of 3055 ECMO survivors were included, and 345 (11.3%) were newly diagnosed with CRDs 365 days after ECMO therapy. The prevalence of asthma was the highest at 6.1% (185). In the multivariate logistic regression, ECMO survivors who underwent ECMO therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or respiratory failure had a 2.00-fold increase in post-ECMO CRD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39 to 2.89; P < 0.001). In the multivariate Cox regression, newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRD was associated with a 1.47-fold (95% CI: 1.17 to 1.86; P = 0.001) higher 5-year all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: At 12 months after ECMO therapy, 11.3% of ECMO survivors were newly diagnosed with CRDs. Patients who underwent ECMO therapy for ARDS or respiratory failure were associated with a higher incidence of newly diagnosed post-ECMO CRD compared to those who underwent ECMO for other causes. Additionally, post-ECMO CRDs were associated with a higher 5-year all-cause mortality.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional METHODS: The S19-HCPs is a self-administered online survey (16-item) developed and validated by the research team. The participants were invited to complete an online survey. Data collection started from June-July 2020 using a convenience sample of HCPs from Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Philippines, and Kuwait. RESULTS: A total number of 1726 participants were included in the final analysis. The majority of the study participants were Jordanians (22%), followed by Kuwaitis (19%), Filipinos (18%) and the lowest participants were Indonesians (6%).

METHODS In a multicenter IVT-register-based cohort study, we compared previously dependent (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, 3-5) versus independent (prestroke modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) patients. Outcome measures were poor 3-month outcome (not reaching at least prestroke modified Rankin Scale [dependent patients]; modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 [independent patients]), death, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (OR [95% confidence interval]) were calculated. RESULTS Among 7430 IVT-treated patients, 489 (6.6%) were dependent and 6941 (93.4%) were independent. Previous stroke, dementia, heart, and bone diseases were the most common causes of preexisting dependency. Dependent patients were more likely to die (ORunadjusted, 4.55 [3.74-5.53]; ORadjusted, 2.19 [1.70-2.84]). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred equally frequent (4.8% versus 4.5%). Poor outcome was more frequent in dependent (60.5%) than in independent (39.6%) patients, but the adjusted ORs were similar (ORadjusted, 0.95 [0.75-1.21]). Among survivors, the proportion of patients with poor outcome did not differ (35.7% versus 31.3%). After adjustment for age and stroke severity, the odds of poor outcome were lower in dependent patients (ORadjusted, 0.64 [0.49-0.84]). CONCLUSIONS IVT-treated stroke patients who were dependent on the daily help of others before stroke carry a higher mortality risk than previously independent patients. The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and the likelihood of poor outcome were not independently influenced by previous dependency. Among survivors, poor outcome was avoided at least as effectively in previously dependent patients.

Data at the country level were compiled from publicly available databases and analysed with gradient boosting regression trees after controlling for confounding factors (e.g. geographic location). We found a positive association between the number of COVID-19 cases in a given country and gross domestic product, number of tourists, and geographic longitude. The number of deaths was positively associated with gross domestic product, number of tourists in a country, and geographic longitude. The effects of gross domestic product and number of tourists were non-linear, with clear thresholds above which the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths increased rapidly. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was positively linked to the number of tourists and gross domestic product. The growth rate of COVID-19 cases was negatively associated with the mean age of the population and geographic longitude. Growth was slower in less urbanised countries.

This mediating effect is only significant at moderate to high levels of resilience, suggesting panic buying is a particular coping response of resilient individuals who experience anxiety after greater exposure to COVID-19 information. Anxiety was found to increase panic buying above that directly related to COVID-19 information exposure.Social implicationsFindings provide some guidance for policymakers where a nuanced approach to building and directing resilience and in directing information flows are needed to curtail panic buying within their Muslim populations.Originality/valueWhile the phenomenon of consumer stockpiling is referred to as panic buying, the findings suggest that anxiety plays a smaller role in the process than preparedness prompted by crisis-related information exposure.

The three stations in the second step of the procedure, the biographical one-on-one interview, presentation and discussion on a subject-specific topic as well as multiple mini interviews (MMI) on the social skills of the applicants were audiovisual and in real time in zoom meetings. Project description: The medical, psychological and student reviewers were prepared for the virtual selection procedure in training sessions. Three weeks before the selection days, the applicants received information on the technical requirements for the interviews and on data protection for the persons affected by the collection of personal data. The evaluation of the virtual selection procedure was carried out by the reviewers using an online questionnaire with 8 socio-demographic, 5 organizational, 8 content and 3 open questions. Results: The 108 reviewers conducted selection interviews in tandems (medical/psychological and student reviewers) with 178 applicants for human medicine and 105 applicants for psychology. The online evaluation by 58 reviewers (response rate 53.7%) showed a positive agreement with the virtual selection procedure, with a more favorable assessment of organization and content by the medical and psychological reviewers compared to the student reviewers. Discussion: The adequate adaptation of the selection procedure of the UW/H to the virtual zoom room as well as its acceptance are confirmed by the successful execution of the selection days for the students for the winter semester 2020/21 and the evaluation of the reviewers. Conclusion: The results and analysis of this exceptional situation will be used to also conduct the upcoming selection procedure for the summer semester 2021 in the virtual space. A valid assessment for the future use of a virtual selection procedure as a possible supplement to the personal selection interviews at the University of Witten/Herdecke remains to be made.","output":"Selection procedure human medicine and psychology at the University of Witten/Herdecke: adaptation to the virtual zoom room"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"AIM: To investigate the influencing factors in professional identity of undergraduate nursing students after the outbreak of COVID-19.

Among them, nine ssDNA-FQ reporters were found to be suitable for direct visual colorimetric detection, with especially very strong performance using ROX-labeled reporters. We optimized the reaction concentrations of these ssDNA-FQ reporters for a naked-eye read-out of assay results (no transducing component required for visualization). In particular, we developed a convolutional neural network algorithm to standardize and automate the analytical colorimetric assessment of images and integrated this into the MagicEye mobile phone software.

The goal of the present study was to examine the role of vascular smooth muscle membrane Na+-K+-ATPase enzyme activity as well as nitric oxide synthase inhibition on the contractile responses induced by sickle erythrocyte constituents. 2 mm ring segments of rabbit carotid arterial ring preparations were placed in 20 ml organ baths containing physiological salt solution (PSS) bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2, at 37oC and pH 7.4 and isometric contractions recorded, under an initial load of 2g. Arterial rings were exposed to 50 l of each erythrocyte constituent at an adjusted haematocrit of 0.6. The magnitude of K+-induced relaxation of 10-7 M phenylephrine (PE)-precontracted rings exposed for 30 minutes to K+-free PSS (which inhibits Na+-K+ pump) was estimated in the absence (control) or presence of RBC constituents (ghosts, erythrocytes or haemoglobin solution) from Hb SS subjects. Secondly, the influence of 20-minute exposure of the rings to SS GHOSTS on acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation of 10-7 M PE phenylephrine-precontraction (in the absence or presence of L-NAME) was evaluated. Our results show that K+-induced relaxation was significantly and differentially attenuated by erythrocyte constituents (p<0.05) in the order: SS GHOST > SS HBS > SS RBC. NO synthase inhibition with L-NAME further potentiated the enhanced PE contractions induced by SS GHOSTS and caused a greater attenuation of Ach-induced relaxation (compared with SS GHOSTS alone). The results suggest that SS erythrocyte GHOSTS induce enhancement of vascular smooth muscle tone via impairment of vascular Na+-K+ ATPase enzyme activity as well as attenuate endothelium-dependent relaxation. These functional changes in vascular smooth muscle and endothelial function may contribute to the pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crisis of sickle cell disease.","output":"Mechanisms of enhanced vascular smooth muscle contraction induced by sickle erythrocyte constituents."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Clinical indications for medicinal cannabis include chronic conditions; thus users (MCUs) are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). The study aimed to provide data on cannabis use and self-reported behavioral changes among MCUs with preexisting chronic conditions in response to the pandemic. METHODS An internet-based questionnaire was administered to adults 18 who self-reported medicinal cannabis use within the past year. Data are from respondents between March 21 and April 23, 2020; response rate was 83.3%. Health conditions and cannabis frequency, route, and patterns of use were assessed via the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Questionnaire (Vidot et al. 2020). RESULTS Participants (N = 1202) were predominantly non-Hispanic white (82.5%) and 52.0% male (mean age 47.2 years). Mental health (76.7%), pain (43.7%), cardiometabolic (32.9%), respiratory (16.8%), and autoimmune (12.2%) conditions were most reported. Those with mental health conditions reported increased medicinal cannabis use by 91% since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic compared to those with no mental health conditions (adjusted odds ratio: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.38-2.65). 6.8% reported suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Two percent (2.1%) have been tested for COVID-19 with only 1 positive test result. Some MCUs (16%) changed their route of cannabis administration, switching to nonsmoking forms. CONCLUSIONS The majority of MCUs reported at least one preexisting chronic health condition.

This report describes the feasibility and diagnostic yield of this assay in 381 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS Clinical targeted sequencing of 23 genes was performed with DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The assay used Agilent SureSelect hybrid capture followed by Illumina HiSeq 2000, MiSeq, or HiSeq 2500 sequencing in a College of American Pathologists-accredited, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified laboratory. Single-nucleotide variants and insertion/deletion events were reported. This assay was performed before methods were developed to detect rearrangements by NGS. RESULTS Two hundred nine of all requisitioned samples (55%) were successfully sequenced. The most common reason for not performing the sequencing was an insufficient quantity of tissue available in the blocks (29%). Excisional, endoscopic, and core biopsy specimens were sufficient for testing in 95%, 66%, and 40% of the cases, respectively. The median turnaround time (TAT) in the pathology laboratory was 21 days, and there was a trend of an improved TAT with more rapid sequencing platforms. Sequencing yielded a mean coverage of 1318. Potentially actionable mutations (ie, predictive or prognostic) were identified in 46% of 209 samples and were most commonly found in KRAS (28%), epidermal growth factor receptor (14%), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (4%), phosphatase and tensin homolog (1%), and BRAF (1%). Five percent of the samples had multiple actionable mutations. A targeted therapy was instituted on the basis of NGS in 11% of the sequenced patients or in 6% of all patients.

Similarly, carcinogenic health risks from exposure to As and Cr exceeded 1E-05 and 1E-06, respectively, needing a risk reduction plan. The non-carcinogenic risk was smaller than the hazard index of one, implying low potential for adverse health effects. The probable locations of sources with relatively higher carcinogenic risks were tracked. In this study, health risk assessment was performed on the elements for which mass concentration and toxicity information were available; however, future research needs to reflect the toxicity of organic compounds, elemental carbon, and PM(2.5) itself.

The contribution of community engagement to non-communicable disease research in low- and middle-income countries has not yet been extensively studied or synthesised. This protocol describes the steps towards generating an understanding of community engagement in the context of non-communicable disease research, prevention and health promotion using a realist review approach. A realist lens enables a rich explanatory approach to causation while capturing complexity, and an openness to multiple outcomes, including unintended consequences. The review will thus develop an understanding of community engagement without assuming that such practices result in more ethical research or effective interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We propose a realist approach aiming to examine how, why, under what circumstances and for whom community engagement works or does not work. The iterative review steps include clarifying the review scope; searching for evidence; appraising studies and extracting data; synthesising evidence and drawing conclusions; and disseminating, implementing and evaluating the findings. Principles of meta-narrative review (pragmatism, pluralism, historicity, contestation, reflexivity and peer review) are employed to ensure practicable and contextualised review outputs. The proposed review will draw on theoretical and empirical literature beyond specific diseases or settings, but with a focus on informing non-communicable disease research and interventions in low- and middle-income countries. The synthesis of existing literature will be complemented by qualitative realist interviews and stakeholder consultation. Through drawing on multiple types of evidence and input from both experts and intended beneficiaries, the review will provide critical and pragmatic insights for research and community engagement in low- and middle-income countries. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the University of the Witwatersrand. Dissemination will include traditional academic channels, institutional communications, social media and discussions with a wide range of stakeholders.","output":"Engaging communities in non-communicable disease research and interventions in low- and middle-income countries: a realist review protocol"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a pandemic with over 270 million confirmed cases and 5.3 million deaths worldwide. In some cases, the infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is triggered by a cytokine storm and multiple organ failure. Clinical hematological, biochemical, coagulation, and inflammatory markers, such as interleukins, are associated with COVID-19 disease progression. In this regard, neutrophilia, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NAR), have emerged as promising biomarkers of disease severity and progression. In the pathophysiology of ARDS, the inflammatory environment induces neutrophil influx and activation in the lungs, promoting the release of cytokines, proteases, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and, eventually, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs components, such as DNA, histones, myeloperoxidase, and elastase, may exert cytotoxic activity and alveolar damage. Thus, NETs have also been described as potential biomarkers of COVID-19 prognosis. Several studies have demonstrated that NETs are induced in COVID-19 patients, and that the highest levels of NETs are found in critical ones, therefore highlighting a correlation between NETs and severity of the disease. Knowledge of NETs signaling pathways, and the targeting of points of NETs release, could help to develop an effective treatment for COVID-19, and specifically for severe cases, which would help to manage the pandemic.","output":"Role of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps in COVID-19 Progression: An Insight for Effective Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article examines the increasing corporate debt vulnerability and its impact on the asset quality of the Indian public sector banks (PSBs) in the post-global financial crisis (post-GFC) of 2008 The study shows that the stress in both corporate and bank balance sheets has increased in the post-GFC As a result, there has been a steep increase the proportion of firms with negative profitability The article finds that the declining profitability has severely affected the debt serviceability of the firms Consequently, the debt at risk has risen significantly, which in turn has contributed to increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) of the banking sector, particularly, the PSBs Using the panel regression technique, the study finds that the corporate debt vulnerability is an important determinant of the growth of NPAs along with other factors such as debt concentration, corporate sales growth, lending to sensitive sectors, bank profitability, bank size and the efficiency of banks","output":"Corporate Debt Vulnerability and Non-performing Assets in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing the global coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, remains a mystery. Current evidence suggests a likely spillover into humans from an animal reservoir. Understanding the host range and identifying animal species that are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection may help to elucidate the origin of the virus and the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Here we demonstrated that white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), an animal species in which the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - the SARS-CoV-2 receptor - shares a high degree of similarity to humans, are highly susceptible to infection. Intranasal inoculation of deer fawns with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in established subclinical viral infection and shedding of infectious virus in nasal secretions. Notably, infected animals transmitted the virus to non-inoculated contact deer. Viral RNA was detected in multiple tissues 21 days post-inoculation (pi). All inoculated and indirect contact animals seroconverted and developed neutralizing antibodies as early as day 7 pi. The work provides important insights into the animal host range of SARS-CoV-2 and identifies white-tailed deer as a susceptible wild animal species to the virus.IMPORTANCEGiven the presumed zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, the human-animal-environment interface of COVID-19 pandemic is an area of great scientific and public- and animal-health interest. Identification of animal species that are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 may help to elucidate the potential origin of the virus, identify potential reservoirs or intermediate hosts, and define the mechanisms underlying cross-species transmission to humans. Additionally, it may also provide information and help to prevent potential reverse zoonosis that could lead to the establishment of a new wildlife hosts. Our data show that upon intranasal inoculation, white-tailed deer became subclinically infected and shed infectious SARS-CoV-2 in nasal secretions and feces. Importantly, indirect contact animals were infected and shed infectious virus, indicating efficient SARS-CoV-2 transmission from inoculated animals. These findings support the inclusion of wild cervid species in investigations conducted to assess potential reservoirs or sources of SARS-CoV-2 of infection.","output":"Susceptibility of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to SARS-CoV-2"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The United Kingdom (UK) care home population has experienced high mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Atypical presentations of COVID-19 are being reported in older adults and may pose difficulties for early isolation and treatment, particularly in institutional care settings. We aimed to characterise the presenting symptoms and associated mortality of COVID-19 in older adults, with a focus on care home residents and older adults living in the community. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of consecutive inpatients over 80 years old hospitalised with PCR confirmed COVID-19 between 10th March 2020 and 8th April 2020. Symptoms at presentation, including those associated with frailty, were analysed. Differences between community dwelling and care home residents, and associations with mortality, were assessed using between-group comparisons and logistic regression. Results: Care home residents were less likely to experience cough (46.9% vs 72.9%, p=0.002) but more likely to present with delirium (51.6% vs 31.4%, p=0.018), particularly hypoactive delirium (40.6% vs 24.3%, p=0.043). Mortality was more likely in the very frail (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.00, 1.58, p=0.049) and those presenting with anorexia (OR 3.20, 95% CI 1.21, 10.09, p=0.028). There were no differences in either mortality or length of stay between those admitted from care homes and community dwelling older adults. Conclusion: COVID-19 in those over 80 does not always present with typical symptoms, particularly in those admitted from institutional care. These individuals have a reduced incidence of cough and increased hypoactive delirium.

Predicting CoV-2 mutations that increase transmissibility or immune evasion would be extremely valuable in development of broad-acting therapeutics and vaccines and prioritising viral monitoring and containment. Using in vitro evolution, we identify a double mutation in CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) that increases affinity for ACE2 almost 20-fold. We determine the mutant:ACE2 structure to reveal the binding mechanism and show the main affinity driver, Q498H, boosts binding of other RBD variants. We find this mutation incompatible with the common N501Y mutation, but N501Y variants can acquire Q498R to access a similar bonding network and affinity gain. We show Q498H, and Q498R plus N501Y, enable variants to bind rat ACE2 with high affinity.

The multicenter CTC Registry was established to systematically collect patient-level data, outcomes, and utilization patterns of CytoSorb under the EUA. Methods: Patient-level data was entered retrospectively at participating centers. The primary outcome of the registry was ICU mortality. Patient disposition of death, continuing ICU care, or ICU discharge was analyzed up to Day 90 after start of CytoSorb therapy. Demographics, comorbidities, COVID-19 medications, inflammatory biomarkers, and details on CytoSorb use were compared between survivors and non-survivors in the veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) cohort. Results: Between April 2020 and April 2021, 52 patients received veno-venous ECMO plus CytoSorb therapy at 5 U.S. centers. ICU mortality was 17.3% (9/52) on day 30, 26.9% (14/52) on day 90, and 30.8% (16/52) at final follow-up of 153 days. Survivors had a trend toward lower baseline D-Dimer levels (2.3  2.5 vs. 19.8  32.2 g/mL, p = 0.056) compared to non-survivors. A logistic regression analysis suggested a borderline association between baseline D-Dimer levels and mortality with a 32% increase in the risk of death per 1 g/mL increase (p = 0.055).

In China, especially in the epidemic pastoral communities on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the harsh climate, low socio-economic status, poor overall hygiene, and remote and insufficient access to all owned dogs exacerbate the difficulty in implementing the ambitious control programme for echinococcosis. We aimed to design and implement a remote management system (RMS) based on internet of things (IoT) for control and surveillance of echinococcosis by combining deworming devices to realise long-distance smart deworming control, smooth statistical analysis and result display. New methods and tools are urgently needed to increase the deworming coverage and frequency, promote real-time scientific surveillance, and prevent transmission of echinococcosis in remoted transmission areas. METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, we had cooperated and developed the smart collar and smart feeder with the Central Research Institute of Shanghai Electric Group Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and Shenzhen Jizhi Future Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). From September 2019 to March 2020, We had proposed the RMS based on IoT as a novel tool to control smart deworming devices to deliver efficient praziquantel (PZQ) baits to dogs regularly and automatically and also as a smart digital management platform to monitor, analyse, and display the epidemic trends of echinococcosis dynamically, in real time in Hezuo City, Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Starting from January 2018, The RMS has been maintained and upgraded by Shanghai Yier Information Technology Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). The database was based on MySQL tools and the Chi-square test was used to probe the difference and changes of variables in different groups. RESULTS: The smart collars are fully capable of anti-collision, waterproof, and cold-proof performance, and the batterys energy is sufficient, the anti-collision rate, water-proof rate, cold-proof rate and voltage normal rate is 99.6% (521/523), 100.0% (523/523), 100.0% (523/523) and 100.0% (523/523), respectively. The RMS can accurately analyse the monitoring data and parameters including positive rates of canine faeces, and the prevalence of echinococcosis in the general population livestock, and children. The data of dogs deworming and surveillance for echinococcosis is able to be controlled using RMS and has expanded gradually in townships to the whole Hezuo region. The automatic delivering PZQ rate, collar positioning rate, deliver PZQ reminding rate, and fault report rate is 91.1% (1914/2102), 92.1% (13 580/14 745), 92.1% (1936/2102) and 84.7% (1287/1519), respectively. After using the RMS from 2019, the missing rate of monitoring data decreased from 32.1% (9/28) to 0 (0/16). A total of 48 administrators (3, 3, 8, 11, 23 at the provincial, municipal, county, township, village levels, respectively) participated in the questionnaire survey, with 93.8% of its overall satisfaction rate. CONCLUSIONS: The existing difficulties and challenges in the way of prevention and control for echinococcosis can partially be resolved using the innovative, IoT-based technologies and tools.

This study aimed to determine the associations among COVID-19-related prevention cognition, self-efficacy, e-Health literacy, and healthy lifestyle behaviors at university students. METHODS: By using a stratified cluster random sampling method, 971 students from five universities were recruited between May and August 2021 in Guangzhou, China. We collected participants' demographic characteristics, and assessed self-efficacy, COVID-19-related prevention cognition, e-Health literacy, and healthy lifestyle behaviors. A structural equation model was used for mediation analysis. RESULTS: The overall mean value of healthy lifestyle behaviors of college students was 0.307 (SD 0.389). Between COVID-19-related prevention cognition, e-Health literacy, self-efficacy, and healthy lifestyle behaviors (r = 0.132C0.505, P < 0.01) were a significant positive correlation. The COVID-19-related prevention cognition had a direct and positive predictive effect on healthy lifestyle behaviors, with a direct effect value of 0.136. e-Health literacy and self-efficacy played both an independent mediating and serial-multiple mediating roles in the association between COVID-19-related prevention cognition and healthy lifestyle behaviors, and the indirect effect values were 0.043, 0.020 and 0.035, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the emphasis on improving college students' prevention cognition, supplemented by improving e-Health literacy and self-efficacy, could improve college students' healthy lifestyle behaviors.

To explore the broader health impacts of the pandemic, we assessed the magnitude and duration of changes in hospital admissions for 12 high-burden diseases and the utilization of five common procedures by lockdown stringency, hospital level, and equity in patient access. METHODS: Our analysis used Philippine social health insurance data filed by 1,295 hospitals in 2019 and 2020. We calculated three descriptive statistics of percent change comparing 2020 to the same periods in 2019: (1) year-on-year, (2) same-month-prior-year, and (3) lockdown periods. FINDINGS: Disease admissions declined (-54%) while procedures increased (13%) in 2020 versus 2019. The increase in procedures was caused by hemodialysis surpassing its 2019 utilization levels in 2020 by 25%, overshadowing declines for C-section (-5%) and vaginal delivery (-18%). Comparing months in 2020 to the same months in 2019, the declines in admissions and procedures occurred at pandemic onset (March-April 2020), with some recovery starting May, but were generally not reversed by the end of 2020. Non-urgent procedures and respiratory diseases faced the largest declines in April 2020 versus April 2019 (range: -60% to -70%), followed by diseases requiring regular follow-up (-50% to -56%), then urgent conditions (-4% to -40%). During the strictest (April-May 2020) and relaxed (May-December 2020) lockdown periods compared to the same periods in 2019, the declines among the poorest (-21%, -39%) were three-times greater than in direct contributors (-7%, -12%) and two-times more in the south (-16%, -32%) than the richer north (-8%, -10%). Year-on-year admission declines across the 12 diseases and procedures (except for hemodialysis) was highest for level three hospitals. Compared to public hospitals, private hospitals had smaller year-on-year declines for procedures, because of increases in utilization in lower level private hospitals. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19s prolonged impact on the utilization of hospital services in the Philippines suggests a looming public health crisis in countries with frail health systems. Through the periodic waves of COVID-19 and lockdowns, policymakers must employ a whole-of-health strategy considering all conditions, service delivery networks, and access for the most vulnerable.

OBJECTIVES To determine whether the presence of scapular dyskinesis in asymptomatic athletes increases the risk of developing shoulder pain by systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS A systematic search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database and SPORTDiscus. Prospective studies that assessed athletes for scapular dyskinesis and recorded incidents of shoulder pain were included. Study quality was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Meta-analysis was conducted to derive a pooled risk ratio (RR) for the development of shoulder pain in athletes with scapular dyskinesis compared with those without scapular dyskinesis. RESULTS Five studies were included with a total of 419 athletes. Of the athletes with scapular dyskinesis, 35% (56/160) experienced shoulder pain during the follow-up, whereas 25% (65/259) of athletes without scapular dyskinesis experienced symptoms. The presence of scapular dyskinesis at baseline indicated a 43% increased risk of a shoulder pain event over a 9 to 24 months follow-up (RR=1.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.93).

We aimed to describe the electrophysiological characteristics of AMC-AP and the related anatomy. METHODS AND RESULTS This study involved eight (male/female = 3/5, mean age 42.6  10.5 years) patients with left-sided AP successfully ablated in the AMC region. The retrograde atrial activation sequence was analysed and compared via recordings at the His-bundle (HB), coronary sinus (CS), and roving catheter during tachycardia, and the peak of QRS from the same cardiac circle used as time reference. Of the eight patients, two received prior ablations. During tachycardia, the activation time at the proximal CS (CSp), lateral CS (CSl), and HB region averaged 120  26 ms, 124  29 ms, and 117  21 ms following the reference, respectively (P = 0.86). The latest atrial activation was recorded in the posterior CS which averaged 135  25 ms following the reference. Placing the ablation catheter to AMC via retrograde approach was attempted in all cases but stable positioning achieved in none. Via transseptal approach, the ablation catheter could be easily placed at the AMC and recorded the earliest retrograde atrial activations with 60  27 ms earlier than the relatively 'earliest' CS/HB recordings, and ablation at this site successfully eliminated AP conduction. No patients had recovered AP conduction after at least 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION AMC-AP is featured by recording comparable retrograde atrial activation times at CSp, CSl, and HB with the latest recordings at the posterior CS. Stable placement and successful ablation in the AMC via retrograde aortic approach was difficult but can be achieved via transseptal approach.","output":"Left-sided accessory pathways successfully ablated from the aortomitral continuity region: distinctive atrial activation patterns and anatomic concerns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper examines the role of bioethics in the successful control of COVID-19 in New Zealand.

In 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a previously unidentified pathogen called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Since its initial description, hMPV has been associated with ARTI in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the UK, Germany, Denmark, Finland and Norway), America (the USA, Canada, Argentina and Brazil), Asia (India, Japan, China and Singapore), Australia and South Africa in individuals of all ages. The incidence of infection varies from 1.5% to 25%, indicating that hMPV is a ubiquitous virus with a worldwide distribution. hMPV seems to play an important role as a cause of paediatric upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with similar, but not identical, epidemiological and clinical features to those of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Moreover, the socio-economic impact of hMPV-infected children on their families seems to be considerable, which suggests that, like influenza virus, hMPV infection may be a substantial public health problem for the community. It may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality in pre-term infants and children with underlying clinical conditions, although more adequately controlled studies are needed to confirm its importance in such patients. Many fundamental questions concerning the pathogenesis of hMPV disease and the host's specific immune response remain to be answered.

Facebook, being the biggest social media platform, plays a significant role in the spread of information influencing the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) use social media as a platform to impart information regarding COVID-19; simultaneously, there is a spread of misinformation on social media, masking the credible sources of information. Our research aims to assess the utility of Facebook in providing misinformation and testing its fact-check policy. Methods An online search was conducted on Facebook by a newly created account to eliminate bias. The Facebook search bar was used to investigate multiple keywords. Data were tabulated in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Descriptive statistical analysis of Facebook accounts and posts was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) while statistical importance was set a priority at a p-value of 0.05. Results Our study consisted of 454 Facebook posts. Most (22.5%) were posted by verified accounts and 23.9% by informal individual/group accounts. The tone for most (40.4%) COVID-19 information was serious while the most common (43.9%) topic was medical/public health. In total, 22.3% included misinformation, 19.6% were unverifiable, and 27.5% included correct information verifiable by the WHO or CDC.

STUDY DESIGN Sidestream microstream ETCO(2) detectors were allowed time to calibrate and reach steady state prior to blood gas measurements. Blood CO(2) (PCO(2) ) and simultaneous ETCO(2) were recorded. Ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) was calculated using modified Bohr's equation. Correlation coefficient, estimates of difference, standard deviation, and 95% limits of agreement between ETCO(2) and PCO(2) concentrations were calculated. RESULTS Two hundred eighty-six paired samples were collected from 48 ventilated NICU patients. Average PCO(2) and ETCO(2) were 58.4 and 50.6 with a correlation of 0.76. Subgroup analysis showed a correlation of 0.73 in 204 paired blood from 34 VLBW infants and 0.82 in 82 paired samples from non-VLBW infants. Estimates of difference  standard deviation between PCO(2) and ETCO(2) concentrations in these three groups, respectively (ALL, VLBW, and non-VLBW) were 7.84  9.96, 8.2  10.16, and 6.95  9.45. The correlation coefficient significantly improved in the VLBW group to 0.86 with dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) <30% (0.86 vs. 0.42; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION ETCO(2) measurements using sidestream microstream technology in VLBW demonstrated that the correlation of ETCO(2) and PCO(2) was moderate, but the agreement was less than adequate (bias > 5 mmHg in all groups). The results improved with lower VD/VT, suggesting that sidestream capnography is more reliable in conditions of less severe lung disease.","output":"Sidestream microstream end tidal carbon dioxide measurements and blood gas correlations in neonatal intensive care unit."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundLimited data exists on the immunogenicity of vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with kidney disease.

Methods1021 patients were screened for spike protein antibodies (anti-S) following 2 doses of either BNT162b2 (n=523) or ChAdOx1 (n=498). 191 patients underwent assessment with T-cell ELISpot assays. 65 health care workers were used as a control group. ResultsAnti-S was detected in 936 (91.2%) of patients post-vaccination. There was no difference in seroconversion rates between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 248/281 (88.3%), compared with ChAdOx1, 227/272 (83.5%), p=0.11. Anti-S concentrations were higher following BNT162b, 462(152-1171) BAU/ml, compared with ChAdOx-1 79(20-213) BAU/ml, p<0.0001. Immunosuppression was associated with failure to seroconvert (p<0.0001); whilst being active on the transplant wait list was a predictor for seroconversion (p=0.02). Only 73 (38.2%) of patients had detectable T-cell responses post-vaccination, with no proportional difference between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 2/19 (10.5%), versus ChAdOx1, 15/75 (20.0%), p=0.34. There were no quantitative differences in T-cell responses in infection-naive patients, with a median 2(0-16) SFU/106 PBMCs and 10(4-28) SFU/106 PBMCs in those receiving BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 respectively, p=0.35. These responses were significantly weaker compared with healthy controls. ConclusionsEnhanced immunogenicity was seen with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, driven by superior humoral responses, with attenuated T-cell responses to both vaccines. Comparative data on clinical efficacy is now required. Significance StatementLimited data exist on the immunogenicity of vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with kidney disease.

It then focuses on soft law measures, the use of which became significant only in Phase II of Italy's response to COVID-19 and argues that non-binding legal instruments provided the public with instructions on gradually returning to normal life. This contribution contains case studies on the soft law measures adopted in relation to private economic enterprise and freedom of worship. Italian soft law deployed during the COVID-19 epidemic was borne out of coordination between the state and the Regions and as the result of (even informal) dialogue with the relevant stakeholders. Despite some criticism of the soft law measures used, their role in restricting constitutionally granted rights was marginal, because only hard law measures adopted nationally and locally limited personal rights and freedoms in order to contain the pandemic. ?","output":"The Role of COVID-19 Soft Law Measures in Italy: Much Ado about Nothing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We highlight the unique facets of paediatric nephrology in Africa in terms of the spectrum of kidney diseases, available diagnostic and treatment modalities, kidney healthcare financing options, paediatric nephrology manpower and the contribution of geography and demographics. RECENT FINDINGS: Paediatric acute kidney injury in Africa is now commonly due to sepsis rather than gastroenteritis. Steroid-sensitive form of nephrotic syndrome is far more common than was two decades ago. SUMMARY: The hot arid climate in North Africa and the tropical climate in most of sub-Saharan Africa, and the high rate of consanguinity, sickle cell disease and HIV drive the spectrum of paediatric kidney diseases in the continent. Kidney diseases are often precipitated by infectious triggers associated with poor living conditions and little access to medical care thus resulting in late presentation and often end-stage kidney disease. Although accessibility to kidney care has improved in the continent due to training opportunities provided by international professional organisations, most children still face significant barriers to kidney care because they live in rural areas, governments spend the least on healthcare and the continent has the least density of healthcare practitioners and nephrology trainees.","output":"Paediatric Nephrology in Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Declaration of Competing Interest statements were not included in published version of the following articles that appeared in previous issues of International Journal of Nursing Sciences Hence, the authors of the below articles were contacted after publication to request a Declaration of Interest statement: 1 Investigation of the working conditions of nurses in public hospitals on the basis of nurse-friendly hospital criteria [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5 (2): 206C212] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2018 01 0012 Predictors of health-promoting behaviour among older adults with hypertension in Indonesia [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5 (2): 201C205] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2018 04 0023 The effects of applying an assessment form based on the health functional patterns on nursing student's attitude and skills in developing the nursing process [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2019;6 (3): 329C333] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2019 06 0044 Nurse-led group cognitive behavioral therapy for major depressive disorder among adults in Japan: A preliminary single-group study [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5 (3): 218C222] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2018 06 0055 A study on the psychological needs of nurses caring for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 from the perspective of the existence, relatedness, and growth theory [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2020;7 (2): 157C160] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2020 04 0026 Design of curriculum for specialised midwive training based on investigation of needs of midwives in Beijing [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5: 24C28] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2017 12 0087 Entrustable professional activities in nursing: A concept analysis [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2020;7 (3): 277C284] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2020 06 0098 A survey of moral distress in certified registered nurse anesthetists: A theoretical perspective for change in ethics education for advance practice nurses [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5 (2): 121C125] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2018 03 0069 Supporting nurse practitioner education: Preceptorship recruitment and retention [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5 (2): 115C120] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2018 03 00510 A review and comparison of midwifery management and education in five representative countries [International Journal of Nursing Sciences, 2018;5: 10C14] https://10 1016/j ijnss 2017 12 00711 Are parental rearing patterns and learning burnout correlated with empathy amongst undergraduate nursing students?

The CTL, HTL, MHC I, and IFN-?3 epitopes were predicted via CTLPRED, IEDB, and IFN epitope servers, respectively. Also, to stimulate strong helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses, Pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) was used. Also, for boosting the immune response, ?-defensin 2 was added to the construct as an adjuvant. Furthermore, TAT was applied to the vaccine to facilitate the intracellular delivery. Finally, TAT, adjuvant, PADRE, and selected epitopes were appropriately assembled. Based on the predicted epitopes, a trivalent multi-epitope vaccine with a molecular weight of 74.8 kDa was constructed. Further analyses predicted the molecule to be a strong antigen, and a non-allergenic and soluble protein. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted. Additionally, analyses validated the stability of the proposed vaccine. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) showed binding affinity and stability of the vaccine-TLR3 complex was favorable. The predicted epitopes demonstrated a strong potential to stimulate T and B-cell mediated immune responses. Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning guaranteed increased expression.

METHODS: A survey was disseminated to DBP clinicians through contact with international professional organizations to determine the use of telehealth in DBP care, before and since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics and &#967;2 tests were used for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 271 respondents from 38 countries completed the survey. The number of respondents offering telehealth increased from 36% to 88% after the pandemic, with the greatest shift to telehealth among high-income countries (HICs). Among respondents using telehealth, 75.1% were conducting interactive video visits, with HICs using more telehealth modalities embedded in electronic health records. Most patients (98.7%) were at home for the telehealth encounter. Almost half (46.5%) could not include an interpreter in telehealth visits. Barriers reported by telehealth users included concerns about limited patient access to technology (74.3%), home environment distractions (56.5%), preference for in-person care (53.6%), telehealth effectiveness (48.1%), workflow efficiency (42.2%), and cost/reimbursement (32.1%). CONCLUSION: Global DBP clinicians rapidly adopted telehealth and continued to have interprofessional practice while doing so, with the largest adoption occurring in HICs. Provider concerns about effectiveness and patient access to technology emerged as key organizational and patient barriers, respectively. Increased provider confidence in telehealth and its sustained use in the future depends on supportive regulatory policies and availability and use of measures to monitor quality and effectiveness.","output":"Global Trends in Telehealth Among Clinicians in Developmental-Behavioral Pediatric Practice: A COVID-19 Snapshot"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction The current global COVID-19 pandemic has almost marked its one year of existence and influenced everyone either at an individual or community level.

In addition, the pandemic has caused major disruptions in medical care and support networks, resulting in treatment delays, limited access to doctors, worsening health disparities, social isolation;and driving higher utilization of telemedicine and online resources. Breastcancer.org has experienced a sustained surge of new and repeat users seeking urgent information and support. To better understand these unmet needs, we conducted a survey of the Breastcancer.org Community. Methods:Members of the Breastcancer.org Community were invited to complete a survey on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on their breast cancer care, including questions on demographics, comorbidities (including lung, heart, liver and kidney disease, asthma, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic health conditions);care delays, anxiety due to COVIDrelated care delays, use of telemedicine, and satisfaction with care during COVID. The survey was conducted between 4/27/2020-6/1/2020 using Survey Monkey. Results were tabulated and compared by chi square test. A p-value of 0.05 is considered significant. Data were analyzed using Stata 16.0 (Stata Corp., Inc, College Station, TX). Results: Our analysis included 568 breast cancer patients of whom 44% had 1 other comorbidities associated with serious COVID-19 complications (per CDC) and 37% had moderate to extreme anxiety about contracting COVID. This anxiety increased with the number of comorbidities (p=0.021), age (p=0.040), and with a current breast cancer diagnosis (p=0.011) (see table). Anxiety was significantly higher in those currently diagnosed, 65, or with 3 other comorbidities, compared to those diagnosed in the past, age &lt;44, or without other comorbidities. Conclusions: Our survey reveals that COVID-related anxiety is prevalent at any age regardless of overall health status, but it increased with the number of other comorbidities, older age, and a current breast cancer diagnosis. Thus, reported anxiety is proportional to the risk of developing serious complications from COVID. Current breast cancer patients of all ages-especially with other comorbidities-require emotional support, safe access to their providers, and prioritization for vaccination.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the analytic performance and handling of four rapid Antigen Point of Care Tests (AgPOCTs) I-IV (Distributors: (I) Roche, (II) Abbott, (III) MEDsan and (IV) Siemens). METHODS: 100 RT-PCR negative and 84 RT-PCR positive oropharyngeal swabs were prospectively collected and used to determine performance and accuracy of these AgPOCTs. Handling was evaluated by 10 healthcare workers/users through a questionnaire. RESULTS: The median duration from symptom onset to sampling was 6 days (IQR 2-12 days). The overall respective sensitivity were 49.4 % (CI95 %: 38.9-59.9), 44.6 % (CI95 %: 34.3-55.3), 45.8 % (CI95 %: 35.5-56.5) and 54.9 % (CI95 %: 43.4-65.9) for tests I, II, III and IV, respectively. In the high viral load subgroup (containing >106 copies of SARS-CoV-2 /swab, n = 26), AgPOCTs reached sensitivities of 92.3 % or more (range 92.3 %-100 %).

Students enter medical school with a high level of technological literacy and an expectation for instructional variety in the curriculum. In response, many medical schools now incorporate technology-enhanced active learning and multimedia education applications. Education games, medical mobile applications, and virtual patient simulations are together termed gamified training platforms. OBJECTIVE To review available literature for the benefits of using gamified training platforms for medical education (both preclinical and clinical) and training. Also, to identify platforms suitable for these purposes with links to multimedia content. METHODS Peer-reviewed literature, commercially published media, and grey literature were searched to compile an archive of recently published scientific evaluations of gamified training platforms for medical education. Specific educational games, mobile applications, and virtual simulations useful for preclinical and clinical training were identified and categorized. Available evidence was summarized as it related to potential educational advantages of the identified platforms for medical education. RESULTS Overall, improved learning outcomes have been demonstrated with virtual patient simulations. Games have the potential to promote learning, increase engagement, allow for real-word application, and enhance collaboration. They can also provide opportunities for risk-free clinical decision making, distance training, learning analytics, and swift feedback. A total of 5 electronic games and 4 mobile applications were identified for preclinical training, and 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools were identified for clinical training. Nine additional gamified, virtual environment training tools not commercially available were also identified.

Here, we propose a computational framework, based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can characterize a holistic view of relative changes in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences approach that corrects for seasonality and query volume variations. We apply this framework to characterize changes in human needs across physiological, socioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35 billion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14 months. Our analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has increased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and variations in statewide policies, we find that the duration of shelter-in-place mandates significantly influenced social and emotional needs. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical needs such as support for unemployment and domestic violence can be identified through web search interactions. Our approach and results suggest that population-scale monitoring of shifts in human needs can inform policies and recovery efforts for current and anticipated needs.","output":"Population-Scale Study of Human Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Analysis and Implications"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Older adults continue to be underrepresented in cancer clinical trials, despite most cancer occurrence peaking in the later decades of life. Consequently, diagnostic and management strategies are commonly extrapolated from data on younger patients, thus challenging the delivery of informed cancer care in this patient population. Several recommendations and calls to action have been released by cancer societies, advocacy organizations, and regulatory agencies to guide inclusion of older adults in clinical trials. Effective implementation, however, requires awareness and close collaboration between all stakeholders involved in the clinical trial journey. We herein provide insights and experience from a drug developer on key considerations to optimize participation and retention of older adults in cancer clinical trials and discuss those under 4 key domains: trial eligibility and design, assessments and endpoints, patients and oncologists, and data reporting.","output":"Age Is Just a Number: Considerations for Older Adults in Cancer Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS The addition of capnography to procedural sedation/analgesia (PSA) guidelines has been controversial due to limited evidence of clinical utility in moderate PSA and cost concerns. PATIENTS AND METHODS A comprehensive model of PSA during gastrointestinal endoscopy was developed to capture adverse events (AEs), guideline interventions, outcomes, and costs. Randomized, controlled trials and large-scale studies were used to inform the model. The model compared outcomes using pulse oximetry alone with pulse oximetry plus capnography. Pulse oximetry was assumed at no cost, whereas capnography cost USD 4,000 per monitor. AE costs were obtained from literature review and Premier database analysis. The model population (n = 8,000) had mean characteristics of age 55.5 years, body mass index 26.2 kg/m(2), and 45.3 % male. RESULTS The addition of capnography resulted in a 27.2 % and 18.0 % reduction in the proportion of patients experiencing an AE during deep and moderate PSA, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated significant reductions in apnea and desaturation with capnography. The median (95 % credible interval) number needed to treat to avoid any adverse event was 8 (2; 72) for deep and 6 (-59; 92) for moderate. Reduced AEs resulted in cost savings that accounted for the additional upfront purchase cost. Capnography was estimated to reduce the cost per procedure by USD 85 (deep) or USD 35 (moderate). CONCLUSIONS Capnography is estimated to be cost-effective if not cost saving during PSA for gastrointestinal endoscopy. Savings were driven by improved patient safety, suggesting that capnography may have an important role in the safe provision of PSA.","output":"Modeling the costs and benefits of capnography monitoring during procedural sedation for gastrointestinal endoscopy."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Navigators in the federal Insurance Navigator Program (\\"Navigator Program\\"), who are employed by organizations in states with Federally Facilitated Marketplaces, provide enrollment assistance, outreach, and education to individuals who are eligible for health insurance coverage. Such work is central to public health efforts to address inequities but continues to be poorly understood and undervalued. More information is needed to understand the components of navigators' equity work and how decreases in program funding have affected their service provision. OBJECTIVE To examine navigators' labor at a granular level to better understand and highlight the equity work they do, the training and skills required for this work, and the Navigator Program-based challenges they face. DESIGN This was a descriptive qualitative study using data collected from interviews conducted in February-May 2021. We used a thematic analysis approach to develop major themes and subthemes. SETTING This was a national study. PARTICIPANTS We conducted 18 semistructured interviews with 24 directors, navigators, and other professionals at organizations funded as federally certified Navigator Programs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Components of navigators' work; required training and skills; and challenges faced in accomplishing the work. RESULTS We identified 3 major themes: (1) navigators' health equity work goes beyond required responsibilities; (2) equity skills are built on the job; and (3) financial instabilities challenge navigators' health equity work. CONCLUSION Navigators bring specialized and essential skills and services to underserved communities. They are trusted sources of information, advocates, resource connectors, and, most significantly, health equity workers. However, the Navigator Program fails to support navigators' work and the communities they serve in the long term. To facilitate organizations' capacities to train, keep, and support navigators in this health equity work and to guarantee long-term enrollment assistance for underserved communities, efforts to stabilize funding are needed.","output":"Lack of Consistent Investment in Federal Insurance Navigator Program Undermines Navigators' Equity Work in Vulnerable Communities."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Suppression of the host intracellular innate immune system is an essential aspect of viral replication.

This includes a previously unidentified gene in SARS-CoV-2 encoded within the Spike gene. We observe immune-suppressing activity in both known host-suppressing genes (e.g., NSP1, Orf6, NSP3, and NSP5) as well as other coronavirus genes, including the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 protein. Moreover, the genes encoded by SARS-CoV-2 are generally more potent immune suppressors than their homologues from the other coronaviruses. This suite of pathway-based and mechanism-agnostic assays could serve as the basis for rapid in vitro prediction of the pathogenicity of novel viruses based on provision of sequence information alone.","output":"High-content screening of coronavirus genes for innate immune suppression reveals enhanced potency of SARS-CoV-2 proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To summarize existing knowledge about the characteristics of attention problems secondary to traumatic brain injuries (TBI) of all severities in children. Methods: Computerized databases PubMed and PsychINFO and gray literature sources were used to identify relevant studies. Search terms were selected to identify original research examining new ADHD diagnosis or attention problems after TBI in children. Studies were included if they investigated any severity of TBI, assessed attention or ADHD after brain injury, investigated children as a primary or sub-analysis, and controlled for or excluded participants with preinjury ADHD or attention problems. Results: Thirty-nine studies were included in the review. Studies examined the prevalence of and risk factors for new attention problems and ADHD following TBI in children as well as behavioral and neuropsychological factors associated with these attention problems. Studies report a wide range of prevalence rates of new ADHD diagnosis or attention problems after TBI. Evidence indicates that more severe injury, injury in early childhood, or preinjury adaptive functioning problems, increases the risk for new ADHD and attention problems after TBI and both sexes appear to be equally vulnerable. Further, literature suggests that cases of new ADHD often co-occurs with neuropsychiatric impairment in other domains. Identified gaps in our understanding of new attention problems and ADHD include if mild TBI, the most common type of injury, increases risk and what brain abnormalities are associated with the emergence of these problems. Conclusion: This scoping review describes existing studies of new attention problems and ADHD following TBI in children and highlights important risk factors and comorbidities. Important future research directions are identified that will inform the extent of this outcome across TBI severities, its neural basis and points of intervention to minimize its impact.","output":"A Systematic Scoping Review of New Attention Problems Following Traumatic Brain Injury in Children."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The advent of novel therapeutics in recent years has urged the need for a safe, non-immunogenic drug delivery vector capable of delivering therapeutic payloads specifically to diseased cells, thereby increasing therapeutic efficacy and reducing side effects. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have garnered attention in recent years as a potentially ideal vector for drug delivery, taking into account their intrinsic ability to transfer bioactive cargo to recipient cells and their biocompatible nature. However, natural EVs are limited in their therapeutic potential and many challenges need to be overcome before engineered EVs satisfy the levels of efficiency, stability, safety and biocompatibility required for therapeutic use. Here, we demonstrate that an enzyme-mediated surface functionalization method in combination with streptavidin-mediated conjugation results in efficient surface functionalization of EVs. Surface functionalization using the above methods permits the stable and biocompatible conjugation of peptides, single domain antibodies and monoclonal antibodies at high copy number on the EV surface. Functionalized EVs demonstrated increased accumulation in target cells expressing common cancer associated markers such as CXCR4, EGFR and EpCAM both in vitro and in vivo. The functionality of this approach was further highlighted by the ability of targeting EVs to specifically deliver therapeutic antisense oligonucleotides to a metastatic breast tumor model, resulting in increased knockdown of a targeted oncogenic microRNA and improved metastasis suppression. The method was also used to equip EVs with a bifunctional peptide that targets EVs to leukemia cells and induces apoptosis, leading to leukemia suppression. Moreover, we conducted extensive testing to verify the biocompatibility, and safety of engineered EVs for therapeutic use, suggesting that surface modified EVs can be used for repeated dose treatment with no detectable adverse effects. This modular, biocompatible method of EV engineering offers a promising avenue for the targeted delivery of a range of therapeutics while addressing some of the safety concerns associated with EV-based drug delivery.","output":"Surface-engineered extracellular vesicles for targeted delivery of therapeutic RNAs and peptides for cancer therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RESUMEN Introduccin: Los estudiantes universitarios se han visto obligados a cambiar sus hbitos debido a la cuarentena por la pandemia COVID-19.

The heterogeneity in individual age and the reaction to biological and environmental changes that has been observed in COVID-19 dynamics in terms of different reaction to vaccination by age group, severity of infection per age group, hospitalization and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) records show different patterns, and hence, it is important to improve mathematical models for COVID-19 pandemic prediction to account for different proportions of ages in the population, which is a major factor in epidemic history. We aim in this paper to estimate, using the Usher model, the lifespan loss due to viral infection and ageing which could result in pathological events such as infectious diseases. Exploiting epidemiology and demographic data firstly from Cameroon and then from some other countries, we described the ageing in the COVID-19 outbreak in human populations and performed a graphical representation of the proportion of sensitivity of some of the model parameters which we varied. The result shows a coherence between the orders of magnitude of the calculated and observed incidence numbers during the epidemic wave, which constitutes a semi-quantitative validation of the mathematical modelling approach at the population level. To conclude, the age heterogeneity of the populations involved in the COVID-19 outbreak needs the consideration of models in age groups with specific susceptibilities to infection.","output":"A Model for the Lifespan Loss Due to a Viral Disease: Example of the COVID-19 Outbreak"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to be a pandemic. This posed challenges to many countries, prominent among which is communication with the public to gain their cooperation. Israel faces different challenges from other countries in its management of the COVID-19 crisis because it is in the midst of a deep constitutional crisis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to examine the response of the Israeli public to the government's emergency instructions regarding the pandemic in terms of correlations between overall risk perception and crisis management; overall risk perception and economic threat perception; crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines; and crisis management and economic threat perception. We also made comparisons between crisis management and spokesperson credibility and between crisis management and the credibility of information sources. METHODS: The sample was established using an online survey that enabled rapid and effective distribution of an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 crisis. The self-selection online survey method of nonprobability sampling was used to recruit participants (N=1056) through social network posts asking the general public (aged &#8805;18 years) to answer the survey. RESULTS: Participants aged &#8805;65 years perceived higher personal risk compared to those aged 18-30 years (mean difference 0.33, 95% CI 0.04-0.61) and those aged 46-64 years (mean difference 0.38, 95% CI 0.12-0.64). Significant correlations were found between overall risk perception and attitudes toward crisis management (r=0.19, P<.001), overall risk perception and economic threat perception (r=0.22, P<.001), attitudes toward crisis management and compliance with behavioral guidelines (r=0.15, P<.001), and attitudes toward crisis management and economic threat perception (r=-0.15, P<.001). Participants who perceived that the prime minister was the most credible spokesperson evaluated the crisis management significantly higher than all other groups. The crisis management was evaluated significantly lower by participants who stated that infectious disease specialists were the most credible spokespersons. Participants for whom the Ministry of Health website was the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management higher than all other groups. Participants for whom scientific articles were the most credible source of information evaluated the crisis management lower than those who perceived that the WHO/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention websites or Ministry of Health/hospital websites and health care workers were the most credible. CONCLUSIONS: The higher the public trust and evaluation of crisis management, the greater the compliance of the public with guidelines. It was also found that crisis management and information cannot be approached in the same way for the overall public. Furthermore, unlike other epidemics, the COVID-19 crisis has widespread economic and social consequences; therefore, it is impossible to focus only on health risks without communicating economic and social risks as well.","output":"Analysis of Public Perception of the Israeli Government's Early Emergency Instructions Regarding COVID-19: Online Survey Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) virus is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing more than two million deaths.

Anthracnose disease is caused by the ascomycetes fungal species Colletotrichum, which is responsible for heavy yield losses in chilli and tomato worldwide. Conventionally, harmful pesticides are used to contain anthracnose disease with limited success. In this study, we assessed the potential of Host-Induced Gene Silencing (HIGS) approach to target the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides COM1 (CgCOM1) developmental gene involved in the fungal conidial and appressorium formation, to restrict fungal infection in chilli and tomato fruits. For this study, we have developed stable transgenic lines of chilli and tomato expressing CgCOM1-RNAi construct employing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic plants were characterized by molecular and gene expression analyses. Production of specific CgCOM1 siRNA in transgenic chilli and tomato RNAi lines was confirmed by stem-loop RT-PCR. Fungal challenge assays on leaves and fruits showed that the transgenic lines were resistant to anthracnose disease-causing C. gloeosporioides in comparison to wild type and empty-vector control plants. RT-qPCR analyses in transgenic lines revealed extremely low abundance of CgCOM1 transcripts in the C. gloeosporioides infected tissues, indicating near complete silencing of CgCOM1 gene expression in the pathogen. Microscopic examination of the Cg-challenged leaves of chilli-CgCOM1i lines revealed highly suppressed conidial germination, germ tube development, appressoria formation and mycelial growth of C. gloeosporioides, resulting in reduced infection of plant tissues. These results demonstrated highly efficient use of HIGS in silencing the expression of essential fungal developmental genes to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi, thus providing a highly precise approach to arrest the spread of disease.","output":"Host-induced silencing of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides conidial morphology 1 gene (CgCOM1) confers resistance against Anthracnose disease in chilli and tomato"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the delivery of surgical services. The purpose of this communication was to report the impact of the pandemic on surgical training and learner well-being and to document adaptations made by surgery departments. STUDY DESIGN: A 37-item survey was distributed to educational leaders in general surgery and other surgical specialty training programs. It included both closed- and open-ended questions and the self-reported stages of GME during the COVID-19 pandemic, as defined by the ACGME. Statistical associations for items with stage were assessed using categorical analysis. RESULTS: The response rate was 21% (472 of 2,196). US stage distribution (n = 447) was as follows: stage 1, 22%; stage 2, 48%; and stage 3, 30%. Impact on clinical education significantly increased by stage, with severe reductions in nonemergency operations (73% and 86% vs 98%) and emergency operations (8% and 16% vs 34%). Variable effects were reported on minimal expected case numbers across all stages. Reductions were reported in outpatient experience (83%), in-hospital experience (70%), and outside rotations (57%). Increases in ICU rotations were reported with advancing stage (7% and 13% vs 37%). Severity of impact on didactic education increased with stage (14% and 30% vs 46%).

The prognosis of this tumor is better than other lung cancers. Polymyositis, a kind of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, may negatively affect the prognosis of patients with lung cancer as a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNPS). LELC is seldomly accompanied by PNPS, thus the treatment strategy and prognosis should be discussed. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 49-year-old female patient who was hospitalized for symmetric limb weakness and pain for more than 2 months. Glucocorticoid-based anti-inflammatory therapy had been performed for over 3 weeks before the patient was hospitalized, however, in vain. The result of serum autoimmune antibody showed Anti-nRNP/Sm ( +). The serum level of myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase elevated significantly. An electromyogram revealed peripheral nerves injury and myogenic damages. Imaging showed a mass in the posterior basal segment of the left lung. A percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy was performed and the pathological result was LELC. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary LELC accompanied by polymyositis. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) showed only ipsilateral hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes metastasis. Video-assisted thoracoscopic left lower lobectomy and systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy were performed. The postoperative pathological stage was T2N2M0, IIIA (UICC 8th), and the patient received adjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent radiotherapy. The patient was followed up for 5 months with no recurrence of tumor and the limb weakness and pain were relieved apparently after the successful comprehensive treatment of her primary tumor. CONCLUSION: Pulmonary LELC is a rare subtype of non-small cell lung cancer seldomly accompanied by PNPS.

Consequently, it is important that clinicians confronted with subjects with early cognitive concerns, have appropriate tools available to assist in diagnosis and to facilitate risks management appropriately. The application of polygenic risk score (PRS) tests has the potential to contribute towards management planning and to reduce the burden of testing in subjects with low overall risk. METHODS This retrospective analysis considered the application of genoSCORETM in a small cohort of patients seen over a six month period in a London Memory Clinic. The test was offered to selected patients in the clinic with MCI not clinically attributable to dementia, or cognitively normal individuals concerned about their risks of dementia. The impact upon clinical management and lifestyle modification was reviewed. genoSCORE, a polygenic risk score algorithm, was developed by Cytox to assess genetic risk for the future development of Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). RESULTS Patients receiving the genoSCORE test included those with early MCI, subjective memory complaints and a small number concerned about their risk of dementia. In each case, a medical history was taken and individuals assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination, conducted either in clinic or remotely. genoSCORE polygenic risk score was easy to conduct and well received. The results stimulated individuals at risk of developing LOAD to make lifestyle adjustments and thereby potentially modifying their dementia risk. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the genoSCORE PRS test provided a valuable assessment of genetic risk of individuals most likely to decline cognitively decline towards AD and as such, contributed significantly to clinical management decisions. The ease and effectiveness of home sampling of saliva as source DNA for the PRS test was a major factor and well aligned with the continuing need for remote consultations in the light of COVID-19 concerns. Further larger-scale studies to determine the full clinical and associated economic impact of the genoSCORE PRS test are required.","output":"Clinical experience with polygenic risk score in subjects with early cognitive concerns."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"CONTEXT Approximately 70% of women report experiencing vasomotor symptoms (VMS, hot flashes and/or night sweats).

We included studies on associations between genetic variation and VMS. We excluded studies focused on medication interventions or prevention or treatment of breast cancer. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Of the 202 unique citations, 18 citations met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 51 to 17,695. Eleven of the 18 studies had fewer than 500 participants; two studies had  1,000. Overall, statistically significant associations with VMS were found for variants in 14 of the 26 genes assessed in candidate gene studies. The cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1B1) gene was the focus of the largest number (n = 7) of studies, but strength and statistical significance of associations of CYP1B1 variants with VMS were inconsistent. A genome-wide association study reported statistically significant associations between 14 single-nucleotide variants in the tachykinin receptor 3 gene and VMS. Heterogeneity across trials regarding VMS measurement methods and effect measures precluded quantitative meta-analysis; there were few studies of each specific genetic variant.

The reason why children do not have lymphopenia is thought to be due to the fact that the thymus is more active in the first years of life.Two-hundred and four patients operated in our paediatric cardiac surgery clinic from 11March, 2020 to 1 April, 2021 were retrospectively examined and 11 patients with preoperative asymptomatic and PCR (-), but with PCR (+) in the post-operative period (patients with incubation period or false PCR negativity) were included in our study.

MF is usually short-lasting, reversible, and is experienced as a feeling of tiredness or lack of energy. The leading causes of short-lasting fatigue are related to overtraining, undertraining/deconditioning, or physical injury. Conversely, MF can be persistent and more serious when associated with pathological states or following chronic exposure to certain medication or toxic composites. In conjunction with chronic fatigue, the muscle feels floppy, and the force generated by muscles is always low, causing the individual to feel frail constantly. The leading cause underpinning the development of chronic fatigue is related to muscle wasting mediated by aging, immobilization, insulin resistance (through high-fat dietary intake or pharmacologically mediated Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor (PPAR) agonism), diseases associated with systemic inflammation (arthritis, sepsis, infections, trauma, cardiovascular and respiratory disorders (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD))), chronic kidney failure, muscle dystrophies, muscle myopathies, multiple sclerosis, and, more recently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The primary outcome of displaying chronic muscle fatigue is a poor quality of life. This type of fatigue represents a significant daily challenge for those affected and for the national health authorities through the financial burden attached to patient support. Although the origin of chronic fatigue is multifactorial, the MF in illness conditions is intrinsically linked to the occurrence of muscle loss. The sequence of events leading to chronic fatigue can be schematically denoted as: trigger (genetic or pathological) -> molecular outcome within the muscle cell -> muscle wasting -> loss of muscle function -> occurrence of chronic muscle fatigue.

METHODS: In this randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial comparing a range of possible treatments with usual care in patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we randomly assigned 1561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3155 to receive usual care. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. RESULTS: The enrollment of patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was closed on June 5, 2020, after an interim analysis determined that there was a lack of efficacy. Death within 28 days occurred in 421 patients (27.0%) in the hydroxychloroquine group and in 790 (25.0%) in the usual-care group (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.23; P = 0.15). Consistent results were seen in all prespecified subgroups of patients. The results suggest that patients in the hydroxychloroquine group were less likely to be discharged from the hospital alive within 28 days than those in the usual-care group (59.6% vs. 62.9%; rate ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.98).

METHODS: This study was an anonymously-completed online self-report survey. Changes in alcohol use were assessed using a single fixed-choice study-specific question. Mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale. RESULTS: A total of 13,829 people contributed complete data and were included in the analysis. Overall, about one in five adults reported that they had been drinking more alcohol since the COVID-19 pandemic began than they used to. People were more likely to be drinking alcohol more than they used to if they had more severe symptoms of depression or anxiety. The associations between depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased alcohol use since the COVID-19 pandemic began were consistent between females and males. LIMITATIONS: Online surveys are less accessible to some groups of people. The data are self-report and not diagnostic. Cross-sectional data can identify associations, not causal relationships. The study was limited to participants from Australia.

Vaccines derived from PEDV traditional strains impart less protection against the variant strains. Moreover, sequence diversity among different PEDV variant strains is also complicated. This necessitates developing alternative antiviral strategies for defending against PEDV. This study explored a natural product, Levistolide A (LA), to possess antiviral activity against PEDV. LA was found to suppress PEDV replication in a dose-dependent manner. And the inhibitory effect of LA against PEDV was maintained in the course of time. In terms of viral RNA and protein production, LA also showed a strong inhibitory effect. In addition, LA was indicated to inhibit PEDV from attaching to the cellular membrane or penetrating the cells. Further study revealed that LA can induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the corresponding inhibitor, NAC, was found to antagonize the effect of LA on inhibiting PEDV replication. This illustrated that the LA-induced ROS generation played an important role in its anti-PEDV activity. LA was also identified to stimulate ER stress, which is an important consequence of ROS production and was proven to be able to inhibit PEDV replication. To conclude, this study revealed that LA can inhibit PEDV replication via inducing ROS generation.","output":"Levistolide A Inhibits PEDV Replication via Inducing ROS Generation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive and therapeutic tools, that can be rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. By single cell sorting 4277 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein specific memory B cells from 14 Covid-19 survivors, 453 neutralizing antibodies were identified and 220 of them were expressed as IgG. Up to 65,9% of monoclonals neutralized the wild type virus at a concentration of >500 ng/mL, 23,6% neutralized the virus in the range of 100 - 500 ng/mL and 9,1% had a neutralization potency in the range of 10 - 100 ng/mL. Only 1,4% neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 1-10 ng/mL. We found that the most potent neutralizing antibodies are extremely rare and recognize the RBD, followed in potency by antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the S-protein trimeric structure and the S2 subunit.

Papers were assessed for quality and eligibility and key information was extracted relating to patterns of injury and risk factors. From an initial 264 records from PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and SafetyLit, studies were screened by title, abstract and full text to yield 12 key papers for analysis.

The average age of injured riders varies by country, but is commonly under 30 years old. Most injuries are lower limb musculoskeletal injuries, although there are no consistent data about frequency, severity or cost to the healthcare system. Twenty-three key risk factors were categorised according to rider characteristics, working conditions and environmental factors. The most common risk factors were younger age, lack of driving experience, time-pressured work and inadequate protective gear.

Considering that youngsters are in a development stage where they are still conforming their own social identity, they become especially vulnerable to these ideologiesinfluence. Therefore, it becomes critical to provide them with the psychological skills to rationalize and resist those influences. Video games, which are already a technology commonly consumed by these generations, provide a way to motivate and engage youngsters. Therefore, implementing these video games in interventions to increase psychological resilience represents an opportunity to create an innovative learning approach. Following this motivation, this paper has three main objectives: adapting a traditional emotional intelligence training program to a novel serious game based intervention, called YoungRes;providing a metric to measure the studentevolution based on in-game behavioural patterns, instead of indirect measures;and evaluating the impact of the intervention itself after its implementation. To do so, an 11 sessions intervention was applied to 36 students from two primary schools in Spain. Quantitative and qualitative data was extracted from the experience, consisting on data extracted from the players behaviour and a final survey. A detailed statistical analysis carried out showed two main outcomes: first, the serious game based intervention was very appreciated by the students, specially by those who frequently play video games;second, the intervention allowed to improve several emotional intelligence competences, such as active listening and controlled breathing, as well as to promote knowledge about the Islamic culture.

Infectious disease may produce an apparently similar form of isolation-disease avoidance-but on symptom remission this often abates. We propose that many forms of stigmatization reflect the activation of this disease-avoidance system, which is prone to respond to visible signs and labels that connote disease, irrespective of their accuracy. A model of this system is presented, which includes an emotional component, whereby visible disease cues directly activate disgust and contamination, motivating avoidance, and a cognitive component, whereby disease labels bring to mind disease cues, indirectly activating disgust and contamination. The unique predictions of this model are then examined, notably that people who are stigmatized evoke disgust and are contaminating. That animals too show avoidance of diseased conspecifics, and that disease-related stigma targets are avoided in most cultures, also supports this evolutionary account. The more general implications of this approach are then examined, notably how it can be used to good (e.g. improving hygiene) or bad (e.g. racial vilification) ends, by yoking particular labels with cues that connote disease and disgust. This broadening of the model allows for stigmatization of groups with little apparent connection to disease.","output":"Disease avoidance as a functional basis for stigmatization."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Rationale: A novel model of phenotypes based on set thresholds of respiratory system compliance (Crs) was recently postulated in context of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In particular, the dissociation between the degree of hypoxemia and Crs was characterized as a distinct ARDS phenotype. Objectives: To determine whether such Crs-based phenotypes existed among patients with ARDS before the COVID-19 pandemic and to closely examine the CrsCmortality relationship. Methods: We undertook a secondary analysis of patients with ARDS, who were invasively ventilated on controlled modes and enrolled in a large, multinational, epidemiological study. We assessed Crs, degree of hypoxemia, and associated Crs-based phenotypic patterns with their characteristics and outcomes. Measurements and Main Results: Among 1,117 patients with ARDS who met inclusion criteria, the median Crs was 30 (interquartile range, 23C40) ml/cm H(2)O. One hundred thirty-six (12%) patients had preserved Crs (50 ml/cm H(2)O; phenotype with low elastance [phenotype L]), and 827 (74%) patients had poor Crs (<40 ml/cm H(2)O; phenotype with high elastance [phenotype H]). Compared with those with phenotype L, patients with phenotype H were sicker and had more comorbidities and higher hospital mortality (32% vs. 45%; P < 0.05). A near complete dissociation between Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) and Crs was observed. Of 136 patients with phenotype L, 58 (43%) had a Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) < 150. In a multivariable-adjusted analysis, the Crs was independently associated with hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio per ml/cm H(2)O increase, 0.988; 95% confidence interval, 0.979C0.996; P = 0.005). Conclusions: A wide range of Crs was observed in nonCCOVID-19 ARDS. Approximately one in eight patients had preserved Crs. Pa(O(2))/Fi(O(2)) and Crs were dissociated. Lower Crs was independently associated with higher mortality. The CrsCmortality relationship lacked a clear transition threshold.","output":"Compliance Phenotypes in Early Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome before the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: In South Africa, the Control of Tobacco and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill seeks to regulate e-cigarettes as tobacco products, including their advertising, promotion and sponsorship. Population data on e-cigarette advertising in South Africa are needed to inform public health programs, practice and policy. We examined self-reported e-cigarette advertising exposure during 2017. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Household-based survey. PARTICIPANTS: 3063 individuals who participated in the 2017 South African Social Attitudes survey, a nationally representative, in-person survey of the non-institutionalised civilian adult population aged 16 years EXPOSURE: In the past 12 months, have you seen advertisements or promotions for e-cigarettes (including e-shisha, e-pipe) on any of the following media: newspapers/magazines, billboards, in the malls or any other source? MAIN OUTCOMES: Beliefs and attitudes regarding e-cigarettes. FINDINGS: Participants mean age was 37.7 years. Overall, 20.1% reported exposure to e-cigarette advertisements. By age, exposure was most prevalent among those aged 16C19 years (24.6%). Top sources of exposure among those exposed were stores, 40.7%; malls, 30.9%; and television, 32.5%. Of those aware of e-cigarettes, 61.2% believed e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes; 62.7% believed that e-cigarette advertisements and promotions may make ex-smokers think of starting smoking cigarettes again; and 59.5% supported the statement that e-cigarette smoking should be banned indoors just as traditional cigarette smoking. Notably, teens aged 16C19 reported the lowest prevalence (49.0%) of those believing that e-cigarette advertisements and promotion may make adolescents think of smoking traditional cigarettes, whereas this percentage was highest among those aged 55C64 years (73.2%). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive regulatory efforts are needed to address e-cigarette advertising, marketing and sponsorship in order to protect public health.

During the present study, we evaluated prospectively the potential of cytokines present in plasma from patients with dengue in stratifying disease severity. METHODS: Seventeen-cytokine multiplex fluorescent microbead immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection in 59 dengue patients. GLM models using bimodal or Gaussian family were determined in order to associate cytokines with clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis. RESULTS: IL-1, IFN-, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-7 and GM-CSF were significantly increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations (severe dengue) when compared to mild disease forms (mild dengue). In contrast, increased MIP-1 levels were observed in patients with mild dengue. MIP-1 was also associated with CD56+NK cell circulating rates. IL-1, IL-8, TNF- and MCP-1 were associated with marked thrombocytopenia. Increased MCP-1 and GM-CSF levels correlated with hypotension. Moreover, MIP-1 and IFN- were independently associated with both dengue severity and disease outcome.

Infected individuals with Covid-19 were noted to present with different symptoms, if at all. Some remained with symptoms even after testing negative for Covid-19. The aim was to explore for the most common acute and post-acute Covid-19 symptoms among adult residents in Malta. METHODS: Using Google forms, an anonymous survey was distributed on social media (1st to 26th February 2021) targeting the adult residents of Malta. The survey assessed for previous/current Covid-19 infection and for acute and post-acute (>4 weeks after negative test) symptoms. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. RESULTS: Out of the 1,034 participants, 6.38% (CI95%: 5.04-8.95) reported to have been positive for Covid-19, with a female predominance (71.21% CI95%:59.30-80.79; p = <0.01). Various combination of symptoms was reported. However, asymptomatic (13.64% CI95%: 7.12-24.15) dominated followed by the combination of fever, cough, headaches, fatigue, loss of taste and smell, aches and pains, and diarrhoea (10.61% CI95%:4.94-17.60). Although the majority did not report post-acute symptoms, a proportion reported the continuation of aches and pains with fatigue or the loss of taste and smell (6.06% CI95%:1.94-14.01; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Although small case numbers were evaluated in this study, it is clear that Covid-19 is affecting a proportion of the population. Asymptomatic Covid-19 is common, enforcing the fact that infectivity rate is higher than reported. However, multi symptomatic representation is also common, possibility requiring medical attention.

A review of online newspaper databases (1 January to 30 April 2020) that reported suicide cases and attempts triggered as a result of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were included and analysed. Out of the 28 identified cases, there were three suicide attempts, one homicide-suicide/pact-suicide, and 24 suicides spanning 10 countries. Durkheim explained the social causation of suicide and provided a four-fold suicide typology. The cases were analysed according to their appropriate typology, and classified as egoistic (9), altruistic (3), anomic (8), and fatalistic (8). Durkheim suggests that the rise and fall of suicide rates will depend on the nature of social change.

Registrations were received from 760 undergraduates representing 60 different countries. U.S. participants consisted of 59% women and 29% from populations traditionally underrepresented in the geosciences. The workshop design consisted of a tailored Linux virtual machine, regular webinars, a Slack workspace, tutorial-style active e-learning assignments, and an optional final project. Every other week for 12 weeks, a module with 6 assignments was released to build skills with Linux, Generic Mapping Tools, Seismic Analysis Code, webservices, seismic network processing, Python, ObsPy, and Jupyter notebooks. A final module focused on competitiveness for graduate school, summer internships, and professional jobs. Evaluation of the workshop relied on registration data, pre- and post-workshop surveys, and performance data from the learning management system. 440 participants completed at least one assignment, 224 completed at least 80% of the assignments, and 191 completed all 35 assignments, significantly higher than most comparable large-scale, open-access courses.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics were used to understand annual trends in demographic characteristics, cause and manner of death (based on autopsy), substances present in toxicology reports, geographic distribution of deaths, and use of health and social services prior to death. Total estimated numbers of people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco were assessed through semiannual point-in-time counts. The 2021 point-in-time count was postponed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: In San Francisco, there were 331 deaths among people experiencing homelessness in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 17, 2020, to March 16, 2021). This number was more than double any number in previous years (eg, 128 deaths in 2016, 128 deaths in 2017, 135 deaths in 2018, and 147 deaths in 2019). Most individuals who died were male (268 of 331 [81%]). Acute drug toxicity was the most common cause of death in each year, followed by traumatic injury. COVID-19 was not listed as the primary cause of any deaths. The proportion of deaths involving fentanyl increased each year (present in 52% of toxicology reports in 2019 and 68% during the pandemic). Fewer decedents had contacts with health services in the year prior to their death during the pandemic than in prior years (13% used substance use disorder services compared with 20% in 2019). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, the number of deaths among people experiencing homelessness in San Francisco increased markedly during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings may guide future interventions to reduce mortality among individuals experiencing homelessness.","output":"Mortality Among People Experiencing Homelessness in San Francisco During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact on global health, and has resulted in an unprecedented, international collaborative effort to develop vaccines to control the outbreak, protect human lives, and avoid further social and economic disruption. Mass vaccination campaigns are underway in multiple countries and are expected worldwide once more vaccine becomes available. Some early candidate vaccines use novel platforms, such as mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, and relatively new platforms, such as replication-deficient viral vectors. While these new vaccine platforms hold promise, limited safety data in humans are available. Serious health outcomes linked to vaccinations are rare, and some outcomes may occur incidentally in the vaccinated population. Knowledge of background incidence rates of these medical conditions is a critical component of vaccine safety monitoring to aid in the assessment of adverse events temporally associated with vaccination and to put these events into context with what would be expected due to chance alone. A list of 22 potential adverse events of special interest (AESI), including neurologic, autoimmune, and cardiovascular disorders, was compiled by subject matter experts at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recently available U.S. background rates for these medical conditions, overall and by age, sex, and race/ethnicity (when available), were sourced from reported statistics (data published by medical panels/ associations or federal government reports), and literature reviews in PubMed. This review provides estimates of background incidence rates for medical conditions that may be monitored or studied as AESI during safety surveillance and research for COVID-19 vaccines and other new vaccines.","output":"U.S. Population-Based background incidence rates of medical conditions for use in safety assessment of COVID-19 vaccines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Public health is considered a social value.

Among them, therapy with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) seems to be very promising in halting the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the illness and in providing the patients with passive immunity. NAbs are designed to mimic the bodys natural immune response. Coronavirus infection is mediated by the interplay between the viral spike and the tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor found on the apical surface of numerous cell types. However, nAbs are capable of blocking this interaction. They bind to the spike protein, thus impeding SARS-CoV-2 to enter human cells and tagging it for destruction. NAbs can be crucial in preventing COVID-19 from progressing to a severe form, and potentially are a prophylaxis option to subjects who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2, while still waiting to get a vaccine.

The mental health status of individuals could have a negative impact attributed to this global situation. Therefore, this study was intended to explore the symptoms of depression and anxiety among healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was undertaken by administering a web-based questionnaire between May and June 2020. Two tools, including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), were employed to measure anxiety and depression symptoms among HCWs. The data analyses were carried out using descriptive statistics, Man Whitney, and Kruskal Wallis tests. Results: Of 1094 HCWs who participated in this online survey, 742 (67.8%) were physicians, followed by nurses (n = 277, 25.3%) and pharmacists (n = 75, 6.9%). The survey respondents had a median depression and anxiety score of 5.00 (7.00-3.00) and 8.00 (11.00-5.00), respectively. A considerable number of HCWs (82.2%) utilized online psychological resources to deal with their psychological distress. Female HCWs, nurses, frontline HCWs, and HCWs aged 30-49 years were more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety (p < 0.05). Conclusion: During the recent ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, there is a mild level of symptoms of depression and anxiety among HCWs.

Left atrial (LA) strain analysis, assessing LA contractility have been associated with the development of new-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) in several clinical situations. We aimed to assess the diagnostic ability of LA strain parameters to predict NOAF in patients with severe hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia. Method We conducted a prospective single center study at Amiens Hospital University (NCT04354558). The population study was composed of adult patients with a severe or critical Covid-19 pneumonia in sinus rhythm at inclusion. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed within 48hours of admission. LA strain analysis was performed by an automated software. The following LA strain parameters were recorded: LA strain during reservoir phase (LASr), LA strain during conduit phase (LAScd) and LA strain during contraction phase (LASct). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of NOAF during the intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Results From March 2020 to February 2021, 79 patients were included. Sixteen patients (18%) developed NOAF in ICU. LAScd and LASr were significantly reduced in the NOAF group compared to the other group (8.1[6.3-10.9] vs. 17.2[5.0-10.2]%; P < 0.001 and 20.2 [12.3-27.3] % vs. 30.5 [23.8-36.2] %; P = 0.002 respectively). After adjustment, only LAScd remained independently predictive of NOAF (OR:2.43; 95%CI:1.18-3.37). A LAScd cut-off value of 11.1% had a sensitivity of 76% and a specificity of 75% to identify patients with NOAF. The 30-day cumulative risk of NOAF was 429% with LAScd <11% and 84% with LAScd >11% (log rank test P value<0.0001) (Fig. 1). Conclusion In patients with severe hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia, LAScd 11% at admission is a strong risk factor of NOAF development during critical care.","output":"Automated left atrial strain analysis for predicting new-onset atrial fibrillation in severe hypoxemic COVID-19 pneumonia: A prospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Disseminated Lyme disease requires treatment to prevent severe sequelae, particularly neurologic.

Furthermore, in our own county-level analysis from the U.S., we find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents have had vastly higher cumulative deaths from COVID-19. In light of this standing literature and our own analysis, it is critical to better understand how to mitigate or prevent these unequal outcomes for any future pandemic or public health emergency. Therefore, we assess the claim that raising institutional trust, primarily scientific trust, is key to mitigating these racial inequities.

The effects of this pandemic were not only on the physical and medical aspects but also on the psychological issues including anxiety disorders, depressive manifestations, sleep problems and others. Sleep disorders were very commonly reported during the novel Coronavirus-19 pandemic either in the acute phase of COVID-19 infection or after recovery. These sleep problems might have a drastic burden on the recovered patients life. This study aimed to investigate the sleep in the post-Coronavirus-19 period and if has an impact on the different items of patients quality of life. This cross-sectional observational study investigated the sleep problems in 500 patients in the post recovery period using Insomnia Severity Index and Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), their relation to this critical period and their impact on different domains of Quality of Life which was assessed by the SF36 Health Survey. RESULTS: Socio-demographic characteristics of 500 post-Coronavirus-19 patients were collected; the insomnia severity index and Pittsburgh sleep quality index evaluated the sleep pattern. The quality of life was investigated using Short Form 36 scale. The study revealed high scores of insomnia severity index (13.01  4.9), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (15.37  4.43), also high scores of different items of scale of quality of life in the studied group. CONCLUSION: Post-COVID-19 sleep disturbances were commonly reported in the recovery period, also these sleep deficits had an impact on the physical and mental aspects of quality of life, so these sleep problems must be managed properly especially in this critical pandemic era.","output":"Sleep in post-COVID-19 recovery period and its impact on different domains of quality of life"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"To reduce the wheat-flour-based food texture and flavor deterioration caused by starch retrogradation, herein wheat starch, the most ingredient in wheat flour, was modified by transglucosidase to delay long-term retrogradation of wheat starch.

As of late August 2020, over 25 million persons had been infected, and we will see the global death toll exceed one million by the end of 2020. Both are minimum estimates. All segments of society have been drastically affected. Schools worldwide have been forced to close due to illness and absenteeism, transmission and risk to vulnerable members of the school community, and community concerns. The decision to reopen school during a pandemic will have a tremendous impact on children's safety, growth, and well-being. Not opening invites social isolation and suboptimal educational experiences, especially for youth whose computing assets and online access are limited and those with special needs. The opening has hazards as well, and the mitigation of these risks is the topic of this chapter. Opening schools requires careful considerations of benefits, risks, and precautions. Guiding principles for safety and strategic application of the principles in each educational niche are critical issues to consider during school reopening. The fundamental principles of disease control involve school-directed initiatives (physical distancing and mask use, hand/face and surface cleansing, administrative controls, engineering controls) and individual-level risk reduction approaches to maximize adherence to new guidelines. The school-initiated \\"top-down\\" approaches and the individual-level \\"bottom-up\\" approaches must be synergized, as no single method will ensure safety. We discuss how to effectively layer strategies in each educational space to increase safety.

The S-glycoprotein in the virus is the key factor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell, which contains two functional domains: S1 is an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain, and S2 is necessary for fusion of the coronavirus and cell membranes. Moreover, it has been reported that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, mRNA level expression of Furin enzyme and ACE2 receptor had been reported in airway epithelia, cardiac tissue, and enteric canals. However, the expression patterns of ACE2 and Furin in different cell types of oral tissues are still unclear. Methods: In order to investigate the potential infective channel of the new coronavirus via the oropharyngeal cavity, we analyze the expression of ACE2 and Furin in human oral mucosa using the public single-cell sequence datasets. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed in mucosal tissue from different oral anatomical sites to confirm the expression of ACE2 and Furin at the protein level. Results: The bioinformatics results indicated the differential expression of ACE2 and Furin on epithelial cells from different oral anatomical sites. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that both the ACE2-positive and Furin-positive cells in the target tissues were mainly positioned in the epithelial layers, partly expressed in fibroblasts, further confirming the bioinformatics results. Conclusions: Based on these findings, we speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could invade oral mucosal cells through two possible routes: binding to the ACE2 receptor and fusion with cell membrane activated by Furin protease. Our results indicated that oral mucosa tissues are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 that could facilitate COVID-19 infection via respiratory and fecalCoral routes.","output":"ACE2 and Furin Expressions in Oral Epithelial Cells Possibly Facilitate COVID-19 Infection via Respiratory and FecalCOral Routes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prefabricated inpatient wards have been proven to be an efficient alternative to quickly extend the caring capacity for patients.

They are modelled as particles with different diameters (3 m, 6 m, 12 m, 20 m, 45 m and 175 m) by the EulerianCLagrangian model.

It is found that small particles (<20 m) can move along with the main flow streams. Most of them are removed by ventilation to the outlet(s). Large particles (>45 m) cannot move with the flow streams over a long path. Most of them deposit on solid surfaces in different regions of the ward in each ventilation strategy. Health workers should pay close attention to these polluted areas. Targeted cleaning of the polluted areas is necessary in a prefabricated inpatient ward.

To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021.

We have reviewed and performed a meta-analysis on a total of 140 studies including 12421 values for IL-6 in the blood of adult healthy donors. Among these studies 83 did not report a mean value and the standard deviation. Therefore, for the statistical analysis we used the values reported in 57 studies which included 3166 values for IL-6. RESULTS The reported values for IL-6 in the blood of healthy donors varied between 0 and 43.5 pg/ml. The pooled estimate of IL-6 was 5.186 pg/ml (95% CI: 4.631, 5.740). As the age increased by one year, IL-6 values increased by 0.05 pg/ml (95% CI: 0.02, 0.09; p<0.01). Though the heterogenicity as determined by I2 statistics was high in our study, the differences in IL-6 values are still at the level of a few pg/ml, which might be related to the differences in the conditions that influence IL-6 production in the healthy population.

The length of in-hospital stay, and mortality rate did not significantly reduce in the CP group compared with controls (p > 0.05) while WHO severity scores remarkably improved (p = 0.01), despite the higher frequency of underlying diseases among the CP group (66.7%) vs. controls (33.3%). Although CP has a remarkable immunomodulatory and antiviral potential to improve the cytokine storm and disease severity in COVID-19 patients, it did not considerably affect the mortality rate.

As a consequence of its highly infectious nature, countries all over the world have imposed extremely strict measures to control its spread. Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020 are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case). Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were retained.","output":"What Can We Estimate from Fatality and Infectious Case Data using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model?

Cardioviruses infection may cause serious complications in biomedical research. To improve the efficiency of routine screening for Cardioviruses infection, a duplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous detection and differentiation of TMEV and RTV. The duplex assay was specific for reference strains of TMEV and RTV, and no cross-reaction was found with seven other rodent viruses. The limits of detection of both TMEV and RTV were 4  10(1) copies RNA/reaction. Reproducibility was estimated using standard dilutions, with coefficients of variation <3.1%. 439 clinical samples were evaluated by both duplex real-time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR. For 439 clinical samples95 samples were positive for TMEV and 72 samples were positive for RTV using duplex real-time RT-PCR approach, whereas only 77 samples were positive for TMEV and 66 samples were positive for RTV when conventional RT-PCR was applied. Mixed infections were found in 20 samples when analyzed by conventional RT-PCR whereas 30 samples were found to be mixed infection when duplex real-time RT-PCR was applied.

Here, we compared a variety of replication features of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and analysed the cytopathology caused by the two closely related viruses in the commonly used Vero E6 cell line. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 generated higher levels of intracellular viral RNA, but strikingly about 50-fold less infectious viral progeny was recovered from the culture medium. Immunofluorescence microscopy of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells established extensive cross-reactivity of antisera previously raised against a variety of non-structural proteins, membrane and nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. Electron microscopy revealed that the ultrastructural changes induced by the two SARS viruses are very similar and occur within comparable time frames after infection. Furthermore, we determined that the sensitivity of the two viruses to three established inhibitors of coronavirus replication (remdesivir, alisporivir and chloroquine) is very similar, but that SARS-CoV-2 infection was substantially more sensitive to pre-treatment of cells with pegylated interferon alpha. An important difference between the two viruses is the fact that - upon passaging in Vero E6 cells - SARS-CoV-2 apparently is under strong selection pressure to acquire adaptive mutations in its spike protein gene. These mutations change or delete a putative furin-like cleavage site in the region connecting the S1 and S2 domains and result in a very prominent phenotypic change in plaque assays.","output":"SARS-coronavirus-2 replication in Vero E6 cells: replication kinetics, rapid adaptation and cytopathology"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The presented work summarizes the results of studies underlining the crucial role of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in both innate and adaptive immune responses as well as in tissue repairing processes during respiratory virus infection. Experimental studies justify that among respiratory virus infected mice, a weaker ER signaling leads to increased morbidity and mortality in both males and females. In animal experiments, estrogen treatment silences the inflammatory reactions and decreases virus titers leading to improved survival rate; it seems to be an ideal prevention and therapy against COVID-19. We should overcome the widespread reluctance to estrogen therapy as we have a unique estrogen formula; conjugated estrogens, or conjugated equine estrogens available under the brand name of Premarin deriving from natural sources. Premarin can exert similar ER upregulative and gene repairing power like endogenous estrogen without any risk for adverse reactions.

Hypertension was based on blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or a previous diagnosis. Logistic regressions were adjusted for traditional hypertension risk factors and previous trauma (e.g., recent rape). Hypertension was more prevalent in women with a history of all forms of IPV, NPSV, and SH, all p  0.001, compared to women without. Frequent NPSV (adjusted odds ratio: 1.63; 95% CI: 1.27-2.67) any SH (2.56; 1.60-4.03), frequent physical (1.44; 1.06-1.95) and emotional IPV (1.45; 1.06-1.98), and greater severity of emotional IPV (1.05; 1.02-1.08) were associated with hypertension.

The performance parameters showed that at higher OL the stability of systems failed and low biogas was produced. In contrast, increasing of operational temperature of systems induced more biogas generation due to the increment of metabolic activity of bacteria.

Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors have been shown to be associated with these gene mutations and include a variety of tumors such as angiomyolipomas and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this report, we present a case of a 28-year-old woman presenting with symptoms of severe abdominal pain and nausea with a medical history of cardiac rhabdomyoma, adenoma sebaceum, Ash leaf spots, bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, and retinal hamartoma, which are manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex. The patient was operated twice for colonic perforations in the rectosigmoid and ileocecal regions where the pathologic examination revealed multiple tumoral lesions in both specimens. DIAGNOSIS: The tumor consisted of a myomatous component where the nodules were composed of spindle cells with fascicular array, and a lymphangiomatous component where epithelioid cells could be observed. Immunohistochemically, smooth muscle markers (desmin and SMA) were positive and the epithelioid component showed HMB-45 positivity. A diagnosis of leiomyomatosis-like lymphangioleiomyomatosis was established due to its morphological and immunohistochemical features, the presence of the tumor in multiple foci, and widespread lymphovascular invasion. INTERVENTIONS: The patient had a perforation in her bowel twice during the hospital stay and underwent Hartmann operation and ileocecal resection in 2 different surgical operations. OUTCOMES: After the second operation the patient developed fever and was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. No other complication was observed during her stay and the patient's follow-up was unremarkable. CONCLUSION: Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors are associated with tuberous sclerosis and can rarely appear in the colon.

MR guided focused ultrasound (MR-g-FUS) and microbubbles have demonstrated safe, temporary, targeted BBB permeabilization clinically. METHODS: We developed clinically scalable, microbubble drug conjugates (MDCs) for the viral gene therapy, AAV.SIRT3-myc [adeno-associated virus expressing myc-tagged SIRT3], which has previously been shown to have disease modifying effects in animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). The lipid shells of the perfluorocarbon gas MDCs were covalently conjugated to antibodies with binding specificity to AAVs. Following systemic (iv) delivery of AAV.SIRT3-myc MDCs, MR-g-FUS was used to deliver SIRT3-myc to brain regions affected in PD. SIRT3-myc expression was determined post mortem, using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: An in vitro, SH-SY5Y cell culture model was used to show that the localized destruction of MDCs using ultrasound exposures within biological safety limits dissociated AAV2-GFP (green fluorescent protein) from the MDCs in the targeted area while maintaining their transduction capacity. In rats, MR-g-FUS resulted in BBB permeabilization in the striatum and substantia nigra (SNc). SIRT3-myc was expressed in the striatum, but not the SNc. CONCLUSION: These studies demonstrate that MDCs combined with MR-g-FUS are an effective method for delivery of viral vector gene therapies, such as AAV.SIRT3, to brain regions affected in PD.

An online longitudinal survey study was performed with pre-lockdown measurements in February, and subsequently in April and June 2020 (n = 259, mean age 59  14 years, 59% women). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess weight, diet quality, physical activity, alcohol intake, and smoking. Perceived stress was measured using the validated perceived stress scale (PSS-10). The presence of COVID-19 symptoms (yes/no) was defined as fever, or >3 of the following symptoms: weakness/tiredness, muscle ache, dry cough, loss of smell/taste, and breathing difficulties. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models, adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status and (change in) employment status. Minimal increases over time were observed in alcohol intake (0.6  0.7 to 0.7  1.1 glasses/day, p = 0.001) and smoking (9.5  8.7 to 10.9  9.4 cigarettes/day among 10% smokers, p = 0.03), but other lifestyle behaviors remained stable.

Examining how these constructs impact mental health and serve as risk factors for the development of clinically significant symptoms may help direct psychological support resources and preventative measures for university students. AIMS: To longitudinally examine associations between the aforementioned psychological constructs and symptoms of insomnia, anxiety and depression in a large representative sample of first-year university students. METHOD: Electronic surveys including validated measures of the predictors and outcomes were emailed to all first-year undergraduate students at entry to a major Canadian university, and followed up on at conclusion of the academic year. RESULTS: Compared with healthy sleepers, students screening positive for insomnia had lower self-esteem, higher self-evaluative perfectionism and increased external locus of control (all P < 0.001). Self-evaluative perfectionism (standardised  = 0.13, P < 0.01), self-esteem ( = ?0.30, P < 0.001) and external locus of control ( = 0.07, P = 0.02) measured at entry were significantly associated with insomnia symptoms at follow-up.

METHODS: In this multicenter two-phase observational prospective cohort study, we aim to assess the prevalence of anxiety prior to labor (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), as well as PPD at 6C8 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). RESULTS: Of the 330 women analyzed, 13.2% reported symptoms of depression using EPDS cut-off score 13. High antenatal levels of anxiety (24.8% scored 10 in GAD-7) were documented. A significant proportion of postpartum women reported a decrease in willingness to attend antenatal education courses (36%) and fewer antenatal visits to their obstetrician (34%) due to pandemic. Higher antenatal anxiety increased the odds of being depressed at 6C8 weeks postpartum (EPDS 13). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to reported prevalence of PPD from previous studies before the COVID-19 era in Greece, we did not find elevated rates during the first wave of the pandemic. High anxiety levels were observed indicating that there is a need for close monitoring in pregnancy during the pandemic and anxiety screening to identify women who need support in the pandemic era.

They comprise a large variety of rare and heterogeneous tumors with an estimated incidence of 3-5/100,000/year. They can arise in virtually every internal organ, but mainly occur in the gastroenteropancreatic and bronchopulmonary systems. Around 25% of the NETs are localized in the bronchopulmonary system. Approximately 2% of all lung tumors are NETs. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lung tumors, bronchopulmonary NETs are subdivided into typical carcinoids (TCs) and atypical carcinoids (ACs). The parameter with the highest impact on NET behavior and prognosis is the histological classification and staging according to the tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) system. The diagnosis of NETs is established by histological examination and the immunohistochemical detection of general neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin. Serum markers and the use of functional imaging techniques are important additive tools to establish the diagnosis of a NET. The only curative option for lung NETs is complete surgical resection. Beyond that, the currently available interdisciplinary therapeutic options are local ablation, biotherapy (somatostatin analogues), or chemotherapy. New therapeutic options such as peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and molecularly targeted therapies achieve promising results and are under further evaluation.

With the elimination of human malaria cases, knowlesi malaria cases in humans are increasing in Malaysia. This necessitates intensive vector studies using safer trapping methods which are both field efficient and able to attract the local vector populations. Thus, this study evaluated the potential of Mosquito Magnet as a collection tool for Anopheles mosquito vectors of simian malaria along with other known collection methods. METHODS: A randomized 4  4 Latin square designed experiment was conducted to compare the efficiency of the Mosquito Magnet against three other common trapping methods: human landing catch (HLC), CDC light trap and human baited trap (HBT). The experiment was conducted over six replicates where sampling within each replicate was carried out for 4 consecutive nights. An additional 4 nights of sampling was used to further evaluate the Mosquito Magnet against the gold standard HLC. The abundance of Anopheles sampled by different methods was compared and evaluated with focus on the Anopheles from the Leucosphyrus group, the vectors of knowlesi malaria. RESULTS: The Latin square designed experiment showed HLC caught the greatest number of Anopheles mosquitoes (n = 321) compared to the HBT (n = 87), Mosquito Magnet (n = 58) and CDC light trap (n = 13). The GLMM analysis showed that the HLC method caught significantly more Anopheles mosquitoes compared to Mosquito Magnet (P = 0.049). However, there was no significant difference in mean nightly catch of Anopheles mosquitoes between Mosquito Magnet and the other two trapping methods, HBT (P = 0.646) and CDC light traps (P = 0.197). The mean nightly catch for both An. introlatus (9.33  4.341) and An. cracens (4.00  2.273) caught using HLC was higher than that of Mosquito Magnet, though the differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). This is in contrast to the mean nightly catch of An. sinensis (15.75  5.640) and An. maculatus (15.78  3.479) where HLC showed significantly more mosquito catches compared to Mosquito Magnet (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mosquito Magnet has a promising ability to catch An. introlatus and An. cracens, the important vectors of knowlesi and other simian malarias in Peninsular Malaysia. The ability of Mosquito Magnet to catch some of the Anopheles mosquito species is comparable to HLC and makes it an ethical and safer alternative.

Both exceeded all expectations, registering more than 140 events in more than 30 countries each year - despite the pandemic context and a fully online format in 2020. In this session we will share insights from both editions, with the round table format allowing for a wider discussion of experiences with other countries from around the world. Under the motto celebrating healthy populations in 2019 and joining forces for healthier populations in 2020, EUPHW aims to raise awareness about public health, maximise existing messages around the five themes that are set each year, and encourage collaboration among all professionals contributing to public health at local, national, regional and European level. Amid the COVID-19 public health emergency, the importance of ensuring that populations remain healthy and that the public health community joins forces gained momentum. The five days of the 2020 edition were dedicated to the Sustainable Development Goals, primary care in the digital age, staying together for mental health, equal health for all, and healthy ageing - under the exceptional overarching theme of 'COVID-19 Collaboration, Coordination, Communication'. Last year's edition covered physical activity, healthy environments, the healthcare workforce, healthy and sustainable diets, and youth mental health. The EUPHW Coordinator will explain what the initiative consists of and reveal key figures from both editions. The different types of involvement in the EUPHW will also be described: Event host, Disseminator and Participant. Three panelists will represent the EUPHW Steering Committee, providing important insights into the backstage preparation of this large-scale initiative. One is the communications coordinator of the EUPHAnxt network, representing contributions from the young generation of public health professionals in Europe. A second panelist will not only share the experience of hosting EUPHW events but also represent EUPHA Sections, which play an important role in fact-checking resources and messages about each of the annual themes. The fourth panelist will share their experiences at country level through the Austrian Public Health Association and its own National Public Health Week. The final panelist will share examples of activities hosted by the community of public health schools across Europe. Although the focus of the EUPHW is the European region, its online reach enables the participation from anywhere in the world. In fact, both editions saw registered activities in Brazil, USA, South Africa, Kenya, Australia and Colombia. The EUPHW is an initiative by the European Public Health Association (EUPHA), receives co-funding under an operating grant from the European Union's Health Programme (2014-2020) and is supported by the WHO Regional Office for Europe.

Evaluations of the relationship between resilience and coping style among university students are important for developing effective health promotion strategies focused on resilience intervention to benefit students' health and well-being. The relationship between psychological resilience and coping styles has usually been examined among adults and patients. Very few studies have investigated the relationship between resilience and coping style in university students. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between psychological resilience, students' characteristics (gender, major and grade) and coping styles among undergraduate students. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students in Shandong Province, China. Undergraduate students were randomly selected from 6 universities in 3 cities of the province using a stratified random sampling method. The questionnaire included questions on the participants' demographic information, including gender, grade and major, measures of psychological resilience and coping style. Coping style was measured by the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The Asian Resilience Scale (ARS) was applied to evaluate undergraduates' psychological resilience. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between resilience, students' characteristics and positive coping styles. RESULTS: A sample of 1743 undergraduates was analysed. The mean psychological resilience score was 70.41. The mean score for positive coping style was 24.72. Multiple regression analysis showed that three factors of psychological resilience, mood control, self-plasticity and coping flexibility, were all significant factors for positive coping styles (regression coefficient = 0.34, 0.35, 0.14, p < 0.01 for the three factors, respectively). Medical students and females had higher scores for positive coping styles than non-medical students and males (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The research revealed that females and medical students are more likely than males and non-medical students to adopt positive coping styles. Higher psychological resilience is associated with a better positive coping style. The findings suggest that psychological education and health promotion programmes that target strengthening psychological resilience among undergraduate students may help foster positive coping styles to benefit their mental health and psychological well-being.","output":"Psychological resilience and positive coping styles among Chinese undergraduate students: a cross-sectional study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Exosomes are the main actors of intercellular communications and have gained great interest in the new cell-free regenerative medicine. These nanoparticles are secreted by almost all cell types and contain lipids, cytokines, growth factors, messenger RNA, and different non-coding RNA, especially micro-RNAs (mi-RNAs). Exosomes cargo is released in the neighboring microenvironment but is also expected to act on distant tissues or organs. Different biological processes such as cell development, growth and repair, senescence, migration, immunomodulation, and aging, among others, are mediated by exosomes and principally exosome-derived mi-RNAs. Moreover, their therapeutic potential has been proved and reinforced by their use as biomarkers for disease diagnostics and progression. Evidence has increasingly shown that exosome-derived mi-RNAs are key regulators of age-related diseases, and their involvement in longevity is becoming a promising issue. For instance, mi-RNAs such as mi-RNA-21, mi-RNA-29, and mi-RNA-34 modulate tissue functionality and regeneration by targeting different tissues and involving different pathways but might also interfere with long life expectancy. Human mi-RNAs profiling is effectively related to the biological fluids that are reported differently between young and old individuals. However, their underlying mechanisms modulating cell senescence and aging are still not fully understood, and little was reported on the involvement of mi-RNAs in cell or tissue longevity. In this review, we summarize exosome biogenesis and mi-RNA synthesis and loading mechanism into exosomes cargo. Additionally, we highlight the molecular mechanisms of exosomes and exosome-derived mi-RNA regulation in the different aging processes.","output":"Exosomes and Micro-RNAs in Aging Process"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent global explosion in Internet usage has enhanced worker productivity and the availability of information to remote and economically disadvantaged population segments unimagined just decades ago.

The employment of these external techniques is because the gain medium itself is incapable of modifying or multiplying the generated laser pulse. Herein, with single femtosecond laser pulse excitation, we achieve the double-pulsed stimulated emission with pulse duration of around 40 ps and pulse interval of around 70 ps from metal-halide perovskite multiple quantum wells. These unique stimulated emissions originate from one fast vertical and the other slow lateral high-efficiency carrier funneling from low-dimensional to high-dimensional quantum wells. Furthermore, such gain medium surprisingly possesses nearly Auger-free stimulated emission. These insights enable us a fresh approach to multiple the ultrashort laser pulse by gain medium.","output":"Ultrashort laser pulse doubling by metal-halide perovskite multiple quantum wells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background The global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has highlighted the need for rapid, accurate, and accessible diagnostics to enable timely treatment and outbreak control. However, current diagnostic tests based on RT-qPCR are insufficient to meet the global testing demand because of their high cost and complexity and supply chain shortages. Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) is a promising alternative to RT-qPCR because of its sensitivity, speed, and robustness to sample inhibitors. Here, we describe the development and optimisation of a sample-to-answer workflow, including a simple lysis and inactivation protocol that provides results in <1h, using inexpensive and readily available reagents. Further, we assess the sensitivity and specificity of the developed RT-LAMP assay against a RT-qPCR. Methods We collected samples from asymptomatic healthcare workers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and inpatients at Lyndon B Johnson Hospital in Houston, TX, USA. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected by medical providers and were placed directly into 300 L of an optimised lysis buffer. Samples were heat inactivated at 95C for 5 mins before direct amplification in a RT-LAMP assay using previously published primer sets. Heating and real-time monitoring was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 thermocycler and an Axxin T8-ISO, a benchtop fluorimeter designed for point-of-care settings. We compared results from the RT-LAMP test with standard-of-care RT-qPCR results on paired nasopharyngeal swabs collected into Universal Viral Transport Media. Findings The developed RT-LAMP assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 4C5 virions/L. The test requires a swab, two tubes, prepared lysis buffer, a heat block, pipettes, RT-LAMP reagents, and the real-time fluorimeter. Samples were collected between April 14, 2020 and Aug 12, 2020, and results from 74 enrolled participants were analysed in the optimised workflow. Thirty nine participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 35 participants tested negative in the hospital-administered RT-qPCR test. All 74 nasopharyngeal swab eluates were tested with our assay on the Bio-Rad CFX96; 72 nasopharyngeal swab eluates were also tested on the Axxin T8-ISO. The developed assay showed sensitivity of 9231% and 9189% when tested on the CFX96 and T8, respectively, and specificity of 9143% and 9789%, respectively. Interpretation RT-LAMP could be used for SARS-CoV-2 testing and overcomes the challenges of adapting an assay to a point-of-care instrument. Further, the reduced instrumentation cost and complexity, along with the simple workflow, highlight the potential for implementation of RT-LAMP for SARS-CoV-2 testing in resource-limited settings.

We disinfected surfaces contaminated with H1N1 influenza viruses using hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor at concentrations below 100 ppm and triethylene glycol (TEG)-saturated air containing 2 ppm of TEG at 25C. METHODS: Influenza viruses in aqueous suspensions were deposited on stainless-steel coupons, allowed to dry at ambient conditions, and then exposed for up to 15 minutes to 10 to 90 ppm of HP vapor or TEG-saturated air. Virus assays were done on the solution used to wash the viruses from these coupons and from coupons treated similarly but without exposure to HP or TEG vapor. RESULTS: After 2.5 minutes, exposure to 10-ppm HP vapor resulted in 99% inactivation. For air saturated with TEG at 25 to 29C, the disinfection rate was about 1.3 log(10) reductions per hour, about 16 times faster than the measured natural inactivation rate under ambient conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Vapor concentrations of 10 ppm HP or 2 ppm TEG can provide effective surface disinfection. At these low concentrations, the potential for damage to even the avionics of an airplane would be expected to be minimal. At a TEG vapor concentration of 2 ppm, there are essentially no health risks to people.","output":"Inactivating influenza viruses on surfaces using hydrogen peroxide or triethylene glycol at low vapor concentrations"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The terminal globular domain of the paramyxovirus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein spike has a number of conserved residues that are predicted to form its neuraminidase (NA) active site, by analogy to the influenza virus neuraminidase protein. We have performed a site-directed mutational analysis of the role of these residues in the functional activity of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) HN protein. Substitutions for several of these residues result in a protein lacking both detectable NA and receptor recognition activity. Contribution of NA activity, either exogenously or by coexpression with another HN protein, partially rescues the receptor recognition activity of these proteins, indicating that the receptor recognition deficiencies of the mutated HN proteins result from their lack of detectable NA activity. In addition to providing support for the homology-based predictions for the structure of HN, these findings argue that (i) the HN residues that mediate its NA activity are not critical to its attachment function and (ii) NA activity is required for the protein to mediate binding to receptors.","output":"Structural and functional relationship between the receptor recognition and neuraminidase activities of the Newcastle disease virus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein: receptor recognition is dependent on neuraminidase activity."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Large-Scale Social Limitations-related policies enacted by the Provincial Government of the Special Capital Region of Jakarta evoked an adaptation process to changes in their usual life patterns Such adaptation processes are suspected to create new problems, which might become stressors This research aims to perceive the effect of coping strategies on the psychological being of Jabodetabek (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, Bekasi) citizens during the Large- Scale Social Limitations period Results showed that there was a significant relationship between coping strategies and psychological well-being (p=0 000&lt;0 005) Research also found that most respondents cope by employing the emotion-focused coping system It was strongly suspected that citizens were able to cope and manage stressors during the pandemic by doing self-improvement activities and trying to connect with their social network (friendship or work-related) with existing technological platforms On the other hand, it was also suspected that the high number of respondents with emotion-focused coping was a result of feelings of helplessness in controlling problems arising during the pandemic, such as local government policies and socioeconomic impacts ? 2020 IEEE","output":"A study of coping stress strategies on psychological well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jabodetabek Area"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a life\\\\threatening lung illness characterized by persistent and progressive airflow limitation.

In a context of restrictions on movement outside the home in both countries, and where alcohol providers are trying to find new ways to reach their customers, this may lead to an intensification of the social and health harms associated with home drinking. By examining the current situation in both Australia and the UK, we argue that heightened risks from home drinking amid COVID-19 bring into sharp focus long-standing weaknesses within licensing systems in both countries: the regulation of off-premise outlets to minimise harms from drinking at home. We call for critical conversations on how licensing systems should be revised to take more responsibility for protecting people from the health and social harms associated with home drinking, both under COVID-19 and in the future.","output":"Accessibility of 'essential' alcohol in the time of COVID-19: Casting light on the blind spots of licensing?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Here, we report the draft genome sequences of six severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strains.

PCV-2 are small single-stranded circular DNA viruses clustered into two main genogroups: PCV-2a and PCV-2b. Each genogroup present a specific highly-conserved motif of six amino acids (between amino acids 86 and 91) in the PCV-2 capsid protein. The aim of this study was to verify whether the motif located in the capsid protein and specific to each PCV-2 genogroup contributes to virulence. Two parental DNA clones, PCV-2a and PCV-2b, were constructed as well as two mutants DNA clones, PCV-2a/motif 2b and PCV-2b/motif 2a by exchanging the capsid motif of each genogroup. The four DNA clones were characterized in vitro as well as in vivo. Cells transfected by the four DNA clones produced infectious viruses. In specific-pathogen-free piglets transfected by the four infectious DNA clones, PCV-2b/motif 2a virulence was not attenuated while the PCV-2a/motif 2b virulence was drastically reduced compared to their parent virulence. These results suggest that the amino acids between positions 86 and 91 of the capsid protein are determinant for the virulence of isolates.

Humans appear endowed with a cognitive system that has formed to meet the unique challenges that emerge for highly social species. Bullshitting, communication characterised by an intent to be convincing or impressive without concern for truth, is ubiquitous within human societies. Across two studies (N = 1,017), we assess participants' ability to produce satisfying and seemingly accurate bullshit as an honest signal of their intelligence. We find that bullshit ability is associated with an individual's intelligence and individuals capable of producing more satisfying bullshit are judged by second-hand observers to be more intelligent. We interpret these results as adding evidence for intelligence being geared towards the navigation of social systems. The ability to produce satisfying bullshit may serve to assist individuals in negotiating their social world, both as an energetically efficient strategy for impressing others and as an honest signal of intelligence.","output":"Bullshit Ability as an Honest Signal of Intelligence."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Social support services such as day care centres are important in post-diagnostic dementia care to enable people living with dementia stay at home for longer. Little research has addressed potential inequalities in access, with no research on variations before and since COVID-19. The aim of this study was to explore inequalities in social support service usage before and since the pandemic. METHODS: Unpaid carers and people living with dementia were interviewed over the phone about their experiences of accessing social support services before and since the COVID-19 pandemic. Transcripts were analysed for key themes using inductive and deductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifty participants (42 unpaid carers; eight people living with dementia) were interviewed, and five themes identified: (1) Service issues; (2) Access issues; (3) Relying on own initiative; (4) New inequalities due to COVID-19; and (5) Missing out on the benefits of support services. Participants reported transport, finances, and location as factors reducing their ability to access support service pre-COVID, with inequalities remaining and at times exacerbated since. Carers and people living with dementia also reported struggling with accessing basic necessities during COVID, including food and medicines.

By this approach, juxtaposed putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nucleic acid binding (\\"finger\\"-like) and RNA helicase domains were identified in F2. Together, these domains might constitute the core of the protein complex involved in the primer-dependent transcription, replication and recombination of coronaviruses. In F1, two cysteine protease-like domains and a growth factor-like one were revealed. One of the putative proteases of IBV is similar to 3C proteases of picornaviruses and related enzymes of como- nepo- and potyviruses. Search of IBV F1 and F2 sequences for sites similar to those cleaved by the latter proteases and intercomparison of the surrounding sequence stretches revealed 13 dipeptides Q/S(G) which are probably cleaved by the coronavirus 3C-like protease. Based on these observations, a partial tentative scheme for the functional organization and expression strategy of the non-structural polyproteins of IBV was proposed.

OBJECTIVE: To describe usefulness, safety, effectiveness and limitations of a telerehabilitation program applied in people with severe haemophilia implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. DESIGN AND METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted based on a focus group. Four analytical categories were predefined, three of which involved elements of Donabedian's model for quality assessment in health care (structure, process and results). RESULTS: One of the most important aspects according to all of the participants is the sense of safety they experienced while being taken care of by a physiotherapist specializing in PWH rehabilitation. This facilitated trust in the professional and adherence to treatment. All participants reported improvements in their physical condition and sense of well-being. The lack of adequate equipment at home, the limited length of the sessions, the perception that the physiotherapist may not be able to perform an appropriate physical examination and the lack of direct supervision were described as disadvantages. CONCLUSIONS: The findings underscored that telerehabilitation had high satisfaction among PWH. Telerehabilitation was perceived by PWH as a safe and effective intervention to improve physical condition. Telerehabilitation could be further supported and improved, and coverage could be enhanced, including rural and remote areas, which suffer from chronic inequalities in access to rehabilitation. The lack of face-to-face supervision and physical examination were perceived as the principal disadvantages.

Intranasal delivery is a promising route because general limitations, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are circumvented. In the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) or Alzheimers disease, for example, future treatment prospects include specialized particles as delivery vehicles. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles are well known as promising delivery systems, especially in the area of nose-to-brain (N2B) delivery. Chitosan is also broadly known as a functional additive due to its ability to open tight junctions. In this study, we produced PLGA nanoparticles of different sizes and revealed for the first time their size-time-dependent uptake mechanism into the lamina propria of porcine olfactory mucosa. The intracellular uptake was observed for 80 and 175 nm within only 5 min after application to the epithelium. After 15 min, even 520 nm particles were detected, associated with nuclei. Especially the presence of only 520 nm particles in neuronal fibers is remarkable, implying transcellular and intracellular transport via the olfactory or the trigeminal nerve to the brain and the CNS. Additionally, we developed successfully specialized Nano-in-Micro particles (NiMPs) for the first time via spray drying, consisting of PLGA nanoparticles embedded into chitosan microparticles, characterized by high encapsulation efficiencies up to 51%, reproducible and uniform size distribution, as well as smooth surface. Application of NiMPs accelerated the uptake compared to purely applied PLGA nanoparticles. NiMPs were spread over the whole transverse section of the olfactory mucosa within 15 min. Faster uptake is attributed to additional paracellular transport, which was examined via tight-junction-opening. Furthermore, a separate chitosan penetration gradient of 150 m caused by dissociation from PLGA nanoparticles was observed within 15 min in the lamina propria, which was demonstrated to be proportional to an immunoreactivity gradient of CD14. Due to the beneficial properties of the utilized chitosan-derivative, regarding molecular weight (150C300 kDa), degree of deacetylation (80%), and particle size (0.1C10 m) we concluded that M2-macrophages herein initiated an anti-inflammatory reaction, which seems to already take place within 15 min following chitosan particle application. In conclusion, we demonstrated the possibility for PLGA nanoparticles, as well as for chitosan NiMPs, to take all three prominent intranasal delivery pathways to the brain and the CNS; namely transcellular, intracellular via neuronal cells, and paracellular transport.","output":"Nano-in-Micro-Particles Consisting of PLGA Nanoparticles Embedded in Chitosan Microparticles via Spray-Drying Enhances Their Uptake in the Olfactory Mucosa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Pfam database is a widely used resource for classifying protein sequences into families and domains.

Cutting, edging or grinding ES releases respirable crystalline silica (RCS). Cases of severe and fatal silicosis among ES workers have been described globally. In the United States, more stringent exposure control and medical surveillance regulations were promulgated in 2017 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We sought to characterize current silica exposure control and medical surveillance practices among ES employers, with the goal of informing outreach and education on silicosis prevention in these high-risk workplaces. Methods: Utilizing ReferenceUSA data, worksites in Colorado and Ohio with a primary North American Industry Classification System code for cut stone fabrication (327991) or masonry contractors (238140) were identified. We developed a brief anonymous digital survey for ES employers. Questions included number of employees, years in business, products manufactured, exposure monitoring, dust controls, work practices, and employees' use of personal protective equipment, with additional questions on COVID-19 impacts. A knowledgeable ES employer pilot-tested the survey tool. An option to selfidentify was included for employers seeking assistance with regulatory compliance and/or employee training. An invitation to complete the survey was mailed to a preliminary set of Colorado ES businesses. Along with a scannable QR code linked directly to the survey, a brief statement from a respected industry stakeholder that urged ES employers to participate was included. Results: We identified 330 ES businesses in Colorado. 89% employed &lt;10 workers, and &lt; 2% had more than 50 employees. We identified 557 ES businesses in Ohio;86% employed &lt;10 workers. Excluding 25 businesses that lacked address data, we mailed 293 letters to Colorado ES businesses identified through ReferenceUSA. 23% were returned due to incorrect or inactive mailing addresses. Within 6 weeks, only one business had responded to the mailed survey. Discussion: Our study highlights the challenges of surveying employers' approaches to silica exposure control. Despite anonymity, employers may be reluctant to share information that could have perceived regulatory implications. Incorrect addresses from ReferenceUSA and/or currently inactive ES businesses may have contributed to poor response rates, and direct mail appears inadequate for survey purposes. COVID-19 impacts on small employers may also have affected response rates. Future directions include partnering with a national stone fabrication trade association for outreach to ES members via social media and electronic mail.","output":"Silicosis prevention in engineered stone industries in Ohio and Colorado: A cross-sectional employer survey"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Der Klimawandel ist ohne Zweifel eine der gr??ten globalen Herausforderungen fr die Wirtschaftspolitik Nur bei wenigen Fragestellungen ist die Diagnose so klar, der Handlungsdruck so akut Gemein haben die meisten bisher ergriffenen Ma?nahmen, dass sie versuchen, dem Klimawandel durch Reduktion der nationalen Nachfrage nach fossilen Brennstoffen zu begegnen Ein aktuelles Beispiel ist die ?Unter 1000 mach ichs nicht-Kampagne der ?Scientist for Future-Bewegung Rund 2000 Professorinnen und Professoren hatten sich kurz vor der Corona-Krise selbstverpfl ichtet, bei Dienstreisen unter 1000 km auf Flge zu verzichten Wie gro? kann die Wirkung solcher Initiativen sein?","output":"Nachfrageorientierte Klimapolitik  Evidenz aus der Corona-Krise"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The Covid-19 lockdown is taking its toll on individuals, families, communities and businesses across the world.

We explored COVID-19 control strategies that could offer the greatest benefit in resource limited settings. Methods Using an age-structured SEIR model, we explored the effects of COVID-19 control interventions--a lockdown, physical distancing measures, and active case finding (testing and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine)-- implemented individually and in combination to control a hypothetical COVID-19 epidemic in Kathmandu (population 2.6 million), Nepal. Results A month-long lockdown that is currently in place in Nepal will delay peak demand for hospital beds by 36 days, as compared to a base scenario of no interventions (peak demand at 108 days (IQR 97-119); a 2 month long lockdown will delay it by 74 days, without any difference in annual mortality, or healthcare demand volume. Year-long physical distancing measures will reduce peak demand to 36% (IQR 23%-46%) and annual morality to 67% (IQR 48%-77%) of base scenario. Following a month long lockdown with ongoing physical distancing measures and an active case finding intervention that detects 5% of the daily infection burden could reduce projected morality and peak demand by more than 99%.

Human placental trophoblasts synthesize, secrete and take up the T4 binding protein transthyretin, providing a route for maternal T4 to enter the placenta. Transthyretin is also involved in T4 transport in other tissues such as the brain choroid plexus. Nicotine alters transthyretin synthesis and function in rat choroid plexus. If nicotine influences trophoblast turnover of transthyretin, then it may directly affect placental transfer of T4 to the developing fetus and contribute to the negative impacts of smoking on fetal growth, development and placental function. METHODS The effect of nicotine on trophoblast uptake of Alexa-labelled transthyretin was measured using live cell imaging. The effect of nicotine on protein expression was measured by western blotting. Interactions between transthyretin, T4 and nicotine were investigated using chemical cross-linking techniques and molecular dynamic simulations. RESULTS Nicotine blocks uptake of transthyretin-T4 by human placental trophoblast cells. Nicotine reduces the expression of the trophoblast scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1) that plays a role in transthyretin-T4 uptake. Molecular dynamic modelling suggests that when T4 is bound to transthyretin, nicotine binding increases tetramer stability, reducing the ability of the transthyretin-T4 complex to enter trophoblast cells. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that nicotine exposure during pregnancy reduces transplacental transport of transthyretin and T4 to the placenta and developing fetus. This may contribute to the negative effects of smoking on fetal growth, development and pregnancy viability.","output":"Nicotine binds to the transthyretin-thyroxine complex and reduces its uptake by placental trophoblasts."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Vitamin D deficiency is common in critically ill patients, and its role in COVID-19 patients could be important.

Various scientific societies recommend the screening of vitamin D in individuals at risk for deficiency. Despite that, the demographics of Vitamin D levels amongst critically ill patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 are currently unknown. We propose a study to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in a consecutive population of COVID-19 patients admitted to intensive care units and to evaluate its relationship with clinical outcomes. We study 226 COVID-19 patients between March 16 and April 26, 2020. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency could not be determined because the value of 25-hydroxyvitamin D was obtained in a few patients (17 patients, 7,5%). However, all patients with serum determinations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D presented a level lower than 20 ng/ml and thirteen patients (76,5%) levels < 12,5 ng/ml.

It is particularly important that these are understood in patients taking complex immunusuppressive therapies. Rapid delivery of targeted and up-to-date video messages from clinicians sent directly to patients could address patient uncertainty, and improve COVID-19 vaccination uptake. Innovative SMS (short message service) based video message has already shown promise in delivering COVID-19 information to patients [1]. We present our experience in creating a tailored vaccine information video sent directly to our large cohort of patients in the UK with a range of rheumatic diseases and report on the learning points going forward. Objectives: Our three objectives were: (1) educate our patients using an interactive mobile video information resource outlining the safety of the COVID vaccination in these patient groups;(2) better understand our patients' views of the COVID-19 vaccine;(3) evaluate the patient experience of this approach. Methods: We designed and recorded an 8-minute interactive web-based video delivered education resource designed for mobile phones. This included: aims of the video;details of licenced vaccines;UK vaccination schedule;frequently asked questions;links to national charity resources;our clinician recommendations;a rheumatologist being vaccinated;case studies;and summary data. We produced a simple mobile phone web-based evaluation of the resource, including anonymised patient demographics, their understanding of the safety of the vaccine pre/ post video, and their user experience. Resource and evaluation were piloted by local healthcare professionals, our Patient Participation Group, a national charity, and approved by senior management. We distributed this to our follow-up patient cohort via our hospital SMS provider on 21.12.20, at the start of roll-out of UK vaccines, containing a link to the resource and evaluation. Results: Of a cohort of 10,981 patients, we had 8886 mobile phone numbers. At Day 14, we recorded 2358 video views (26.3%) and 664/2358 completed evaluations (28.1%). Only one person reported being unable to watch the video. Before watching the video, 348/664 patients (52.4%) were unsure if the vaccine was safe and/or recommended for them, rising to 626/664 (94.3%) post-video. Reasons for uncertainty after the video (38/664) included drug allergy and fertility concerns. Following the video, 509/664 patients (76.6%) reported that they were more likely to have the vaccination. The majority of the patients (614/660, 93.0%) agreed that the method was a helpful method to share such information.Age distribution of our whole cohort, patients with mobile phones, and responders were similar: Age >50 was 80.4%,76.3%,and 88.6% respectively. A large proportion was treated with immunosuppressive medication (61.3% conventional DMARD, 39.4% biological DMARD and 17.6% corticosteroids). Gender and case mix for responders were similar to published data from our cohort: female 74.0%;rheumatoid arthritis commonest disease (389/664, 58.5%).

We investigated the association between COVID-19 and stroke. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study involving patients discharged from a healthcare system in New York State, from January to April 2020. A mixed-effects logistic regression analysis and a propensity score-weighted analysis were used to control for confounders and investigate the association of COVID-19 with ischemic stroke. Similar techniques were used to detect the impact of concurrent COVID-19 infection on unfavorable outcomes for patients with stroke. RESULTS: Among 24 808 discharges, 2513 (10.1%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 566 (0.2%) presented with acute ischemic stroke. Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were at one-quarter the odds of stroke compared with other patients (odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.16-0.40]). This association was consistent in all age groups. Our results were robust in sensitivity analyses, including propensity score-weighted regression models. In patients presenting with stroke, concurrent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was associated with higher case-fatality (odds ratio, 10.50 [95% CI, 3.54-31.18]) and a trend towards increased occurrence of discharge to rehabilitation (odds ratio, 2.45 [95% CI, 0.81-1.25]). CONCLUSIONS: Using a comprehensive cross-section of patients from a large NY-based healthcare system, we did not identify a positive association between ischemic stroke and COVID-19. However, patients with stroke with COVID-19 had worse outcomes compared with those without, with over a 9-fold increase in mortality.

Although arrhythmia characterization and possible predictors were previously reported, there are conflicting data regarding the exact prevalence of arrhythmias. Clinically applicable algorithms to classify COVID patients' arrhythmic risk are still lacking, and are the aim of our study. METHODS: We describe a single center cohort of hospitalized patients with a positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 during the initial Israeli outbreak between 1/2/2020 -30/5/2020. The study's outcome was any documented arrhythmia during hospitalization, based on daily physical examination, routine ECG's, periodic 24-hour Holter, and continuous monitoring. Multivariate analysis was used to find predictors for new arrhythmias and create classification trees for discriminating patients with high and low arrhythmic risk. RESULTS: Out of 390 COVID-19 patients included, 28 (7.2%) had documented arrhythmias during hospitalization, including: 23 atrial tachyarrhythmias, combined atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia storm, and 3 bradyarrhythmias. Only 7/28 patients had previous arrhythmias. Our study showed significant correlation between disease severity and arrhythmia prevalence (p<0.001) with a low arrhythmic prevalence among mild disease patients (2%). Multivariate analysis revealed background heart failure (CHF) and disease severity are independently associated with overall arrhythmia while age, CHF, disease severity, and arrhythmic symptoms are associated with tachyarrhythmias. A novel decision tree using age, disease severity, CHF, and troponin levels was created to stratify patients into high and low risk for developing arrhythmia.

This paper examines the current responses in New South Wales prisons to the threat of COVID-19 to prisoner health, by contrasting contemporary activities with actions and policy developed during two historical epidemics: the influenza epidemic of 1860 and pandemic of 1919. Method: Epidemiological information relating to cases of disease in NSW prisons during the 1860 and 1919 influenza epidemics was obtained from the Comptroller-General's reports for the specific outbreak years and for the preceding and succeeding five-year periods. Additional archival sources such as digitised newspaper reports and articles available through the National Library of Australia were analysed for closer detail. The management of these outbreaks was compared to current strategies to mitigate against risk from the COVID-19 pandemic in the NSW prison system. Results: Interesting similarities were discovered in relation to the management of the historic influenza outbreaks in NSW prisons and in the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic. An outbreak of influenza in mid-1860 impacted seven penal institutions in Sydney and Parramatta. Infection rates at these institutions were between 3.1% and 100%; the mean rate was 41.8%. The public health measures employed at the time included allowing 'air circulation freely night and day', and treatments that were 'tonical and stimulatory'. Discussion: While the past 100 or more years have brought huge progress in scientific knowledge, public health approaches remain the mainstay of outbreak management in prisons; and, as in 1919, the opportunity for Australia to observe the rest of the world and plan for action has not been wasted.

GD has 3 major types namely, non-neuronopathic (type I), acute neuronopathic (type II), and chronic neuronopathic (type III). Definite treatment options are limited and expensive. They succumb early to the disease, if untreated. There is paucity of studies from the Indian subcontinent, which elicit the factors resulting in their premature mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective study was carried out in a tertiary care setting of South India to assess the clinical profile, mutation spectrum, and various management strategies (only supportive therapy, enzyme replacement therapy [ERT], substrate reduction therapy [SRT] haematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT]), and mortality predictors of patients with GD from 2004 to 2019. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was plotted. In silico predictions were performed for novel variants. RESULTS There were 60 patients with all types of GD seen over the study period of 15 years. Their median age at diagnosis was 2 years. The median follow-up was for 5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 2-8). The overall mortality rate was 35%; however, it was only 10% in those receiving definite treatment. Mortality was higher (47.5%) by more than 4 folds in those only on supportive therapy. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 6.3 years (IQR = 3.5-10.8) in the definite treatment group and 3.5 years (IQR = 1-5) in those on supportive therapy. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed significant (p value 0.001) mortality difference between these groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found the neuronopathic type (OR = 5) and only supportive therapy (OR = 6.3) to be the independent risk factors for premature mortality. CONCLUSION GD is a rare disease with a high mortality rate, if left untreated. ERT and SRT are the definitive treatments which increase the survival. In resource-limited settings like India, with higher prevalence of the neuronopathic type, HSCT may be a more suitable definitive treatment option, due to its one-time intervention and cost, assuming similar efficacy to ERT. However, the efficacy and safety of HSCT in GD needs to be established further by substantial patient numbers undergoing it.","output":"Clinicogenetic Profile, Treatment Modalities, and Mortality Predictors of Gaucher Disease: A 15-Year Retrospective Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: New SARS-CoV-2 variants with increased transmissibility, like B.1.1.7 from England or B1.351 from South Africa, have caused considerable concern worldwide.

For the detection of retinopathy lesions from retinal images, several automatic approaches based on deep neural networks have been developed in the recent years. Most of the proposed methods produce point estimates of pixels belonging to the lesion areas and give no or little information on the uncertainty of method predictions. However, the latter can be essential in the examination of the medical condition of the patient when the goal is early detection of abnormalities. This work extends the recent research with a Bayesian framework by considering the parameters of a convolutional neural network as random variables and utilizing stochastic variational dropout based approximation for uncertainty quantification. The framework includes an extended validation procedure and it allows analyzing lesion segmentation distributions, model calibration and prediction uncertainties. Also the challenges related to the deep probabilistic model and uncertainty quantification are presented. The proposed method achieves area under precision-recall curve of 0.84 for hard exudates, 0.641 for soft exudates, 0.593 for haemorrhages, and 0.484 for microaneurysms on IDRiD dataset.","output":"Deep Bayesian baseline for segmenting diabetic retinopathy lesions: Advances and challenges."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with an increasing public health concern. Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P  0.05. The respondents mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD  3.0) and 24.1 (SD  2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels. However, relatively lower proportions showed adherence to avoid touching face or nose (19.5%), face mask-wearing (58.1%), and social distancing (57.4%).

Our review of 248 policy reports and expert consultation revealed waves of political attention and repeated reframings of AMR as a policy object. AMR emerged as an object of international policy-making during the 1990s. Until then, AMR was primarily defined as a challenge of human and agricultural domains within the Global North that could be overcome via rational drug use and selective restrictions. While a growing number of reports jointly addressed human and agricultural AMR selection, international organisations (IOs) initially focused on whistleblowing and reviewing data. Since 2000, there has been a marked shift in the ecological and geographic focus of AMR risk scenarios. The Global South and One Health (OH) emerged as foci of AMR reports. Using the deterritorialised language of OH to frame AMR as a Southern risk made global stewardship meaningful to donors and legitimised pressure on low-income and middle-income countries to adopt Northern stewardship and surveillance frameworks. It also enabled IOs to move from whistleblowing to managing governance frameworks for antibiotic stewardship. Although the environmental OH domain remains neglected, realisation of the complexity of necessary interventions has increased the range of topics targeted by international action plans. Investment nonetheless continues to focus on biomedical innovation and tends to leave aside broader socioeconomic issues.

Twenty-seven questions assessed knowledge, confidence, and trust scores on COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials from participants in 46 districts in Uganda. Resultswe found low levels of knowledge (i.e., confusing COVID-19 with Ebola) with males being more informed than females (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.7C3.0), and mistrust associated with policy decisions to promote herbal treatments in Uganda and the rushed international clinical trials, highlighting challenges for the upcoming OxfordCAstraZeneca vaccinations.

Young adults are vulnerable to pandemic-related adverse mental health outcomes, but little is known about the impact on adolescents. We examined factors associated with perceived changes in mood and anxiety among male youth in urban and Appalachian Ohio. METHODS In June 2020, participants in an ongoing male youth cohort study were invited to participate in an online survey that included questions about changes in mood, anxiety, closeness to friends and family, and the major impacts of the pandemic. Weighted log-binomial regression models were used to assess the risk of worsened mood and increased anxiety. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between perceived changes in mood and anxiety and perceived changes in closeness to friends and family and open-ended responses to a question about COVID-19's impact on participants. RESULTS Perceived worsened mood and increased anxiety during the pandemic were associated with higher household socioeconomic status, older age, feeling less close to friends and family, and reporting that COVID-19 negatively affected mental health. A perceived increase in anxiety was also associated with a history of symptoms of depression or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS Specific subgroups of male youth may be at heightened risk of worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions should target vulnerable adolescents and seek to increase closeness to social contacts. Such efforts could involve novel programs that allow youth to stay connected to friends, which might mitigate the negative impact on mental health.","output":"Perceived Changes in Mood and Anxiety Among Male Youth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From a Mixed-Methods Study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BackgroundFew datasets have been established that capture the full breadth of COVID-19 patient interactions with a health system.

The parents completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and a subset of items from the questionnaire of the COVID-19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents, and Children in Epidemics (Co-SPACE) survey of parental mental health, childs psychological symptoms, parent-child, and marital relationship. Several multiple linear regressions were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The largest variance in parental mental health was explained by the childs psychological symptoms (effect size beta = 0.27). Parent-child (effect size beta = -0.13) and marital relationship (effect size beta = -0.21) were negatively associated with parental mental health.

We used two real-time, real-life ecological momentary assessments once before and once during the initial lockdown of the pandemic (N = 70 participants; n~6800 observations) capturing the protective role of social interactions on well-being. Moreover, we used a multimethod approach to analyze ecological assessment data with individual risk and resilience factors, which are promising moderators in the relationship of social behavior, stress reactivity, and affective states (i.e., amygdala volume, neuroticism, polygenic risk for schizophrenia). Social contacts were linked to higher positive affect both during normal times and during the COVID-19-pandemic (beta coefficient = 0.1035), highlighting the beneficial role of social embedding. Interestingly, this relationship was differentially moderated by individual risk and resilience factors. In detail, participants with a larger left amygdala volume (beta coefficient = ?0.0793) and higher neuroticism (beta coefficient = ?0.0958) exhibited an affective benefit from more social interactions prior to the pandemic. This pattern changed during the pandemic with participants with smaller amygdala volumes and lower neurotic traits showing an affective gain during the pandemic. Moreover, participants with low genetic risk for schizophrenia showed an affective benefit (beta coefficient = ?0.0528) from social interactions irrespective of the time point.

When PPH occurs, early identification of bleeding and prompt management using evidence-based guidelines, can avert most PPH-related severe morbidities and deaths. However, adherence to the World Health Organization recommended practices remains a critical challenge. A potential solution to inefficient and inconsistent implementation of evidence-based practices is the application of a clinical care bundle for PPH management. A clinical care bundle is a set of discrete, evidence-based interventions, administered concurrently, or in rapid succession, to every eligible person, along with teamwork, communication, and cooperation. Once triggered, all bundle components must be delivered. The E-MOTIVE project aims to improve the detection and first response management of PPH through the implementation of the E-MOTIVE bundle, which consists of (1) Early PPH detection using a calibrated drape, (2) uterine Massage, (3) Oxytocic drugs, (4) Tranexamic acid, (5) Intra Venous fluids, and (6) genital tract Examination and escalation when necessary. The objective of this paper is to describe the protocol for the formative phase of the E-MOTIVE project, which aims to design an implementation strategy to support the uptake of this bundle into practice. METHODS: We will use behavior change and implementation science frameworks [e.g. capability, opportunity, motivation and behavior (COM-B) and theoretical domains framework (TDF)] to guide data collection and analysis, in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania. There are four methodological components: qualitative interviews; surveys; systematic reviews; and design workshops. We will triangulate findings across data sources, participant groups, and countries to explore factors influencing current PPH detection and management, and potentially influencing E-MOTIVE bundle implementation. We will use these findings to develop potential strategies to improve implementation, which will be discussed and agreed with key stakeholders from each country in intervention design workshops. DISCUSSION: This formative protocol outlines our strategy for the systematic development of the E-MOTIVE implementation strategy. This focus on implementation considers what it would take to support roll-out and implementation of the E-MOTIVE bundle. Our approach therefore aims to maximize internal validity in the trial alongside future scalability, and implementation of the E-MOTIVE bundle in routine practice, if proven to be effective.

Aiming at the problems of tracking and transparency of an asymmetric teleoperation system, a robust control algorithm based on a state observer was proposed. The Haptic Device was designed and was chosen as the master-robot of the system. The Baxter dual-arm robot was chosen as the slave-robot of the system. The simulation experiment of robust control based on a state observer of the asymmetric teleoperation robot was carried out. The experiment results showed that the maximum values of displacement tracking errors in three directions x, y, and z are 0.02 m, 0.01 m, and 0.015 m, respectively. Compared with single- joint PID control, the performance of the new control algorithm is improved. The force feedback experiment on the real asymmetric teleoperation robot system was carried out. The results showed that the force feedback wave is consistent with the actual situation and showed that the robust control algorithm proposed is superior to PID. Therefore, the algorithm perfectly satisfied the system. The experiment parameters also demonstrate that the haptic device satisfies the design requirements of the asymmetric teleoperation robots system and the industry standards.","output":"Robust Control of a New Asymmetric Teleoperation Robot Based on a State Observer."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the MICCAI 2020 AutoImplant Challenge1.

Evaluation of public involvement has typically focused on the process and experiences for participants. Less is known about outcomes for health services. The aim of this systematic review was to a) identify and synthesise what is known about health service outcomes of public involvement and b) document how outcomes were evaluated. METHODS Searches were undertaken in MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and CINAHL for studies that reported health service outcomes from public involvement in health service design. The review was limited to high-income countries and studies in English. Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and critical appraisal guidelines for assessing the quality and impact of user involvement in health research. Content analysis was used to determine the outcomes of public involvement in health service design and how outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 93 articles were included. The majority were published in the last 5 years, were qualitative, and were located in the United Kingdom. A range of health service outcomes (discrete products, improvements to health services and system/policy level changes) were reported at various levels (service level, across services, and across organisations). However, evaluations of outcomes were reported in less than half of studies. In studies where outcomes were evaluated, a range of methods were used; most frequent were mixed methods. The quality of study design and reporting was inconsistent. CONCLUSION When reporting public involvement in health service design authors outline a range of outcomes for health services, but it is challenging to determine the extent of outcomes due to inadequate descriptions of study design and poor reporting. There is an urgent need for evaluations, including longitudinal study designs and cost-benefit analyses, to fully understand outcomes from public involvement in health service design.","output":"Evaluating health service outcomes of public involvement in health service design in high-income countries: a systematic review."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Airline workers have been suffering risks of job instability and virus infection since the outbreak of COVID-19.

Drawing on structural power theory, our article examines President Nixons historic attacks on the Bretton Woods international monetary regime to help illuminate President Trumps attacks on the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In both cases regime destruction was driven to a large extent by a desire to contain rivals: Europe for Nixon, China for Trump. Drawing on original archival material, our case study analysis shows that while the United States possessed sufficient negative structural power to derail Bretton Woods, it lacked sufficient positive structural power to create the new monetary structure Nixon wanted. Trump faces a similar dilemma: he can block the WTO regime, but cannot necessarily replace it with one to the United States liking. China is too powerful and possesses too much structural power of its own to give up its WTO privileges without a fight.

The mean knowledge score of participants was 5.51  1.55 (78.7% correct rate), and participants who received influenza vaccination in the past year scored the highest (6.06  1.30, p< .001). Nearly half of the participants (49.63%) agreed the threat to the functioning of society by influenza was far less than the COVID-19. 73.04% of the participants knew influenza vaccination was the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, while 54.18% did not know the vaccination location. The proportion of participants who were willing to get vaccinated would increase from 62.53% to 85.82% if clinicians recommended the vaccination. For influenza-like illness, merely 36.11% of participants would seek medical care from the hospital, and 60.53% agreed or showed a neutral attitude toward antibiotic use for influenza treatment.

While the risk factors of COVID-19 are still under investigation, environmental factors, such as urban air pollution, may play an important role in increasing population susceptibility to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional nationwide study using zero-inflated negative binomial models to estimate the association between long-term (2010-2016) county-level exposures to NO2, PM2.5 and O3 and county-level COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality rates in the US. We used both single and multipollutant models and controlled for spatial trends and a comprehensive set of potential confounders, including state-level test positive rate, county-level healthcare capacity, phase-of-epidemic, population mobility, population density, sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity, behavioral risk factors, and meteorology. Results 3,659,828 COVID-19 cases and 138,552 deaths were reported in 3,076 US counties from January 22, 2020 to July 17, 2020, with an overall observed case-fatality rate of 3.8%. County-level average NO2 concentrations were positively associated with both COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate in single-, bi-, and tri-pollutant models. When adjusted for co-pollutants, per inter-quartile range (IQR) increase in NO2 (4.6 ppb), COVID-19 case-fatality rate and mortality rate were associated with an increase of 11.3% (95% CI 4.9% to 18.2%) and 16.2% (95% CI 8.7% to 24.0%), respectively. We did not observe significant associations between COVID-19 case-fatality rate and long-term exposure to PM2.5 or O3, although per IQR increase in PM2.5 (2.6 ug/m3) was marginally associated with 14.9% (95% CI: 0.0% to 31.9%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate when adjusted for co-pollutants. Discussion Long-term exposure to NO2, which largely arises from urban combustion sources such as traffic, may enhance susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes, independent of long-term PM2.5 and O3 exposure. The results support targeted public health actions to protect residents from COVID-19 in heavily polluted regions with historically high NO2 levels. Continuation of current efforts to lower traffic emissions and ambient air pollution may be an important component of reducing population-level risk of COVID-19 case-fatality and mortality.","output":"Urban Air Pollution May Enhance COVID-19 Case-Fatality and Mortality Rates in the United States"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Involvement in research plays an integral role in the delivery of high-quality patient care, benefitting doctors, patients and employers.

Since both Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and COVID-19 case definitions overlap, we re-investigated the ILI cases using PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 739 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from November 2019 to March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 37 samples (5%) collected mostly during February 2020. It was followed by confirmation of evolutionary and spatial relationships using next generation sequencing (NGS). We observed that the overall incidence of ILI cases during 2019-2020 influenza season was considerably higher than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2, which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory patients. Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than previously thought. Evolutionary and spatial analyses revealed clustering in the GH clade, characterized by three amino acid substitutions in spike gene (D614G), RdRp (P323L) and NS3 (Q57H). P323L causes conformational change near nsp8 binding site that might affect virus replication and transcription. In conclusion, assessment of the community transmission among patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost importance to guide policy makers to optimize public health interventions.

This encourages a double analysis of this issue: the need to capture the deluge of false information as opposed to the real one and the study of users patterns to interact with that infodemic. As a response to this, our work combines the use of artificial intelligence and journalism through fact-checked false claims to provide an indepth study of the number of retweets, likes, replies, quotes and repeated texts in posts stating or contradicting misinformation in Twitter. The large sample of tweets was collected and automatically analysed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, not to give all the attention only to the posts with a big impact but to all the messages contributing to the expansion of false information or its rejection regardless of their virality.

Visual assessment conducted in 2015 and 2016 recorded the prevalence and severity of lesions. Opportunistic sampling for disease testing was conducted on a subset of 39 sun bears, with histopathological examination of lip and tongue biopsies and PCR testing of oral swabs and tissue biopsies collected during health examinations. Lip lesions were similarly prevalent in 2015 (66.0%) and 2016 (68.3%). Degradation of lip lesion severity was seen between 2015 and 2016, and the odds of having lip lesions, having more severe lip lesions, and having lip lesion degradation over time, all increased with age. Cheilitis was found in all lip lesion biopsies, with histological confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma in 64.5% of cases. Single biopsies frequently showed progression from dysplasia to neoplasia. Eighteen of 31 sun bears (58.1%) had at least one sample positive for Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1. The virus was detected in sun bears with and without lip lesions, however due to case selection being strongly biased towards those showing lip lesions it was not possible to test for association between Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 and lip squamous cell carcinoma. Given gammaherpesviruses can play a role in cancer development under certain conditions in other species, we believe further investigation into Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 as one of a number of possible co-factors in the progression of lip lesions to squamous cell carcinoma is warranted. This study highlights the progressively neoplastic nature of this lip lesion syndrome in sun bears which has consequences for captive and re-release management.

The latter is based on the principle that the reconstructed ultrasound image shows optimal quality if the velocity model is correct. The autofocus approach is applied to a composite image of the interface between cortical bone and marrow. It is obtained by incoherent summation of 4 types of images exploiting 4 different ray paths in the cortical bone layer, 3 of them involving mode-converted shear waves. If the parameters of the model are correct, spatial co-localization of the interface appears in the four images. As a result, intensity and sharpness in the composite image are maximal. The five parameters of the model of transverse isotropy are successfully estimated in a tube made of a bone-mimicking material. The estimates are in good agreement with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. The tube thickness is recovered with an error smaller than 0.3%.In vivoresults at the forearm of a volunteer are promising, four parameters could be estimated and are in good agreement withex vivoresonant ultrasound spectroscopy measurements. Moreover X-ray peripheral computed tomography corroborates the thickness of the cortical bone layer in the ultrasound image. Weak-anisotropy and exact transverse isotropy models provide very close measurements of the thickness of the tube and the radius bone. Thus, we recommend using the model of weak transverse isotropy for real-time anatomical imaging because more computationally efficient. For material characterization however, the model of exact transverse isotropy is preferred because the elastic anisotropy of cortical bone is moderate, rather than weak.","output":"Measuring anisotropy of elastic wave velocity with ultrasound imaging and an autofocus method - application to cortical bone."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"(1) Background: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the associations between physical activity (PA), sunshine duration (SD) and the occurrence of osteoporosis according to lifestyle status. (2) Methods: Data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) collected from 2009 to 2015 were used. Osteoporosis (n = 19,351) and control (n = 38,702) participants were matched in a 1:2 ratio according to age, sex, income, and region of residence. PA was classified as moderate- to high-intensity PA (MHPA) or low-intensity PA (LPA) based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). SD was classified as short (&#8804;6 h) or long (>6 h). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of MHPA and long SD for the occurrence of osteoporosis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to SD (or PA), obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. (3) The adjusted OR of MHPA for osteoporosis was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87-0.94). The results were consistent in the age/sex, SD, obesity, smoking, and alcohol consumption subgroups, but not the <60-year-old male and underweight subgroups. The adjusted OR of long SD for osteoporosis was 0.96 (95% CI = 0.93-1.00). The findings were consistent in the <60-year-old female, obese, nonsmoker, and <1 time a week alcohol consumption subgroups. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that both higher intensity of PA and long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis. Specifically, PA could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in individuals with most characteristics except male sex or underweight. Long SD could decrease the risk of osteoporosis in young females, obese individuals, nonsmokers, and individuals with lower alcohol consumption.","output":"Associations between Physical Activity, Sunshine Duration and Osteoporosis According to Obesity and Other Lifestyle Factors: A Nested Case-Control Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The enormous impact of covid-19 pandemic on everyday life, global economy and healthcare has stimulated the fast-tracked development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines Development is directed also towards promising innovative although not yet established platforms, such as vector vaccines and DNA and RNA-based vaccines The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is projected to cost about 2 billion USD and take 12 to 18 months 115 vaccines are currently being developed, of which 73 are in the preclinical phase and 10 in the first or second stage of a clinical trials Only the results of the third stage of trials, which will include thousands of volunteers and their long-term monitoring, will give an answer as to whether the vaccine achieves the desired protection against the pathogen On the way to the ultimate goal of a safe, effective and accessible vaccine, significant barriers to cost-effective production will still need to be overcome, especially for new platforms for which production infrastructure does not yet exist","output":"Sars-COV-2 vaccine pipeline"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Shift workers are at an increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. Eating and sleeping out of synchronisation with endogenous circadian rhythms causes weight gain, hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance. Interventions that promote weight loss and reduce the metabolic consequences of eating at night are needed for night shift workers. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of three weight loss strategies on weight loss and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in night shift workers. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A multisite 18-month, three-arm randomised controlled trial comparing three weight loss strategies; continuous energy restriction; and two intermittent fasting strategies whereby participants will fast for 2 days per week (5:2); either during the day (5:2D) or during the night shift (5:2N). Participants will be randomised to a weight loss strategy for 24 weeks (weight loss phase) and followed up 12 months later (maintenance phase). The primary outcomes are weight loss and a change in HOMA-IR. Secondary outcomes include changes in glucose, insulin, blood lipids, body composition, waist circumference, physical activity and quality of life. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 24 weeks (primary endpoint) and 18 months (12-month follow-up). The intervention will be delivered by research dietitians via a combination of face-to-face and telehealth consultations. Mixed-effect models will be used to identify changes in dependent outcomes (weight and HOMA-IR) with predictor variables of outcomes of group, time and groupCtime interaction, following an intention-to-treat approach.

Canine distemper virus (CDV) belongs to the genus Morbillivirus. Its L protein functions as an RdRp during viral replication. In this study, a recombinant enhanced green fluorescence protein-tagged CDV (rCDV-eGFP) was rescued from its cDNA clone, followed by viral identification and characterization at passage-7 (P7). This recombinant was independently subjected to extra 40 serial passages (P8 to 47) in ribavirin- and non-treated cells. Two viral progenies, undergoing passages in ribavirin- and non-treated VDS cells, were named rCDV-eGFP-R and -N, respectively. Both progenies were simultaneously subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) at P47 for comparing their quasispecies diversities with each other. The rCDV-eGFP-R and -N showed 62 and 23 single-nucleotide mutations (SNMs) in individual antigenomes, respectively, suggesting that the ribavirin conferred a mutagenic effect on the rCDV-eGFP-R. The spectrum of 62 SNMs contained 26 missense and 36 silent mutations, and that of 23 SNMs was composed of 17 missense and 6 silent mutations. Neither the rCDV-eGFP-R nor -N exhibited nonsense mutation in individual antigenomes. We speculate that the rCDV-eGFP-R may contain at least one P47 sub-progeny characterized by high-fidelity replication in cells. If such a sub-progeny can be purified from the mutant swarm, its L protein would elucidate a molecular mechanism of CDV high-fidelity replication.","output":"Rescuing eGFP-Tagged Canine Distemper Virus for 40 Serial Passages Separately in Ribavirin- and Non-Treated Cells: Comparative Analysis of Viral Mutation Profiles"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a high-risk specialty involving airway and aerosol-generating procedures, which is potentially of more risk in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) We aimed to identify the impact of COVID-19 on the disease pattern of OMFS inpatients and surgeries under general anesthesia in a comparative study Materials and Methods: We reviewed the admission and operating theater records of OMFS patients from Jan 1 to Aug 31 in 2020 and 2019 The total number of cases, presenting disease patterns, and proportion of essential and non-essential medical services were compared between 2020 and 2019","output":"The Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on the Disease Pattern of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Inpatients: A Comparative Study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The emergence of COVID-19 resulted in postponement of nonemergent surgical procedures for cardiac patients in London. mHealth represented a potentially viable mechanism for highlighting deteriorating patients on the lengthened cardiac surgical waiting lists. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the deployment of a digital health solution to support continuous triaging of patients on a cardiac surgical waiting list. METHOD: An NHS trust utilized an app-based mHealth solution (Huma Therapeutics) to help gather vital information on patients awaiting cardiac surgery (valvular and coronary surgery). Patients at a tertiary cardiac center on a waiting list for elective surgery were given the option to be monitored remotely via a mobile app until their date of surgery. Patients were asked to enter their symptoms once a week. The clinical team monitored this information remotely, prompting intervention for those patients who needed it. RESULTS: Five hundred and twenty-five patients were on boarded onto the app. Of the 525 patients using the solution, 51 (9.71%) were identified as at risk of deteriorating based on data captured via the remote patient monitoring platform and subsequently escalated to their respective consultant. 81.7% of patients input at least one symptom after they were on boarded on the platform.

This virus is spreading worldwide, and to date, the number of new infections and their variants is still increasing in many countries. Early detection of this virus is critical to identify whether the patient is infected with COVID-19 or not. So far, RT-PCR is known as the most common method for COVID-19 detection. But compared with lung CT scan, lung CT scan has higher sensitivity, and it is easy to use in COVID-19 infection screening. One of the many steps that are needed in COVID-19 screening is the lung segmentation process. Many segmentation models have been developed by many researchers.

Based on the experiments, we can conclude that Unet++ performs better than other models. It might be because U-Net++ has a robust network architecture, and it is initially designed for medical image segmentation.

Indeed, schools play a key role in suicide prevention, including participating in risk assessments with students expressing suicidal ideation. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools now need to offer mental health services, including suicide risk assessment, via eHealth platforms. Post pandemic, the use of eHealth risk assessments will support more accessible services for youth living in rural and remote areas. However, as the remote environment is a new context for many schools, guidance is needed on best practices for eHealth suicide risk assessment among youth. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a rapid, systematic scoping review to explore promising practices for conducting school-based suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth (ie, information technologies that allow for remote communication). METHODS: This review included peer-reviewed articles and gray literature published in English between 2000 and 2020. Although we did not find studies that specifically explored promising practices for school-based suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth platforms, we found 12 peer-reviewed articles and 23 gray literature documents that contained relevant information addressing our broader study purpose; thus, these 35 sources were included in this review. RESULTS: We identified five key recommendation themes for school-based suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth platforms in the 12 peer-reviewed studies. These included accessibility, consent procedures, session logistics, safety planning, and internet privacy. Specific recommendation themes from the 23 gray literature documents substantially overlapped with and enhanced three of the themes identified in the peer-reviewed literatureconsent procedures, session logistics, and safety planning. In addition, based on findings from the gray literature, we expanded the accessibility theme to a broader theme termed youth engagement, which included information on accessibility and building rapport, establishing a therapeutic space, and helping youth prepare for remote sessions. Finally, a new theme was identified in the gray literature findings, specifically concerning school mental health professional boundaries. A second key difference between the gray and peer-reviewed literature was the formers focus on issues of equity and access and how technology can reinforce existing inequalities. CONCLUSIONS: For school mental health providers in need of guidance, we believe that these six recommendation themes (ie, youth engagement, school mental health professional boundaries, consent procedures, session logistics, safety planning, and internet privacy) represent the most promising directions for school-based suicide risk assessment among youth using eHealth tools. However, suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth platforms in school settings represents a critical research gap.

However, its successful application to medical images is severely handicapped with the limited amount of annotated training data. Transfer learning is commonly adopted for the medical imaging tasks. However, a large covariant shift between the source domain of natural images and target domain of medical images results in poor transfer learning. Moreover, scarcity of annotated data for the medical imaging tasks causes further problems for effective transfer learning. To address these problems, we develop an augmented ensemble transfer learning technique that leads to significant performance gain over the conventional transfer learning. Our technique uses an ensemble of deep learning models, where the architecture of each network is modified with extra layers to account for dimensionality change between the images of source and target data domains. Moreover, the model is hierarchically tuned to the target domain with augmented training data. Along with the network ensemble, we also utilize an ensemble of dictionaries that are based on features extracted from the augmented models. The dictionary ensemble provides an additional performance boost to our method. We first establish the effectiveness of our technique with the challenging ChestXray-14 radiography data set. Our experimental results show more than 50% reduction in the error rate with our method as compared to the baseline transfer learning technique.

Aims The present article presents a case study of the association between URTIs and academic performance and reports the use of such information as an extenuating circumstance for poor performance. Methods The paper describes the poor performance of a primary school student taking the 11+ examination, which determines the choice of the future secondary school. Evidence suggested that it was plausible that the student was incubating an URTI at the time of the examination. Other possible infections, such as COVID, were ruled out. An appeal was made based on the possible association between incubating an URTI and unusually poor examination performance. Results The appeal was supported by the adjudicating committee and the student was allowed a place in the preferred secondary school.

METHODS: Systematic review. We contacted all included studies corresponding authors requesting further details. RESULTS: We included 18 studies from a diverse setting with substantial methodological variation (this field lacks standardized methodology). At initial testing, prevalence of asymptomatic cases was 12.5-100%.

Nursing/care home facilities reported high rates of presymptomatic: 50-100% (n=3 studies). Fourteen studies were classified as high risk of, and four studies as at moderate risk of symptom ascertainment bias. High risk studies may be less likely to distinguish between presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases.

We aim to outline the establishment of a specialised health quarantine accommodation service in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and describe the first month of COVID-19 screening. METHODS: The SHA was established with a comprehensive governance structure, remote clinical management through Royal Prince Alfred Virtual Hospital (rpavirtual) and site management with health care workers, NSW Police and accommodation staff. RESULTS: From 29 March to 29 April 2020, 373 returning travellers were admitted to the SHA from Sydney Airport. 88 (26.1%) of those swabbed were positive for SARS-CoV 2.

Seven people required admission to hospital for ongoing clinical care. CONCLUSION: The Public Health response to COVID-19 in Australia included early and increased case detection through testing, tracing of contacts of confirmed cases, social distancing and prohibition of gatherings.

The immune response of pregnant women to SARS-CoV-2 and the interplay of how the maternal immune response affects neonatal passive immunity have not been systematically studied. Objectives We characterized the serologic response in pregnant women and studied how this serologic response correlates with maternal clinical presentation and with the rate and level of passive immunity from mothers to neonates. Study Design Between March 22-May 31, 2020, women giving birth who tested positive for semi-quantitative IgM or IgG detection in a New York City Hospital were included in the study. Retrospective chart review of the cases that met inclusion criteria was conducted for presence of COVID19 symptoms and use of oxygen support. Serology levels between the symptomatic and asymptomatic patients were compared with Welchs two sample t-test. Further chart review of the same patient cohort was conducted in order to identify dates of self-reported onset of COVID-19 symptoms, and the timing of the peak of IgM and IgG antibody levels after symptoms onset were visualized using local polynomial regression smoothing (LOESS) on log2-scaled serological values. To study the neonatal serology response, cord blood samples of neonates born to a subset of all serology positive pregnant women were tested for serology. Maternal antibody levels of serology-positive vs. serology-negative neonates were compared with the Welchs two sample t-test. The relationship between quantitative maternal and quantitative neonatal serologic data was studied using Pearson correlation and linear regression. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted using maternal symptoms, maternal serology levels, and maternal use of oxygen support to determine predictors of neonatal IgG levels. Results Eighty-eight serology positive pregnant women were included in this study. Antibody levels are higher in symptomatic pregnant women compared to asymptomatic pregnant women. Serology studies in 34 women with symptom onset data reveal that maternal IgM and IgG levels peak around 15 and 30 days post COVID-19 symptoms onset, respectively. Furthermore, studies of fifty neonates born to a subset of serology positive women show that passive immunity in the form of IgG is conferred upon 78% of all neonates. Presence of passive immunity is dependent on maternal antibody levels, and levels of neonatal IgG correlate with maternal IgG levels. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support were predictive of neonatal IgG levels. Conclusions We demonstrate that maternal serologies correlate with symptomatic maternal infection, and higher levels of maternal antibodies are associated with passive immunity. Maternal IgG levels and maternal use of oxygen support, a marker of disease severity, predict neonatal IgG levels. These data will further guide the screening for this unique linked population of mothers and their babies, and can aid in developing maternal vaccination strategies.","output":"SARS-CoV-2 serology levels in pregnant women and their neonates."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Various neurological complications have been reported in association with COVID-19. We report our experience of COVID-19 with stroke at a single center over a period of eight months spanning 1 March to 31 October 2020. METHODS We recruited all patients admitted to Internal Medicine with an acute stroke, who also tested positive for COVID-19 on RTPCR. We included all stroke cases in our analysis for prediction of in-hospital mortality, and separately analyzed arterial infarcts for vascular territory of ischemic strokes. RESULTS There were 62 stroke cases among 3923 COVID-19 admissions (incidence 1.6%). Data was available for 58 patients {mean age 52.6 years; age range 17-91; F/M=20/38; 24% (14/58) aged 40; 51% (30/58) hypertensive; 36% (21/58) diabetic; 41% (24/58) with O2 saturation <95% at admission; 32/58 (55.17 %) in-hospital mortality}. Among 58 strokes, there were 44 arterial infarcts, seven bleeds, three arterial infarcts with associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, two combined infarct and bleed, and two of indeterminate type. Among the total 49 infarcts, Carotid territory was the commonest affected (36/49; 73.5%), followed by vertebrobasilar (7/49; 14.3%) and both (6/49; 12.2%). Concordant arterial block was seen in 61% (19 of 31 infarcts with angiography done). 'Early stroke' (within 48 hours of respiratory symptoms) was seen in 82.7% (48/58) patients. Patients with poor saturation at admission were older (58 vs 49 years) and had more comorbidities and higher mortality (79% vs 38%). Mortality was similar in young strokes and older patients, although the latter required more intense respiratory support. Logistic regression analysis showed that low Glasgow coma score (GCS) and requirement for increasing intensity of respiratory support predicted in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS We had a 1.6% incidence of COVID-19 related stroke of which the majority were carotid territory infarcts.

To identify the structure of remote homologs, the structure-sequence alignment has to consider not only sequence similarity, but also spatially conserved conformations caused by residue interactions and, consequently, is computationally intractable. It is difficult to cope with the inefficiency without compromising alignment accuracy, especially for structure search in genomes or large databases. This paper introduces a novel method and a parameterized algorithm for structure-sequence alignment. Both the structure and the sequence are represented as graphs, where, in general, the graph for a biopolymer structure has a naturally small tree width. The algorithm constructs an optimal alignment by finding in the sequence graph the maximum valued subgraph isomorphic to the structure graph. It has the computational time complexity O[k(t)N(2)] for the structure of N residues and its tree decomposition of width t. Parameter k, small in nature, is determined by a statistical cutoff for the correspondence between the structure and the sequence.

With this study we aimed to establish asthma patients' general satisfaction with the quality of health care provided by virtual visits (phone or video calls). Materials and methods. A questionnaire (9 questions) was published on the Facebook page of the Portuguese Association of Asthmatics. It was available online for general self-reported asthmatic patients to answer for one month, starting on 11st May 2020. The survey only allowed one answer per registered user. Results. Fifty-five responses were obtained. Patients were satisfied with communication with providers (greater than 88%); nevertheless, one-half evaluated the virtual visit as inferior when compared to in-person visits. About one third attributed a classification of 6 or less (0-10 scale, 0 being the worst and 10 the best consultation possible), but still most of the patients would either recommend it or use this kind of medical visits in the future, even outside the actual pandemic context. Patients also referred some important limitations, as lack of physical examination and the fact that the medical visit was more impersonal. Only 27% had technical issues accessing virtual visits. Positive aspects were also named, such as virtual visits being practical and avoiding the need to move to the hospital. Discussion and conclusions. Our survey revealed that small changes could further increase patients' satisfaction, adherence, and confidence in telemedicine.

We aimed to explore the risk factors of 14-day and 28-day mortality and develop a model for predicting 14-day and 28-day survival probability among adult hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study, we examined 828 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan Union Hospital and Central Hospital of Wuhan between January 12 and February 9, 2020. Among the 828 patients, 516 and 186 consecutive patients admitted in Wuhan Union Hospital were enrolled in the training cohort and the validation cohort, respectively. A total of 126 patients hospitalized in Central Hospital of Wuhan were enrolled in a second external validation cohort. Demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory measures; treatment; proximate causes of death; and 14-day and 28-day mortality are described. Patients' data were collected by reviewing the medical records, and their 14-day and 28-day outcomes were followed up. RESULTS: Of the 828 patients, 146 deaths were recorded until May 18, 2020. In the training set, multivariate Cox regression indicated that older age, lactate dehydrogenase level over 360 U/L, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio higher than 8.0, and direct bilirubin higher than 5.0 mol/L were independent predictors of 28-day mortality. Nomogram scoring systems for predicting the 14-day and 28-day survival probability of patients with COVID-19 were developed and exhibited strong discrimination and calibration power in the two external validation cohorts (C-index, 0.878 and 0.839). CONCLUSION: Older age, high lactate dehydrogenase level, evaluated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and high direct bilirubin level were independent predictors of 28-day mortality in adult hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19.

These infections occur mainly in the first month after transplantation and are hospital-acquired. Nosocomial infections cause significant morbidity and are the most common cause of mortality in this early period of transplantation. These infections are caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms, mainly Gram-negative enterobacteria, non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, and staphylococci. The patients at risk of developing nosocomial bacterial infections are those previously colonized with MDR bacteria while on the transplant waiting list. Intravascular catheters, the urinary tract, the lungs, and surgical wounds are the most frequent sources of infection. Preventive measures are the same as those applied in non-immunocompromised, hospitalized patients except in patients at high risk for developing fungal infection. These patients need antifungal therapy during their hospitalization, and for preventing some bacterial infections in the early transplant period, patients need vaccinations on the waiting list according to the current recommendations. Although morbidity and mortality related to infectious diseases have decreased during the last few years in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, they are still one of the most important complications in this population. Furthermore, as occurs in the general population, the incidence of nosocomial infections has increased during the different phases of transplantation. It is difficult to establish general preventive measures in these patients, as there are many risk factors conditioning these infections. Firstly, they undergo multiple antibiotic treatments and interventions; secondly, there is a wide variability in the degree of neutropenia and immunosuppression among patients, and finally they combine hospital and home stay during the transplant process.

The dominant route of cell entry of the coronavirus is via phagocytosis, with ensconcement in endosomes thereafter proceeding via the endosomal pathway, involving transfer from early (EEs) to late endosomes (LEs) and ultimately into lysosomes via endolysosomal fusion. EE to LE transportation is a rate-limiting step for coronaviruses. Hence inhibition or dysregulation of endosomal trafficking could potentially inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Furthermore, the acidic luminal pH of the endolysosomal system is critical for the activity of numerous pH-sensitive hydrolytic enzymes. Golgi sub-compartments and Golgi-derived secretory vesicles also depend on being mildly acidic for optimal function and structure. Activation of endosomal toll-like receptors by viral RNA can upregulate inflammatory mediators and contribute to a systemic inflammatory cytokine storm, associated with a worsened clinical outcome in COVID-19. Such endosomal toll-like receptors could be inhibited by the use of pharmacological agents which increase endosomal pH, thereby reducing the activity of acid-dependent endosomal proteases required for their activity and/or assembly, leading to suppression of antigen-presenting cell activity, decreased autoantibody secretion, decreased nuclear factor-kappa B activity and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine production. It is also noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 inhibits autophagy, predisposing infected cells to apoptosis. It is therefore also suggested that further pharmacological inhibition of autophagy might encourage the apoptotic clearance of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells.","output":"Can endolysosomal deacidification and inhibition of autophagy prevent severe COVID-19?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments around the world to impose strict hygiene and national lockdown measures, which in turn has changed the dietary and lifestyle habits of the worlds population.

This review article describes the SARS CoV-2 genome, hot spot mutations, variants, and then focuses on the Delta variant, finishing up with an update on the Omicron variant. The genome encompasses 11 open reading frames, one of which encodes the spike or S protein that has been the target for vaccines and some of the drugs because of its role in attachment to the human host cell, as well as antibodies. Mutations in the S protein that are common among several of the variants include D614G that increases transmissibility and viral load and is often associated with P323L on the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. N501Y is a mutation in the receptor binding domain of the S protein that increases binding to the ACE-2 receptor on the human host cells by 10 fold. The discussed variants carry combinations of these and other mutations and are classified by the World Health Organization as variants of concern, variants of interest, and variants under monitoring. All variants are characterized by increased transmissibility (relative to the original SARS CoV-2), which is the reason for their ability to establish themselves. Several but not all variants are more resistant to antiviral drugs and less susceptible to antibodies/vaccines. The Delta variant that dominated the world until November 2021 causes an increased risk for hospitalization and death, but is still very susceptible to the current vaccines.

Understanding what proportion of these patients require testing and who can be safely screened in community-based models of care is critical for workforce and infrastructure planning across the healthcare system, as well as public messaging campaigns. METHODS: In this cross-sectional survey, we screened patients presenting to a COVID-19 screening clinic in a tertiary ED. We assessed the proportion of patients who met testing criteria; self-reported symptom severity; reasons why they came to the ED for screening and views on community-based care. RESULTS: We include findings from 1846 patients. Most patients (55.3%) did not meet contemporaneous criteria for testing and most (57.6%) had mild or no (13.4%) symptoms. The main reason for coming to the ED was being referred by a telephone health service (31.3%) and 136 (7.4%) said they tried to contact their general practitioner but could not get an appointment. Only 47 (2.6%) said they thought the disease was too specialised for their general practitioner to manage.

Here, we review the theoretical basis for estimation of vaccine direct effects under traditional case-control and test-negative design frameworks, addressing specific natural history parameters of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 relevant to these designs. Bias may be introduced by misclassification of cases and controls, particularly when clinical case criteria include common, nonspecific indicators of COVID-19. When using diagnostic assays with high analytical sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection, individuals testing positive may be counted as cases even if their symptoms are due to other causes. The traditional case-control design may be particularly prone to confounding due to associations of vaccination with healthcare-seeking behavior or risk of infection. The test-negative design reduces but may not eliminate this confounding, for instance, if individuals who receive vaccination seek care or testing for less-severe illness. These circumstances indicate the two study designs cannot be applied naively to datasets gathered through public health surveillance or administrative sources.

The use of mobile phones today is indispensable even in the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic. People are not aware of the dangers of using cell phones (HP) in a pandemic situation such as using cellphones on public transportation (buses trains etc.) hospitals etc. HP users when on public transport often operate their cellphones while they may forget that they have previously held iron bars or bus doors so that their cellphones become contaminated with the COVID-19 virus Seeing this phenomenon the community service team (PKM) was moved to socialize the use of waterproof cell phone protectors and how to clean cell phones (HP) after being used on a trip or outside the home. Community service activities were carried out when the lockdown was implemented in Jakarta therefore the team carried out socialization by using brochures and distributing aid to health workers. Community service in addition to providing socialization on virus prevention through mobile devices the PKM team also explained the need to maintain health protocols by wearing masks and washing hands using a hand sanitizer. The PKM team was also moved to provide assistance to underprivileged communities who live on the streets of the Cibubur area and its surroundings. The results before the socialization through a field survey showed that 35% of patients and 30% of nurses stated that they had known beforehand that the use of a mobile phone (HP) protector was needed to prevent COVID-19. The results after socialization through brochures that the ways to protect HP devices for the prevention of COVID-19 are very easy to understand the results are 93.33% patients and 95% nurses. 97.5% of nurses and 96.67% of patients hope that this explanation of HP Protection needs to be disseminated more widely.

Workers supply labor to entrepreneurs who borrow to purchase factors of production. Borrowing capacity is restricted by the value of capital, generating a pecuniary externality when financing constraints bind. Additionally, there is a distributive externality operating through wages. The planner's allocation can be decentralized with two instruments: a credit tax/subsidy and a labor tax/subsidy. Labor shocks, such as the COVID-19 shock, amplify the policy responses, which critically depend on whether financing constraints bind or not.","output":"Financial Amplification of Labor Supply Shocks"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Trichinella spiralis is a major foodborne parasite and has a serious threat to meat safety. Development of anti-Trichinella vaccines is prospective to eliminate Trichinella infection in food animal. The aim of this study was to assess the biological properties of a novel T. spiralis trypsin (TsT) and its elicited immune protection against larval challenge. The cDNA sequence of TsT gene was cloned and expressed. Western blotting showed rTsT was identified by infection serum and anti-TsT serum. RT-PCR results revealed that TsT gene was transcribed at diverse T. spiralis lifecycle stages. The IIFT results showed that natural TsT was principally expressed at epicuticle of 5-6 day adult worms, indicating that TsT is a worm somatic antigen and adult-stage specific surface antigen. Vaccination of mice with rTsT triggered an evident humoral immune response (high levels of serum IgG, IgG1/IgG2a, and enteral sIgA), and it also induced the systemic and enteral local cellular immune response, demonstrated by an significantly elevation of cytokines IFN- and IL-4. The mice vaccinated with rTsT exhibited a 33.17% reduction of enteral adult worms and a 37.80% reduction of muscle larvae after larval challenge.

Our aim is to assess the combined impact of mobility restriction, testing, and vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic in India. Methods: We conducted a multiple regression analysis to assess the impact of mobility, testing, and vaccination on COVID-19 incidence between April 28, 2021 to November 24, 2021 using data from Our World in Data and Google Mobility Report. The 7-day moving average was applied to offset the daily fluctuations in the mobility and testing. Each independent variable was lagged to construct a temporal relationship, and waning vaccination efficacy was taken into consideration. We performed additional analysis for three time periods between March 28, 2020 to November 24, 2021 (1st: March 28, 2020 ~ October 7, 2020, 2nd: October 8, 2020 ~ April 27, 2021, 3rd: April 28, 2021 ~ November 24, 2021) to examine potential heterogeneity over time. Results: Mobility (0.041, 95% CI: 0.033 to 0.048), testing (-0.008, 95% CI: -0.015 to -0.001), and vaccination (quadratic term: 0.004, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.005, linear term: -0.130, 95% CI: -0.161 to -0.099) were all associated with COVID-19 incidence. For vaccination rate, the decrease of number of cases demonstrated a U-shaped curve, while mobility showed a positive association and testing showed an inverse association with COVID-19 incidence. Mobility restriction was effective during all three periods - March 28, 2020 to November 24, 2021 (0.009, 0.048, and 0.026 respectively). Testing was effective during the second and third period - October 8, 2020 to November 24, 2021 (-0.036, and -0.006 respectively). Conclusion: Mobility restriction and testing were effective even in the presence of vaccination. This shows the positive value of mobility restrictions, testing, and vaccination from the health system perspective on COVID-19 prevention and control, especially with continual emergence of variants in India and globally. At the same time, this health system gain must be balanced with the challenges in the delivery of non-COVID health services and broader socio-economic impact in deciding the prolonged continuance of mobility restriction.","output":"Impact assessment of mobility restriction, testing, and vaccination on the COVID-19 pandemic in India"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Recently, various countries from across the globe have been facing the second wave of COVID-19 infections. In order to understand the dynamics of the spread of the disease, much effort has been made in terms of mathematical modeling. In this scenario, compartmental models are widely used to simulate epidemics under various conditions. In general, there are uncertainties associated with the reported data, which must be considered when estimating the parameters of the model. In this work, we propose an effective methodology for estimating parameters of compartmental models in multiple wave scenarios by means of a dynamic data segmentation approach. This robust technique allows the description of the dynamics of the disease without arbitrary choices for the end of the first wave and the start of the second. Furthermore, we adopt a time-dependent function to describe the probability of transmission by contact for each wave. We also assess the uncertainties of the parameters and their influence on the simulations using a stochastic strategy. In order to obtain realistic results in terms of the basic reproduction number, a constraint is incorporated into the problem. We adopt data from Germany and Italy, two of the first countries to experience the second wave of infections. Using the proposed methodology, the end of the first wave (and also the start of the second wave) occurred on 166 and 187 days from the beginning of the epidemic, for Germany and Italy, respectively. The estimated effective reproduction number for the first wave is close to that obtained by other approaches, for both countries. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is able to find good estimates for all parameters. In relation to uncertainties, we show that slight variations in the design variables can give rise to significant changes in the value of the effective reproduction number. The results provide information on the characteristics of the epidemic for each country, as well as elements for decision-making in the economic and governmental spheres.","output":"Mathematical modelling of the second wave of COVID-19 infections using deterministic and stochastic SIDR models"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Natural gas stoves in >40 million U.S. residences release methane (CH4)a potent greenhouse gasthrough post-meter leaks and incomplete combustion. We quantified methane released in 53 homes during all phases of stove use: steady-state-off (appliance not in use), steady-state-on (during combustion), and transitory periods of ignition and extinguishment. We estimated that natural gas stoves emit 0.8-1.3% of the gas they use as unburned methane and that total U.S. stove emissions are 28.1 [95% confidence interval: 18.5, 41.2] Gg CH4 year-1. More than three-quarters of methane emissions we measured originated during steady-state-off. Using a 20-year timeframe for methane, annual methane emissions from all gas stoves in U.S. homes have a climate impact comparable to the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 500 000 cars. In addition to methane emissions, co-emitted health-damaging air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into home air and can trigger respiratory diseases. In 32 homes, we measured NOx (NO and NO2) emissions and found them to be linearly related to the amount of natural gas burned (r2 = 0.76; p ? 0.01).

One of the highest numbers of cases were recorded in the most polluted regions worldwide. The risk factors for severe COVID-19 include diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases. It has been known that the same disease might be worsened by chronic exposure to air pollution. The study aimed to determine whether long-term average exposure to air pollution is associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Poland. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and deaths for each voivodeship (the main administrative level of jurisdictions) in Poland were collected from March 4, 2020, to May 15, 2020. Based on the official data published by Chief Inspectorate of Environmental Protection voivodeship-level long-term exposure to main air pollution: PM(2.5), PM(10), NO(2), SO(2), O(3) (averaged from 2013 to 2018) was established. There were statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 cases (per 100,000 population) and annual average concentration of PM(2.5) (R(2) = 0.367, p = 0.016), PM(10) (R(2) = 0.415, p = 0.009), SO(2) (R(2) = 0.489, p = 0.003), and O(3) (R(2) = 0.537, p = 0.0018).

Objective. Using the method of digital epidemiology, we analyzed the dynamics of the frequency of a specific request for antibiotics in pharmacies and hospitals. We used open data from Yandex (Wordstat.Yandex) and Google (Google Trends) collected on weekly basis for the Russian Federation. Results. The World Health Organization reports a growing problem of antibiotic misuse by some individuals and healthcare institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive irrational use of antibiotics causes the development of antibiotic resistance by many microorganisms, including those circulating in hospitals (for example, ESKAPE group). Moreover, COVID-19 has led to an exponential increase in the use of biocides worldwide, potentially resulting in additional indirect pressure promoting the selection of antibiotic-resistant strains. The pandemic in Russia was marked by a significant increase in antibiotic sales in pharmacies (including systemic antibacterial agents) and purchases by healthcare institutions. Conclusion. Our findings demonstrate that the rapid spread of COVID-19 was associated with extensive consumption of antibiotics, which resulted in growing antibacterial resistance (number of circulating drug-resistant strains) and posed a threat to the national security. The COVID-19 necessitates the discovery of new effective treatments for this infection, as well as rational use of antimicrobial drugs. The implementation of surveillance of antibiotic consumption will help to identify changing trends in their use, combine efforts to solve problems related to antibiotics and drug resistance, and to ensure rational use of antimicrobials. ? 2021, Dynasty Publishing House.

The homotrimeric transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein of coronaviruses which facilitates virus entry into the host cells is covered with N-linked glycans having oligomannose and complex sugars. These glycans provide a unique opportunity for their targeting via carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) which have shown their antiviral potential against coronaviruses and enveloped viruses. However, CBA-ligand interaction is not fully explored in developing novel carbohydrate-binding-based antivirals due to associated unfavorable responses with CBAs. CBAs possess unique carbohydrate-binding specificity, therefore, CBAs like mannose-specific plant lectins/lectin-like mimic Pradimicin-A (PRM-A) can be used for targeting N-linked glycans of S glycoproteins.

In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of ten most commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, HSP90, HMBS, 18S rRNA, B2M, POLR2A, HPRT1, ACAC, YWHAZ) in fourteen different Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infected tissues of goats and sheep. RefFinder and RankAggreg software were used to deduce comprehensive ranking of reference genes. Our results suggested HMBS and B2M in goats and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep can be used as suitable endogenous controls in gene expression studies of PPRV infection irrespective of tissues and condition as a whole, thus eliminating the use of tissue specific/ condition specific endogenous controls. We report for the first time suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in PPRV infected tissues. The reference genes determined here can be useful for future studies on gene expression in sheep and goat infected with PPRV, thus saving extra efforts and time of repeating the reference gene determination and validation.","output":"Selection and validation of suitable reference genes for qPCR gene expression analysis in goats and sheep under Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), lineage IV infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Sport-related muscle injury classifications are based basically on imaging criteria such as ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without consensus because of a lack of clinical prognostics for return-to-play (RTP), which is conditioned upon the severity of the injury, and this in turn with the muscle gap (muscular fibers retraction). Recently, Futbol Club Barcelona's medical department proposed a new muscle injury classification in which muscle gap plays an important role, with the drawback that it is not always possible to identify by MRI. Localized bioimpedance measurement (L-BIA) has emerged as a non-invasive technique for supporting US and MRI to quantify the disrupted soft tissue structure in injured muscles. OBJECTIVE To correlate the severity of the injury according to the gap with the RTP, through the percent of change in resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and phase-angle (PA) by L-BIA measurements in 22 muscle injuries. MAIN RESULTS After grouping the data according to the muscle gap (by MRI exam), there were significant differences in R between grade 1 and grade 2f (myotendinous or myofascial muscle injury with feather-like appearance), as well as between grade 2f and grade 2g (myotendinous or myofascial muscle injury with feather and gap). The Xc and PA values decrease significantly between each grade (i.e. 1 versus 2f, 1 versus 2g and 2f versus 2g). In addition, the severity of the muscle gap adversely affected the RTP with significant differences observed between 1 and 2g as well as between 2f and 2g. SIGNIFICANCE These results show that L-BIA could aid MRI and US in identifying the severity of an injured muscle according to muscle gap and therefore to accurately predict the RTP.","output":"Detection of muscle gap by L-BIA in muscle injuries: clinical prognosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Technology has become a crucial service medium also for higher education institutions (HEIs).

Because anorectal manometry (ARM) testing for pelvic floor dysfunction is mostly limited to academic centers, clinicians frequently use rectosigmoid accumulation of markers as a surrogate for pelvic floor dysfunction. We sought to determine whether rectosigmoid localization of markers on a ROM study correlated with measures of pelvic floor dysfunction by ARM and balloon expulsion testing. METHODS We assembled a multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with chronic constipation who underwent both transit testing by ROM transit testing and ARM with balloon expulsion testing. We compared the proportion of patients with outlet obstruction by rectoanal pressure gradient or prolonged balloon expulsion stratified by marker location. RESULTS There were 610 patients with both ROM testing and ARM with balloon expulsion testing. The mean age was 44 years and 526 were women (86%). Eighty-one (13%) patients had markers confined to the rectosigmoid area alone and were compared with 529 patients with markers elsewhere (51%) or no retained markers (49%). Of those with markers confined to the rectosigmoid colon, 48 (59%) had a prolonged balloon expulsion compared with 276 (52%) who did not have rectosigmoid markers (P=0.28). The mean rectoanal gradient for patients with markers in the rectosigmoid colon was -2946 mm Hg compared with -3459 mm Hg for all others (P=0.59).

However, the molecules that govern myonuclear positioning remain elusive. Here, we report that skeletal muscle-specific CIP (sk-CIP) is a regulator of nuclear positioning. Genetic deletion of sk-CIP in mice results in misalignment of myonuclei along the myofibers and at specialized structures such as neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and myotendinous junctions (MTJs) in vivo, impairing myonuclear positioning after muscle regeneration, leading to severe muscle dystrophy in mdx mice, a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. sk-CIP is localized to the centrosome in myoblasts and relocates to the outer nuclear envelope in myotubes upon differentiation. Mechanistically, we found that sk-CIP interacts with the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex and the centriole Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC) proteins to coordinately modulate myonuclear positioning and alignment. These findings indicate that sk-CIP may function as a muscle-specific anchoring protein to regulate nuclear position in multinucleated muscle cells.","output":"Regulation of myonuclear positioning and muscle function by the skeletal muscle-specific CIP protein"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Remote in-home infant monitoring technologies hold great promise for increasing the scalability and safety of infant research (including in regard to the current Covid-19 pandemic), but remain rarely employed. These technologies hold a number of fundamental challenges and ethical concerns that need addressing to aid the success of this fast-growing field. In particular, the responsible development of such technologies requires caregiver input. We conducted a survey of the opinions of 410 caregivers on the viability, privacy and data access of remote in-home monitoring technologies and study designs. Infant-friendly wearable devices (such as sensing body suits) were viewed favourably. Caregivers were marginally more likely to accept video and audio recording in the home if data was anonymised (through automated processing) at point of collection, particularly when observations were lengthy. Caregivers were more open to international data sharing for anonymous data. Caregivers were interested in viewing all types of data, but were particularly keen to access video and audio recordings for censoring purposes (i.e., to delete data segments). Taken together, our results indicate generally positive attitudes to remote in-home monitoring technologies and studies for infant research but highlight specific considerations such as safety, privacy and family practicalities (e.g. multiple caregivers, visitors and varying schedules) that must be taken into account when developing future studies.","output":"A survey on the attitudes of parents with young children on in-home monitoring technologies and study designs for infant research"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To investigate the current state of medication adherence among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in China and analyze the influencing factors.

The General Information Questionnaire and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale were used as measurement instruments. The factors influencing the Morisky score were studied by multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The average Morisky score was 6.11  1.93. Univariate analysis showed that there were statistically significant differences in Morisky scores among patients with different ages, education levels, disease types, medication administration methods, medication frequencies, disease understanding and knowledge learning frequencies (P < 0.05). Multiple stepwise linear regression analyses showed that medication frequency, medication administration method and disease understanding were important factors influencing the Morisky score (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our data confirmed that the medication adherence of IBD patients was poor, especially among patients taking oral medication, those taking medications with a high frequency and those with a low understanding of the disease.

Recently, vaccines from various companies have been urgently approved to control SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infections. However, any specific antiviral drug has not been confirmed so far for regular treatment. An important target is the main protease (M(pro)), which plays a major role in replication of the virus. In this study, Gaussian and residue network models are employed to reveal two distinct potential allosteric sites on M(pro) that can be evaluated as drug targets besides the active site. Then, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\\\approved drugs are docked to three distinct sites with flexible docking using AutoDock Vina to identify potential drug candidates. Fourteen best molecule hits for the active site of M(pro) are determined. Six of these also exhibit high docking scores for the potential allosteric regions. Full\\\\atom molecular dynamics simulations with MM\\\\GBSA method indicate that compounds docked to active and potential allosteric sites form stable interactions with high binding free energy (?G (bind)) values. ?G (bind) values reach ?52.06 kcal/mol for the active site, ?51.08 kcal/mol for the potential allosteric site 1, and ? 42.93 kcal/mol for the potential allosteric site 2. Energy decomposition calculations per residue elucidate key binding residues stabilizing the ligands that can further serve to design pharmacophores.

METHODS: A retrospective and single-center study was performed in Wuhan, involving 83 severe or critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Laboratory parameters in ICU patients with laboratory-confirmed infection of SARS-CoV2 were collected. The association between parameters was assessed by Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: Patients median age was 66 years (IQR, 57C73), and 55 (66%) were men. Among the 83 patients, 61 (73%) had 1 or more coexisting medical condition.

We apply our models to the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome PRRS, one of the most persistent global livestock diseases to date. Whereas extensive control efforts have shown limited success, recent production of gene-edited pigs that are fully resistant to the PRRS virus have raised expectations for eliminating this deadly disease. Our models predict that disease elimination on a national scale would be difficult to achieve if gene editing was used as the only disease control. However, when complemented with vaccination, the introduction of 10% of genetically resistant animals in a fraction of herds could be sufficient for eliminating the disease within 3-6 years.

However, research has not yet examined the changing roles of hospital administrative staff. This study clarified: (1) the adverse incidents caused by hospital administrative staff, and the direct and indirect impact of these incidents on patient care; and (2) the incidents that directly involved hospital administrative staff. METHODS: This study used case report data from the Japan Council for Quality Health care collected from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2019, including a total of 30,823 reports. In April 2020, only the 88 self-reported incidents by hospital administrative staff were downloaded, excluding incidents reported by those in medical and co-medical occupations. Data from three reports implicating pharmacists were rejected and the quantitative and textual data from the remaining 85 case reports were analyzed in terms of whether they impacted patient care directly or indirectly. RESULTS: Thirty-nine reports (45.9%) involved direct impact on patient care, while 46 (54.1%) involved indirect impact on patient care. Most incidents that directly impacted patient care involved administrative staff writing prescriptions on behalf of a doctor (n = 24, 61.5%); followed by errors related to system administration, information, and documentation (n = 7, 17.9%). Most reported errors that indirectly affected patient care were related to system administration, information, and documentation used by administrative staff (n = 22, 47.8%), or to reception (n = 9, 19.6%). Almost all errors occurred during weekdays. Most frequent incidents involved outpatients (n = 23, 27.1%), or occurred next to examination/operation rooms (n = 12, 14.1%).

METHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, TIA, or MI documented anonymously in 1,262 general practices in Germany were included. We studied the differences between 2019 and 2020 (between April and June) in terms of rates and baseline characteristics by comparing monthly absolute frequencies. RESULTS: A total of 3,496 patients with stroke (mean age: 72.2 years), 1,608 patients with TIA (mean age: 71.5 years), and 2,385 patients with MI (mean age: 66.8 years) were identified between April and June 2020, indicating a decrease of 10% (stroke), 16% (TIA), and 9% (MI) compared to 2019. For patients with stroke, the decrease in men was 13% (women: ?6%) but reached 17% in the age category 51C60 years. For MI, the decrease was only obvious in males (14%). The largest decrease in stroke (?17%) and MI (?19%) was noted in April, while that for TIA occurred in May (?22%). In June for all 3 conditions, the previous year's level was achieved.

DESIGN: In-depth, qualitative interviews, analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. SETTING: Telephone or video call interviews, conducted in the UK between September 2020 and January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: 23 participants aged 26C61 (mean age=47.2) years employed in a range of non-healthcare keyworker occupations, including transport, retail, education, postal services, the police and fire services, waste collection, finance and religious services. RESULTS: Keyworkers experienced adverse psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic, including fears of COVID-19 exposure, contagion and subsequent transmission to others, especially their families. These concerns were often experienced in the context of multiple exposure risks, including insufficient personal protective equipment and a lack of workplace mitigation practices. Keyworkers also described multiple work-related challenges, including increased workload, a lack of public and organisational recognition and feelings of disempowerment. CONCLUSIONS: In efforts to reduce psychosocial concerns among non-healthcare keyworkers, there is a need for appropriate support during the COVID-19 pandemic and in preparation for other infections (eg, seasonal influenza) in the future. This includes the provision of psychological and workplace measures attending to the intersections of personal vulnerability and work conditions that cause unique risks and challenges among those in frontline keyworker occupations.","output":"Stressed, uncomfortable, vulnerable, neglected: a qualitative study of the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK frontline keyworkers"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oil and gas, in today's world of diminishing demand and price will not be able to save the finances of the state and, even worse, Sonatrach itself appears to be about to go through yet another corruption scandal, this time involving the appointment of Yamina Hakkar, the wife of the state company's chief executive officer, Toufik Hakkar, as head of the health, safety and environment department of the company Tunisia The role of the state in the other two major countries of the Maghrib has been rather more problematic than has been the case recently in Algeria and Morocco Since the beginning of 2021, the states of the Maghrib have sought to reassert themselves and to increasingly challenge popular resentment despite the severe challenges they face in doing so For the present, though, Morocco has intensified its campaign to win over other states to accept its sovereignty over the Western Sahara, especially now that the Trump administration, in its dying days, had endorsed its claim, apparently in return for Morocco's willingness to join the Abraham Accord and renew diplomatic relations with Israel - a development which the new Biden administration seems unlikely to reverse (Joff [3]) [Extracted from the article] Copyright of Journal of North African Studies is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use This abstract may be abridged No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","output":"Back to the future"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Apolipoprotein D (apoD), a member of the lipocalin family of transporter proteins binds a number of small lipophilic molecules including arachidonic acid and cholesterol. Recent studies showed a protective function of mammalian apoD as well as its insect and plant homologs against oxidative stress. In this study we investigated the effect of direct addition of exogenous human apoD protein purified from breast cystic fluid to rat hippocampal slice cultures after excitotoxic injury induced by the glutamate analog kainate. ApoD at a concentration of 10 g/ml partially prevented loss of MAP2 immunostaining and LDH release from injured hippocampal neurons after kainate injury. ApoD also attenuated the increase in oxidative products of arachidonic acid and cholesterol, F(2)-isoprostanes and 7-ketocholesterol, respectively, after kainate treatment. In view of the molecular structure of apoD which consists of an eight stranded  barrel that forms a binding pocket for a number of small hydrophobic molecules, we propose that apoD promotes its neuroprotective effects by binding to arachidonic acid and cholesterol thus preventing their oxidation to neurotoxic products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and 7-ketocholesterol.","output":"Apolipoprotein D modulates F(2)-isoprostane and 7-ketocholesterol formation and has a neuroprotective effect on organotypic hippocampal cultures after kainate-induced excitotoxic injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.7759/cureus.21272.].","output":"Correction: Ivermectin Prophylaxis Used for COVID-19: A Citywide, Prospective, Observational Study of 223,128 Subjects Using Propensity Score Matching"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"LAY ABSTRACT Teachers often report concerns about behavior challenges in their students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the school setting. Furthermore, teachers often report that they do not have adequate training in how to manage these challenging behaviors effectively. The RUBI program is an intervention initially developed for parents of children with ASD and co-occurring challenging behavior in clinic settings. The present project used school staff input to systematically redesign RUBI to be used with educators in schools. School staff gave input at multiple stages of development to ensure the adapted intervention was appropriate to use in a school setting. Responses were coded and analyzed to identify strengths and weaknesses of the RUBI manual in schools and adaptations were made accordingly. Scores of how appropriate, possible, likable, and usable RUBI would be in schools rose after the intervention was redesigned. The redesigned RUBIES manual may give school staff the tools they need to manage disruptive behaviors. In addition, collaborating with providers over multiple stages to redesign established interventions for new contexts may be a promising way to help bring research tools to practice in the future.","output":"Iterative redesign of a caregiver-mediated intervention for use in educational settings."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia and thrombosis are prominent in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19), particularly among critically ill patients; however, the mechanism is unclear. Such critically ill COVID\\\\19 patients may be suspected of heparin\\\\induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), given similar clinical features. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the presence of platelet\\\\activating anti\\\\platelet\\\\factor 4 (PF4)/heparin antibodies in critically ill COVID\\\\19 patients suspected of HIT. PATIENTS/METHODS: We tested 10 critically ill COVID\\\\19 patients suspected of HIT for anti\\\\PF4/heparin antibodies and functional platelet activation in the serotonin release assay (SRA). Anti\\\\human CD32 antibody (IV.3) was added to the SRA to confirm FcRIIA involvement. Additionally, SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 antibodies were measured using an in\\\\house ELISA. Finally, von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and activity were measured along with A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin\\\\13 Domain (ADAMTS13) activity and the presence of anti\\\\ADAMTS13 antibodies. RESULTS: Heparin\\\\induced thrombocytopenia was excluded in all samples based on anti\\\\PF4/heparin antibody and SRA results. Notably, six COVID\\\\19 patients demonstrated platelet activation by the SRA that was inhibited by FcRIIA receptor blockade, confirming an immune complex (IC)\\\\mediated reaction. Platelet activation was independent of heparin but inhibited by both therapeutic and high dose heparin. All six samples were positive for antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) or the spike protein of the SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 virus. These samples also featured significantly increased VWF antigen and activity, which was not statistically different from the four COVID\\\\19 samples without platelet activation. ADAMTS13 activity was not severely reduced, and ADAMTS13 inhibitors were not present, thus ruling out a primary thrombotic microangiopathy.

Despite calls for solidarity and social justice during the pandemic, vaccine nationalism, stockpiling of limited vaccine supplies by high-income countries and profit-driven strategies of global pharmaceutical manufacturers have brought into sharp focus global health inequities and the plight of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as they wait in line for restricted tranches of vaccines. Even in high-income countries that received vaccine supplies first, vaccine roll-out globally has been fraught with logistic and ethical challenges. South Africa (SA) is no exception. Flawed global institutional strategies for vaccine distribution and delivery have undermined public procurement platforms, leaving LMICs facing disproportionate shortages necessitating strict criteria for vaccine prioritisation. In anticipation of our first consignment of vaccines, deliberations around phase 1 roll-out were intense and contentious. Although the first phase focuses on healthcare personnel (HCP), the devil is in the detail. Navigating the granularity of prioritising different categories of risk in healthcare sectors in SA is complicated by definitions of risk in personal and occupational contexts. The inequitable public-private divide that characterises the SA health system adds another layer of complexity. Unlike other therapeutic or preventive interventions that are procured independently by the private health sector, COVID-19 vaccine procurement is currently limited to the SA government only, leaving HCP in the private sector dependent on central government allocation. Fair distribution among tertiary, secondary and primary levels of care is another consideration. Taking all these complexities into account, procedural and substantive ethical principles supporting a prioritisation approach are outlined. Within the constraints of suboptimal global health governance, LMICs must optimise progressive distribution of scarce vaccines to HCP at highest risk.","output":"Hard choices: Ethical challenges in phase 1 of COVID-19 vaccine roll-out in South Africa."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In the first controlled, non-self-report studies to show an influence of university-level ethical instruction on everyday behavior, Schwitzgebel et al.

Seven hundred thirty students in three large philosophy classes read James Rachels (2004) Basic Argument for Vegetarianism, followed by 50-min small-group discussions. Half also viewed a vegetarianism advocacy video containing factory farm footage. A few days after instruction, 54% of students agreed that eating the meat of factory farmed animals is unethical, compared to 37% before instruction, with no difference between the film and non-film conditions. Also, 39% of students anonymously pledged to avoid eating factory farmed meat for 24 h, again with no statistically detectable difference between conditions. Finally, we obtained 2828 campus food purchase receipts for 113 of the enrolled students who used their Student ID cards for purchases on campus, which we compared with 5033 purchases from a group of 226 students who did not receive the instruction. Meat purchases remained constant in the comparison group and declined among the students exposed to the material, falling from 30% to 23% of purchases overall and from 51% to 42% of purchases of $4.99 or more, with the effect possibly larger in the film condition.

Investigating the association between time spent on social media (TSSM) and depression may provide guidance toward the prevention and intervention of adolescent depression. However, related literature reported mixed findings in terms of the relationship between TSSM and depression in adolescents. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive doseCresponse meta-analysis to clarify this issue. We conducted a systematic title/abstract and topic search of the relative terms in Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO databases through 9 January 2022. Odd ratios (ORs) were used to examine the pooled effect size of the association between TSSM and risk of depression. DoseCresponse analysis was evaluated by a generalized least squares trend estimation. Twenty-one cross-sectional studies and five longitudinal studies including a total of 55,340 participants were included. Overall, more TSSM was significantly associated with a higher risk of depression symptoms (OR = 1.60, 95%CI: 1.45 to 1.75) with high heterogeneity (Q((29)) = 105.9, p < 0.001; I(2) = 72.6%). The association was stronger for adolescent girls (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.41 to 2.09) than boys (OR = 1.20, 95%CI: 1.05 to 1.37). Five studies with seven reports were included in doseCresponse analysis. There was a linear doseCresponse association of TSSM and risk of depression. The risk of depression increased by 13% (OR = 1.13, 95%CI: 1.09 to 1.17, p < 0.001) for each hour increase in social media use in adolescents. TSSM is associated with depression in a linear doseCresponse and gender-specific manner, which suggests the need for better monitoring of adolescent social media use. However, motivation, content, and engagement on and exposure to social media use may also be important contributing factors, making it necessary to interpret the current findings with caution. Therefore, further research is required to clarify not only the causal link between TSSM and depression by randomized control studies but also the influence of other factors, such as active vs. passive social media use or different types of engagement or environments in which social media is used.","output":"Time Spent on Social Media and Risk of Depression in Adolescents: A DoseCResponse Meta-Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PROBLEM: Preterm, premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a dire pregnancy outcome that is frequently associated with infection by the genital mycoplasmas, Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma parvum, and U. urealyticum. One potential mechanism by which these microorganisms may cause PPROM is by increasing the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the membranes and amniotic fluid. We tested this hypothesis in a well\\\\defined model system of genital infection with M. pulmonis, a natural reproductive pathogen of rats. METHOD OF STUDY: Timed\\\\pregnant, specific pathogen\\\\free, SpragueCDawley rats were infected with 10(7) CFU M. pulmonis at gestation day (gd) 14.

This work has been carried out to test for validity. METHODS A total of 746 patients who were identified from a prospective rectal cancer database underwent sphincter-preserving anterior resection of the rectum between October 2001 and January 2011. The incidence and severity of AL was determined using the criteria established by the ISREC. Patients with AL were categorized according to the ISREC scheme. The clinical outcomes were analyzed and compared between the groups. RESULTS The overall AL rate was 7.5% (56/746). The 56 patients with AL were distributed among the different groups as follows: Grade A, 16%; grade B, 23%; and grade C, 61%. Compared with the grade A patients, grades B and C patients had significantly elevated serum C-reactive protein levels (P < .01). None of the grade A patients were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Their further hospital stay was uneventful. The length of stay in the ICU was significantly longer for grade C patients compared with grade B patients (P < .001). The median hospital stay of grade C patients was significantly longer than that of grades A and B patients (P < .001).

METHODS: We assessed placental histology, ACE2 expression, and viral and immune dynamics at the term placenta in pregnant women with and without respiratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. FINDINGS: The majority (13 of 15) of placentas analyzed had no detectable viral RNA. ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the normal placenta during early pregnancy but was rarely seen in healthy placentas at full term, suggesting that low ACE2 expression may protect the term placenta from viral infection. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we found that cytotrophoblasts, the trophoblast stem cells and precursors to syncytiotrophoblasts, rather than syncytiotrophoblasts or Hofbauer cells, are most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. To better understand potential immune mechanisms shielding placental cells from infection in vivo, we performed bulk and single-cell transcriptomics analyses and found that the maternal-fetal interface of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited robust immune responses, including increased activation of natural killer (NK) and T cells, increased expression of interferon-related genes, as well as markers associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia.

This study aims to find a new antiviral combination regimen by investigating the frequency of clinically relevant and objectively identified comorbidities, and the clustering of these clinical syndromes and varying results of treatment with antiviral drugs in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This study recruited 151 severe COVID-19 infection cases diagnosed in our hospital examination and illustrated the clinical potential during a consecutive 25-day medication period. Potential differences in disease severity and clinical characteristics, hematological profile, and current pharmacologic treatments (single agent, double or triple combinations, and the combined antiviral drugs plus Lianhua Qingwen) among comorbidity clusters were explored. RESULTS: Although disease severity was comparable among three clusters, it was markedly different in terms of laboratory test status. Coagulable abnormality was mainly present in cluster 1 and cluster 2. Other indicators were normal, except for a significant increase of neutrophils presented in cluster 2. Patients showed the most complicated haematological results in cluster 3, including severe coagulation abnormalities, leukocytosis, neutrophilic granulocytosis, and lymphopenia. Our results for the first time suggest that a quadruple combination therapy (Ribavirin, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Umifenovir, and Lianhua Qingwen) can be considered as a preferred treatment approach to severe COVID-19 patients.

Conservative, surgical and endoscopic therapeutic techniques are used. Both CEP and PSF are potentially life-threatening complications and require intensive treatment. Endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT) is an innovative endoscopic surgical procedure for the treatment of transmural intestinal defects throughout the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). In this retrospective study, we demonstrate its application in head and neck surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS In ENPT, open-pore drains are placed endoscopically in the wound area. The drains can be inserted in an intraluminal position spanning the length of the defect (intraluminal ENPT), or through the defect into the extraluminal wound cavity (intracavitary ENPT). An electronic suction pump applies and maintains a continuous negative pressure of - 125 mmHg over a period of several days. The endoscopic drains are changed at regular intervals every few days until stable intracorporeal wound healing by secondary intention or defect closure is achieved. Between 06/2008 and 05/2019 ten patients (f = 3, m = 7; 46-78 years old) were treated with ENPT for CEP or PSF. Five patients had postoperative wound defects with consecutive PSF after total laryngectomy or floor of mouth resection. In five patients iatrogenic CEP was found following endoscopic procedures. RESULTS In all patients treated with ENPT, healing of the perforation defect or fistula was achieved (cure rate 100%). The median treatment duration was 13.7 days (range 4-42 days).

Higher expression of ERAP2 was significantly associated with better survival in SqCLC patients from TCGA (p=0.007), KM-plotter (p=0.017), and our tissue microarrays (TMAs) (p=0.026). In univariate and multivariate Cox analysis of SqCLC TMAs, high ERAP2 expression was identified as an independent protective factor for SqCLC patients (Univariate Cox, HR=0.659, range 0.454-0.956, p<0.05. Multivariate Cox, HR=0.578, range 0.385-0.866, p<0.05). In TIMER, ERAP2 was positively correlated with several immune markers (CD274, p=1.27E-04; CD68, p=5.88E-08) and immune infiltrating cells (CD8(+) T cell, p=4.09E-03; NK cell, p=1.00E-04). In our cohort, ERAP2 was significantly correlated with CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) (p=0.0029), and patients with higher ERAP2 expression had a higher percentage of PD-L1 positive patients (p=0.049) and a higher CD8(+) TILs level (p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our study demonstrates that higher expression of ERAP2 is tightly associated with the immuno-supportive microenvironment and can predict a favorable prognosis in SqCLC. Meanwhile, ERAP2 may be a promising immunotherapeutic target for patients with SqCLC.","output":"ERAP2 Is Associated With Immune Infiltration and Predicts Favorable Prognosis in SqCLC"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 affects the liver, causing alteration in liver biochemistry tests such as aspartate transferase (AST), alanine transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin and albumin. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of alteration in liver functions tests and associated factors for severity among Peruvian COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective and cross-sectional study was performed in 4 public hospitals in Peru. Patients admitted to hospitalization wards and intensive care units with a diagnosis COVID-19 were enrolled. The evaluation of AST, ALT, ALP, totalbilirubin and albumin was performed.

Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are tools that assist patients in making health decisions, when there is uncertainty about treatment choice, incorporating their personal preferences and values about the available treatment options. PtDAs can improve shared decision-making and lead to better treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a web-based PtDA for patients with GAD in primary care (PC). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The general study design is comprised of two stages: (1) development of a web-based PtDA for patients with GAD, derived from an evidence-based Clinical Practice Guideline and (2) assessment of the effectiveness of the PtDA in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design, in PC centres in Tenerife (Spain). This RCT will be carried out with 124 patients with GAD, comparing the PtDA to a fact sheet with general information on mental health. Patients will review the PtDA in one session accompanied by a researcher. Post-intervention measures will be administered immediately after the intervention and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome will be decisional conflict. Secondary outcomes will include knowledge about GAD and its treatment, treatment preference, concordance between treatment preference and choice, and decision quality (knowledge 60% and concordant decision). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project received ethics approval from the local committee at Nuestra Se?ora de la Candelaria (HUNSC) University Hospital in Santa Cruz de Tenerife (code: CHUNSC_2019_58). Informed consent will be obtained from each participant before randomisation. Results from the trial will be submitted for publication in international peer-reviewed scientific journals and will be disseminated through workshops and local and international conferences.

Both services provide emotional expression scores if at least one face is successfully detected in the picture. Using the Microsoft Azure Face API we obtained scores for anger, contempt, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutrality. Using the MEGVII Face++ Detect API, pictures were scored for the presence of anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise, and neutrality. Higher scores on each emotion refer to a stronger expression of the respective emotion. The dataset presented here consists of data of N =728 Facebook users with a profile picture in which both APIs detected only one face. Regarding self-report data, the dataset includes the following demographic information about the participants: gender and age. The dataset also includes participants' personality scores based on a short validated assessment of Big Five traits (Ten Item Personality Inventory), and Impulsivity/Sensation Seeking (IMPSS8). A document including the questions administered in the online survey is attached to the dataset. This dataset can be useful to generate insights on the association between demographic variables, including age and gender, and personality (Big Five traits and Impulsivity/Sensation Seeking), and emotional expression as derived from social media pictures.

These fields can tap energy and angular momentum from spinning black holes through superradiant instabilities, during which a macroscopic bosonic condensate develops around the black hole. Striking features of this phenomenon include gaps in the spin-mass distribution of astrophysical black holes and a continuous gravitational-wave (GW) signal emitted by the condensate. So far these processes have been studied in great detail for scalar fields and, more recently, for vector fields. Here we take an important step forward in the black hole superradiance program by computing, analytically, the instability timescale, direct GW emission, and stochastic background, in the case of massive tensor (i.e., spin-2) fields. Our analysis is valid for any black hole spin and for small boson masses. The instability of massive spin-2 fields shares some properties with the scalar and vector cases, but its phenomenology is much richer, for example, there exist multiple modes with comparable instability timescales, and the dominant GW signal is hexadecapolar rather than quadrupolar. Electromagnetic and GW observations of spinning black holes in the mass range M(1,10^{10}) M_{} can constrain the mass of a putative spin-2 field in the range 10^{-22}?m_{b} c^{2}/eV?10^{-10} .

METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional investigation among asymptomatic outpatient subjects and covered 0.1% of total population of Northern Serbia (Autonomous Province of Vojvodina). Each participant was tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using an immunochromatographic qualitative test (point-of-care rapid test). In the last round of survey IgG antibodies targeting the S1 subunit of the spike protein and the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus were assessed. RESULTS: During the four rounds of survey (between the end of April and the end of September), anti-SARS-CoV-2 seropositivities based on immunochromatographic test results were 2.60% (95% CI 1.80C3.63), 3.93% (95% CI 2.85C5.28), 6.11% (95% CI 4.72C7.77) and 14.60% (95% 12.51C16.89), respectively. After adjusting with results obtained from the Line immunoassay test, the estimated overall seroprevalence increased to 16.67% (95% CI 14.45C19.08) corresponding to 322,033 infections in total by the end of September 2020 in Vojvodinas population. Throughout the course of the study, for every RT-PCR confirmed case of COVID-19, there were 39C87 additional infections in Vojvodina. No significant difference (p>0.05) in SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity regarding gender and between age subgroups was observed over the course of the survey. CONCLUSIONS: The population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies implies much more widespread infection in Vojvodina than indicated by the number of confirmed cases.

The docking results demonstrated glycyrrhizin followed by azadirachtanin, mycophenolic acid, kushenol-w and 6-azauridine, as potential candidates. Glycyrrhizin depicted very stable binding mode to the active pocket of the Mpro (binding energy, -8.7 kcal/mol), PLpro (binding energy, -7.9 kcal/mol), and Nucleocapsid (binding energy, -7.9 kcal/mol) enzymes. This compound showed binding with several key residues that are critical to natural substrate binding and functionality to all the receptors. To test docking prediction, the compound with each receptor was subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to characterize the molecule stability and decipher its possible mechanism of binding. Each complex concludes that the receptor dynamics are stable (Mpro (mean RMSD, 0.93 ?), PLpro (mean RMSD, 0.96 ?), and Nucleocapsid (mean RMSD, 3.48 ?)).

RESULTS: Seventy-six survivors (55 females) with a mean age of 41.3  13.8 years were enrolled, and 65 (86%) were HCWs. A total of 69 (91%) patients had returned to their original work at 3-months after discharge. Most of the survivors had symptoms including fever, sputum production, fatigue, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, chest tightness on exertion and palpitations in the three months after discharge. The serum troponin-I levels during the acute illness showed high correlation with the symptom of fatigue after hospital discharge (r = 0.782; P = 0.008) and lymphopenia was correlated with the symptoms of chest tightness and palpitations on exertion of patients after hospital discharge (r = -.285, P = 0.027; r = -.363, P = 0.004, respectively). The mean values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity and diffusion capacity were all normal (> 80% predicted) and lung HRCTs returned to normal in most of the patients (82%), however, 42% of survivors had mild pulmonary function abnormalities at 3-months after discharge.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) implantation was performed in 10 female rabbits using ferro-oxide loaded PVDF meshes. MRI measurements were performed postoperatively at days 1 and 90. After three-dimensional reconstruction of all MRI images the total surface and the effective surface of the implanted mesh were explored and calculated computer-assisted. RESULTS In all cases, the mesh could be identified in MRI. The subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction always allowed a calculation of the mesh area. In relation to the original size of the used textile implant, we found neither a significant reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of the pneumoperitoneum at day 1 after laparoscopic surgery nor a significant change of the total surface of this large pore mesh by the end of the observation period. CONCLUSIONS In vivo investigation of mesh surface via MRI could exclude a significant initial reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of pneumoperitoneum, in this IPOM rabbit model.

Especially non communicable chronic diseases like Osteoarthritis (OA), Diabetes mellitus Type 2 (DMT2), overweight (OW) and obesity (OB) as well as cardio-vascular diseases (CVD) are examples of the most prevalent chronic conditions in industrial nations. The treatment of multimorbidity has not gained much attention in research so far. Especially conservative therapies other than medication have not been established for this specific population. Physical exercise (PE) has been shown to be a treatment option with little adverse events and many positive effects for many single diseases, and physical activity (PA) promotion in general has found its way in many disease management programs. However, a shortfall of research on the effectiveness of specific PE interventions in the treatment of multimorbidity must be stated. The objective of this study therefore was to evaluate a pilot model aiming for behavior change towards the initiation and maintenance of regular PE and its related health benefits in patients with multimorbidity. This abstract focuses on a subsample of participants with knee osteoarthritis. Strength measures of the knee flexors and extensors and self-reported disease related symptoms were analyzed. Methods: Participants with at least two severe risk factors or manifested disease signs for hip and/or knee OA, DMT2, OW/OB, CVD were included in the study. The following analysis relates to the subsample of subjects with or at risk for knee OA. The intervention consisted of two 12-week successive phases. The first phase included different types of supervised aerobic and strength training sessions. Dosage parameters were based on the national PA recommendations. The intervention further comprised theoretical background information on training science, nutrition and behavioral change techniques as well as two personal counselling sessions with the aim to enable participants towards an autonomous exercise participation. The second intervention phase enhanced the self-organized maintenance of the same level of PE. In this phase, participants were contacted via email on a regular base. They received weekly training logs and feedback on their logs as well as another personal counselling session. Data were assessed at baseline (t0), after the first (t3) and after the second intervention phase (t6). Outcomes of this analysis relate to self-reported disease-related symptoms (WOMAC subscale pain and physical functioning) and isometric peak torque measures for knee flexion and extension. The study was conducted in two recruitment waves for organizational reasons. Due to the Covid-19 induced nationwide contact restrictions, strength measures could not be assessed for wave two at t3 in March 2020, therefore only t6 was used for further analysis of strength measures. Wilcoxon Tests were calculated for non-parametric data to assess the changes between t0-t3 and t0-t6. Effect sizes were calculated using r. The study is registered at the German clinical trial register (DRKS00016702). Results: N=39 patients were included in the study, thereof n=23 participants (females=19, males=4) showed disease signs or self-reported risk factors for knee OA. The mean BMI of them was 30.3  3.2 kg/m2 and the mean age was 58.3  6.3 years. Of the subsample, n=22 were also overweight or obese, n=16 had a diagnosis of hypertension, n=2 were diagnosed with DMT2 and n=16 had an elevated risk for DMT2. The WOMAC score was not answered by three participants at t3. One participant did not perform the knee extension test due to pain at t0 and t6. One participant did not perform the isometric torque at t6 due to an elevated blood pressure. 2 participants were lost to follow-up due to family illness (n=1) and shortage of time caused by Covid-19 induced overtime (n=1) and did not provide any data at t6. Median values for WOMAC pain decreased from t0 to t3 but not from t0 to t6, this was not statistically significant. The decrease for the subscale physical function from t0 to t3 and t6 was not statistically significant as well (Table 1). [Formula presented] There was a statistically significant change for isometric peak torque of knee extension. Strength values for knee flexion increased as well, however this was not statistically significant (Table 2, Figure 1). [Formula presented] [Formula presented] Conclusions: Results of this study indicate that a systematic, initially supervised training can lead to objective health benefits in people with knee OA and multimorbidity. Participants of the study showed an increase in maximal isometric force of knee extension with a large effect size. This is an important finding for patients with risk factors as well as already manifested knee OA, as quadriceps strength is known as a protective factor for knee OA and its progression. Results for the WOMAC showed marginal improvement throughout the intervention period. The majority of people only had minor complaints at the beginning of the study, reducing the potential for positive change. One limitation of the study is the onset of the Covid-19 related contact restrictions that prohibited strength measures as well as physical exercise training sessions in gyms and other public places for participants of wave 2 from the 9th intervention week on. The influence of this force majeure on the results of the study cannot be conclusively assessed at this point. Further limitations are related to the small sample size, especially for the subgroup of patients with OA, and the lack of a control group. This was a pilot study for a randomized controlled trial in health services research which is already initiated. Results of this pilot trial therefore indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of this intervention for multimorbid patients with knee OA that will now be implemented and evaluated in a real health services setting in the near future.","output":"Physical exercise promotion and related health benefits for people with knee osteoarthritis and additional other chronic non-communicable diseases: a pilot study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Understanding how interurban movements can modify the spatial distribution of the population is important for transport planning but is also a fundamental ingredient for epidemic modeling. We focus here on vacation trips (for all transportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results for 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating the spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel flows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial fluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they appear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations, creating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These movements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population concentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the return to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us to show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New Year due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread of the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of keeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring intra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited.

One of the potential risks of joint replacement is metallosis, or the local and systemic release of metal ions. Metallosis is caused by the release of metallic debris, secondary to hardware failure. The phenomenon is most commonly associated with failed metal-on-metal hip prostheses and is characterized locally by heavy staining of surrounding soft tissue, metallic synovitis, joint effusion, and gradual loosening of the prosthesis. Additionally, metallic debris can also lead to periarticular superficial skin manifestations. The release of metal ions has further been known to lead to systemic upsets including neurologic deficit (declining vision, hearing, or cognition; headaches), cardiac failure, and hypothyroidism. As the number of patients seeking major orthopedic interventions grows, the incidence of metallosis-related skin tattooing will also increase. The structural components of a failed joint replacement can be revised (improving patients' pain and functioning). However, any skin tattooing secondary to metallosis presents the treating dermatologist with clinical challenge, due to lack of research regarding treatment of this condition. Our aim is to review the published literature on metallosis, including the pathophysiology. After assessing publications on the treatment of traumatic and cosmetic tattooing, we hope to stimulate further research regarding treatment.

Few studies have assessed the positive psychological impact of politically motivated violence on health care workers. In this study, the level of positive psychological impact among health care workers with recurrent exposure to victims of politically motivated violence was examined. METHODS A validated questionnaire survey of health care personnel treating victims of politically motivated violence during 2000-2005 in two hospital settings was conducted. Positive psychological impact was assessed by the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory and traumatic stress symptoms were assessed using the Revised Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Inventory. Subjects included physicians (surgeons and anesthesiologists), nurses, and psychotherapists. RESULTS The rate of response to the mail-in questionnaires was 68.3% (n = 138). The sample consisted of 70 physicians, 37 nurses, and 31 hospital-based psychotherapists. Positive psychological impact was noted for the entire sample and among all professions. Traumatic stress symptoms predicted positive psychological impact for the entire sample and for each profession, and there was a curvilinear relationship between traumatic stress symptoms and positive psychological impact. Women experienced greater levels of positive psychological impact. CONCLUSIONS Hospital-based health care providers treating victims of politically motivated violence experience both positive and negative psychological impact.

It is synthesized by hyaluronan synthases (HAS) into high-molecular-weight chains (HMW-HA) that exhibit anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. In damaged, infected, and/or inflamed tissues, HMW-HA are degraded by hyaluronidases (HYAL) or reactive oxygen species (ROS) to give rise to low-molecular-weight HAs (LMW-HAs) that are potent pro-inflammatory molecules. Therefore, the size of HA regulates the balance of anti- or pro-inflammatory functions. The activities of HA depend also on its interactions with hyaladherins. HA synthesis, degradation, and activities through HA/receptors interactions define the hyaluronasome. In this review, a short overview of the role of high and low-molecular-weight HA polymers in the lungs is provided. The involvement of LMW-HA in pulmonary innate immunity via the activation of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and epithelial cells is described to highlight LMW-HA as a therapeutic target in inflammatory respiratory diseases.

The role of hypercapnia on lung repair after injury is not completely understood. Here, we show that hypercapnia limits -catenin signaling in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, leading to reduced proliferative capacity. Hypercapnia alters expression of major Wnts in PDGFRa+-fibroblasts from those maintaining AT2 progenitor activity and towards those that antagonize -catenin signaling and limit progenitor function. Activation of -catenin signaling in AT2 cells, rescues the inhibition AT2 proliferation induced by hypercapnia. Inhibition of AT2 proliferation in hypercapnic patients may contribute to impaired lung repair after injury, preventing sealing of the epithelial barrier, increasing lung flooding, ventilator dependency and mortality.","output":"Hypercapnia limits -catenin-mediated alveolar type 2 cell progenitor function by altering Wnt production from adjacent fibroblasts"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus related infectious diseases seems to be biggest challenge of 21 century that have been constantly emerging and threating public health around the globe.

Widespread awareness of epidemiological and molecular characteristics of the dengue virus (DENV) is required. In 2014, we isolated the virus from patients and sequenced its genome. The sequences of DENV isolated from Guangdong and other countries screened since 2005 were studied to establish molecular evolutionary databases along with epidemiological data to explore its epidemiological, phylogenetic, and molecular characteristics. Causes underlying the occurrence of the dengue epidemic included importation and localization of the virus. The number of indigenous cases significantly exceeded that of imported cases. Dengue virus 1 is the most important serotype and caused the long-term epidemic locally. Based on the data available since 2005, DENV1 was divided into three genotypes (I, IV, and V). Only genotypes I and V were detected in 2014. In 2014, an epidemic involving old lineages of DENV1 genotype V occurred after 2 years of silence. The genotype was previously detected from 2009 to 2011. Genotype I, which caused recent epidemics, demonstrated a continuation of new lineages, and a predictive pattern of molecular evolution since 2005 among the four lineages was present. The DENV isolated from Guangdong was closely related to those causing large-scale epidemics in neighboring countries, suggesting the possibility of its import from these countries.

An initial step in creating a plan towards strengthening Pakistans baseline critical care capacity was to carry out a needs-assessment within the country to assess gaps and devise strategies for improving the quality of critical care facilities. Methods: : To assess the baseline critical care capacity of Pakistan, we conducted a series of cross-sectional surveys of hospitals providing COVID-19 care across the country. These hospitals were pre-identified by the Health Services Academy (HSA), Pakistan. Surveys were administered via telephonic and on-site interviews and based on a unique checklist for assessing critical care units which was adapted from the Partners in Health 4S Framework, which is: Space, Staff, Stuff, and Systems. These components were scored, weighted equally, and then ranked into quartiles. Results: : A total of 106 hospitals were surveyed, with the majority being in the public sector (71.7%) and in the metropolitan setting (56.6%). We found infrastructure, staffing, and systems lacking as only 19.8% of hospitals had negative pressure rooms and 44.4% had quarantine facilities for staff. Merely 36.8% of hospitals employed accredited intensivists and 54.8% of hospitals maintained an ideal nurse-to-patient ratio. 31.1% of hospitals did not have a staffing model while 37.7% of hospitals did not have surge policies. On chi-square analysis, statistically significant differences (p<0.05) were noted between public and private sectors along with metropolitan versus rural settings in various elements. Almost all ranks showed significant disparity between public-private and metropolitan-rural settings, with private and metropolitan hospitals having a greater proportion in the 1 st rank, while public and rural hospitals had a greater proportion in the lower ranks. Conclusion: Pakistan has an underdeveloped critical care network with significant inequity between public-private and metropolitan-rural strata.

This paper addresses the privacy concerns associated with sharing the viral sequence data with a pre-defined set of contextual data describing the sample source and case attribute of the sequence data in the Canadian context. Currently, the viral genome sequences are shared by provincial public health laboratories and their healthcare and academic partners, with the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory and with publicly accessible databases. However, data sharing delays and the provision of incomplete contextual data often occur because publicly releasing such data triggers privacy and data governance concerns. The CanCOGeN Ethics and Governance Expert Working Group thus has investigated several privacy issues cited by CanCOGeN data providers/stewards. This paper addresses these privacy concerns and offers insights primarily in the Canadian context, although similar privacy considerations also exist in other jurisdictions. We maintain that sharing viral sequencing data and its limited associated contextual data in the public domain generally does not pose insurmountable privacy challenges. However, privacy risks associated with reidentification should be actively monitored due to advancements in reidentification methods and the evolving pandemic landscape. We also argue that during a global health emergency such as COVID-19, privacy should not be used as a blanket measure to prevent such genomic data sharing due to the significant benefits it provides towards public health responses and ongoing research activities.","output":"Addressing Privacy Concerns in Sharing Viral Sequences and Minimum Contextual Data in a Public Repository During the COVID-19 Pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"By equipping a previously reported dynamic causal model of COVID-19 with an isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded) relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000 tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent serological studies.","output":"Tracking and tracing in the UK: a dynamic causal modelling study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This study aimed to assess the changes of small intestinal morphology, progenitors, differentiated epithelial cells, and potential mechanisms in neonatal piglets. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of samples from 36 piglets suggested that dramatic changes were observed in the jejunum crypts depth and crypt fission index of neonatal piglets (P < 0.001). The number of intestinal stem cells (ISC) tended to increase (P < 0.10), and a decreased number of enteroendocrine cells appeared in the jejunal crypt on d 7 (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of jejunal chromogranin A (ChgA) was down-regulated in d 7 piglets (P < 0.05). There was an up-regulation of the adult ISC marker gene of SPARC related modular calcium binding 2 (Smoc2), and Wnt/-catenin target genes on d 7 (P < 0.05). These results were further verified in vitro enteroid culture experiments. A mass of hollow spheroids was cultured from the fetal intestine of 0-d-old piglets (P < 0.001), whereas substantial organoids with budding and branching structures were cultured from the intestine of 7-d-old piglets (P < 0.001). The difference was reflected by the organoid budding efficiency, crypt domains per organoid, and the surface area of the organoid. Furthermore, spheroids on d 0 had more Ki67-positive cells and enteroendocrine cells (P < 0.05) and showed a decreasing trend in the ISC and goblet cells (P < 0.10). Moreover, the mRNA expression of spheroids differed markedly from that of organoids, with low expression of intestinal differentiation gene (Lysozyme; P < 0.05), epithelial-specific markers (Villin, E-cadherin; P < 0.05), and adult ISC markers (leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 [Lgr5], Smoc2; P < 0.001), and up-regulation of fetal marker (connexin 43 [Cnx43]; P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of relevant genes was up-regulated, and involved in Wnt/-catenin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), Notch, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling on d 7 organoids (P < 0.05). Spheroids displayed low differentiated phenotype and high proliferation, while organoids exhibited strong differentiation potential. These results indicated that the conversion from the fetal progenitors (spheroids) to adult ISC (normal organoids) might largely be responsible for the fast development of intestinal epithelial cells in neonatal piglets.","output":"Changes in progenitors and differentiated epithelial cells of neonatal piglets"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aim of this study is to investigate whether the risk of miscarriage increases in pregnant women who had COVID-19 in first trimester.

METHODS: We searched relevant databases/websites (up to September 2020) and selected English-language RCT publications of remdesivir for COVID-19. We conducted meta-analysis using an inverse variance, random-effects model in addition to trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the efficacy outcomes: all-cause mortality, viral burden and clinical progression. Safety outcomes were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: We included five RCTs (7540 participants) from 7237 citations. Most (80%) were of an unclear to high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a significant improvement with remdesivir (100 mg, 10 days) regarding all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, CI 0.82-1.07; I2 = 0%; 4 RCTs; 7143 patients), clinical progression (RR 1.08, CI 0.99-1.18; I2 = 70.4%; 3 RCTs; 1692 patients), or diarrhoea (RR 0.82, CI 0.40-1.66; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). Nausea occurred more often with remdesivir (RR 2.77, CI 1.28-6.03; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). TSA showed that the required information size was not reached for firm conclusions to be drawn. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19. More high-quality RCTs are needed for a stronger evidence.

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the ability for the completion of in-person clerkships for medical students across the nation. Virtual opportunities to increase exposure to Med-Peds programs and didactics are lacking at this time. Objective: To develop a virtual Med-Peds student elective that serves to increase awareness of the Med-Peds specialty, exposure to Med-Peds topics and relevant didactics, and exposure to Med-Peds specific mentorship when on-site clerkships are not available due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Fifteen medical students participated in a virtual Med-Peds student elective utilizing Zoom (Zoom Inc, San Jose, CA). Three separate cohorts of five students each completed two-week elective experiences. The virtual elective curriculum was created using asynchronous and synchronous learning modalities. Sessions were composed of self-directed learning topics, peer-to-peer interactive case discussions, resident-led didactics, and attending physician-led didactics and mentorship sessions. A pre-survey was administered at the beginning of the elective and a post-survey was administered at the end of the elective to assess the effectiveness of the elective, student experiences with Med-Peds mentors, and students general perceptions of Med-Peds as a residency application choice. Results: All students (100%), rated the Med-Peds elective to have exceeded their expectations. All students indicated this elective had been extremely (100%) valuable to increase their understanding and interest in Med-Peds (top rating on a five-point Likert scale). Compared to prior to the elective, most were very likely (87%) or likely (7%) to apply to Med-Peds as their top (preferred) specialty. Similar to pre-survey data, one-third (33%) of the students were still likely to apply to an alternate specialty in addition to Med-Peds. Hundred percent of students indicated that the mentorship component of the elective exceeded their original expectations. While most students indicated that they are much more strongly considering applying to Med-Peds as a top (preferred) specialty, the number of students who continue to consider dual-application to include either categorical Internal Medicine, categorical Pediatrics, or Family Medicine did not differ before and after completion of the virtual elective. Conclusions: Implementation of a virtual medical student elective focusing on exposure to Med-Peds can strengthen medical students interest in the combined specialty despite a paucity of previous experiences or an affiliated Med-Peds program. This new type of rotation can positively impact a students view of a hospital system and a residency program when in-person clinical rotations are not available.","output":"Virtual Med-Peds: Description of the First Virtual Med-Peds Student Elective During COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis infection of the maxillofacial region and brain has been associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Mucormycosis was relatively a rare infection before COVID-19, and imaging findings are not very well described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective imaging study of 101 patients diagnosed with COVID-19-associated mucormycosis by histopathology and/or culture was performed. All patients underwent computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging based on the clinical condition of the patient and on consensus decision by the team of treating physicians. A simple 3-stage classification system based on imaging findings was adopted. RESULTS: One hundred one cases were included in the final analysis (mean age = 55.1 years; male/female ratio = 67:34). The affected patients had diabetes in 94% of the instances (n = 95), 80.1% (n = 81) received steroids), whereas 59.4% (n = 60) patients received supplemental oxygen. The majority underwent surgical intervention, whereas in 6 cases, patients were treated with antibiotic regimens. Sixty subjects improved following therapy, whereas 18 eventually succumbed to the illness. We noted a significant positive correlation between the imaging stage and outcomes. No association was seen between other clinical parameters and final clinical outcomes. Salient imaging findings include lack of normal sinonasal mucosal enhancement, perisinus inflammation, ischemic optic neuropathy, perineural spread, pachymeningeal enhancement, and presence of strokes.

Population-level effects of COVID-19 on patients with ESKD in the United States are uncertain. METHODS We identified patients with ESKD from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data during epidemiologic weeks 3-27 of 2017-2020 and corresponding weeks of 2017-2019, stratifying them by kidney replacement therapy. Outcomes comprised hospitalization for COVID-19, all-cause death, and hospitalization for reasons other than COVID-19. We estimated adjusted relative rates (ARRs) of death and non-COVID-19 hospitalization during epidemiologic weeks 13-27 of 2020 (March 22 to July 4) versus corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. RESULTS Among patients on dialysis, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization peaked between March 22 and April 25 2020. Non-Hispanic Black race and Hispanic ethnicity associated with higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, whereas peritoneal dialysis was associated with lower rates. During weeks 13-27, ARRs of death in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.19) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36) among patients undergoing dialysis or with a functioning transplant, respectively. Excess mortality was higher among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients. Among patients on dialysis, the rate of non-COVID-19 hospitalization during weeks 13-27 in 2020 was 17% lower versus hospitalization rates for corresponding weeks in 2017-2019.

Methods: We analyzed a training set of 20 patients, each with four sequences/weightings: T1, T1 post-contrast, T2, and T2-FLAIR. We trained the parameters of a relatively small convolutional neural network (CNN) as follows: First, we randomly mutated the CNN weights. We then measured the CNN training set accuracy, using the latter as the fitness evaluation metric. The fittest child CNNs were identified. We incorporated their mutations into the parent CNN. This selectively mutated parent became the next generation's parent CNN. We repeated this process for approximately 50,000 generations. Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy. DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy. Conclusions: DNE can achieve perfect accuracy with small training sets and small CNNs.

METHODS The daily numbers of the probable SARS patients and the daily meteorological factors during the SARS outbreak period in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Beijing, and Taiyuan were used in the data analysis. Ecological analysis was conducted to explore the association between the daily numbers of probable SARS patients and the environmental temperature and its variations. RESULTS There was a significant correlation between the SARS cases and the environmental temperature seven days before the onset and the seven day time lag corresponds well with the known incubation period for SARS. The optimum environmental temperature associated with the SARS cases was between 16 degrees C to 28 degrees C, which may encourage virus growth. A sharp rise or decrease in the environmental temperature related to the cold spell led to an increase of the SARS cases because of the possible influence of the weather on the human immune system. This study provided some evidence that there is a higher possibility for SARS to reoccur in spring than that in autumn and winter. CONCLUSION Current knowledge based on case studies of the SARS outbreak in the four cities suggested that the SARS outbreaks were significantly associated with the temperature and its variations.

RESULTS: We found that province-specific crude case-fatality rate in the first wave (February-July 2020) had a median value of 12.0%. Data about infection-fatality rate was more difficult to compute, due to large underestimation of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the first wave when asymptomatic individuals were very rarely tested. However, when using reference population-based seroprevalence data for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies collected in May-July 2020, we computed an infection-fatality rate of 2.2%.

B cells produce antibodies by a Darwinian evolutionary process called affinity maturation (AM). During AM, the B cell population evolves in response to the antigen. Antibodies that bind specifically and strongly to the antigen are thus produced. Highly mutable pathogens pose a major challenge to the development of effective vaccines because antibodies that are effective against one strain of the virus may not protect against a mutant strain. Antibodies that can protect against diverse strains of a mutable pathogen are called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). In spite of extensive experimental and computational studies that have led to important advances, an effective vaccination strategy that can generate bnAbs does not exist for any highly mutable pathogen. Here we study a minimal model of AM in different time-varying antigenic environments to explore the mechanisms underlying optimal vaccination protocols that maximize the production of bnAbs. We find that the characteristics of the time-varying Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) between the B cell population distribution and the fitness landscape imposed by antigens is a key determinant of bnAb evolution. The optimal vaccination protocol requires a relatively low KLD in the beginning in order to increase the entropy (diversity) of the B cell population so that the surviving B cells have a high chance of evolving into bnAbs upon subsequently increasing the KLD. For a discretized two-step variation in antigenic environment, there are optimal values of the KLDs for the first and second steps. Phylogenetic tree analysis further reveals the evolutionary pathways that lead to bnAbs. The connections between our results and recent simulation studies of bnAb evolution and the general problem of evolution of generalists versus specialists are discussed.","output":"Mechanisms underlying vaccination protocols that may optimally elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against highly mutable pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"during the time of the global pandemic Covid 19, entire world is having problems associated with global sickness and health care issues It is visible that there is no accurate medicine, yet available for the disease There is no direct method that is responsible to handle the situation when a person suffers from this disease The paper elaborates method that is responsible for advising a person about the first aid or immediate treatment that can be taken care during this pandemic situation Artificial intelligence and natural language processing are used for providing a system, which is integrated with the very famous, WhatsApp messenger The paper also elaborates the functionality of the bot and construction This bot is sufficient for providing proper advice based on the symptoms of a patient in order to seek medical attention The bot further gives the advices and information about nearest hospitals for seeking medical care ? 2021 IEEE","output":"COVIBOT-An intelligent WhatsApp based advising bot for Covid-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This cross-national study explored stability and change in mental health, quality of life, well-being and loneliness during the early stage and nine months after the implementation of COVID-19 pandemic social distancing measures and periodic lockdowns as adjusted by demographic variables.

To collect the required data, we applied a questionnaire that included socio-demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and questions on the patients HRQoL. Time trade-off (TTO) approach was used to measure the lost HRQoL attributed to COVID-19. Besides, we applied a two-limit Tobit regression model to determine the effects of the socio-demographic factors on patients health utility and the visual analogue scale approach was used to estimate the perceived total current health status. RESULTS: The overall mean (SE) and median (IQR) of the health utility values were 0.863 (0.01) and 0.909 (0.21) respectively. These values for the traders (those who were willing to lose a part of their remaining time of life to avoid the disease) were estimated at 0.793 (0.01) and 0.848 (0.17), respectively. The lowest amount of utility value belonged to the elderly (mean (SE) = 0.742 (0.04); median (IQR) = 0.765 (0.42)) and those living in rural areas (mean (SE)) = 0.804 (0.03); median (IQR) = 0.877 (0.30)).

CASE PRESENTATION: We present a challenging and rare case of ASS-associated ILD presenting with unexplained respiratory symptoms and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging during the COVID-19 pandemic. High clinical suspicion for ASS with early appropriate therapy with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents led to marked clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: High index of suspicion for ASS is mandated in patients with unexplained ILD.

Here, we conducted a follow-up study of 29 naive TB patients who received first-line anti-TB drug treatment; we collected their fecal samples at different time points, as well as 22 fecal samples from healthy subjects. Fungal ITS2 and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing were used to analyze the effects of active TB and anti-TB treatment on the gut microbiota. We found that naive TB patients had bacterial and fungal dysbiosis with altered community composition and a decreased density of the transkingdom correlation network. Anti-TB drug treatment significantly decreased the diversity of bacteria and fungi with altered composition. Notably, we observed that the abundance of Purpureocillium lilacinum tended to decrease and Nakaseomyces spp. tended to increase in the anti-TB treatment, and all of them had increased proportions in the three TB groups compared with healthy subjects. We found that the fungal-bacterial transkingdom network was severely altered in TB patients after 2 months of treatment, and new fungal-enriched connections that were not observed in other groups after 6 months of treatment. This study provides the first detailed analysis of dysbiosis of the gut mycobiota due to active TB and anti-TB treatment. The results suggest that fungi play an important role in the balance of the gut microbiota and may be associated with the progression of TB, influencing the microbiota and immunity homeostasis in those receiving anti-TB treatment. IMPORTANCE Numerous studies have shown that the gut bacterial microbiota is altered in active TB patients and that anti-TB drugs have profound and long-term impacts. However, as an integral part of the microbiota, fungi have rarely been studied. The need to investigate both the bacterial and fungal microbiota, as well as the relationship between them is apparent. The significance of our study is in our examination of the changes in the bacterial and fungal microbiota simultaneously in both active TB and patients receiving anti-TB treatment. We found that fungi play an important role in the bacterial-fungal transkingdom network, especially during the anti-TB therapy. These findings underscore the importance of fungi in gut microbiota dysbiosis during active TB and anti-TB treatment processes. In addition, our findings suggest it is meaningful to research potential adjunctive therapies that reduce fungal expansion and increase commensal bacterial abundance after anti-TB treatment, which would help the recovery of TB patients.","output":"Gut Mycobiota Dysbiosis in Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients Undergoing Anti-Tuberculosis Treatment"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of pre-existing cardiovascular comorbidities, including hypertension and coronary heart disease, with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and mortality. METHODS: PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus were searched between January 1, 2020, and July 18, 2020, to identify eligible studies. Random-effect models were used to estimate the pooled event rates of pre-existing cardiovascular disease comorbidities and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of disease severity and mortality associated with the exposures of interest. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies involving 19,156 patients with COVID-19 infection met the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease in the included studies was 14.0%. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 patients was associated with severe outcomes (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 2.9 to 5.7) and mortality (OR, 6.1; 95% CI, 2.9 to 12.7).

Three inhalation flow rates, 30, 85, and 150 l min(?1), were tested. The filter penetration and the quality factor were determined. Between-respirator and within-respirator comparisons of penetration values were performed. At the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), >3% of MS2 virions penetrated through filters of both N99 models at an inhalation flow rate of 85 l min(?1). Inhalation airflow had a significant effect upon particle penetration through the tested respirator filters. The filter quality factor was found suitable for making relative performance comparisons. The MPPS for challenge aerosols was <0.1 m in electrical mobility diameter for all tested respirators. Mean particle penetration (by count) was significantly increased when the size fraction of <0.1 m was included as compared to particles >0.1 m. The filtration performance of the N95 respirator approached that of the two models of N99 over the range of particle sizes tested (0.02 to 0.5 m).

Using innovative approaches such as video conferencing can connect mentors with practitioners regardless of location. This study describes and evaluates the methods, outputs, and outcomes of a quality improvement program implemented in 12 public hospital laboratories in Cambodia between January 2018 and April 2019. The program used mixed intervention methods including both in-person and remote-access training and mentorship. METHODS: Training outputs were quantified from the activity reports of program trainers and mentors. Program outcomes were measured by pre- and postimplementation audits of laboratory quality management system conformity to international standards. Variations in improved outcomes were assessed in relation to the time spent by laboratory personnel in video conference training and mentoring activity. An additional cross-sectional comparison described the difference in final audit scores between participating and nonparticipating laboratories. RESULTS: Laboratories significantly improved their audit scores over the project period, showing significant improvement in all sections of the ISO 15189 standard. Pre- and postaudit score differences and laboratory personnel participation time in remote mentoring activities showed a strong monotonic relationship. Average input per laboratory was 6,0272,454 minutes of participation in video conference activities with mentors. Audit scores of participating laboratories were significantly higher than those of laboratories with no quality improvement program. CONCLUSION: Laboratories improved significantly in ISO 15189 conformity following structured laboratory quality management systems training supported by remote and on-site mentoring.

GUIDELINE 2: ACCESS AND FLUID DELIVERY FOR ACUTE PD IN ADULTS (2.1) Flexible peritoneal catheters should be used where resources and expertise exist (1B) (optimal).(2.2) Rigid catheters and improvised catheters using nasogastric tubes and other cavity drainage catheters may be used in resource-poor environments where they may still be life-saving (1C) (minimum standard).(2.3) We recommend catheters should be tunnelled to reduce peritonitis and peri-catheter leak (practice point).(2.4) We recommend that the method of catheter implantation should be based on patient factors and locally available skills (1C).(2.5) PD catheter implantation by appropriately trained nephrologists in patients without contraindications is safe and functional results equate to those inserted surgically (1B).(2.6) Nephrologists should receive training and be permitted to insert PD catheters to ensure timely dialysis in the emergency setting (practice point). (2.7) We recommend, when available, percutaneous catheter insertion by a nephrologist should include assessment with ultrasonography (2C).(2.8) Insertion of PD catheter should take place under complete aseptic conditions using sterile technique (practice point).(2.9) We recommend the use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to PD catheter implantation (1B).(2.10) A closed delivery system with a Y connection should be used (1A) (optimal). In resource poor areas, spiking of bags and makeshift connections may be necessary and can be considered (minimum standard).(2.11) The use of automated or manual PD exchanges are acceptable and this will be dependent on local availability and practices (practice point). GUIDELINE 3: PERITONEAL DIALYSIS SOLUTIONS FOR ACUTE PD (3.1) In patients who are critically ill, especially those with significant liver dysfunction and marked elevation of lactate levels, bicarbonate containing solutions should be used (1B) (optimal). Where these solutions are not available, the use of lactate containing solutions is an alternative (practice point) (minimum standard).(3.2) Commercially prepared solutions should be used (optimal). However, where resources do not permit this, then locally prepared fluids may be life-saving and with careful observation of sterile preparation procedure, peritonitis rates are not increased (1C) (minimum standard).(3.3) Once potassium levels in the serum fall below 4 mmol/L, potassium should be added to dialysate (using strict sterile technique to prevent infection) or alternatively oral or intravenous potassium should be given to maintain potassium levels at 4 mmol/L or above (1C).(3.4) Potassium levels should be measured daily (optimal). Where these facilities do not exist, we recommend that after 24 h of successful dialysis, one consider adding potassium chloride to achieve a concentration of 4 mmol/L in the dialysate (minimum standard) (practice point). GUIDELINE 4: PRESCRIBING AND ACHIEVING ADEQUATE CLEARANCE IN ACUTE PD (4.1) Targeting a weekly K t/V urea of 3.5 provides outcomes comparable to that of daily HD in critically ill patients; targeting higher doses does not improve outcomes (1B). This dose may not be necessary for most patients with AKI and targeting a weekly K t/V of 2.2 has been shown to be equivalent to higher doses (1B). Tidal automated PD (APD) using 25 L with 70% tidal volume per 24 h shows equivalent survival to continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration with an effluent dose of 23 mL/kg/h (1C).(4.2) Cycle times should be dictated by the clinical circumstances. Short cycle times (1-2 h) are likely to more rapidly correct uraemia, hyperkalaemia, fluid overload and/or metabolic acidosis; however, they may be increased to 4-6 hourly once the above are controlled to reduce costs and facilitate clearance of larger sized solutes (2C).(4.3) The concentration of dextrose should be increased and cycle time reduced to 2 hourly when fluid overload is evident. Once the patient is euvolemic, the dextrose concentration and cycle time should be adjusted to ensure a neutral fluid balance (1C).(4.4) Where resources permit, creatinine, urea, potassium and bicarbonate levels should be measured daily; 24 h K t/V urea and creatinine clearance measurement is recommended to assess adequacy when clinically indicated (practice point).(4.5) Interruption of dialysis should be considered once the patient is passing >1 L of urine/24 h and there is a spontaneous reduction in creatinine (practice point). The use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) to treat patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) has become more popular among clinicians following evidence of similar outcomes when compared with other extracorporeal therapies. Although it has been extensively used in low-resource environments for many years, there is now a renewed interest in the use of PD to manage patients with AKI (including patients in intensive care units) in higher income countries.

Method: Allied health practitioners (both qualified and student) and patients were recruited during the transition to telehealth across a large healthcare facility located on the Gold Coast, Australia. Participants were surveyed after each telehealth session rating their satisfaction and experience across four areas (technical, administrative and operational, privacy, communication). Descriptive statistics were used to express categorical variables and a chi-square test of independence was applied to determine the presence of any associations. Results: Surveys (n=197) were collected from allied health practitioners (n = 31) and their patients (n = 70). Overall, high levels of satisfaction and experience with telehealth among patients and a consensus in satisfaction and experience among exercise physiology, physiotherapy and psychology practitioners were reported.

Interoperability has been described as the ability for two or more systems or components to exchange information and use the information that has been exchanged. Given the importance of linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in the developing world, a suitable interoperability framework is required to provide an agreed approach to interoperability and specify common elements. Although eHealth interoperability frameworks exist in the literature, none meet all the requirements for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in developing countries. The aim of this paper was to describe the design and development of a conceptual framework for linking mHealth solutions to eRecord systems in Botswana, as an exemplar. METHODS: An iterative and reflective process was adopted, supported by existing literature and research including consultations with eHealth experts, and guidance from existing frameworks. These collectively identified key elements, concepts, and standards relevant and essential for framework design and development. RESULTS: The mHealth-eRecord Interoperability Framework (mHeRIF) was developed which highlights the need for: governance and regulation of mHealth and eRecord systems, a national health information exchange, and which interoperability levels to achieve. Each of these are supported by integral themes and concepts. It also addresses the need for regular review, accreditation, and alignment of framework concepts and themes with a National eHealth Strategy Interoperability Development Process. To demonstrate the frameworks applicability, a proposed architecture for the Kgonafalo mobile telemedicine programme is presented.

Population-based prevalence surveys demonstrate that the majority of individuals with culture-positive tuberculosis and corresponding radiographic abnormalities lack recognizable symptoms. Subclinical tuberculosis is often conceptualized as an early stage that generally progresses to recognizable active tuberculosis disease within months. However, many individuals with subclinical tuberculosis likely never develop recognizable symptoms, and consequently are never identified as having tuberculosis. A growing body of evidence indicates that, in high-burden settings, people with tuberculosis spend more time in a subclinical state than they spend with recognizable symptoms, and that people with subclinical tuberculosis may be infectious. As such, the subclinical period may represent a long window of potential Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. To appropriately prioritize interventions, there is a need to quantify the amount of transmission that occurs during the subclinical period, including the contribution of those who never develop clinically symptomatic disease. If individuals with subclinical tuberculosis are responsible for a large fraction of M. tuberculosis transmission, then ambitious reductions in tuberculosis incidence cannot be achieved without greater focus on early detection and treatment of subclinical tuberculosis. Novel diagnostic assays, population-based studies, and bioinformatic techniques could be used to better estimate the contribution of individuals with subclinical tuberculosis to overall transmission.

We saw that DNAm at these loci was associated with nearby gene expression and enriched for enhancer chromatin states in prenatal brain tissue. Additionally, these loci were enriched for genes associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and genes involved with neurogenesis. We also found autosomal differences in DNAm between the sexes during prenatal development, though these have less clear functional consequences.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primarily interacts with the cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 and other accessory proteins such as 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and CD147. Thus, altered receptor signals in aging and chronic disease play a role in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and are associated with a higher risk of deterioration in different organs. In this review, after a brief introduction to the link between aging and receptors for SARS-CoV-2, we focus on the risk of deterioration in different organs of COVID-19 patients considering aging as the main factor. We further discuss the structural and/or physiological changes in the immune system and organs (lung, heart, kidney, vessels, nerve system), as well as those associated with diabetes, in aging patients, and speculate on the most likely mechanisms underlying the deterioration of COVID-19 patients.","output":"Influence of aging on deterioration of patients with COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of telehealth for patient visits grew rapidly and served an important role as a valuable and necessary resource. Although clinical documentation is critical for telehealth patient visits, there is limited information about how healthcare facilities manage telehealth patient visit documentation, technology used for telehealth visits, and challenges encountered with telehealth patient visit documentation. This study aimed to assess the use of telehealth during the pandemic, the quality of clinical documentation in telehealth practice and to identify challenges and issues encountered with telehealth patient visits in order to develop a strategy for best practices for telehealth documentation and data management. Methods: Data were collected for this cross-sectional study in January-February 2021 via a self-designed survey of administrators/managers from physicians offices and mental health facilities. Survey questions included four categories: health organization demographic information;telehealth visits;clinical documentation for telehealth visit;and challenges and barriers related to telehealth documentation technology use. Results: Of 76 respondents, more than half (62%) of the healthcare facilities started using telehealth for patient visits within one year of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 94% of respondents indicating an increased use of telehealth for patient visits since the pandemic. The most common types of telehealth patient care provided during the pandemic included pediatrics, primary care, cardiology, and womens health. The most consistent data documentation of telehealth visits included: date of service, patient identification number, communication methods, patient informed consent, diagnosis and impression, evaluation results, and recommendations. The telehealth visit data was most commonly used for patient care and clinical practice, billing and reimbursement, quality improvement and patient satisfaction, and administrative planning. The top barriers to telehealth use by the healthcare professionals included patient challenges with telehealth services, such as inequities in quality of technology, lack of patient understanding, and lack of patient satisfaction;this was followed by frustration with constant updates of telehealth guidelines and procedures, understanding required telehealth documentation for reimbursement purposes, payer denial for telehealth visits, and legal and risk issues. Conclusions: Findings from this study can assist government entities, policymakers, and healthcare organizations in developing and advocating best practices in telehealth usage and clinical documentation improvement strategies. ? mHealth.

TSC acts via a novel mechanism of action, improving the diffusivity of oxygen in blood plasma. Thus, it is based on physical-chemical principles, unlike most drugs which are based on biochemistry-based mechanisms. We explored the use of escalating doses and multiple daily dosing of TSC as a potential therapeutic for patients suffering from hypoxemia due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. MethodsIndividuals []18 years who were hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hypoxemia, defined as SpO2 < 94% on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, WHO ordinal scale 3 through 7 (exclusive of Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation [ECMO]) were enrolled in cohorts of six subjects, each of whom received the same dose (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg) of TSC via intravenous bolus every 6 hours in addition to standard of care (SOC). This report describes the safety and efficacy results from the lead-in phase of the study and the population pharmacokinetics (PK) analyses. Safety was assessed as the number of serious adverse events and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) observed with each dose. Several efficacy parameters were examined in the lead-in phase and descriptive statistics of efficacy parameters are provided. No formal statistical analyses were performed. The population PK analyses were based on previous analyses and examination of the concentration profiles, and two-compartment linear pharmacokinetic models were evaluated and validated. Covariates, including body size, age, sex, organ function, and dose level, were evaluated for inclusion into the model. ResultsTSC was well tolerated. There were no treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported. There were 2 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported during the study, neither were considered treatment-related. A total of 24 (96%) subjects survived. One subject (4.0%) died during the study as a result of an SAE (respiratory failure), and that event was determined to be due to COVID-19 complications and not related to study drug. There was an observed reduction in the time to improvement in WHO Ordinal Scale with increasing dose. The median time to 1-point reduction in subjects receiving 0.25 mg/kg was 11.5 days versus 7.5 days in the 1.5 mg/kg treatment cohort. The overall range across all doses was 1 day to 28 days. A total of 36.0% of subjects had a 1-point improvement in WHO Ordinal Scale to Day 7. The 1.5 mg/kg dose resulted in observed superior outcomes for multiple secondary clinical outcomes: time to 1-point WHO Ordinal Score improvement through Day 29/discharge, 1-point improvement by Day 7, days to return to room air, and hospital length of stay. The PK results showed that the two-compartment model fit the data well. Clearance decreased with increasing dose level and there was no evidence that clearance was affected by covariates other than dose level. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that TSC administration every 6 hours at doses up to 1.5 mg/kg for up to 15 days is safe and well tolerated with predictable pharmacokinetics and demonstrated an observed clinical benefit in the treatment of COVID-19-related hypoxemia.

This Phase 2b trial prospectively investigated WST11-VTP for intermediate-risk cancers. METHODS: 50 men with unilateral Grade Group 2 (GG2) cancers (Gleason 3+4) evaluated with MRI and ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy were treated with up to 2 sessions of unilateral PGA using padeliporfin VTP. Eligibility criteria included <cT2b, PSA <10, and fusion biopsy for PIRADS 3+ lesions on pretreatment MRI. Contralateral very lowerisk disease was observed. MRI and systematic, 14-core TRUS biopsy (+/- fusion) were performed 3 and 12 months after treatment, evaluating for Gleason Grade 4 or 5 (GG2) cancer as the primary endpoint. Additional data included adverse events and patient-reported quality of life. The study was powered using =0.2 to reject the null hypothesis (r70%), using a one-sided exact binomial test with 5% alpha risk. To be valid, 44 evaluable patients were required by the 12-month primary endpoint. Treatment safety and patient-reported quality of life for sexual and urinary function were assessed with validated questionnaires (IIEF-15 and IPSS, respectively). RESULTS: 46 men were evaluable for the 12-month primary endpoint. Before 12 months, 1 man proceeded to prostatectomy (treatment failure), 2 men refused 12-month biopsy, and 1 man died of COVID-19. 12/49 (24%) underwent per-protocol second hemiablation treatment for GG2 tumor at 3 months: 9 for residual cancer and 4 with newly identified contralateral GG2 tumors (1 bilateral). 45 of the 46 evaluable men underwent 12-month biopsy: 38 (83%) had no Gleason grade 4 or 5 cancer, including 11/12 (92%) patients receiving 2 treatments. By 3 months, median decline in IIEF-5 score from baseline was -1.0 (IQR -7,0). Median improvement in IPSS score was -1.0 (IQR -1,5), with pad-free continence observed in 100% of patients. Median change in IIEF score by 12-months was -1.0 (IQR -5,0). Grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 6 (12%) patients;all procedure-related prostate/pelvic pain resolved by 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These positive trial results show that WST11- VTP is effective for PGA of intermediate-risk prostate cancer with minimal toxicity including impact on urinary and sexual function, consistent with the Phase 3 trial results in low-risk disease. Based on these data this therapy bears consideration for approval as a conservative therapeutic option for selected cases of intermediate risk disease.","output":"Results of the PCM-204 phase 2b trial of partial-gland ablation for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer with padeliporfin (WST11 or TOOKAD) vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION Orthopedic implant-associated infections are difficult to treat, both physically and psychologically, for the patient and the surgeon as well. Organisms capable of forming biofilms tend to be more virulent and have ability of causing chronic infections. Chronic implant associated infections are very difficult to treat, requires a lot of time, money and other resources. Chronic infections produce a lot of morbidity and sometimes mortality to the patient. CASE REPORT A 40-year-old male treated for bilateral acetabular fracture sustained after fall from height due to an episode of seizure. After acetabular surgery, he developed surgical site infection unresponsive to wound wash and intravenous antibiotics. After two weeks, we started treatment with Qurion solution and Vacuum assisted suction (QiVAS) to which patient responded very well and his infection was cured. We are not aware of any study or case report using QiVAS therapy for treatment of infection associated with orthopaedic implant. CONCLUSION Orthopaedic implant related infection can be difficult to treat especially if caused by multidrug resistant organisms capable of forming biofilm. QiVAS therapy is a new method which can be used in such difficult situations to treat infection without removal of implant within short period of time thus reducing morbidity for patients.","output":"Qivas Therapy for Treatment of Implant Associated MDR Bacterial Infection."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: To compare the performance and interobserver agreement of the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS), the COVID-19 imaging reporting and data system (COVID-RADS), the RSNA expert consensus statement, and the British Society of Thoracic Imaging (BSTI) guidance statement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this case-control study, total of 100 symptomatic patients suspected of having COVID-19 were included: 50 patients with COVID-19 (5917 years, 38 men) and 50 patients without COVID-19 (6524 years, 30 men). Eight radiologists independently scored chest CT images of the cohort according to each reporting system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and interobserver agreements were calculated and statistically compared across the systems. RESULTS: A total of 800 observations were made for each system. The level of suspicion of COVID-19 correlated with the RT-PCR positive rate except for the negative for pneumonia classifications in all the systems (Spearmans coefficient: =1.0, P=<.001 for all the systems).

The aim of this trial was to assess if the addition of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir improved clinical outcomes in patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. METHODS: This was an open-label, multicentre, randomized controlled clinical trial in adults with moderate or severe COVID-19 admitted to four university hospitals in Iran. Patients were randomized into a treatment arm receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir plus standard care, or a control arm receiving standard care alone. The primary endpoint was clinical recovery within 14 days of treatment. The study is registered with IRCT.ir under registration number IRCT20200128046294N2. RESULTS: Between 26 March and 26 April 2020, 66 patients were recruited and allocated to either the treatment arm (n = 33) or the control arm (n = 33). Clinical recovery within 14 days was achieved by 29/33 (88%) in the treatment arm and 22/33 (67%) in the control arm (P = 0.076). The treatment arm had a significantly shorter median duration of hospitalization [6 days (IQR 4C8)] than the control group [8 days (IQR 5C13)]; P = 0.029.

Excessive alcohol consumption and \\"comfort eating\\" as coping mechanisms during times of high stress have been shown to further exacerbate mental and physical ill-health. Global examples suggest that unhealthy food and alcohol brands and companies are using the COVID-19 pandemic to further market their products. However, there has been no systematic, in-depth analysis of how \\"Big Food\\" and \\"Big Alcohol\\" are capitalizing on the COVID-19 pandemic to market their products and brands. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to quantify the extent and nature of online marketing by alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage companies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: We conducted a content analysis of all COVID-19-related social media posts made by leading alcohol and unhealthy food and beverage brands (n=42) and their parent companies (n=12) over a 4-month period (February to May 2020) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. RESULTS: Nearly 80% of included brands and all parent companies posted content related to COVID-19 during the 4-month period. Quick service restaurants (QSRs), food and alcohol delivery companies, alcohol brands, and bottle shops were the most active in posting COVID-19-related content. The most common themes for COVID-19-related marketing were isolation activities and community support. Promotion of hygiene and home delivery was also common, particularly for QSRs and alcohol and food delivery companies. Parent companies were more likely to post about corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, such as donations of money and products, and to offer health advice. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to show that Big Food and Big Alcohol are incessantly marketing their products and brands on social media platforms using themes related to COVID-19, such as isolation activities and community support. Parent companies are frequently posting about CSR initiatives, such as donations of money and products, thereby creating a fertile environment to loosen current regulation or resist further industry regulation. \\"COVID-washing\\" by large alcohol brands, food and beverage brands, and their parent companies is both common and concerning.

The basic elements of a healthcare system designed according to principles derived from Antonovskys salutogenic model of health are then presented.

In the vast majority of cases, cutaneous symptoms precede musculoskeletal complaints. Progression from psoriasis to PsA is characterized by subclinical synovio-entheseal inflammation and often non-specific musculoskeletal symptoms that are frequently unreported or overlooked. With the development of increasingly effective therapies and a broad drug armamentarium, prevention of arthritis development through careful clinical monitoring has become priority. Identifying high-risk psoriasis patients before PsA onset would ensure early diagnosis, increased treatment efficacy, and ultimately better outcomes; ideally, PsA development could even be averted. However, the current model of care for PsA offers only limited possibilities of early intervention. This is attributable to the large pool of patients to be monitored and the limited resources of the health care system in comparison. The use of digital technologies for health (eHealth) could help close this gap in care by enabling faster, more targeted and more streamlined access to rheumatological care for patients with psoriasis. eHealth solutions particularly include telemedicine, mobile technologies, and symptom checkers. Telemedicine enables rheumatological visits and consultations at a distance while mobile technologies can improve monitoring by allowing patients to self-report symptoms and disease-related parameters continuously. Symptom checkers have the potential to direct patients to medical attention at an earlier point of their disease and therefore minimizing diagnostic delay.

Methods A convergent mixed methods design was employed, using both quantitative and qualitative data collected successively through Phase 1: Online teaching follow-up program;Phase 2: Discussion groups (two focus groups and a nominal group with students and faculty, respectively) and a survey of students from first to fifth year;and Phase 3: Triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data. Results Thirteen strongly interconnected categories were identified. Four of them played an organizational role: course planning, coordination, communication, and pedagogical coherence. The remaining nine categories were learning outcomes, teaching methodology, online resources, evaluation, time management, workload, student motivation, participation, and teacher-student relationship. Among the key aspects of learning were those that promoted rapport between faculty and students, such as synchronous sessions, especially those based on clinical cases.

In this sense, the establishment of culture environment, as oocyte incubation time, is essential for the success of the IVM. Therefore, the study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the meiotic potential and the IVM times of collared peccary oocytes, wild mammals of great commercial and ecological interest. Thus, ovaries were collected of females derived from captivity and transported to the laboratory within 1 hour of slaughtering. The oocytes derived from follicles (3-6mm in diameter) were recovered by aspirated and sliced. Good quality oocytes (evenly granulated cytoplasm with a least one layer of surrounding cumulus cells) were selected and subjected to culture in TCM 199 supplemented with 10g/mL FSH, 10% FBS and 100M cysteamine at 38.5C, 5% CO2 and maximum humidity for 24 or 48 hours. After the incubation period, the nuclear status, the presence of first polar body and the expansion of cumulus cells of oocytes were assessed. The data obtained were analyzed by Fisher exact test (P<0.05). A total of four sessions (2-3 females per session) were performed, resulting in eighteen aspirated and sliced ovaries with normal morphological characteristics. An oocyte recovery rate of about 83.1% (59/71) was obtained with 3.3 oocytes/ovary and 2.3 viable oocytes/ovary.

Penulis melihat pola respon yang terjadi cenderung reaktif daripada antisipatif. Walaupun berbagai langkah strategis sudah dilakukan hingga akhir Juni 2020 Spanyol gagal membendung kurva sehingga menjadi salah satu negara Eropa terburuk dengan total lebih dari 240.000 kasus. Penulis berargumen faktor kontributornya adalah adanya lacking climate atau iklim serba kekurangan di berbagai aspek sehingga menyebabkan Spanyol menjadi episentrum virus. Kekurangan dapat dilihat secara empiris pada aspek manajemen politis yang asimetris antara pemerintah pusat dengan pemerintah lokal di tujuh belas komunitas otonom;aspek teknologi pengumpulan data yang paradoks;aspek pelayanan kesehatan yang bermasalah;hingga aspek organisasional di tataran Uni Eropa yang mengaburkan fokus Spanyol untuk seharusnya membenahi keadaan nasionalnya terlebih dahulu.

Kata kunci: Spanyol pandemi COVID-19 state of alarm normalitas baru This paper discusses how Spain has responded to the COVID-19 outbreaks. The focus of discussion began when virus emergences which prompted the government to issue policies with four main focus: (1) general confinement or efforts to prohibit people from leaving the house;(2) cessation of some economic activities;(3) provision of health resources;and (4) preparation of advanced mitigation policies. The author sees that the response pattern tends to be reactive rather than anticipatory. Although various strategic steps have been taken Spain failed to stem the curve until the end of June 2020. Therefore, it became one of the worst European countries with more than 240.000 cases. The author argues that the contributing factor is lacking climate in various aspects causing Spain to become the epicenter of the virus. The shortcomings can be seen empirically in the asymmetric characteristics of political management between the central government and local government in seventeen autonomous communities;paradoxical aspects of data collection technology;problematic aspects of health services;to the organizational part at the level of the European Union which obscures the focus of Spain on what should first fix its national situation. This paper proves that coordination is very crucial for Spain in facing the global health crisis COVID-19.

An effective post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) strategy may limit the spread of infection; however, there is no consensus regarding PEP for MERS-CoV infection. In this study, we assessed (1) the efficacy of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir as PEP for HCWs exposed to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia, and (2) safety of the PEP regimen. METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled 43 HCWs with high-risk exposure to MERS-CoV from 5 hospitals affected during this outbreak in South Korea. The rate of MERS-CoV infection was compared between 22 workers at 1 hospital who received PEP consisting of oral ribavirin and lopinavir/ritonavir after exposure to patients with severe MERS-CoV pre-isolation pneumonia and 21 workers at other hospitals who did not receive PEP. RESULTS: Six workers (14%) developed MERS-CoV infection; all of these subjects belonged to the non-PEP group. The attack rate was lower in the PEP group compared with the non-PEP group (0% vs. 28.6%; Odds ratio = 0.405, 95% confidence interval = 0.274C0.599; P = 0.009). The most commonly reported side effects of PEP therapy were nausea and diarrhea, but there were no severe adverse effects associated with PEP therapy.

The former is associated with Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) severity. We aimed to investigate whether an association also exists for EAT. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively measured EAT volume using computed tomography (CT) scans (semi-automatic software) of inpatients with COVID-19 and analyzed the correlation between EAT volume and anthropometric characteristics and comorbidities. We then analyzed the clinicobiological and radiological parameters associated with severe COVID-19 (O2 [Formula: see text] 6 l/min), intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death, and 25% or more CT lung involvement, which are three key indicators of COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: We included 100 consecutive patients; 63% were men, mean age was 61.8  16.2 years, 47% were obese, 54% had hypertension, 42% diabetes, and 17.2% a cardiovascular event history. Severe COVID-19 (n = 35, 35%) was associated with EAT volume (132  62 vs 104  40 cm(3), p = 0.02), age, ferritinemia, and 25% or more CT lung involvement.

Furthermore, B. mallei is genetically related to B. pseudomallei, which is the causative agent of melioidosis. Both facultative intracellular bacteria are classified as tier 1 select biothreat agents. Our previous study with a B. mallei tonB hcp1 (CLH001) live-attenuated vaccine demonstrated that it is attenuated, safe and protective against B. mallei wild-type strains in the susceptible BALB/c mouse model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING In our current work, we evaluated the protective efficacy of CLH001 against glanders and melioidosis in the more disease-resistant C57BL/6 mouse strain. The humoral as well as cellular immune responses were also examined. We found that CLH001-immunized mice showed 100% survival against intranasal and aerosol challenge with B. mallei ATCC 23344. Moreover, this vaccine also afforded significant cross-protection against B. pseudomallei K96243, with low level bacterial burden detected in organs. Immunization with a prime and boost regimen of CLH001 induced significantly greater levels of total and subclasses of IgG, and generated antigen-specific splenocyte production of IFN- and IL-17A. Interestingly, protection induced by CLH001 is primarily dependent on humoral immunity, while CD4+ and CD8+ T cells played a less critical protective role. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Our data indicate that CLH001 serves as an effective live attenuated vaccine to prevent glanders and melioidosis. The quantity and quality of antibody responses as well as improving cell-mediated immune responses following vaccination need to be further investigated prior to advancement to preclinical studies.","output":"Evaluation of Burkholderia mallei tonB hcp1 (CLH001) as a live attenuated vaccine in murine models of glanders and melioidosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Late dysphagia that develops or persists years after head and neck cancer (HNC) is a disabling survivorship issue. Fibrosis is thought to stiffen connective tissues and compress peripheral nerve tracts, thereby contributing to diminished strength, flexibility, and in some cases denervation of swallowing muscles. Manual therapy (MT) is used in cancer survivors for pain and other indications, but it is unknown if increasing blood flow, flexibility and cervical range of motion (CROM) in the head and neck may improve late dysphagia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Manual Therapy for Fibrosis-Related Late Effect Dysphagia (MANTLE) is a National Cancer Institute-funded prospective single-arm pilot trial evaluating the feasibility, safety and therapeutic potential of MT in patients with late dysphagia after radiotherapy (RT) for HNC. Disease-free survivors 2 years after curative-intent RT for HNC with at least moderate dysphagia and grade 2 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 fibrosis are eligible. The target sample size is 24 participants who begin the MANTLE programme. MANTLE is delivered in 10 MT sessions over 6 weeks with an accompanying home exercise programme (HEP). Patients then transition to a 6-week post-washout period during which they complete the HEP and then return for a final post-washout evaluation. Feasibility (primary endpoint) and safety will be examined. Serial assessments include CROM, modified barium swallow studies, quantitative MRI, electromyography (optional) and patient-reported outcomes as secondary, tertiary and exploratory endpoints.

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the SusceptibleCExposedCInfectiousCRecovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228  0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28  0.13.

Wuhan, Hubei Province, is the origin and core location of the epidemic. Neurosurgeons were faced with the challenge of balancing treatment of patients with life-threatening conditions and preventing the cross-transmission of the virus. Methods: A series of infection prevention and control strategies was adopted for the peri-operative period of emergency surgeries in our department. These strategies include protective measures for the emergency department (ED) and measures for the peri-operative period of emergency surgery. The propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match COVID-19-related patients with patients before the epidemic. Length of wait time in the ED and duration of operation were compared. Results: From January 23, 2020 to March 18, 2020, we performed emergency surgery for 19 patients who were either COVID-19-related or COVID-19-suspected. None of the medical staff involved in the surgeries developed viral infection, and no peri-operative virus transmission occurred in our hospital. After the PSM, 32 patients were included in the epidemic group and the pre-epidemic group (16 patients in each group). The duration of wait time in the ED of the former group was longer than that of the latter group (z = -3.000; p = 0.003). During the epidemic, the duration of a craniotomy was longer than before the epidemic (z = -2.253; p = 0.024), and there was no difference in the duration of interventional surgery (z = -0.314; p = 0.753). Conclusion: We believe that our experience can provide a useful reference for other surgeons facing the same challenges and as a lesson for similar infectious diseases that may occur in the future.","output":"Infection Prevention and Control Strategies for the Peri-Operative Period of Emergency Surgery during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in a Neurosurgery Department in Wuhan, China."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We screened three separate cohorts of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 via nasopharyngeal swab PCR.

It also presents the results of the analysis of monthly forecasting of the values of C, D and I. As earlier, the information was regularly sent to the National Center for Disease Control & Public Health of Georgia and posted on the Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/Avtandil1948/. The analysis of data is carried out with the use of the standard statistical analysis methods of random events and methods of mathematical statistics for the non-accidental time-series of observations. In particular, the following results were obtained. Georgia's ranking in the world for Covid-19 monthly mean values of infection and deaths cases in investigation period (per 1 million population) was determined. Among 157 countries with population [] 1 million inhabitants in February 2022 Georgia was in the 4 place on new infection cases, in the 2 place on death. Georgia took the best place in terms of confirmed cases of diseases (thirty fifth) and in mortality (tenth) - in March. A comparison between the daily mortality from Covid-19 in Georgia from January 01, 2022 to March 31, 2022 with the average daily mortality rate in 2015-2019 shows, that the largest share value of D from mean death in 2015-2019 was 43.1 % (January 04, 2022), the smallest 2.12 % (March 23, 2022). As in previous works [10-13] the statistical analysis of the daily and decade data associated with coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic of confirmed, recovered, deaths cases and infection rate of the population of Georgia are carried out. Maximum daily values of investigation parameters are following: C = 26320 (February 2, 2022), R = 48486 (February 12, 2022), D = 67 (January 4,2022), I = 41.58 % (February 14, 2022). Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: C = 22214 (1 Decade of February 2022), R = 23408 (2 Decade of February 2022), D = 45 (2 Decade of February 2022), I = 32.12% (1 Decade of February 2022). It was found that as in spring, summer and from September to December 2021 [10,11,13], in investigation period of time the regression equations for the time variability of the daily values of C, R, D and I have the form of a tenth order polynomial. Mean values of speed of change of confirmed -V(C), recovered - V(R), deaths - V(D) and infection rate V(I) coronavirus-related cases in different decades of months for the indicated period of time were determined. Maximum mean decade values of investigation parameters are following: V(C) = +1079 cases/day (3 Decade of January 2022), V(R) = +1139 cases/day (1 Decade of February 2022), V(D) = +0.8 cases/day (1 Decade of February 2022), V(I) = + 1.16 %/ day (3 decades of January 2022). Cross-correlations analysis between confirmed COVID-19 cases with recovered and deaths cases shows, that from January 1, 2022 to March 31, 2022 the maximum effect of recovery is observed on 3-6 days after infection (CR=0.83-0.84), and deaths - after 2 and 4 days (CR=0.60).

It is unknown whether ethanol-induced alterations in nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) cholinergic projections to the BLA mediate anxiety-related behaviors through direct modulation of GABA and glutamate afferents. Following 10 days of CIE exposure and 24 hours of withdrawal, we recorded GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic responses in BLA pyramidal neurons with electrophysiology, assessed total protein expression of cholinergic markers, and quantified acetylcholine and choline concentrations using a colorimetric assay. We measured  7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) dependent modulation of presynaptic function at distinct inputs in AIR- and CIE-exposed BLA coronal slices as a functional read-out of cholinergic neurotransmission. CIE/withdrawal upregulates the endogenous activity of  7 nAChRs, facilitating release at both GABAergic' local' interneuron and glutamatergic synaptic responses to stria terminalis (ST) stimulation, with no effect at GABAergic lateral paracapsular cells. CIE caused a three-fold increase in BLA acetylcholine concentration, with no changes in  7 nAChR or cholinergic marker expression. These data illustrate that  7 nAChR-dependent changes in presynaptic function serve as a proxy for CIE-dependent alterations in synaptic acetylcholine levels.

It is widely used in topic discovery, information retrieval, and document modeling. In recent years, with the advancement of research about neural networks, topic models using neural networks, such as NVLDA and ProdLDA, have been presented. Since it is easy to use accelerators such as GPUs for training these, topic modeling for large corpora can be done efficiently. Topic models are also used for short texts such as social networking sites and product reviews, where the number of words in a document is often short. This means that the co-occurrence information of words is also extremely less, and it is difficult to infer latent topics for easy understanding by humans when training with only the target corpus. In this paper, we investigated whether trained word embedding vectors on other large corpora such as Wikipedia compensate for the lack of word information in short texts. While previous studies have been conducted on long texts such as newspaper articles, we specifically checked the effect on short texts.

These interactions develop from the coevolution of pathogen and host and often lead to a species specificity of the virus that can make interspecies transmissions difficult. Nevertheless, viruses do sporadically cross species barriers into other host populations, including humans. In zoonotic infections, many of these interspecies transfer events are dead end, where transmission is confined only to the animal-to-human route but sometimes viruses adapt to enable spread from human to human. A pathogen must overcome many hurdles to replicate successfully in a foreign host. The viral pathogen must enter the host cell, replicate with the assistance of host factors, evade inhibitory host products, exit the first cell and move on to the next, and possibly leave the initial host and transmit to another. Each of these stages may require adaptive changes in the pathogen. Although the factors that influence each stage of the replication and transmission of most agents have not been resolved, the genomics of both hosts and pathogens are now at hand and we have begun to understand some of the molecular changes that enable some viruses to adapt to a new host.","output":"Molecular constraints to interspecies transmission of viral pathogens"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We present a structure-based model of phosphorylation-dependent binding and sequestration of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the impact of two consecutive amino acid changes R203K and G204R.

Furthermore, it is necessary not only to introduce but also to secure the applied surgical material and expand it from the original surgical site. To address these challenges, we developed a novel procedure for introducing such surgical materials into a corporeal cavity using a 5-mm trocar and a self-expanding origami structure, called the \\"chevron pleats procedure (CPP)\\". METHODS We used CPP in 114 cases of laparoscopic surgery for gastrointestinal diseases. The chevron folding pattern is an excellent origami structure and compactly folds a large sheet of material for use with a slim trocar. Surgical materials were folded using a chevron pleats pattern and inserted into a novel, slim, long syringe-type device, which was made from a specially ordered precision polypropylene tube, for introduction into a corporeal cavity. When the surgical material was used, the end of the device was placed above the surgical site and the inner rod was pushed. The surgical material was securely injected and expanded over the surgical site. RESULTS Surgical materials were introduced smoothly and securely using a 5-mm trocar to a site of intraoperative bleeding, the incisional surface of the liver, and defects of the abdominal wall or peritoneum. Efficient hemostasis was attained, the introduction and expansion of surgical mesh was made simpler, and the covering of defects of the peritoneum with adhesion barrier membranes, which is typically difficult during laparoscopic surgery, was easily performed. CONCLUSIONS CPP is a basic utility procedure for introducing several sheet-type surgical materials into a corporeal cavity with a 5-mm trocar and might help ensure efficient and safe laparoscopic surgery.","output":"A novel procedure for introducing large sheet-type surgical material with a self-expanding origami structure using a slim trocar (chevron pleats procedure)."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This is a statement by the European Criminal Bar Association on the use of Video-Conferencing in Criminal Cases in a Post-Covid-19 World It addresses the topic using a two-fold distinction between the use of remote hearings in domestic and in cross-border cases, on one hand, and the use of such of remote technology for conducting interviews of the suspect or accused in the pre-trial stages or at trial hearings, on the other hand Recognising that these distinctive settings impact differently upon the seriousness of the interference with the fair trial rights and the rights of defence of the suspect or accused, and also upon the circumstances that must be weighed in order to assess whether restrictions are proportionate, adequate and necessary, the European Criminal Bar Association assesses whether the use of remote technologies in those different settings is acceptable and outlines proposals for further action in the field","output":"European Criminal Bar Association statement of principles on the use of video-conferencing in criminal cases in a Post-Covid-19 World"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\\\\19) outbreak, the nosocomial infection rate worldwide has been reported high.

METHODS AND RESULTS: COVID-19 patients at seven institutions receiving HCQ therapy from whom a baseline and at least one ECG at 48+ h were available were enrolled in the study. QT/QTc prolongation, QT-associated and QT-independent arrhythmic events, arrhythmic mortality, and overall mortality during HCQ therapy were assessed. A total of 649 COVID-19 patients (61.9  18.7 years, 46.1% males) were enrolled. HCQ therapy was administrated as a home therapy regimen in 126 (19.4%) patients, and as an in-hospital-treatment to 495 (76.3%) hospitalized and 28 (4.3%) intensive care unit (ICU) patients. At 36-72 and at 96+ h after the first HCQ dose, 358 and 404 ECGs were obtained, respectively. A significant QT/QTc interval prolongation was observed (P < 0.001), but the magnitude of the increase was modest [+13 (9-16) ms]. Baseline QT/QTc length and presence of fever (P = 0.001) at admission represented the most important determinants of QT/QTc prolongation. No arrhythmic-related deaths were reported. The overall major ventricular arrhythmia rate was low (1.1%), with all events found not to be related to QT or HCQ therapy at a centralized event evaluation. No differences in QT/QTc prolongation and QT-related arrhythmias were observed across different clinical settings, with non-QT-related arrhythmias being more common in the intensive care setting. CONCLUSION: HCQ administration is safe for a short-term treatment for patients with COVID-19 infection regardless of the clinical setting of delivery, causing only modest QTc prolongation and no directly attributable arrhythmic deaths.","output":"Arrhythmic safety of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients from different clinical settings"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Mechanosensitive vagal afferents in the lung, rapidly and slowly adapting receptors (RARs and SARs, respectively), play an important role in eliciting the reflexes that regulate the normal airway function. A profound bronchoconstrictive effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has been extensively reported in various animal species, but its influence on the SAR and RAR activity is not known. This study investigated the effect of 5-HT on these receptors, and the possible mechanisms involved. Single-fiber activities of these afferents were measured in anesthetized, open-chest, and mechanically ventilated rats. Our results showed that intravenous injection of 5-HT evoked a consistent and pronounced stimulation of phasic RARs. In contrast, 5-HT generated an inconsistent and paradoxical action on SARs: no effect in 29% (5 of 17) of the SARs; stimulation in 35% (6 of 17); and inhibition in the remainder. These responses of both RARs and SARs to 5-HT were reproducible and dose-dependent. After the injection of a high dose of 5-HT (16 g/kg), the receptor responses slowly reached a peak (after a??8 s) and returned toward the baseline in a??20 s, accompanied by a consistent increase in total pulmonary resistance and a decrease in dynamic lung compliance in a temporal pattern very similar to the increased receptor activity. When these changes in lung mechanics induced by 5-HT were prevented by pretreatment with salbutamol, a ?2 adrenergic receptor agonist, the delayed responses of both RARs and SARs to 5-HT were also abolished, except that the immediate stimulatory effect on a subset of RARs, the silent RARs, was not affected.

Most patients with COVID-19 were mild. Severe patients progressed rapidly to critical condition including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure and even death. This study aims to find early multi-organ injury indicators and blood glucose for predicting mortality of COVID-19. METHODS: Fasting blood glucose (FBG) 7.0 mmol/L for two times during hospitalization and without a history of diabetes were defined as new-onset COVID-19-related diabetes (CRD). Indicators of injuries for multiple organs, including the lung, heart, kidney and liver, and glucose homeostasis were specifically analyzed for predicting death. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients with a severity equal to or greater than Moderate were hospitalized. After excluding patients with history of diabetes, chronic heart, kidney, and liver disease, 69 patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 69 patients, 23 were Moderate, 20 were Severe, and 26 were Critical (including 16 deceased patients). Univariable analysis indicated that CRD, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBDH), creatine kinase (CK) and creatinine (Cr) were associated with death. Multivariable analysis indicated that CRD was an independent predictor for death (HR = 3.75, 95% CI 1.26C11.15). Abnormal glucose homeostasis or CRD occurred earlier than other indicators for predicting poor outcomes. Indicators of multiple organ injury were in parallel with the expression patterns of ACE2 (the SARS-CoV-2 receptor) in different organs including pancreatic islet. CONCLUSIONS: New-onset COVID-19-related diabetes is an early indicator of multi-organ injury and predictor for poor outcomes and death in COVID-19 patients.

METHODS: This work will include cross-sectional studies published between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2017, without any language restriction, on populations residing in African countries. We will consider studies that reported the prevalence of respiratory viruses in people with ARTI confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction technique. We will be searching PubMed, Embase, African Journals Online, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. The selection of relevant studies, extraction of data, and evaluation of the quality of the articles will be carried out independently by two review authors, and the discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or intervention of a third author. The heterogeneity of the studies will be assessed using the (2) test on Cochranes Q statistic. Publication bias will be assessed by the Egger test. Studies will be pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis model. Results will be presented by age group and sub-region of Africa. Using meta-regression models, we will identify factors associated with viral infections in people with ARTI.

Galectin-3 is known to play a key role in the inflammation and fibrosis process. We aimed to evaluate the predictive role of galectin-3 levels for pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. Materials and methods: Total of 176 patients with COVID-19, confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, admitted to the Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital was analyzed. The study was designed as a cross sectional. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including galectin-3 were collected at the time of diagnosis. CT images evaluated by a single radiologist according to the recommendation of the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Document for pulmonary involvement. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was assessed using the total severity score. Results: The mean galectin-3 level in patients with typical pneumonia was found to be significantly higher than those patients with atypical (p < 0.01) and indeterminate appearance (p < 0.01) and patients without pneumonia (p < 0.01). The severity of lung involvement was significantly associated with Galectin-3 levels (p < 0.01 r: 0.76). Stepwise logistic regression model showed that the levels of ferritin (odds ratio [OR] = 0.05, p: 0.08) and galectin-3 (OR = 0.1, p < 0.01) were significantly and independently associated with typical pneumoniain COVID-19 patients. When COVID-19 patients were evaluated in terms of typical pneumonia, we determined a cut-off value of 18.9 ng/mL for galectin-3 via ROC analysis (87% sensitivity; 73% specificity; area under curve (AUC): 0.89; p < 0.001).

The outbreak prediction and making cautious steps is the only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based machine learning technique to predict the possible outbreak in India. The proposed ANFIS-based prediction system tracks the growth of epidemic based on the previous data sets fetched from cloud computing. The proposed ANFIS technique predicts the epidemic peak and COVID-19 infected cases through the cloud data sets. The ANFIS is chosen for this study as it has both numerical and linguistic knowledge, and also has ability to classify data and identify patterns. The proposed technique not only predicts the outbreak but also tracks the disease and suggests a measurable policy to manage the COVID-19 epidemic. The obtained prediction shows that the proposed technique very effectively tracks the growth of the COVID-19 epidemic. The result shows the growth of infection rate decreases at end of 2020 and also has delay epidemic peak by 40C60 days. The prediction result using the proposed ANFIS technique shows a low Mean Square Error (MSE) of 1.184  10(C3) with an accuracy of 86%.

METHOD: We conducted a retrospective direct medical care cost analysis of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission after obtaining the Institutional Ethics Committee approval. Data were obtained from the records of patients admitted to the COVID-19 ICU of a tertiary care trust teaching hospital from June 2020 to December 2020. Direct costs were analyzed and correlated with various demographic variables and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 176 patients were included (males76%). The median direct medical cost for a median stay of 13 days was INR 202248.5 ($ 2742.91). Hospital drugs and disposables accounted for 20% of the total cost followed by bed charges (19%), equipment charges (17%), biosafety protective gear (15.5%), pathological and radiological tests (15%), clinical management (7.6%), and biomedical waste management (1.6%). Government schemes accounted for 79% of medical claims followed by directly paying patients (12.5%) and private insurance (8.5%). The cost was significantly higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and sepsis and in those requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) (p <0.05). Shorter lead time to hospital admission and lesser length of hospital stay were associated with significant lower direct cost. CONCLUSION: Direct medical care cost is substantial for COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission. This cost is significantly associated with increased ICU and hospital stay, longer lead time to admission, diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and those who need high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), and MV.

A biological mesh might be considered, but little is known about long-term results. Both biological and synthetic meshes were investigated in an experimental model of peritonitis to assess their characteristics in vivo. METHODS Male Wistar rats were randomized into five groups and peritonitis was induced. A mesh was implanted after 24 h. Five meshes were investigated: Permacol? (cross-linked collagen), Strattice? (non-cross-linked collagen), XCM Biologic? (non-cross-linked collagen), Omyra? Mesh (condensed polytetrafluoroethylene) and Parietene? (polypropylene). The rats were killed after either 30, 90 or 180 days. Incorporation and shrinkage of the mesh, adhesion coverage, strength of adhesions and histology were analysed. RESULTS Of 135 rats randomized, 18 died from peritonitis. Some 180 days after implantation, both XCM Biologic? and Permacol? had significantly better incorporation than Strattice? (P = 0003 and P = 0009 respectively). Strattice? had significantly fewer adhesions than XCM Biologic? (P = 0001) and Permacol? (P = 0020). Thirty days after implantation, Permacol? had significantly stronger adhesions than Strattice? (P < 0001). Shrinkage was most prominent in XCM Biologic? , but no significant difference was found compared with the other meshes. Histological analysis revealed marked differences in foreign body response among all meshes. CONCLUSION This experimental study suggested that XCM Biologic? was superior in terms of incorporation, macroscopic mesh infection, and histological parameters such as collagen deposition and neovascularization. There must be sufficient overlap of mesh during placement, as XCM Biologic? showed a high rate of shrinkage. Surgical relevance The use of synthetic mesh to repair a potentially contaminated incisional hernia is not supported unequivocally, and may lead to a higher failure rate. A biological mesh might be considered as an alternative. There are few long-term studies, as these meshes are expensive and rarely used. This study evaluated the use of biological mesh in a contaminated environment, and investigated whether there is an ideal mesh. A new non-cross-linked biological mesh (XCM Biologic? ) was evaluated in this experiment. The new non-cross-linked biological mesh XCM Biologic? performed best and may be useful in patients with a potentially contaminated incisional hernia.","output":"Characteristics of different mesh types for abdominal wall repair in an experimental model of peritonitis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"P187 Figure 1Showing the post Tocilizumab alert card[Figure omitted.

Relevant information was identified through a comprehensive literature search using Medline, PubMed and CINAHL Complete and using the search terms Ebola, Ebola virus disease, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, West Africa outbreak, Ebola transmission, Ebola symptoms and signs, Ebola diagnosis, Ebola treatment, vaccines for Ebola and clinical trials on Ebola. Through 22 July 2015, a total of 27,741 EVD cases and 11,284 deaths were reported from all affected countries. Several therapeutic agents and novel vaccines for EVD have been developed and are now undergoing evaluation. Concurrent with active case investigation, contact tracing, surveillance and supportive care to patients and communities, there has been rapid progress in the development of new therapies and vaccines against EVD. Continued focus on strengthening clinical and public health infrastructure will have direct benefits in controlling the spread of EVD and will provide a strong foundation for deployment of new drugs and vaccines to affected countries when they become available.

Bei bestimmten Infektionskrankheiten sind die klinischen Symptome und Organver?nderungen nicht auf die direkte Wirkung des Infektionserregers zurckzufhren.

In zahlreichen Beobachtungen an Spontankrankheiten sowie in tier\\\\experimentellen Untersuchungen konnte gekl?rt werden, welche Faktoren fr die Entstehung, biologische Wirkung, Elimination und Lokalisation von Immunkomplexen im Gewebe ma?gebend sind. Die wichtigsten, die Pathogenit?t von Immunkomplexen bestimmenden Faktoren sind die Art des Antigens, Klasse und Subklasse des Immunglobulins, das molare Verh?ltnis zwischen Antigen und Antik?rper, die Produktionsrate und Verfgbarkeit der beiden Immunreaktanten sowie der Funktionszustand des RES. Weiterhin k?nnten genetische Faktoren bedeutsam sein, da sie die Menge des produzierten Anti\\\\k?rpers sowie dessen Affinit?t zum Antigen determinieren. 3. Die pathogene, insbesondere entzndungserregende Wirkung von Immunkomplexen beruht auf ihrer F?higkeit, das Komplementsystem zu aktivieren, d. h. der Bildung von biologisch aktiven Komplementspaltprodukten; mit Fc\\\\Rezeptoren auf Thrombozyten, neutrophilen und eosinophilen Granulozyten und Makrophagen zu reagieren; sowie Mediatoren des Kinin\\\\Systems zu aktivieren. 4.

In certain infectious diseases the clinical signs and changes in organs are not due to the direct effects of the infectious agent. After deposition or local formation of pathogenic immune complexes there develop in a series of target organs characteristic inflammatory processes; an immune complex disease develops. 2. From numerous observations of spontaneous diseases as well as experimental studies it is possible to explain which factors are responsible for the development, biological effects, elimination and localization of immune complexes in the tissues. The most important factors responsible for determining the pathogenicity of immune complexes are the nature of the antigen, class and sub\\\\class of immunoglobulin, molar relationship between antigen and antibody, rate of production and availability of both immune reactants, and the functional state of the reticulo\\\\endothelial system. In addition, genetic factors may be important since they determine the amount of antibody produced as well as its affinity for the antigen. 3. The pathogenic, especially the inflammation\\\\stimulating action, of immune complexes rests on their ability to activate the complement system i. e. the formation of biologically active complement breakdown products; to react with Fc\\\\receptors on thrombocytes, neutrophil and eosinophil granulocytes and macrophages; and also to activate mediators of the kinin system. 4. The localization of circulating immune complexes in tissues is determined by the size of the immune complex, the molar relations between antigen and antibody, the haemodynamic relationships in the area of deposition, the local increase in vascular permeability caused by vaso\\\\active mediators, and, in the case of the kidney, by the presence of C 3 b\\\\receptors in the glomeruli. Immune complexes have some significance as regulators of cell\\\\mediated and humoral responses since they can react with cells which carry Fc and C receptors and can sometimes increase and at other times reduce the immune response. 5. Circulating immune complexes have a pathogenic effect after deposition in certain target organs such as renal glomeruli, vessel walls, choroid plexus, synovial membranes and skin, as well as after activation of humoral and cellular mediators. The reasons for the continuing persistence of immune complexes in the circulation are deficient elimination by the monocyte\\\\macrophage system, lack of certain complement factors, an antigen\\\\antibody relationship unfavourable for phagocytosis, and the degree of antibody affinity; these various reasons are discussed. 6. The development of new methods to detect immune complexes in biological fluids and in tissues has resulted in explaining the primary importance of immune complexes in the development of diseases in man and animals. In some diseases the aetiology can be further explained after indentifying the antigens in isolated immune complexes.","output":"Immunkomplex\\\\Krankheiten bei Mensch und Tieren"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) is a rare complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Translation of the pol gene is dependent upon readthrough of the gag UAG stop codon; whereas the env gene is translated from spliced mRNA transcripts. Here, we report the first high resolution analysis of retrovirus gene expression through tandem ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) of MuLV-infected cells. RESULTS: Ribosome profiling of MuLV-infected cells was performed, using the translational inhibitors harringtonine and cycloheximide to distinguish initiating and elongating ribosomes, respectively. Meta-analyses of host cell gene expression demonstrated that the RiboSeq datasets specifically captured the footprints of translating ribosomes at high resolution. Direct measurement of ribosomal occupancy of the MuLV genomic RNA indicated that ~ 7% of ribosomes undergo gag stop codon readthrough to access the pol gene. Initiation of translation was found to occur at several additional sites within the 5 leaders of the gag and env transcripts, upstream of their respective annotated start codons. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments reveal the existence of a number of previously uncharacterised, ribosomally occupied open reading frames within the MuLV genome, with possible regulatory consequences. In addition, we provide the first direct measurements of stop codon readthrough efficiency during cellular infection.

This study aimed to describe a contingency plan for a tertiary academic cancer center, define a strategy to prioritize and postpone examinations, and evaluate the infection rate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in the endoscopy unit of the Cancer Institute of the State of S?o Paulo (ICESP). METHODS: We created a strategy to balance the risk of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and to mitigate the effects of postponing endoscopic procedures in oncological patients. A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on all endoscopies between March and June 2020 compared with those during the same period in 2019 was carried out. All HCWs were interviewed to obtain clinical data and SARS-CoV-2 test results. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, there was a reduction of 55% in endoscopy cases in total. Colonoscopy was the most affected modality. The total infection rate among all HCWs was 38%. None of the senior digestive endoscopists had COVID-19. However, all bronchoscopists had been infected. One of three fellows had a serological diagnosis of COVID-19. Two-thirds of all nurses were infected, whereas half of all technicians were infected. CONCLUSIONS: In this pandemic scenario, all endoscopy services must prioritize the procedures that will be performed. It was possible to maintain some endoscopic procedures, including those meant to provide nutritional access, tissue diagnosis, and endoscopic resection.

Results: We found that an inadequate understanding of the pathophysiology behind COVID-19 cytokine storm, particularly with regards to IL-6, inconsistencies in the time of administration and dosing, the use of adjunctive therapies, and an element of reporting bias were plausible reasons for tocilizumab's failure in latest clinical trials. The NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines and IDSA recommendations both discourage the offlabel use of tocilizumab outside of clinical trial settings. Although several studies have reported remarkable results with tocilizumab, it would be advisable to wait for further results from other clinical trials before reaching a verdict.","output":"The Shortcomings of Tocilizumab in COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance.

Given these concerns, we investigated whether the pandemic affected visits to family physicians differently across sociodemographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic medical records from family physician practices within the University of Toronto Practice-Based Research Network. We evaluated primary care visits for a fixed cohort of patients who were active within the database as of Jan. 1, 2019, to estimate the number of patients who visited their family physician (visitor rate) and the number of distinct visits (visit volume) between Jan. 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. We compared trends in visitor rate and visit volume during the pandemic (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2020) with the same period in the previous year (Mar. 14 to June 30, 2019) across sociodemographic factors, including age, sex, neighbourhood income, material deprivation and ethnic concentration. RESULTS: We included 365 family physicians and 372 272 patients. Compared with the previous year, visitor rates during the pandemic period dropped by 34.5%, from 357 visitors per 1000 people to 292 visitors per 1000 people. Declines in visit volume during the pandemic were less pronounced (21.8% fewer visits), as the mean number of visits per patient increased during the pandemic (from 1.64 to 1.96). The declines in visitor rate and visit volume varied based on patient age and sex, but not socioeconomic status. INTERPRETATION: Although the number of visits to family physicians dropped substantially during the first few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, patients from communities with low socioeconomic status did not appear to be disproportionately affected. In this primary care setting, the pandemic appears not to have worsened socioeconomic disparities in access to care.","output":"Changes in family medicine visits across sociodemographic groups after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario: a retrospective cohort study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This book focuses on the influence of philanthropic foundations in global development, and on how the global south has engaged with them. The idea of corporate philanthropy stretches back a long way, with the late 19th industrialist Andrew Carnegie seeing it as an important obligation of the very wealthy. In the modern day, Bill Gates has taken up this call, suggesting that the very wealthy should donate half their wealth to philanthropic causes, and endowing his own foundation with something in the order of $50 billion. This book brings together case studies of the most influential of these foundations over the last one hundred years: the Rockefeller, Ford, and Gates Foundations, investigating their impact on education and research, health and agriculture. The book concludes by asking whether global south foundations such as Al Waleed Philanthropies, Tata Trusts, and those from China may point to the future of global philanthropic foundations. The sheer scale of resources that foundations can devote to their work results in significant influence in global politics, to the point that Foundations can drive and even set government policy.

METHODS: We retrospectively studied 138 consecutively enrolled patients with COVID-19 and identified in-hospital VTE and bleeding risk by Padua Prediction Score and Improve bleed risk assessment model. The clinical data and features were analyzed in VTE patients. RESULTS: Our findings identified that 23 (16.7%) patients with COVID-19 were at high risk for VTE according to Padua prediction score and 9 (6.5%) patients were at high risk of bleeding for VTE prophylaxis according to Improve prediction score. Fifteen critically ill patients faced double high risk from thrombosis (Padua score more than 4 points in all 15 [100%] patients) and hemorrhage (Improve score more than 7 points in 9 [60.0%] patients). Thrombotic events were identified in four patients (2.9%) of all COVID-19 patients. All of them were diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound 3 to 18 days after admission.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to strict physical distancing regulations and regional lockdowns that made the in-person delivery of Simulated Cultural Communication Scenarios (SCCS) with Indigenous patient actors impossible due to the disproportionate risk that public health emergencies pose for Indigenous communities. As the pandemic continued in 2021, we co-created a Virtual Visit approach to SCCS for the education of culturally safe care to pre-clerkship medical students. We report on student and tutor evaluation of these virtual sessions and contextualize our findings with our previous results delivering In-Person SCCSs. We found that Virtual Visit SCCS were highly effective in providing authentic exposure to and feedback from Indigenous patients. However, students rated their learning outcomes with Virtual Visit lower than the In-person approach to SCCS. We recommend formal training on interacting with patients in virtual care scenarios prior to Virtual Visit SCCS. We also found that exposure to SCCS with Indigenous animators has the potential to conjure up a diverse spectrum of sometimes unresolved negative feelings related to colonialism among students and tutors including discomfort, embarrassment, and anxiety. Our findings underscore the importance of resolving these sentiments within the safe environment of a classroom.

Although South Africa aims to reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases, there is limited evidence on the hypertension care cascade (HCC) performance in rural areas where stroke and hypertension are high. This study estimated HCC performance and identified predictors of hypertension screening among adults in the Ingwavuma community of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Data were collected using the WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) questionnaire from 400 adult participants, excluding pregnant women and those with physical or cognitive impairments. Three hundred and ninety-three participants had complete data, and 131 had high blood pressure. We calculated progression rates for screening, diagnosis, treatment and control of hypertension from the sub-sample of participants with high blood pressure and assessed the bivariate association between HCC stages and participant characteristics and their effect sizes. We used binary and multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of hypertension screening. RESULTS: Eighty-eight per cent of participants reported prior screening for hypertension. However, only 53.5% of patients under pharmacological treatment for hypertension had controlled blood pressure. In bivariate regression, employed participants were 80.3% (COR = 0.197, 95% CI [0.042C0.921]) more likely to be screened. In multivariable regression, the likelihood of hypertension screening was 82.4% (AOR = 0.176, 95% CI [0.047C0.655]) lower among participants in a cohabiting union than single participants. Similarly, employed participants were 87.4% (AOR = 0.129, 95% CI [0.017C0.952]) less likely to be screened than their unemployed counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The considerable attrition from the HCC across socio-demographic categories indicates a need for community-wide interventions. Empowering health care workers for community-based health promotion and hypertension management through point-of-care diagnostic tools could improve HCC performance. Efforts to improve the HCC should also focus on social determinants of health, notably gender and formal educational attainment.","output":"Hypertension care cascade in the Ingwavuma rural community, uMkhanyakude District, KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Dengue is a major public health problem globally. It is caused by four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus (DENV1-4), and although serotype-specific and strongly neutralizing cross-reactive immune responses against the four DENV serotypes are thought to be protective, subneutralizing Abs can contribute to increased disease severity upon secondary infection with a different DENV serotype. Understanding the breadth of the immune response in natural DENV infections and in vaccinees is crucial for determining the correlates of protection or disease severity. Transformation of B cell populations to generate mAbs and ELISPOT assays have been used to determine B cell and Ab specificity to DENV; however, both methods have technical limitations. We therefore modified the conventional ELISPOT to develop a Quad-Color FluoroSpot to provide a means of examining B cell/Ab serotype specificity and cross-reactivity on a single-cell basis. Abs secreted by B cells are captured by an Fc-specific Ab on a filter plate. Subsequently, standardized concentrations of all four DENV serotypes are added to allow equal stoichiometry for Ag binding. After washing, the spots, representing individual B cells, are visualized using four fluorescently labeled DENV serotype-specific detection mAbs. This method can be used to better understand the breadth and magnitude of B cell responses following primary and secondary DENV infection or vaccination and their role as immune correlates of protection from subsequent DENV infections. Furthermore, the Quad-Color FluoroSpot assay can be applied to other diseases caused by multiple pathogen serotypes in which determining the serotype or subtype-specific B cell response is important.","output":"Single-Cell Analysis of B Cell/Antibody Cross-Reactivity Using a Novel Multicolor FluoroSpot Assay."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Increased awareness of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) can disrupt vaccination programs.

Risk assessments are the cornerstone of protecting vulnerable groups of individuals. The QCovid risk calculator is a newly developed tool to predict the risk of death or hospitalisation from COVID-19. It has not been applied in SMI populations. We aimed to use the QCovid risk calculator in an inpatient rehabilitation setting to identify and mitigate risk for people with SMI with personalised COVID-19 prevention plans.MethodClinical and sociodemographic characteristics were obtained for 22 inpatients. Firstly, the QCovid risk calculator was used to ascertain the absolute and relative risks to patients (Odds Ratios (OR) of mortality and/or hospitalisation) from COVID-19. Patients were stratified as high (OR &gt; 10), moderate (OR 5-10) and low (OR &lt; 5) risk. Secondly, personalised COVID-19 prevention plans were coproduced by patients and clinicians addressing 1) risk factors contributing to increased QCovid risk, 2) patient's personal goals, concerns, and preferences 3) maximizing patient engagement in COVID-19 infection prevention strategies. Finally, uptake of personalised COVID-19 prevention plans was evaluated after four weeks using a customised patient feedback questionnaire.ResultOf the 22 inpatients (68% male), 14 patients (64%) had schizophrenia and 3 patients (14%) had schizoaffective disorder as primary diagnosis. 13 (59%) patients were prescribed clozapine. QCovid risk stratification showed 10% of patients as high risk, 29% as moderate risk, and 61% as low risk. Apart from SMI in all 22 inpatients, the most common QCovid risk factors were increased body mass index (64%, n = 14;23% overweight and 41% obese), diabetes mellitus type 1 or 2 (27%, n = 6) and epilepsy (n = 4, 18%). 19 of the 22 patients provided feedback on their personalised COVID-19 prevention plans. Most patients (79%) felt they had contributed significantly to their COVID-19 prevention plans, and their individual goals and concerns were valued. 79% were satisfied with their COVID-19 prevention plans. Subjective perception of safety from COVID-19 was high, with 95% of patients feeling safe and well-protected from COVID-19.ConclusionComprehensive assessment of COVID-19 risks in vulnerable groups enables personalised risk mitigation, both at an individual and service level. Our findings show the importance of applying current knowledge to protect vulnerable patients with SMI through personalised prevention plans.

However, there exists several differences in present emission standards followed by different countries. For instance, emission standards in USA are fuel neutral, while no separate weight categorization exists among light-duty vehicles (LDVs). In Europe, Japan, Australia and India, separate weight categorization and emission limits for both petrol and diesel vehicles are provided. It was observed that different driving test cycles used by different countries are the reasons for numerical differences in vehicular emission standards. To rectify this, a worldwide harmonized test cycle (WHTC) is introduced by United Nations Economic Committee for Europe (UNECE) that would represent real-world driving and verifies that the statutory emission limits are not exceeded during actual driving. Countries like Japan and Europe have already been following the WHTC, while some other countries may introduce the same in near future.

Dysregulated immune response marks severe COVID-19, but the immunological mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathogenesis are still largely unknown, which is hampering the development of efficient treatments. Here we analyzed ~140 parameters of cellular and humoral immune response in peripheral blood of 41 COVID-19 patients and 16 age/gender-matched healthy donors by flow-cytometry, quantitative PCR, western blot and ELISA, followed by integrated correlation analyses with ~30 common clinical and laboratory parameters. We found that lymphocytopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (n=20) strongly affects T, NK and NKT cells, but not B cells and antibody production. Unlike increased activation of ICOS-1+ CD4+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients (n=21), T cells in severe patients showed impaired activation, low IFN-?3 production and high functional exhaustion, which correlated with significantly down-regulated HLA-DR expression in monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells. The latter phenomenon was followed by lower interferon responsive factor (IRF)-8 and autophagy-related genes expressions, and the expansion of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Intriguingly, PD-L1-, ILT-3-, and IDO-1-expressing monocytic MDSC were the dominant producers of IL-6 and IL-10, which correlated with the increased inflammation and accumulation of regulatory B and T cell subsets in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, down-regulated IRF-8 and autophagy-related genes expression, and the expansion of MDSC subsets could play critical roles in dysregulating T cell response in COVID-19, which could have large implications in diagnostics and design of novel therapeutics for this disease.","output":"Reduced Expression of Autophagy Markers and Expansion of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Correlate With Poor T Cell Response in Severe COVID-19 Patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Burnout interventions are limited by low use. Understanding resident physician preferences for burnout interventions may increase utilization and improve the assessment of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to use an econometric best-worst scaling (BWS) framework to survey internal medicine resident physicians to establish help-seeking preferences for burnout and barriers to using wellness supports by quantifying selections for 7 wellness support options and 7 barriers. METHODS: Internal medicine resident physicians at our institution completed an anonymous web-based BWS survey during the 2020-2021 academic year. This cross-sectional study was analyzed with multinomial logistic regression and latent class modeling to determine the relative rank ordering of factors for seeking support for burnout and barriers to using wellness supports. Analysis of variance with Tukey honest significant difference posthoc test was used to analyze differences in mean utility scores representing choice for barriers and support options. RESULTS: Of the 163 invited residents, 77 (47.2% response rate) completed the survey. Top-ranking factors for seeking wellness supports included seeking informal peer support (best: 71%; worst: 0.6%) and support from friends and family (best: 70%; worst: 1.6%). Top-ranking barriers to seeking counseling included time (best: 75%; worst: 5%) and money (best: 35%; worst: 21%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings suggest that low utilization of formal mental health support is reflective of resident preferences to seek help informally and that increasing utilization will require addressing pragmatic barriers of time and cost. Assessing physician preferences for wellness-related initiatives may contribute to understanding the low utilization of formal mental health services among physicians, which can be determined using a BWS framework.","output":"Self-Reported Preferences for Help-Seeking and Barriers to Using Mental Health Supports Among Internal Medicine Residents: Exploratory Use of an Econometric Best-Worst Scaling Framework for Gathering Physician Wellness Preferences"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Burn patients experience major physiological and psychological stressors during treatment and rehabilitation, including elevated levels of pain, anxiety, stress, or depression. Music interventions inclusive of music therapy (MT) have been shown to improve such symptoms, but rigorous clinical trials investigating specific music therapy methods in adult burn patients are scarce. Methods: This is a single center Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) protocol with two parallel arms. Participants are 81 adult burn patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the University Hospital Fundacin Santa Fe de Bogot in Colombia. The intervention consists of a Music Assisted Relaxation (MAR) protocol, a music therapy technique composed of entrained live music combined with a guided relaxation and/or the use of imagery. The effects of the MAR will be compared to a control group (treatment as usual) over a period of maximum 2 weeks or six interventions. The primary outcome measure is perceived background pain, as measured with a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after each intervention. Secondary outcomes are anxiety and depression levels; vital signs; and the use of pain medication. Additionally, some patients in the intervention group will be invited to participate in electroencephalography, electromyography, and electrocardiography recordings during the MAR. Discussion: This study protocol follows the SPIRIT guidelines for defining items of clinical trials and is the first study in Colombia to evaluate the effects of music therapy for adult burn patients. With this RCT it is hoped to gather new knowledge about the potential of music therapy to help critical care patients cope and recover from their injuries during the hospitalization in the ICU.

Multiple repurposed drugs have shown promise in treating COVID-19. We describe a master protocol that will assess the efficacy of different repurposed drugs as treatments for early COVID-19 among outpatients at a high risk for severe complications.Methods: : The TOGETHER Trial is a multi-center platform adaptive randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial. Patients are included if they are at least 18 years of age, have a positive antigen test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and have an indication for high risk of disease severity, including co-morbidities, older age, or high body mass index. Eligible patients are randomized with equal chance to an investigational product (IP) or to placebo.The primary endpoint is hospitalization defined as either retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting for greater than 6 hours or transfer to tertiary hospital due to COVID-19. Secondary outcomes include mortality, adverse events, adherence, and viral clearance. Scheduled interim analyses are conducted and reviewed by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), who make recommendations on continuing or stopping each IP. The platform adaptive design go-no-go decision rules are extended to dynamically incorporate external evidence on COVID-19 interventions from ongoing independent randomized clinical trials.Discussion: Results from this trial will assist in the identification of therapeutics for the treatment of early diagnosed COVID-19.

In our institution, we adapted our delivery of outpatient systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) by introducing a number of 'risk-reducing' measures including pre-assessment screening. AIMS: We sought to evaluate the experience and perceptions of patients with cancer undergoing SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Patients on SACT during the Covid-19 pandemic were eligible for participation. Data were collected by anonymous survey over a 1 week period during the most intensive phase of government restrictions. Patients were asked questions under three headings: perceived risk of infection exposure, changes to treatment plan and psychological impact of Covid-19. RESULTS: One hundred patients were assessed, 60% were male, 41% were > 65 years of age and 67% had advanced cancer. Eleven percent of patients were living alone. Fifty-seven percent reported feeling at increased risk in general of contracting Covid-19. Sixty-eight percent of patients did not feel worried about contracting Covid-19 in the hospital. Ninety-two percent of patients reported wanting to continue on SACT as originally planned. Fifty-eighty percent felt isolated and 40% reported increased anxiety. CONCLUSION: Though patients on active treatment for cancer during the Covid-19 pandemic reported increased anxiety and feelings of isolation due to Covid-19, the majority of patients wanted to continue SACT as originally planned.

Methods: A total of 104 patients with psychosis and 105 patients with depression were surveyed to assess their internet use and mental health-related internet use. Results: The majority of participants were internet users (87.6%), with 66.7% of internet users with psychosis and 71.4% of internet users with depression using it as a source of information on mental health. Participants with psychosis significantly more attributed the internet and mental health internet forums as helpful in coping with their mental illness and were more interested in the utilization of online mental health services than participants with depression. Conclusions: General internet use in patients with schizophrenia and depression corresponds with the internet use of the general population; however, they use it more often as a source of health information than the general population.

We performed a retrospective and prospective observational study to describe the etiology, clinical course, and outcomes of pneumonia for patients 60 years and older in Thailand. We enrolled 490 patients; 440 patients were included in the retrospective study and 50 patients were included in the prospective study. The CURB-65 score and a modified SMART-COP score (SMART-CO score) were used to assess disease severity. The median patient age was 80 years (interquartile range, 70C87 years); 51.2% were men. Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.5%) were the most common causative agents of pneumonia. A significant minority (23%) of patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and mortality among this subset of patients was 45%. Most patients (80.8%) survived and were discharged from the hospital. The median duration of hospitalization was 8 days (interquartile range, 4C16 days). In contrast, 17.6% of patients died while undergoing care and 30-day mortality was 14%. Factors significantly associated with mortality were advanced age (P = 0.004), male sex (P = 0.005), multiple bacterial infections (P = 0.007; relative risk [RR], 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.19C2.79), infection with multi-drug-resistant/extended-spectrum B-lactamase-producing organisms (P < 0.001; RR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.83C4.85), ICU admission (P < 0.001; RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4C2.3), and complications of pneumonia (P < 0.001; RR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.8C3.4). Patients with higher SMART-CO and CURB-65 scores had higher rates of ICU admission and higher 30-day mortality rates (P < 0.001). These results emphasize the importance of Gram-negative bacteria, particularly K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, as major causes of pneumonia among the elderly in contrast to other reports, Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of pneumonia among elderly individuals worldwide. The SMART-COP and CURB-65 scores were developed to assess pneumonia severity and predict mortality of young adults with pneumonia. Few studies have examined the appropriateness of these scores for elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. A limited number of studies have used modified versions of these scores among elderly individuals. We found that Gram-negative bacteria has a major role in the etiology of pneumonia among elderly individuals in Southeast Asia. A significant proportion of elderly individuals with low CURB-65 scores were admitted to the hospital, indicating that hospital admission may reflect fragility among elderly individuals with low CURB-65 scores. The modified SMART-COP score (SMART-CO score) sufficiently predicted intensive care unit admission and the need for intensive vasopressor or respiratory support.

Some, mainly democracies like New Zealand and South Korea, took quick health measures without curbing citizen rights. Others, especially those led by populists like Bolsonaro and Erdogan, denied the seriousness of the health crisis even as they curbed political and civil rights. El Salvador is virtually unique in its COVID-19 response, combining a strong rhetorical commitment to health measures with clear efforts to undermine democratic controls and rights. President Nayib Bukele adopted an early travel ban and publicly vilified those who broke curfew by sending them and all who tested positive to quarantine centers for 30 days. He derided and defied Constitutional Chamber decisions against such practices, ordered militarized actions, and crowded gang-affiliated prisoners together in humiliating ways that risked exposure to COVID-19. We examine how Bukeles policies conform to, and seemingly exemplify, Michel Foucaults theoretical concepts of biopolitics and disciplinary power. However, the Salvadoran case also challenges key features of Foucaults theory, suggesting the need to modify his Western assumptions about highly institutionalized states.

We herein discuss the cardiovascular implications and complications of this pandemic analyzing the most recent data clustered over the last several months. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 afflicts the cardiovascular system producing acute cardiac injury in 10-20% of cases with mild disease but in greater than 50-60% in severe cases, contributing to patients' demise. Other cardiovascular complications include arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism and shock. Off-label therapies are being trialed with their own inherent cardiovascular risks, while supportive therapies currently dominate, until more specific and effective antiviral therapies and vaccinations become available. A controversial issue relates to the safety of drugs blocking the renin--angiotensin system as an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) homologue, ACE2, serves as the receptor for viral entry into host cells. However, to-date, no harm has been proven for these drugs. SUMMARY In the cardiovascular system, COVID-19 can induce acute cardiac injury, arrhythmias, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, shock and death, whereas anti-COVID therapies also confer serious cardiovascular side-effects. Ongoing extensive efforts focus on specific vaccines and antivirals. Meanwhile, cardiovascular risk factors and diseases should be jointly controlled according to current evidence-based guidelines.","output":"Cardiovascular implications and complications of the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic: a world upside down."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"[Figure: see text].","output":"Sequential immunization of macaques elicits heterologous neutralizing antibodies targeting the V3-glycan patch of HIV-1 Env."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This article is adapted from a speech Dr. de Groot delivered in June 2020 as President, Health Care & Education, of the American Diabetes Association at the Association's 80th Scientific Sessions, which was held online as a result of coronavirus disease 2019.

Recently, numerous cases of acute limb ischemia (ALI) have been reported although pooled data are lacking. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library for studies published online up to January 2021 that reported cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection and ALI. Eligible studies should have reported early outcomes including mortality. Primary endpoints included also pooled amputation, clinical improvement and reoperation rates. RESULTS: In total, 34 studies (19 case reports and 15 case series/cohort studies) including a total of 540 patients (199 patients were eligible for analysis) were evaluated. All studies were published in 2020. Mean age of patients was 61.6 years (range 39-84 years; data from 32 studies) and 78.4% of patients were of male gender (data from 32 studies). There was a low incidence of comorbidities: arterial hypertension: 49% (29 studies); diabetes mellitus: 29.6% (29 studies); dyslipidemia: 20.5% (27 studies); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 8.5% (26 studies); coronary disease: 8.3% (26 studies); and chronic renal disease: 7.6% (28 studies). Medical treatment was selected as first-line treatment for 41.8% of cases. Pooled mortality rate among 34 studies reached 31.4% (95% CI = 25.4% to 37.7%). Pooled amputation rate among 34 studies reached 23.2% (95% CI = 17.3% to 29.7%). Pooled clinical improvement rate among 28 studies reached 66.6% (95% CI = 55.4% to 76.9%). Pooled reoperation rate among 29 studies reached 10.5% (95% CI = 5.7% to 16.7%). Medical treatment was associated with a higher death risk compared to any intervention (OR = 4.04; 95% CI [1.075 C 15.197]; P = .045) although amputation risk was not different between the two strategies (OR = .977; 95% CI [.070 C 13.600]; P = .986) (data from 31 studies). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a high risk for thrombotic complications including ALI. Covid-associated ALI presents in patients with a low incidence of comorbidities, and it is associated with a high mortality and amputation risk. Conservative treatment seems to have a higher mortality risk compared to any intervention although amputation risk is similar.","output":"ACUTE LIMB ISCHEMIA AMONG PATIENTS WITH COVID-19 INFECTION"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Formaldehyde (FA) is a ubiquitous endogenous and environmental metabolite that is thought to exert cytotoxicity through DNA and DNA-protein crosslinking, likely contributing to the onset of the human DNA repair condition Fanconi Anaemia. Mutations in the genes coding for FA detoxifying enzymes underlie a human inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS), even in the presence of functional DNA repair, raising the question of whether FA causes relevant cellular damage beyond genotoxicity. Here, we report that FA triggers cellular redox imbalance in human cells and in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mechanistically, FA reacts with the redox-active thiol group of glutathione (GSH), altering the GSH:GSSG ratio and causing oxidative stress. FA cytotoxicity is prevented by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5/GSNOR), which metabolizes FA-GSH products, lastly yielding reduced GSH. Furthermore, we show that GSH synthesis protects human cells from FA, indicating an active role of GSH in preventing FA toxicity. These findings might be relevant for patients carrying mutations in FA-detoxification systems and could suggest therapeutic benefits from thiol-rich antioxidants like N-acetyl-L-cysteine.","output":"Endogenous formaldehyde scavenges cellular glutathione resulting in redox disruption and cytotoxicity"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan raised serious public health concerns. By February 15, 2020 in Wuhan, the total number of confirmed infection cases has reached 37 914, and the number of deaths has reached 1123, accounting for 56.9% of the total confirmed cases and 73.7% of the total deaths in China. People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people's work and life will be on the right track. Method: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. Results: The optimal parameters were estimated as R0 = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1). Based on these parameters, the number of infected individuals in Wuhan city may reach the peak around February 19 at about 47 000 people. Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed.

To ensure the validity and accuracy of research using these data, investigators need to be confident that the phenotypes they construct are reliable and accurate, reflecting the healthcare settings from which they are ascertained. We developed a COVID-19 registry at a single academic medical center and used data from March 1 to June 5, 2020 to assess differences in population-level characteristics in pandemic and non-pandemic years respectively. Median EHR length, previously shown to impact phenotype performance in type 2 diabetes, was significantly shorter in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group relative to a 2019 influenza tested group (median 3.1 years vs 8.7; Wilcoxon rank sum P=1.3e-52). Using three phenotyping methods of increasing complexity (billing codes alone and domain-specific algorithms provided by an EHR vendor and clinical experts), common medical comorbidities were abstracted from COVID-19 EHRs, defined by the presence of a positive laboratory test (positive predictive value 100%, recall 93%). After combining performance data across phenotyping methods, we observed significantly lower false negative rates for those records billed for a comprehensive care visit (p=4e-11) and those with complete demographics data recorded (p=7e-5). In an early COVID-19 cohort, we found that phenotyping performance of nine common comorbidities was influenced by median EHR length, consistent with previous studies, as well as by data density, which can be measured using portable metrics including CPT codes.

DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Conducted with a nationally representative sample of UK adults within 48 hours of the UK Government advising the public to stop non-essential contact with others and all unnecessary travel. PARTICIPANTS: 2108 adults living in the UK aged 18 years and over. Response rate was 84.3% (2108/2500). Data collected between 17 March and 18 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Descriptive statistics for all survey questions, including number of respondents and weighted percentages. Robust Poisson regression used to identify sociodemographic variation in: (1) adoption of social distancing measures, (2) ability to work from home, and (3) ability and (4) willingness to self-isolate. RESULTS: Overall, 1992 (94.2%) respondents reported at least one preventive measure: 85.8% washed their hands with soap more frequently; 56.5% avoided crowded areas and 54.5% avoided social events. Adoption of social distancing measures was higher in those aged over 70 years compared with younger adults aged 18C34 years (adjusted relative risk/aRR: 1.2; 95% CI: 1.1 to 1.5). Those with lowest household income were three times less likely to be able to work from home (aRR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.45) and less likely to be able to self-isolate (aRR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.96). Ability to self-isolate was also lower in black and minority ethnic groups (aRR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.0). Willingness to self-isolate was high across all respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Ability to adopt and comply with certain non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is lower in the most economically disadvantaged in society. Governments must implement appropriate social and economic policies to mitigate this. By incorporating these differences in NPIs among socioeconomic subpopulations into mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, our modelling of epidemic outcomes and response to COVID-19 can be improved.","output":"Early perceptions and behavioural responses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey of UK adults"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, certain illegal business practices, such as the trade in counterfeit medical products, have been experiencing a boom.

However, the exact physiological role of endogenous ChREBP in BAT thermogenesis remains unclear. METHODS: We used the Cre/LoxP system to generate ChREBP BAT-specific knockout mice, and examined their BAT thermogenesis under acute cold exposure and long-term cold acclimation.

RESULTS: The mice lacking ChREBP specifically in BAT displayed a significant decrease in the expression levels of lipogenic genes and the activity of de novo lipogenesis in BAT after cold exposure, with UCP1 expression decreased under thermoneutral conditions or after acute cold exposure but not chronic cold acclimation. Unexpectedly, BAT-specific ChREBP deletion did not significantly affect body temperature as well as local temperature or morphology of BAT after acute cold exposure or chronic cold acclimation.

With further screening and isolating with immunomodulatory and antagonistic effects, two Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum strains might be expected to emerge as next-generation probiotics. The finding here might provide a solution for preventing gastrointestinal disorders for preruminant calves without sustained periods of administration through inhibiting the infectious bacteria, immunomodulatory effect and possible modulating microbiota. ABSTRACT: (1) Background: We aimed to isolate and identify potential next-generation probiotics (NGP) by investigating the interrelationships between gastrointestinal microbiota and diarrhea in preruminant Holstein calves. (2) Material and methods: Twenty preruminant Holstein calves were divided into healthy and diarrheic groups after the combination outcomes of veterinary diagnosis and fecal scores. The fecal microbiome, plasma cytokines, plasma immunoglobulin (Ig) G and haptoglobin were analyzed. The potential probiotic bacteria were identified by comparing the microbiota difference between healthy and diarrheic calves and correlation analysis with fecal scores and inflammatory markers. The identified bacteria were also isolated for further evaluation for antimicrobial activities and immunoregulatory effects. (3) Results: Microbiota analysis suggested that Ruminococcaceae_UCG_014, Bifidobacterium and Pseudoflavonifractor positively correlated with bovine IgG and negatively correlated with fecal score; inflammatory factors, bovine HP, and IL-8 were classified as beneficial bacteria contributing to the health of the calves. The alternation of gut microbial composition also induced changes in the functional gene enrichment of gut microbiota in calves. The gathering of microbiomic data strongly indicated the possible beneficial effects of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, expected to develop as NGP. After isolation and evaluation of the potential functionality in vitro, two specific bifidobacterial strains demonstrated antimicrobial activities and immunoregulatory effects.

The biosensor is characterized by an air-bridge capacitor and fabricated via integrated passive device technology on gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate. The exterior design of the structure is a spiral inductor with the air-bridge providing a sensitive surface, whereas the internal capacitor improves indicator performance. The sensing relies on repolarization and rearrangement of surface molecules, which are excited by the dropped sample at the microcosmic level, and the resonance performance variation corresponds to the difference in glucose concentration at the macroscopic level. The air-bridge capacitor in the modeled RLC circuit serves as a bio-recognition element to glucose concentration ([Formula: see text]), generating resonant frequency shifts at 0.874 GHz and 1.244 GHz for concentrations of 25 mg/dL and 300 mg/dL compared to DI water, respectively. The proposed biosensor exhibits excellent sensitivity at 1.38 MHz per mg/dL with a wide detection range for glucose concentrations of 25C300 mg/dL and a low detection limit of 24.59 mg/dL. Additionally, the frequency shift and concentration are highly linear with a coefficient of determination of 0.98823. The response time is less than 3 s.

Our objective was to evaluate continuous BP measurements obtained from a non-invasive, wireless photoplethysmography (PPG)-based device using two distinct configurations (wristwatch and chest-patch monitors) compared to an AL. Methods: In this prospective evaluation study, comparison of the PPG-based devices to the AL was conducted in 10 patients immediately following cardiac surgery. Pulse rate (PR), systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded using both the AL and the PPG-based devices simultaneously for an average of 432  290 min starting immediately after cardiac surgery. Bland-Altman plots and Pearson's correlations were used to assess the accuracy and degree of agreement between techniques. Results: A total of ~4,000 data points were included in the final analysis. AL measurements for PR, SBP, DBP and MAP were significantly (p < 0.001) and strongly correlated with both the wristwatch (r = 0.99, r = 0.94, r = 0.93 and r = 0.96, respectively) and the chest-patch (r = 0.99, r = 0.95, r = 0.93 and r = 0.95, respectively) monitors.

Variance in protein sequence might lead to change in protein structure and interaction, then further affect the viral physiological characteristics, which could bring tremendous influence on the pandemic. In this study, we investigated 20 non-synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome which incidence rates were all &#8805;1% as of September 1st, 2020, then modeled and analyzed the mutant protein structures. The results showed that four types of mutations caused dramatic changes in protein structures (RMSD &#8805;5.0 ?), which were Q57H and G251V in open reading frames 3a (ORF3a), S194L and R203K/G204R in nucleocapsid (N). Next, we found that these mutations also affected the binding affinity of intraviral protein interactions. In addition, the hot spots within these docking mutant complexes were altered, among which the mutation Q57H was involved in both Orf3a-S and Orf3a-Orf8 protein interactions. Besides, these mutations were widely distributed all over the world, and their occurrences fluctuated as time went on. Notably, the incidences of R203K/G204R in N and Q57H in Orf3a were both over 50% in some countries.

For decades hypertension has disproportionately affected African Americans, who also have a higher burden of associated comorbidities including diabetes and heart failure. METHODS: Current literature including guideline reports and newer studies on hypertension in African Americans in PubMed were reviewed. We also reviewed newer publications on the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. FINDINGS: While APOL1 has been theorized in the epidemiology of hypertension, the increased prevalence and associated risks are primarily due to environmental and lifestyle factors. These factors include poor diet, adverse lifestyle, and social determinants. Hypertension control can be achieved by lifestyle modifications such as low sodium diet, weight loss, and adequate physical activity. When lifestyle modifications alone do not adequately control hypertension, a common occurrence among African Americans who suffer with greater prevalence of resistant hypertension, pharmacological intervention is indicated. The efficacy of renal denervation, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 and aminopeptidase A inhibitors, have been studied for treatment of resistant hypertension. Furthermore, the recent COVID-19 crisis has been particularly devastating among African Americans who demonstrate increased incidence and poorer health outcomes related to the disease. CONCLUSION: The disparities in outcomes, which are largely attributable to a greater prevalence of comorbidities such as hypertension and obesity, in addition to adverse environmental and socioeconomic factors, highlight the necessity of specialized clinical approaches and programs for African Americans to address longstanding barriers to equitable care.","output":"Contemporary and Future Concepts on Hypertension in African Americans: COVID-19 and Beyond"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tissue-resident macrophages (M?) originating from foetal precursors are maintained by self-renewal under tissue/organ-specific microenvironments (niches).

Lung tissue-resident M? could be largely propagated under standard culture media along with the propagation of lung interstitial cells demonstrating a fibroblastic morphology. Propagated lung M? showed characteristic expression properties for M?/monocyte markers: high expressions of CD11b, CD64 and CD206; substantial expressions of Mertk; and negative expressions of Ly6C, MHC II and Siglec-F.

Cervical cancer is a highly preventable and treatable disease, if detected through screening at an early stage. Governments have a responsibility to screen women for precancerous cervical lesions. Yet, national screening programmes overlook many poor women and those marginalised in society. Under-screened women (called hard-to-reach) experience a higher incidence of cervical cancer and elevated mortality rates compared to regularly-screened women. Such inequalities deprive hard-to-reach women of the full enjoyment of their right to sexual and reproductive health, as laid out in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and General Comment No. 22. DISCUSSION: This article argues first for tailored and innovative national cervical cancer screening programmes (NCSP) grounded in human rights law, to close the disparity between women who are afforded screening and those who are not. Second, acknowledging socioeconomic disparities requires governments to adopt and refine universal cancer control through NCSPs aligned with human rights duties, including to reach all eligible women. Commonly reported- and chronically under-addressed- screening disparities relate to the availability of sufficient health facilities and human resources (example from Kenya), the physical accessibility of health services for rural and remote populations (example from Brazil), and the accessibility of information sensitive to cultural, ethnic, and linguistic barriers (example from Ecuador). Third, governments can adopt new technologies to overcome individual and structural barriers to cervical cancer screening. National cervical cancer screening programmes should tailor screening methods to under-screened women, bearing in mind that eliminating systemic discrimination may require committing greater resources to traditionally neglected groups. CONCLUSION: Governments have human rights obligations to refocus screening policies and programmes on women who are disproportionately affected by discrimination that impairs their full enjoyment of the right to sexual and reproductive health. National cervical cancer screening programmes that keep the right to health principles (above) central will be able to expand screening among low-income, isolated and other marginalised populations, but also women in general, who, for a variety of reasons, do not visit healthcare providers for regular screenings.","output":"Universal cervical cancer control through a right to health lens: refocusing national policy and programmes on underserved women"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic brought many challenges, from hospital-occupation management to lock-down mental-health repercussions such as anxiety or depression.

We conducted a comparative analysis of quarantine durations, testing frequencies, and false-positive rates for all of the 18 RA tests with emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA, and an RT-PCR test. For each test, we employed a mathematical model of imminent infections to calculate the effective reproductive number in the context of the test used for quarantine or serial testing. We informed the model with data on test specificity, temporal diagnostic sensitivity, and COVID-19 infectiousness. Our results demonstrate that the relative effectiveness of RA and RT-PCR tests in reducing post-quarantine transmission depends on the quarantine duration and the turnaround time of testing results. For quarantines shorter than five days, RA test on entry to and on exit from quarantine reduced onward transmission more than a single RT-PCR test conducted upon exit. Conducting surveillance via serial RT-PCR testing with a 24-h turnaround time, the minimum testing frequency paired with isolation of positives that is required to suppress the effective reproduction number (RE) below one was found to be every six days. RA tests reduce RE below one when conducted at a minimum frequency that ranges from every six days to every eight days. Our analysis also highlights that the risk of onward transmission during serial testing increases with the delay in obtaining the results. These RA test-specific results are an important component of the tool set for policy decision-making, and demonstrate that judicious selection of an appropriate RA test can supply a viable alternative to RT-PCR in efforts to control the spread of disease.","output":"Comparative analyses of all FDA EUA-approved rapid antigen tests and RT-PCR for COVID-19 quarantine and surveillance-based isolation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In this paper, we estimate the seroprevalence against COVID-19 by country and derive the seroprevalence over the world.

RESULTS: Among 1721 patients (median age 71 years, 57% male), 349 (20.3%) had pre-existing CVD (CVD), 888 (51.6%) had CV risk factors without CVD (RF-CVD), 484 (28.1%) had neither. Patients with CVD were older with a higher burden of non-CV comorbidities. During follow-up, 438 (25.5%) patients died: 37% with CVD, 25.7% with RF-CVD and 16.5% with neither. CVD was independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients < 70 years of age (adjusted HR 2.43 [95% CI 1.16C5.07]), but not in those  70 years (aHR 1.14 [95% CI 0.77C1.69]). RF-CVD were not independently associated with mortality in either age group (< 70 y aHR 1.21 [95% CI 0.72C2.01],  70 y aHR 1.07 [95% CI 0.76C1.52]). Most CV complications occurred in patients with CVD (66%) versus RF-CVD (17%) or neither (11%; p < 0.001). 213 [12.4%] patients developed venous thromboembolism (VTE). CVD was not an independent predictor of VTE. CONCLUSIONS: In patients hospitalised with COVID-19, pre-existing established CVD appears to be a more important contributor to mortality than CV risk factors in the absence of CVD. CVD-related hazard may be mediated, in part, by new CV complications. Optimal care and vigilance for destabilised CVD are essential in this patient group. Trial registration n/a.

Though mass immunization programs have been implemented in several countries, the viral transmission cycle has shown a continuous progression in the form of multiple waves. A constant change in the frequencies of dominant viral lineages, arising from the accumulation of nucleotide variations (NVs) through favourable selection, is understandably expected to be a major determinant of disease severity and possible vaccine escape. Indeed, worldwide efforts have been initiated to identify specific virus lineage(s) and/or NVs that may cause a severe clinical presentation or facilitate vaccination breakthrough. Since host genetics is expected to play a major role in shaping virus evolution, it is imperative to study role of genome-wide SARS-CoV-2 NVs across various populations. In the current study, we analysed the whole genome sequence of 3543 SARS-CoV-2 infected samples obtained from the state of Telangana, India (including 210 from our previous study), collected over an extended period from April, 2020 to October, 2021. We present a unique perspective on the evolution of prevalent virus lineages and NVs during this time period. We also highlight presence of specific NVs likely to be associated favourably with samples classified as vaccination breakthroughs. Finally, we report genome-wide intra-host variations (iSNVs) at novel genomic positions. The results presented here provide critical insights into virus evolution over an extended time period within a geographically restricted area and pave the way to rigorously investigate the role of specific NVs in vaccination breakthroughs.","output":"Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution in a localized population"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a pandemic viral pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

It is also primarily located within the respiratory airways and is uprising during COVID-19 infection. Hitherto, the association between COVID-19 pathophysiology and HA is still unclear. Herein, we provide an overview of the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection in conjunction with the involvement of HA and the diminution of HA for therapeutic potential of COVID-19.

However, it remains unclear whether tourists are able to restore themselves from staycation programs, since tourists have a tendency to favor a novel space, as opposed to a usual travel environment. To address this question, we relied upon a government-funded staycation campaign using a survey to assess a transformative process leading from travel motivation and restoration to fortifying psychological capital and wellbeing.

Measuring hair cortisol concentrations (HCCs), which reflect the integrated long-term cortisol levels, may elucidate the impact of COVID-19 related stress on healthcare professionals. In the current study, we investigated experienced stress in 693 healthcare workers, with hair samples for cortisol analysis collected from a subset of 67 female nurses. The HCCs in two 3 cm hair segments corresponding to periods before and during the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 were compared. To evaluate the effect of working in the first line, the sample was divided into two groups based on the COVID-19 risk estimated by the nurses. Covariates in the model included perceived stress (PSS), perceived social support (MSPSS), and quality of sleep (PSQI) measured via an online questionnaire. The data showed that more than 75% of healthcare workers agreed that COVID-19 led to increased stress at their workplace. The hair cortisol analysis showed higher HCCs in the hair segments corresponding to the time of the pandemic compared to hair corresponding to an earlier period (partial ?290%CI = 0.123-0.397); in the same model, higher HCCs were also found in nurses from high-risk environments compared to low-risk ones (partial ?290%CI = 0.002-0.176). None of the subjective questionnaire measures were significant predictors of HCCs.

The goal of this qualitative descriptive study is to explore the impact of COVID-19 on fidelity to the TCM intervention during this clinical trial. Using directed content analysis, recorded monthly meetings with health system leaders and staff were coded to identify challenges and strategies to maintaining fidelity to the intervention in the context of the pandemic. Analyses showed that COVID-19 impacted all 10 TCM components. The components with the most challenges were delivering services from hospital-to-home due to quarantining, restrictive facility policies, lack of personal protective equipment and limited telehealth availability; coordinating care due reduced availability of services, and screening at risk individuals because of fewer eligible patients. Strategies for addressing challenges included: exploring alternatives (e.g., increasing reliance on telehealth, expanding study eligibility), building and engaging networks (e.g., direct outreach to skilled nursing facility staff) and anticipating needs (e.g., preparing for shorter hospital stays).

ICCM relies on standardized test-and-treat algorithms implemented by community health workers using malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). However, due to a changing epidemiology of fever causes in Africa, positive RDT results might not correctly reflect malaria. In this study, we modeled diagnostic predictive values for all malaria-endemic African regions as an indicator of the programmatic usefulness of RDTs in iCCM campaigns on malaria. METHODS: Positive predictive values (PPVs) and negative predictive values (NPVs) of RDTs for clinical malaria were modeled. Assay-specific performance characteristics stem from the Cochrane Library and data on the proportion of malaria-attributable fevers among African febrile children aged <5 years were used as prevalence matrix. RESULTS: Average country-level PPVs vary considerably. Ethiopia had the lowest PPVs (histidine-rich protein II [HRP2] assay, 17.35%; parasite lactate dehydrogenase [pLDH] assay, 39.73%), and Guinea had the highest PPVs (HRP2 assay, 95.32%; pLDH assay, 98.46%). On the contrary, NPVs were above 90% in all countries (HRP2 assay, 94.87%; pLDH assay, 93.36%). CONCLUSIONS: PPVs differed considerably within Africa when used to screen febrile children, indicating unfavorable performance of RDT-based test-and-treat algorithms in low-PPV settings. This suggests that the administration of antimalarials alone may not constitute causal treatment in the presence of a positive RDT result for a substantial proportion of patients, particularly in low-PPV settings. Therefore, current iCCM algorithms should be complemented by information on other setting-specific major causes of fever.","output":"Predictive Performance of Rapid Diagnostic Tests for Falciparum Malaria and Its Modeled Impact on Integrated Community Case Management of Malaria in Sub-Saharan African Febrile Children"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background and Purpose:With the surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients, neurology and neurosurgery residents and advanced practice providers (APPs) were deployed to intensive care units (ICU).

Because all CoVs use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates -1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored a group of 6 small-molecule ligands, evaluating their activity against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs--the most likely source of future zoonoses--as well as SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. We found that whereas some ligands had notable activity against only a few of the frameshift signals, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed -1 PRF significantly in several of them, while having limited to no effect on -1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls.

Randomized clinical trials and observational studies with propensity score matching comparing TAR versus non-TAR CABG were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. The current barriers to implementation of TAR in clinical practice and measures that can be used to optimize outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen publications (from 2012 to 2020) involving a total of 22,746 patients (TAR: 8,941 patients; non-TAR: 13,805 patients) were included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for long-term mortality (over 10 years) was lower in the TAR group than in the non-TAR group (random effect model: HR 0.676, 95% confidence interval 0.586-0.779, P<0.001). There was evidence of low heterogeneity of treatment effect among the studies for mortality, and none of the studies had a particular impact on the summary result.

By acknowledging that such cycles are detrimental for both employees and organizations, the present study aimed to contribute to enhancing the current scarce understanding regarding their explanatory mechanisms. For this purpose, it applied social cognitive theory to propose that occupational self-efficacy mediates the effects of two role stressors (i.e., role ambiguity and role conflict) on employee mental health complaints and vice versa. The hypothesized reciprocal mediation effects were tested using a three-wave full panel research design and a dataset of 917 (N(T1) = 513, N(T1+T2) = 122, N(T1+T3) = 70, N(T1+T2+T3) = 212) Croatian employees working in heterogeneous private sector industries. The results demonstrated that role conflict, but not role ambiguity, undermined employees beliefs in their capabilities to successfully master their jobs which, in turn, led them to experience more mental health complaints over time. Contrary to expectations, poor mental health did not lead to diminished efficacy beliefs nor, in turn, more job demands over time. Overall, the results of this study demonstrated an additional mechanism in the job demands-strain relationship and, at the same time, shed new light on the role of personal resources within the JDCR theory. Accounting for the malleable nature of employee efficacy beliefs, the study proposes several ways in which organizations can enhance occupational self-efficacy and thereby curb the causal chain linking job demands and employee strain reactions.","output":"Occupational Self-Efficacy as a Mediator in the Reciprocal Relationship between Job Demands and Mental Health Complaints: A Three-Wave Investigation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Liquorice foliage","output":"Glycyrrhiza glabra"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: One of the benefits of online education is the potential reduction in carbon emissions through the decrease in travel to attend a university in person. We estimated the savings in CO 2 emissions of an international cohort of master's students who studied fully online from their home countries, rather than travelling to the UK and living there while attending university. Methods: The city and country of residence of a cohort of students who first enrolled in the fully online Peoples-uni/Manchester Metropolitan University Master of Public Health programme between the second semester of 2011 and the first semester 2013 were recorded. Total difference in emissions was calculated by adding the estimated aviation emissions between Manchester, UK and the cities where students resided, to the difference in per capita emissions between the country of origin and the UK for the time that the student would have spent in Manchester, based on the semester in which they first enrolled. Results: 128 students enrolled from 55 cities in 31 countries. 93 students were from a range of African countries and 18 from the Indian sub-continent. Flights to and from Manchester were estimated to have accounted for 114,553kg of CO 2 and living in Manchester for the duration of their course compared with staying in the home country would have been equivalent to 854,904kg of CO 2. The combined net savings was 969,457kg of CO 2. Conclusions: A small cohort of overseas students, largely from Africa and India, studied online rather than attending university in the UK.

Inspired by the state-of-the-art AI training methods, we trained a human-centric hybrid augmented intelligence (HAI) to learn a foundation model6 that extracts all-encompassing knowledge of human physiology and diseases. To evaluate the quality of HAI's extracted knowledge, we designed the public, prospective prediction of pivotal ongoing clinical trial outcomes at large scale (PROTOCOLS) challenge to benchmark HAI's real-world performance of predicting drug clinical efficacy without access to human data. HAI achieved a 10.5-fold improvement from the baseline with 99% confidence in the PROTOCOLS validation, readily increasing the average clinical success rate of investigational new drugs from 7.9% to 90% for almost any human diseases. The validated HAI confirms that exponentially extracted knowledge alone is sufficient for accurately predicting drug clinical efficacy, effecting a total reversal of Eroom's aw. HAI is also the world's first clinically validated model of human aging that could substantially speed up the discovery of preventive medicine for all age-related diseases. Our results demonstrate that disruptive breakthroughs necessitate the smallest team size to attain the largest HAI for optimal knowledge extraction from high-dimensional low-quality data space, thus establishing the first prospective proof of the previous discovery that small teams disrupt.

We aim to develop a model helping planners assess expected COVID-19 hospital resource utilization based on individual patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop a model of patient clinical course based on an advanced multistate survival model. The model predicts the patient's disease course in terms of clinical statescritical, severe, or moderate. The model also predicts hospital utilization on the level of entire hospitals or healthcare systems. We cross-validated the model using a nationwide registry following the day-by-day clinical status of all hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Israel from March 1 to May 2, 2020 (n = 2703). RESULTS: Per-day mean absolute errors for predicted total and critical care hospital bed utilization were 4.72  1.07 and 1.68  0.40, respectively, over cohorts of 330 hospitalized patients; areas under the curve for prediction of critical illness and in-hospital mortality were 0.88  0.04 and 0.96  0.04, respectively. We further present the impact of patient influx scenarios on day-by-day healthcare system utilization. We provide an accompanying R software package. DISCUSSION: The proposed model accurately predicts total and critical care hospital utilization. The model enables evaluating impacts of patient influx scenarios on utilization, accounting for the state of currently hospitalized patients and characteristics of incoming patients. We show that accurate hospital load predictions were possible using only a patients age, sex, and day-by-day clinical state (critical, severe, or moderate).

We conducted an online questionnaire-based cross-sectional study with 422 Israeli respondents. Pandemic-related distress was defined by perceived stress, negative and positive affect, and worries. Predictors were: health locus of control, generalized self-efficacy, trait optimism, and intolerance of uncertainty. The findings show that CSEs and intolerance of uncertainty added between 11% (to perceived stress) and 22% (to negative affect) of explained variance beyond the background variables. Specifically, higher trait optimism and generalized self-efficacy were associated with less distress, and greater intolerance of uncertainty was correlated with higher distress. In conclusion, the CSE framework is useful for explaining psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beyond their theoretical contribution, the findings may have practical implications for increasing resilience and ameliorating distress during a pandemic.","output":"Core self-evaluations as resilience and risk factors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Exercise training during hospitalization may prevent loss of physical function and hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Additional data for clinical characteristics of the participants were collected from patient records. Results: 79 patients participated (mean  SD age 72  12 years; 42% women), of whom 25% had a low level of education and 46% lived alone. The median (IQR) length of the stay was 6 (4C10) days. A total of 67% of the participants wished to be more physically active. Walking as exercise was preferred by 51%. The most frequently reported barriers to exercise training were bodily pain (48%) and dizziness (42%).

It is necessary to immediately investigate this due to the mutation of the viral genome and there being no current protective vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Molecular modelling and molecular docking based on in silico screening strategies were employed to determine the potential activities of seven HIV protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors, two flu drugs, and eight natural compounds. The computational approach was carried out to discover the structural modes with a high binding affinity for these drugs on the homology structure of the Wuhan coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV-2 PR). From the theoretical calculations, all the drugs and natural compounds demonstrated various favorable binding affinities. An interesting finding was that the natural compounds tested had a higher potential binding activity with the pocket sites of SARS-CoV-2 PR compared to the groups of HIV-PR inhibitors. The binding modes of each complex illustrated between the drugs and compounds interacted with the functional group of amino acids in the binding pocket via hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions using the molecular dynamics simulation technique. This result supports the idea that existing protease inhibitors and natural compounds could be used to treat the new coronavirus.

METHODS: This was an observational study performed using a life-size head model to simulate tonsil surgery and fluorescein-soaked strawberries to mimic tonsils. The Coblation wand was activated over the strawberries for 5 minutes. This was repeated 5 times with 2 surgeons (totalling 10 data sets). The presence of droplet around the surgical field and anatomical subsites on the surgeon was assessed in binary fashion: present or not present. The results were collated as frequency of droplet detection and illustrated as a heatmap; 0 = white, 1-2 = yellow, 3-4 = orange, and 5 = red. RESULTS: Fluorescein droplets were detected in all 4 quadrants of the surgical field. The frequency of splatter was greatest in the upper (nearest to surgeon) and lower quadrants. There were detectable splatter droplets on the surgeon; most frequently occurring on the hands followed by the forearm. Droplets were also detected on the visor, neck, and chest albeit less frequently. However, none were detected on the upper arms.

Plain films are considered the first line imaging technique due to its ability to depict femoral head morphological changes, to its low costs and high availability. CT is not a routinely performed technique, but is useful to rule out the presence of a subchondral fracture when MRI is doubtful or contraindicated. MRI is unanimously considered the gold standard technique in the early stages, being capable to detect bone marrow changes such as edema and sclerosis.

Nuclear medicine imaging is mostly applied in post-operative period to detect graft viability or infective complications. More advanced techniques may be useful in particular conditions but still need to be validated; thus new research trials are desirable. In conclusion, X-ray examination is the first line approach, but lacks of sensitivity in early stage whereas MRI is indicated.

In this study, changes in the protein structure of the Mpro due to mutations in SARS-CoV-2 and the effects of these changes on boceprevir affinity, an important potential therapeutic agent, were investigated. The mutations were analyzed with RDP4 and MegaX. A three-dimensional model of mutant Mpro was generated by ProMod3. Qualitative Model Energy Analysis, ProSA, and MolProbity tools were used for structural validation and modeling of the wild-type and mutant Mpro proteins. Topological differences of the wild-type and mutant Mpro were calculated with the i-Tasser TM-Score. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock 4.2. Functional dynamic structure models were created with DynOmics. Seven mutations (L89F, K90R, P108S, A191V, T224A, A234V and S254F) were detected in the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. The mutations caused a decrease in the affinity of boceprevir, a potential protease inhibitor. The boceprevir was docked to the active site of Mpro, and the binding energies were ?10.34 and ?9.41 kcal.mol-1 for the wild-type and the mutant, respectively. The Debye-Waller factors calculated by elastic network model analysis were 0.58 and 0.64 ?2 for the wild-type Mpro and mutant Mpro, respectively.

Observations Prior to relaxation of stay-at-home orders in the US, the American College of Cardiology's Sports and Exercise Cardiology Section endorsed empirical consensus recommendations advising a conservative return-to-play approach, including cardiac risk stratification, for athletes in competitive sports who have recovered from COVID-19. Emerging observational data coupled with widely publicized reports of athletes in competitive sports with reported COVID-19-associated cardiac pathology suggest that myocardial injury may occur in cases of COVID-19 that are asymptomatic and of mild severity.

Working groups developed plans by discussion and consensus for resuming elective services in pulmonary and sleep-medicine clinics, pulmonary function testing laboratories, bronchoscopy and procedure suites, polysomnography laboratories, and pulmonary rehabilitation facilities.Results: The community new case rate should be consistently low or have a downward trajectory for at least 14 days before resuming elective clinical services. In addition, institutions should have an operational strategy that consists of patient prioritization, screening, diagnostic testing, physical distancing, infection control, and follow-up surveillance. The goals are to protect patients and staff from exposure to the virus, account for limitations in staff, equipment, and space that are essential for the care of patients with COVID-19, and provide access to care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.Conclusions: Transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a dynamic process and, therefore, it is likely that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community will wax and wane.

The most significant flaw in health systems today is a failure to value health but instead to count the costs of ill health, and the authors examine why this should be so from a range of perspectives. The costs of ill health are explored not only as an increasing portion of government spend, but also in relation to wider society, where entrenched inequalities result in the clustering of poor health, low educational attainment, and poor job prospects. The ways in which our health and the drivers of health have evolved are described, and their roles in preventing individuals from living well, learning, and working, are identified. The healthcare system is also examined, and revealed to be an illness service with little resilience, importing illness rather than exporting health, and failing to leverage the digital and technological innovations harnessed by other industries. The authors call for health to be valued, rather than ill health costed, and describe a 21st-century healthcare system that expands the NHS from an illness service to a true, total health service.

Drawing on the cases of Ebola and influenza, we map how sociological and anthropological research contributes in the modelling of pandemics to consider lessons for COVID-19. We show how models detach from their implementation contexts through their connections with global narratives of pandemic response, and how sociological and anthropological research can help to locate models differently. This potentiates multiple models of pandemic response attuned to their emerging situations in an iterative and adaptive science. We propose a more open approach to the modelling of pandemics which envisages the model as an intervention of deliberation in situations of evolving uncertainty.

Ocular specimens were obtained for testing. OBSERVATIONS: A 69-year-old African American woman developed poor vision while hospitalized for COVID-19 in April but did not seek ophthalmic care until end of May. She had an edematous cornea, stromal keratitis, and highly elevated intraocular pressure by June. After lack of response to oral valacyclovir, aqueous fluid and swabs of her conjunctiva and limbal epithelium with corneal epithelium anterior to the limbus were sent for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Epithelium from the cornea and limbus was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR; specimens from the other two ocular sites were negative. All specimens were negative for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus. The patient refused further treatment despite intraocular pressure above 50 mm Hg at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Although SARS-CoV-2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) have been detected by PCR in the conjunctiva and tears of patients with acute respiratory infection, presence in corneal tissue has not been described.

Our method starts with racemic 2-arylbenzaldehydes and sulfonamides as the substrates and N-heterocyclic carbenes as the organocatalysts to afford axially chiral benzonitriles in good to excellent yields and enantioselectivities. DFT calculations suggest that the loss of p-toluenesulfinate group is both the rate-determining and stereo-determining step. The axial chirality is controlled during the bond dissociation and CN group formation. The reaction features a dynamic kinetic resolution process modulated by both covalent and non-covalent catalytic interactions. The axially chiral benzonitriles from our method can be easily converted to a large set of functional molecules that show promising catalytic activities for chemical syntheses and anti-bacterial activities for plant protections.","output":"Catalytic atroposelective synthesis of axially chiral benzonitriles via chirality control during bond dissociation and CN group formation."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Drosophila melanogaster silver gene is the ortholog of the coding gene of mammalian carboxypeptidase D (CPD).

Overall, DmCPD1Bs conforms to the structure of N/E-type funnelins/M14B metallopeptidases, but it has two unique structural elements potentially involved in regulation of its activity: (i) two contiguous surface cysteines that may become palmitoylated and target the enzyme to membranes, thus providing control through localization, and (ii) a surface hot spot targetable by peptidases that would provide a regulatory mechanism through proteolytic inactivation. Given that the fruit fly possesses orthologs of only two out of the five proteolytically competent N/E-type funnelins found in higher vertebrates, DmCPD1Bs may represent a functional analog of at least one of the missing mammalian CPs.","output":"StructureCFunction Analysis of the Short Splicing Variant Carboxypeptidase Encoded by Drosophila melanogaster silver"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic, a worldwide health and humanitarian crisis, has created unique challenges for citizens, governments, and organizations alike.

Demographic trends from the recent COVID waves, which are believed to be driven by new SARS-CoV-2 variants, indicate that the aforementioned epidemiological barriers are being breached and a larger number of younger and healthy individuals are developing severe disease. The new SARS-CoV-2 variants have key mutations that can induce significant changes in the virus-host interactions. Recent studies report that, some of these mutations, singly or in a group, enhanced key mechanisms, such as binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein with the ACE2 receptor in the host cells, increased glycosylation of spike protein at antigenic sites, and proteolytic cleavage of the spike protein, leading to improved host cell entry and replication of the virus. The putative changes in the virus-host interactions imparted by the mutations in the RBD sequence can potentially be the reason behind the breach of the observed epidemiological barriers. Susceptibility for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease outcomes are known to be influenced by host expressions of ACE2 and other proteases. The new variants can act more efficiently, and even on the lower concentrations of the viral entry receptor and associated proteases, thus can have more efficient host cell entry and greater replication resulting in higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding, and widespread tissue injury, and severe inflammation leading to increased transmissibility and lethality.

RESULTS: Almost 93% of patients achieved clinically relevant pain relief within 4 days (median). Over 90% of patients with neuropathic pain or mixed pain and all patients with nociceptive pain were responders. Pain intensity significantly decreased from baseline through to the end of maintenance period in opioid-na?ve and opioid-tolerant patients. No patients discontinued tapentadol due to serious adverse events. No opioid-na?ve patients experienced nausea or vomiting during tapentadol treatment. Only three opioid-tolerant patients experienced nausea which was considered to be related to tapentadol. CONCLUSION: Tapentadol is effective and well tolerated in opioid-na?ve and opioid-tolerant patients with cancer pain of varying pathophysiology, including those with nociceptive and/or neuropathic components. Tapentadol may be considered for first-line use in moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain.","output":"Tapentadol is effective in the management of moderate-to-severe cancer-related pain in opioid-na?ve and opioid-tolerant patients: a retrospective study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introdu??o Sabe-se que a infec??o por SARSCOV2  notavelmente marcada por fen?menos inflamatrios exacerbados e envolvimento tanto da imunidade inata quanto adaptativa, por meio de respostas imunes complexas.

Thus, its pertinent to evaluate various diversified clinical specimens diagnostic utility in both diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19. METHODS: A total of 924 initial specimens from 130 COVID-19 symptomatic cases before initiation of treatment and 665 follow up specimens from 15 randomly selected cases comprising of equal number of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), combined NPS and OPS (Combined swab), sputum, plasma, serum and urine were evaluated by rRT-PCR. RESULTS: Demographic analysis showed males (86) twice more affected by COVID-19 than females (44) (p = 0.00001). Combined swabs showed a positivity rate of 100% followed by NPS (91.5%), OPS (72.3%), sputum (63%), while nCoV was found undetected in urine, plasma and serum specimens. The lowest cycle threshold (Ct) values of targeted genes E, ORF1b and RdRP are 10.56, 10.14 and 12.26 respectively and their lowest average Ct values were found in combined swab which indicates high viral load in combined swab among all other specimen types. Analysis of 665 follow-up multi-varied specimens also showed combined swab as the last specimen among all specimen types to become negative, after an average 6.6 (range 4C10) days post-treatment, having lowest (15.48) and average (29.96) Ct values of ORF1b respectively indicating posterior nasopharyngeal tract as primary nCoV afflicted site with high viral load. CONCLUSION: The combined swab may be recommended as a more appropriate specimen for both diagnosis and monitoring of COVID-19 treatment by rRT-PCR for assessing virus clearance to help physicians in taking evidence-based decision before discharging patients. Implementing combined swabs globally will definitely help in management and control of the pandemic, as it is the need of the hour.","output":"Comparative analysis of various clinical specimens in detection of SARS-CoV-2 using rRT-PCR in new and follow up cases of COVID-19 infection: Quest for the best choice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE To analyze the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with cancer in hospital care after implementation of institutional and governmental safety measurements. METHODS Patients with cancer routinely tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by nasal swab and real-time polymerase chain reaction between March 21 and May 4, 2020, were included. The results of this cancer cohort were statistically compared with the SARS-CoV-2 prevalence in the Austrian population as determined by a representative nationwide random sample study (control cohort 1) and a cohort of patients without cancer presenting to our hospital (control cohort 2). RESULTS A total of 1,688 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 1,016 consecutive patients with cancer were performed. A total of 270 of 1,016 (26.6%) of the patients were undergoing active anticancer treatment in a neoadjuvant/adjuvant and 560 of 1,016 (55.1%) in a palliative setting. A total of 53 of 1,016 (5.2%) patients self-reported symptoms potentially associated with COVID-19. In 4 of 1,016 (0.4%) patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected. At the time of testing at our department, all four SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were asymptomatic, and two of them had recovered from symptomatic COVID-19. Viral clearance was achieved in three of the four patients 14-56 days after testing positive. The estimated odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence between the cancer cohort and control cohort 1 was 1.013 (95% CI, 0.209 to 4.272; P = 1), and between control cohort 2 and the cancer cohort it was 18.333 (95% CI, 6.056 to 74.157). CONCLUSION Our data indicate that continuation of active anticancer therapy and follow-up visits in a large tertiary care hospital are feasible and safe after implementation of strict population-wide and institutional safety measures during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

They may also have specific beliefs about the impact of COVID-19-related changes on their capacity to perform, with potential consequences for self-efficacy and academic performance. Two weeks after the COVID-19-related transition to online-only learning, 89 first-year psychology students completed a measure of academic self-efficacy and indicated how they thought COVID-19-related changes would impact their capacity to perform in a psychology subject. At the end of the semester, subject grades were obtained from institutional records. Contrary to expectations, neither the self-efficacy beliefs nor the subject grades of the 2020 cohort were significantly different from those of a sample of 2019 first-year psychology students (n = 85). On average, 2020 students believed that COVID-19-related changes to their learning environment had a negative impact on their capacity to perform well. A mediation analysis indicated that students beliefs about the impact of COVID-19 on their capacity did not directly, or indirectly (via self-efficacy), predict grades. The only significant association in the model was between self-efficacy and grades. Although students reported believing that COVID-19-related changes would negatively impact their capacity to perform, there is little evidence that these beliefs influenced their academic self-efficacy or academic performance or that studying during the COVID-19 outbreak disadvantaged students in comparison with the previous years. A follow-up analysis indicated that self-efficacy was a stronger predictor of grades in the 2020 cohort than in the 2019 cohort. While there may be several unmeasured reasons for cohort differences, one potential interpretation is that, in the context of uncertainty associated with COVID-19, self-efficacy beliefs assumed relatively greater importance in terms of mobilising the resources required to perform well.","output":"COVID-19 Beliefs, Self-Efficacy and Academic Performance in First-year University Students: Cohort Comparison and Mediation Analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Despite being symmetric in its very nature, the Covid-19 shock is affecting European economies in a very asymmetric way, threatening to deepen the divide between core and peripheral countries even more.

Both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein are heavily glycosylated, including at sites near their binding interface. We built fully glycosylated models of the ACE2 receptor bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we found that the glycosylation of the human ACE2 receptor contributes substantially to the binding of the virus. Interestingly, the glycans at two glycosylation sites, N90 and N322, have opposite effects on spike protein binding. The glycan at the N90 site partly covers the binding interface of the spike RBD. Therefore, this glycan can interfere with the binding of the spike protein and protect against docking of the virus to the cell. By contrast, the glycan at the N322 site interacts tightly with the RBD of the ACE2-bound spike protein and strengthens the complex. Remarkably, the N322 glycan binds into a conserved region of the spike protein identified previously as a cryptic epitope for a neutralizing antibody.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature review through an independent electronic search of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed, Medline, Google, and Google Scholar was performed on April 26-30, 2020. Resources identified comprised of published papers, national and international pediatric ENT society guidelines. RESULTS: Fourteen guidelines fit the inclusion criteria. Key statements were formulated and graded: 1) Strong recommendation (reported by 9 or more/14); 2) Fair recommendation (7-8/14); 3) Weak recommendation (5-6/14); and 4) Expert opinion (2-4/14). Any single source suggestion was included as a comment. Highly scored recommendations included definition of urgent/emergent cases that required surgery; surgery for acute airway obstruction; prompt diagnosis of suspected cancer; and surgical intervention for sepsis following initial first-line medical management. Other well scored recommendations included senior faculty to perform the surgery; the use of open approaches rather than endoscopic ones; and avoidance of powered instruments that would aerosolize virus-loaded tissue.

RESULTS: Of 1,213 PIDS members, 161 (13.3%) completed the survey, and the responses of 154 (12.7%) from the US were included in our report. Medical school (63.6%) and hospital (44.8%) were the commonest work settings with 16.9% practicing in both of them. The most common TH modalities used were synchronous provider-patient virtual visits (20.8%) and synchronous provider-provider consultations (13.6%). TH services included outpatient consultations (48.1%), vaccine recommendations (43.5%), inpatient consultations (39.6%) and travel advice (39.6%). Barriers perceived by respondents included reimbursement (55.8%), lack of experience with TH (55.2%), lack of institutional support (52.6%), lack of administrative support (50%), and cost of implementation (48.7%). Most respondents (144, 93.5%) were interested in implementing a wide range of TH modalities. CCs accounted for 1-20 hours/week among 148 respondents.

METHODS We combined individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE, ESPS-2, MATCH, CHARISMA, ESPRIT, and PRoFESS) investigating antiplatelet therapy after TIA or ischemic stroke. Cox regression analyses stratified by trial were performed to study the association between predictors and major bleeding. A risk prediction model was derived and validated in the PERFORM trial. Performance was assessed with the c statistic and calibration plots. RESULTS Major bleeding occurred in 1,530 of the 43,112 patients during 94,833 person-years of follow-up. The observed 3-year risk of major bleeding was 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4%-4.9%). Predictors were male sex, smoking, type of antiplatelet agents (aspirin-clopidogrel), outcome on modified Rankin Scale 3, prior stroke, high blood pressure, lower body mass index, elderly, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes (S2TOP-BLEED). The S2TOP-BLEED score had a c statistic of 0.63 (95% CI 0.60-0.64) and showed good calibration in the development data. Major bleeding risk ranged from 2% in patients aged 45-54 years without additional risk factors to more than 10% in patients aged 75-84 years with multiple risk factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were immunized initially by intramuscular injection and boosted 3 weeks later by intranasal application. Expression of the S1 protein in the lungs and kidneys was detected using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) targeting specific regions within the S1 subunit at weeks 3, 4, 5, and 6 after the first vaccination. Antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated in serum and in cell culture following in vitro stimulation with a specific 9-mer epitope within the S1 protein (CYSSLILDY). RESULTS: S1 protein expression was only detected by IHC in the kidneys of the Ad-MERS-S1 group at week 6 from first immunization, and in both lungs and kidneys of Ad-MERS-S1 group by conventional PCR at weeks 3 and 5 post-prime. The vaccine elicited a specific S1-immunoglobulin G antibody response, which was detected in the sera of the vaccinated mice at weeks 4 and 6 from the onset of the first immunization.

CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that this recombinant adenovirus vaccine encoding the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV elicits potentially protective antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. This study demonstrates a promising vaccine for the control and/or prevention of MERS-CoV infection in humans.","output":"Recombinant adenoviral vaccine encoding the spike 1 subunit of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus elicits strong humoral and cellular immune responses in mice"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Anaphase chromosome movement is thought to be mediated by pulling forces generated by end-on attachment of microtubules to the outer face of kinetochores. However, it has been suggested that during C. elegans female meiosis, anaphase is mediated by a kinetochore-independent pushing mechanism with microtubules only attached to the inner face of segregating chromosomes. We found that the kinetochore proteins KNL-1 and KNL-3 are required for preanaphase chromosome stretching, suggesting a role in pulling forces. In the absence of KNL-1,3, pairs of homologous chromosomes did not separate and did not move toward a spindle pole. Instead, each homolog pair moved together with the same spindle pole during anaphase B spindle elongation. Two masses of chromatin thus ended up at opposite spindle poles, giving the appearance of successful anaphase.","output":"Evidence for anaphase pulling forces during C. elegans meiosis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Responses of subnational government units are crucial in the containment of the spread of pathogens in a country. To mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine national government through its Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases outlined different quarantine measures wherein each level has a corresponding degree of rigidity from keeping only the essential businesses open to allowing all establishments tooperate at a certain capacity. Other measures also involve prohibiting individuals at a certain age bracket from going outside of their homes. The local government units (LGUs){municipalities and provinces{can adopt any of these measures depending on the extent of the pandemic in their locality. The purpose is to keep the number of infections and mortality at bay while minimizing the economic impact of the pandemic. Some LGUs have demonstrated a remarkable response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to identify notable non-pharmaceutical interventions of these outlying LGUs in the country using quantitative methods. Methods: Data come from public databases such as Philippine Department of Health, Philippine Statistics Authority Census, and Google Community Mobility Reports. These are normalized using Z-transform. For each locality, infection and mortality data (dataset Y ) are compared to the economic, health, and demographic data (dataset X) using Euclidean metric d = (x - y)2, where x  X and y  Y . If a data pair (x;y) exceeds, by two standard deviations, themean of the Euclidean metric values between the sets X and Y , the pair is assumed to be a 'good' outlier. Results: Our results showed that cluster of cities and provinces in Central Luzon (Region III), CALABARZON (Region IV-A), the National Capital Region (NCR), and Central Visayas (Region VII) are the 'good' outliers with respect to factors such as working population, population density, ICU beds, doctors on quarantine, number of frontliners and gross regional domestic product. Among metropolitan cities, Davao was a 'good' outlier with respect to demographic factors. Conclusions: Strict border control, early implementation of lockdowns, establishment of quarantine facilities, effective communication to the public, and monitoring efforts were the defining factors that helped these LGUs curtail the harm that was brought by the pandemic. If these policies are to be standardized, it would help any country's preparedness for future health emergencies.","output":"Local Government Responses for COVID-19 Management in the Philippines"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"COVID-19 may drive sustained research in robotics to address risks of infectious diseases.","output":"Combating COVID-19-The role of robotics in managing public health and infectious diseases"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of Emergency Preparedness & Response (EP&R) education, training, capacity building and infrastructure development in India.

The polypharmacological feature in drugs enables us to find new uses for existing drugs (namely drug repositioning). However, current computational methods for drug repositioning mainly consider proteins as drug targets. Meanwhile, these methods identify only statistical relationships between drugs and diseases. They provide little information about how drug-disease associations are formed at the molecular target level. METHODS: Herein, we first comprehensively collect proteins and two categories of ncRNAs as drug targets from public databases to construct drug-target interactions. Experimentally confirmed drug-disease associations are downloaded from an established database. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based method is then applied to the two datasets to extract correlated sets of targets and diseases. The correlated sets are regarded as canonical components, and they are used to investigate drug's mechanism of actions. We finally develop a strategy to predict novel drug-disease associations for drug repositioning by combining all the extracted correlated sets. RESULTS: We receive 400 canonical components which correlate targets with diseases in our study. We select 4 components for analysis and find some top-ranking diseases in an extracted set might be treated by drugs interfacing with the top-ranking targets in the same set. Experimental results from 10-fold cross-validations show integrating different categories of target information results in better prediction performance than only using proteins or ncRNAs as targets. When compared with 3 state-of-the-art approaches, our method receives the highest AUC value 0.8576. We use our method to predict new indications for 789 drugs and confirm 24 predictions in the top 1 predictions. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational effort which combines both proteins and ncRNAs as drug targets for drug repositioning. Our study provides a biologically relevant interpretation regarding the forming of drug-disease associations, which is useful for guiding future biomedical tests.","output":"In silico drug repositioning based on integrated drug targets and canonical correlation analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Corona virus disease (COVID-19) emerged as an epidemic from China, with quick spread globally.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We described and compared the clinical presentation and radiological and hematological data of a cohort of symptomatic COVID19 positive T2DM diabetic patients (n = 59) versus another cohort of non-diabetic symptomatic COVID19 positive patients (n =244) diagnosed at the same time from January 2020 to May 2020. Associated comorbidities were assessed, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated. The outcomes including duration of hospitalization, duration of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and duration of O2 supplementation were assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence of T2DM in symptomatic COVID19 positive patients was 59/303 (=19.5%). Diabetic patients had higher prevalence of hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiac dysfunction [coronary heart disease (CHD)], and congestive heart failure (CHF). Charlson Comorbidity score was significantly higher in the T2DM patients (2.4 1.6) versus the non-diabetic patients (0.28  0.8; p: < 0.001). Clinically and radiologically, T2DM patients had significantly higher percentage of pneumonia, severe pneumonia and ARDS versus the non-diabetic patients. Hematologically, diabetic patients had significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP), higher absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) and lower counts of lymphocytes and eosinophils compared to non-diabetic patients. They had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, longer duration of hospitalization, ICU stay, mechanical ventilation and oxygen therapy. CRP was correlated significantly with the duration of stay in the ICU and the duration for oxygen supplementation (r = 0.37 and 0.42 respectively; p: <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: T2DM patients showed higher inflammatory response to COVID 19 with higher absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) and CRP with lower lymphocytic and eosinophilic counts.

From its first appearance in the city of Wuhan (China), the infection spread worldwide, leading to its declaration as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Clinical research on SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) suggests that the virus may determine changes in the pulmonary hemodynamics through mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction, vascular leak, thrombotic microangiopathy, and venous thromboembolism that are similar to those leading to pulmonary hypertension (PH). Current available studies report echocardiographic signs of PH in approximately 12 to 13% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Those with chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, and prior PH are at increased risk to develop or worsen PH. Evidence of PH seems to be associated with increased disease severity and poor outcome.

Objective To empirically explore the extent of basic accommodations physicians practicing in the US provide to patients with significant vision limitations in outpatient care. Design, Setting, and Participants In this physician survey study, randomly selected physicians were surveyed throughout the US on their attitudes toward patients with disability. A total of 1400 randomly selected active board-certified physicians representing 7 specialties (family medicine, general internal medicine, rheumatology, neurology, ophthalmology, orthopedic surgery, and obstetrics-gynecology) were surveyed. Data were collected from October 2019 to June 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Reported use of basic accommodations when caring for patients with significant vision limitations (defined here as blind or significant difficulty seeing even with glasses or other corrective lenses). Physicians' accommodation performance was assessed based on whether they always or usually described the clinic space and always or usually provided printed material in large font. Use of Braille materials was reported too rarely to include in analyses. Results Of the 462 survey participants, 297 of 457 (65.0%) were male. The weighted response rate was 61.0%. Only 48 physicians (9.1%; 95% CI, 6.6-12.3) provided both accommodations (always or usually describing clinic spaces and providing large-font materials), while 267 (60.2%; 95% CI, 55.3-65.0) provided neither of these accommodations. Although 62.8% (95% CI, 57.5-67.8; n = 245) of nonophthalmologists did not provide either accommodation, 29.3% (95% CI, 20.1-40.7; n = 22) of ophthalmologists also did not do so; only 24.0% (95% CI, 15.6-35.0; n = 18) of ophthalmologists provided both accommodations compared with 8.4% (95% CI, 5.4-12.7) of other physicians.

Replication of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is the likely target of the investigational nucleotide analogue remdesivir (RDV). RDV shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against RNA viruses, and previous studies with RdRps from Ebola virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have revealed that delayed chain termination is RDV's plausible mechanism of action. Here, we expressed and purified active SARS-CoV-2 RdRp composed of the nonstructural proteins nsp8 and nsp12. Enzyme kinetics indicated that this RdRp efficiently incorporates the active triphosphate form of RDV (RDV-TP) into RNA. Incorporation of RDV-TP at position i caused termination of RNA synthesis at position i+3. We obtained almost identical results with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 RdRps. A unique property of RDV-TP is its high selectivity over incorporation of its natural nucleotide counterpart ATP. In this regard, the triphosphate forms of 2-C-methylated compounds, including sofosbuvir, approved for the management of hepatitis C virus infection, and the broad-acting antivirals favipiravir and ribavirin, exhibited significant deficits. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the target specificity of RDV, as RDV-TP was less efficiently incorporated by the distantly related Lassa virus RdRp, and termination of RNA synthesis was not observed. These results collectively provide a unifying, refined mechanism of RDV-mediated RNA synthesis inhibition in coronaviruses and define this nucleotide analogue as a direct-acting antiviral.","output":"Remdesivir is a direct-acting antiviral that inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with high potency"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Over the past several decades, rapidly growing popularity of airline transportation has pushed many passengers and crew to focus on potential risk of contaminant transmission during commercial air travel. Understanding airflow dynamics and transport property within an aircraft cabin is critical to creating a healthy cabin environment and improving control of epidemics. This work reveals the temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region and evaluates impact of airflows large-scale flow structures (swing motion around the aisle region and large-scale vortices) on transport property by calculating traces of marked fluid particles (MFPs) passing through passengers exhalation area within a Boeing 737-200 cabin mock-up. The Peixoto theorem has been used to interpret temporal and spatial evolution process of large-scale flow structures around the aisle region. Transport property within this single-aisle aircraft cabin is a mixed effect of the airflows swing motion, large-scale vortices and longitudinal airflow. Airflows swing motion around the aisle region tends to carry MFPs nearby across the aisle region and invade the large-scale vortex in the opposite side. The large-scale vortices try to control MFPs in its each separated zone. The airflows swing motion and large-scale vortices dominate MFPs latitudinal transmission, while longitudinal airflow dominates MFPs longitudinal transmission.","output":"Evolution of large-scale flow structures and traces of marked fluid particles within a single-aisle cabin mock-up"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: Code status orders impact clinical outcomes as well as patients and surrogates experiences. This is the first multicenter cohort examining status orders of ICU patients with COVID-19 reported to date. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study including adult patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted to the ICU at three hospitals in Massachusetts from March 11, 2020 - May 31, 2020. We examined differences in code status orders at multiple timepoints and performed multivariable regression analysis to identify variables associated with code status at admission. RESULTS: Among 459 ICU patients with COVID-19, 421 (91.7%) were Full Code at hospital admission. Age and admission from a facility were positively associated with DNR status (adjusted OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.05-1.15, p < 0.001; adjusted OR 2.68, CI 1.23-5.71, p = 0.011) while non-English preferred language was negatively associated with DNR status (adjusted OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.74, p = 0.012). Among 147 patients who died during hospitalization, 95.2% (140) died with DNR code status; most (86.4%) died within two days of final code status change.

METHODS: This was a historical cohort study of pregnant mothers with pregestational type 2 diabetes delivering at a Canadian tertiary-care center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Delivery records were reviewed to collect information about demographics and peripartum complications. Stored fetal ultrasound images from 36 weeks' gestation were reviewed to collect fetal biometry and postprocessing measurement of AWT performed in a standardized fashion by 2 blinded and independent observers. The relationship between fetal AWT was then correlated with risk of intrapartum complications including emergency Caesarean section (CS) and shoulder dystocia. RESULTS: 216 pregnant women with type 2 diabetes had planned vaginal deliveries and were eligible for inclusion. Mean maternal age was 31.3 years, and almost all were overweight or obese at the time of delivery (96.8%). Overall, the incidence of shoulder dystocia and emergency intrapartum CS was 7.4% and 17.6%, respectively. There was no difference in mean fetal AWT between those having a spontaneous vaginal delivery (8.2 mm (95% CI 7.9-8.5)) and those needing emergency intrapartum CS (8.1 mm (95% CI 7.4-8.8); p = 0.71) or shoulder dystocia (8.7 mm (95% CI 7.9-9.5); p = 0.23). There was strong interobserver correlation of AWT measurements (r = 0.838; p < 0.00001). The strongest association with intrapartum complications was birthweight (p = 0.003): with birthweight > 4000 grams, the relative risk of shoulder dystocia or CS is 2.75 (95% CI 1.74-4.36; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: There was no obvious benefit of AWT measurement at 36 weeks for predicting shoulder dystocia or intrapartum CS amongst women with type 2 diabetes in our population. The strongest predictor of intrapartum complications remained birthweight, and so studies for improving estimation of fetal weight and evaluating the role of intrapartum ultrasound for predicting risk of delivery complications are still needed.","output":"The Relationship between Fetal Abdominal Wall Thickness and Intrapartum Complications amongst Mothers with Pregestational Type 2 Diabetes"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The pandemic of COVID-19 has an unprecedented impact on global health and economy The novel SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as the etiological agent of current outbreak Because of its contagious human-to-human transmission, it is an utmost global health emergency at present To mitigate this threat many scientists and researchers are racing to develop antiviral therapy against the virus Unfortunately, to date no vaccine or antiviral therapeutic is approved thus there is an urgent need to discover antiviral agent to help the individual who are at high risk Virus main protease or chymotrypsin-like protease plays a pivotal role in virus replication and transcription;thus, it is considered as an attractive drug target to combat the COVID-19 In this study, multistep structure based virtual screening of CAS antiviral database is performed for the identification of potent and effective small molecule inhibitors against chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 Consensus scoring strategy combine with flexible docking is used to extract potential hits As a result of extensive virtual screening, 4 hits were shortlisted for MD simulation to study their stability and dynamic behavior Insight binding modes demonstrated that the selected hits stabilized inside the binding pocket of the target protein and exhibit complementarity with the active site residues Our study provides compounds for further in vitro and in vivo studies against SARS-CoV-2","output":"Probing CAS database As Prospective Antiviral Agents Against SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Purpose: To validate the Rosenbaum near vision card (Near Chart) and a smartphone-based visual acuity (VA) test (Eye Chart) against a standard retro-illuminated Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart within participants Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study of participants aged &gt;=18 years was conducted VA was measured in all participants using the ETDRS chart, Near Chart and smartphone-based Eye Chart application, respectively VA was converted to logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) for statistical analysis Eyes with ETDRS VA worse than 1 0 logMAR (20/200) were excluded The main outcome measures were levels of agreement between VA measured using the Near Chart or Eye Chart application vs the ETDRS chart Results: A total of 295 eyes of 151 participants were included One hundred participants (66 2%) were female and the mean age was 64 3 +/- 12 5 years Educational level was high school or below for 49% of participants and at Bachelor's degree or above for 51% The median logMAR VAs of all eyes tested using the ETDRS chart, Near Chart and Eye Chart application were 0 1, 0 0 and 0 1, respectively The median VA difference between the Near Chart vs ETDRS chart and Eye Chart application vs ETDRS chart was 0 0 logMAR in both cases for both the right eye (OD) and left eye (OS) Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) demonstrated a strong positive correlation between VA tested with the Near Chart vs ETDRS chart (OD: ICC=0 85;p&lt;0 001, OS: ICC=0 77;p&lt;0 001) and Eye Chart application vs ETDRS chart (OD: ICC=0 88;p&lt;0 001, OS: ICC=0 74;p&lt;0 001) Conclusion: VA measurements with the Near Chart and smartphone-based Eye Chart application corresponded well to the standard ETDRS chart, suggesting potential utility of alternative portable VA tests for in-office or remote vision monitoring, particularly during periods of physical distancing such as the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era","output":"Comparison of Visual Acuity Measurement Using Three Methods: Standard ETDRS Chart, Near Chart and a Smartphone-Based Eye Chart Application"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 38-year-old emergency medical service Bell 214 male pilot with a dry cough, fever, anorexia, fatigue, and sweating for the past 3 days; an oral temperature of 38C; blood pressure of 105/65 mm Hg; heart rate of 94 beats/min; respiratory rate of 21 breaths/min; and pulse oximetry of 93% on room air was suspicious for coronavirus disease 2019.

The overall number of ZIKV-related cases increased until November 2016, after which it declined sharply. While the evaluation of the potential risk and impact of future arbovirus epidemics remains challenging, intensified surveillance efforts along with a scale-up of ZIKV whole-genome sequencing provide an opportunity to understand the patterns of genetic diversity, evolution, and spread of ZIKV. However, a classification system that reflects the true extent of ZIKV genetic variation is lacking. Our objective was to characterize ZIKV genetic diversity and phylodynamics, identify genomic footprints of differentiation patterns, and propose a dynamic classification system that reflects its divergence levels. We analysed a curated dataset of 762 publicly available sequences spanning the full-length coding region of ZIKV from across its geographical span and collected between 1947 and 2021. The definition of genetic groups was based on comprehensive evolutionary dynamics analyses, which included recombination and phylogenetic analyses, within- and between-group pairwise genetic distances comparison, detection of selective pressure, and clustering analyses. Evidence for potential recombination events was detected in a few sequences. However, we argue that these events are likely due to sequencing errors as proposed in previous studies. There was evidence of strong purifying selection, widespread across the genome, as also detected for other arboviruses. A total of 50 sites showed evidence of positive selection, and for a few of these sites, there was amino acid (AA) differentiation between genetic clusters. Two main genetic clusters were defined, ZA and ZB, which correspond to the already characterized African and Asian genotypes, respectively. Within ZB, two subgroups, ZB.1 and ZB.2, represent the Asiatic and the American (and Oceania) lineages, respectively. ZB.1 is further subdivided into ZB.1.0 (a basal Malaysia sequence sampled in the 1960s and a recent Indian sequence), ZB.1.1 (South-Eastern Asia, Southern Asia, and Micronesia sequences), and ZB.1.2 (very similar sequences from the outbreak in Singapore). ZB.2 is subdivided into ZB.2.0 (basal American sequences and the sequences from French Polynesia, the putative origin of South America introduction), ZB.2.1 (Central America), and ZB.2.2 (Caribbean and North America).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply an implementation science framework to identify implementation factors and best practices for social needs screening and response. METHODS: Guided by the Health Equity Implementation Framework (HEIF), we collected qualitative data from clinicians and patients to evaluate barriers and facilitators to implementing the Protocol for Responding to and Assessing Patients Assets, Risks, and Experiences (PRAPARE), a standardized social needs screening and response protocol, in a federally qualified health center. Eligible patients who received the PRAPARE as a standard of care were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. We also obtained front-line clinician perspectives in a semi-structured focus group. HEIF domains informed a directed content analysis. RESULTS: Patients and clinicians (i.e., case managers) reported implementation barriers and facilitators across multiple domains (e.g., clinical encounters, patient and provider factors, inner context, outer context, and societal influence). Implementation barriers included structural and policy level determinants related to resource availability, discrimination, and administrative burden. Facilitators included evidence-based clinical techniques for shared decision making (e.g., motivational interviewing), team-based staffing models, and beliefs related to alignment of the PRAPARE with patient-centered care. We found high levels of patient acceptability and opportunities for adaptation to increase equitable adoption and reach. CONCLUSION: Our results provide practical insight into the implementation of the PRAPARE or similar social needs screening and response protocols in primary care at the individual encounter, organizational, community, and societal levels. Future research should focus on developing discrete implementation strategies to promote social needs screening and response, and associated multisector care coordination to improve health outcomes and equity for vulnerable and marginalized patient populations.

This review summarizes the rationale for antibiotic use in animal agriculture, therapeutic classes used, risks from antibiotic-resistant organisms, and limits of existing regulation. In addition, opportunities for improved surveillance, stewardship, and advocacy will be highlighted. METHODS: A transdisciplinary narrative review of drivers of antibiotics in food production was conducted, including concepts from population health, infectious diseases, veterinary medicine, and consumer advocacy. FINDINGS: Globally, antibiotics of many important classes in human medicine are given to animals for the treatment of a diagnosed illness, disease control and prevention, and growth promotion. Extensive antibiotic use on farms drives the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms in food-producing animals, which can be transmitted to people and the environment. Antibiotic stewardship in food production has been associated with decreased rates of resistance in both animals and humans, without reducing farm productivity. Multiple European nations have successfully implemented stewardship strategies, including banning uses for disease prevention, benchmarking antibiotic utilization, and setting national reduction targets. In the United States, medically important antibiotics are no longer permitted for growth promotion; however, antibiotics may be prescribed for other indications with limited veterinary oversight and requirements for reporting. Marked reductions in use have been achieved in the poultry industry, although use in the pork and beef industries remain high. IMPLICATIONS: Despite some progress, significant challenges in surveillance and regulatory oversight remain to prevent the overuse of antibiotics in food production. Consumers remain a potent force via market pressure on grocery stores, restaurants, suppliers, and farmers. Improved, verified labelling is important for informing consumer choices.

METHODS: This retrospective study consisted of 5,766 persons-under-investigation for COVID-19 between 7 February 2020 and 4 May 2020. Demographics, chronic comorbidities, vital signs, symptoms and laboratory tests at admission were collected. A deep neural network model and a risk-score system were constructed to predict ICU admission and in-hospital mortality. Prediction performance used the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: The top ICU predictors were procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin and oxygen saturation. The top mortality predictors were age, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, cardiac troponin, C-reactive protein and oxygen saturation. Age and troponin were unique top predictors for mortality but not ICU admission. The deep-learning model predicted ICU admission and mortality with an AUC of 0.780 (95% CI [0.760C0.785]) and 0.844 (95% CI [0.839C0.848]), respectively. The corresponding risk scores yielded an AUC of 0.728 (95% CI [0.726C0.729]) and 0.848 (95% CI [0.847C0.849]), respectively.

Study of PML-type JCPyV in vitro has been limited due to difficulty in efficient propagation of the virus in cultured cells. In this study, we carried out long term cultivation of COS-7 cells (designated as COS-IMRb cells) transfected with PML type M1-IMRb, an adapted viral DNA with a rearranged non-coding control region (NCCR). The JCPyV derived from COS-IMRb cells was characterized by analyzing viral replication, amount of virus by hemagglutination (HA), production of viral protein 1 (VP1), and structure of the NCCR. HA assays indicated that a high amount of PML type JCPyV was present in COS-IMRb cells. Immunostaining showed that VP1-positive cells were a small population in COS-IMRb cells that represented a JCPyV carrier cell culture. Sequencing analysis of the NCCR of JCPyV after long-term cultivation showed that the NCCR of M1-IMRb was conserved in COS-IMRb cells without any point mutation. The JCPyV genomic DNA derived from a clone of COS-IMRb-3 cells was detected by Southern blotting as a single band of approximately 5.1 kbp without deletion. These findings support that COS-IMRb-3 cells may offer a useful tool for screening anti-JCPyV drugs.","output":"Characterziation of JC polyomavirus derived from COS-IMRb cells"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Effective and efficient management of human betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus infection i.e., COVID-19 pandemic, required sensitive and selective sensors with short sample-to-result durations for performing desired diagnostics. In this direction, one appropriate alternative approach to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus protein at low level i.e., femtomolar (fM) is exploring plasmonic metasensor technology for COVID-19 diagnostics, which offers exquisite opportunities in advanced healthcare programs, and modern clinical diagnostics. The intrinsic merits of plasmonic metasensors stem from their capability to squeeze electromagnetic fields, simultaneously in frequency, time, and space. However, the detection of low-molecular weight biomolecules at low densities is a typical drawback of conventional metasensors that has recently been addressed using toroidal metasurface technology. This research is focused on the fabrication of a miniaturized plasmonic immunosensor based on toroidal electrodynamics concept that can sustain robustly confined plasmonic modes with ultranarrow lineshapes in the terahertz (THz) frequencies. By exciting toroidal dipole mode using our quasi-infinite metasurface and a judiciously optimized protocol based on functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) conjugated with the specific monoclonal antibody specific to spike protein (S1) of SARS-CoV-2 virus onto the metasurface, the resonance shifts for diverse concentrations of the spike protein are monitored. Possessing molecular weight around ~76 kDa allowed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus protein with significantly low as limit of detection (LoD) was achieved as ~4.2 fM. We envisage that outcomes of this research will pave the way toward the use of toroidal metasensors as practical technologies for rapid and precise screening of SARS-CoV-2 virus carriers, symptomatic or asymptomatic, and spike proteins in hospitals, clinics, laboratories, and site of infection.","output":"Functionalized terahertz plasmonic metasensors: Femtomolar-level detection of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic places older adults with serious mental illness with medical comorbidity at greater risk for poor physical and mental health outcomes.

The national and regional coverage rates were calculated. The coverage rate for each group divided by the degree of population concentration was also calculated. Results We found that 147 of 344 secondary medical zones did not have a plastic surgery facility, and the area coverage rate was found to be 57.27% nationwide. The coverage rate in terms of population was 87.07% (correlation coefficient of area and population coverage = 0.983).

In our retrospective observational study, 23 patients with confirmed positive PCR test results for Severe Acute respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and hypoxemia that required oxygen therapy with or without non-invasive ventilation were treated with PP. Patients were classified into mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 disease. There were no targeted number of hours for proning per day and patients were kept in prone position according to their tolerance. The primary outcome measure was the avoidance of intubation and secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stays and complications related to PP. The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 54.5 (11.7) years, and the majority were males (21/23, 91.3%). Sixty-one per cent (14/23) of the patients were suffering from severe disease and 82.6% (19/23) had bilateral lung involvement with interstitial infiltrates. Majority of the patients were prone positioned for a median of 6 days (IQR 4 - 8). Only one patient required transfer to ICU for mechanical ventilation and subsequently died due to severe ARDS.

We expressed and purified a soluble chimera consisting of the p75NTR ectodomain fused to the human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) Fc fragment (p75-Fc). Although p75-Fc interacts with RV, the infectivity of RV did not decrease significantly when it was incubated in the presence of the soluble receptor alone. However, when it was subsequently incubated with an antihuman IgG directed against the Fc fragment of p75-Fc, the infectivity of RV was significantly lowered (>90%), whereas incubation with antihuman IgG alone had no effect. We then selected eight independent RV mutants that were not neutralized by p75-Fc and antihuman IgG (srr [soluble receptor resistant] mutants). Each mutant carried a single mutation in the glycoprotein gene leading to one amino acid substitution in the protein. A total of four different substitutions were found. Two of the mutations were located at position 318 (phenylalanine replaced by a serine or a valine residue), and two were located at position 352 (histidine replaced by a tyrosine or an arginine residue). All of the mutations prevented the interaction with p75NTR as either a soluble or a membrane-anchored form. Two mutants (F318S) and (H352R) resulted in the formation of small plaques on BSR cells, probably due to the slower maturation of the glycoprotein.

It is most known for causing infectious mononucleosis characterized by the classic triad of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. Hepatitis is a common manifestation seen in 90% of cases;however, isolated acute hepatitis in the absence of infectious mononucleosis is a rare clinical presentation. Case Description/Methods: An 18-year-old female with no medical history presented with fevers, fatigue, myalgia, and headache ongoing for one week. She had been evaluated previously with recommendations for supportive care for an unspecified viral illness. Workup at the time had been negative for urine hCG, COVID-19, heterophile antibody, Lyme disease, and bacteremia. However, symptoms worsened with the development of nausea, vomiting, and darkening of her urine. Prior to this, patient had been in her normal state of health without sick contacts, travel history, animal exposures, risky sexual practices, or substance use. Exam revealed cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Labs showed normal leukocyte count 8.4 thou/cmm with differential significant for reactive lymphocytosis 19% and bandemia 8%. Liver function tests were abnormal with elevated total bilirubin 3.8 mg/dL, AST 366 U/L, ALT 460 U/L, ALP 562 U/L. Synthetic function was intact. Hepatic ultrasound was unrevealing. Extensive infectious workup revealed acute EBV infection with serologies showing positive VCA IgM Ab 74.3 U/mL, negative VCA IgG Ab 11.9 U/mL, negative EA Ab < 5 U/mL, negative EBNA Ab < 3 U/mL. Patient was managed supportively with improved symptoms. She was instructed to avoid physical contact sports for one month upon discharge. Discussion: Clinically significant EBV induced hepatitis is a rare entity seen in < 5% of cases. Nevertheless, it is important to consider EBV as a causative pathogen of acute hepatitis. Heterophile antibody or Monospot test is the diagnostic test of choice with a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 100%;however, false negatives can occur especially early in the disease course. EBV serology has an improved sensitivity of 97% with a comparable specificity of 94%. As such, follow-up serology is necessary especially if clinical suspicion is high. While no specific EBV targeted therapies exist, it is important to identify it given the potential complications, including splenic rupture, airway obstruction, malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, among others.","output":"Isolated EBV-induced acute hepatitis in the absence of infectious mononucleosis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The intervention attempts to engage critically with the Smittestopp app as a specifically Norwegian technofix Culturally and politically, much of the Covid-19 response and the success of social distancing rules have been organized around the widespread trust in the government and public health authorities, and a focus on the citizens' duty to contribute to the dugnaor The intervention argues that Smittestopp has been co-created by the mobilization of trust and dugnaor, resulting in the launch of an incomplete and poorly defined data-hoarding product with significant vulnerabilities","output":"\\"Smittestopp\\": If you want your freedom back, download now"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The covid-19 global pandemic brought about a drastic change to how the world approaches education.

These diseases originate in childhood, and a better understanding of their early determinants and risk factors would allow better prevention. The BELINDA (BEtter LIfe by Nutrition During Adulthood) study is a 10C14-year follow-up of the HEalthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence study (the HELENA study, a European cross-sectional study in adolescents). The study aims to evaluate cardiovascular risk using the PDAY (Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth) risk score during young adulthood (21C32 years), and to examine the impact of risk factors identified during adolescence (12.5C17.5 years). Our secondary objective is to compare the characteristics of the BELINDA study population with the HELENA population not participating in the follow-up study. The HELENA study recruited 3528 adolescents during 2006C2007 and reassessed 232 of them 10C14 years later as young adults. We assessed clinical status, anthropometry, nutrition, physical activity (including sedentary behavior), physical fitness, and mental health parameters, and collected biological samples (blood, stool, and hair). Dietary intake, and physical activity and fitness data were also collected. A multivariable linear regression model will be used for the analysis of the primary outcome. A Chi-square and T-test were conducted for the comparison of the descriptive data (gender, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and maternal school level) between participating and non-participating BELINDA adolescents. When comparing the 1327 eligible subjects with the 232 included in the BELINDA study, no significant differences regarding gender (p = 0.72), age (p = 0.60), height (p = 0.11), and weight (p = 0.083) at adolescence were found. However, the participating population had a lower BMI (20.4  3.1 kg/m(2) versus 21.2  3.6 kg/m(2); p < 0.001) and a higher maternal educational level (46.8% high school or university level versus 38.6%; p = 0.027) than the HELENA population who did not participate in the BELINDA study. The complete phenotyping obtained at adolescence through the HELENA study is a unique opportunity to identify adolescent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

It is very significant to explore an optimal clinical trial management model during the outbreak period to provide reference and insight for other clinical trial centers worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the management strategies used to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on oncology clinical trials. METHODS: We implemented a remote management model to maintain clinical trials conducted at Beijing Cancer Hospital, which realized remote project approval, remote initiation, remote visits, remote administration and remote monitoring to get through two COVID-19 outbreaks in the capital city from February to April and June to July 2020. The effectiveness of measures was evaluated as differences in rates of protocol compliance, participants lost to follow-up, participant withdrawal, disease progression, participant mortality, and detection of monitoring problems. RESULTS: During the late of the first outbreak, modifications were made in trial processing, participant management and quality control, which allowed the hospital to ensure the smooth conduct of 572 trials, with a protocol compliance rate of 85.24% for 3718 participants across both outbreaks. No COVID-19 infections were recorded among participants or trial staff, and no major procedural errors occurred between February and July 2020. These measures led to significantly higher rates of protocol compliance and significantly lower rates of loss to follow-up or withdrawal after the second outbreak than after the first, without affecting rates of disease progression or mortality. The hospital provided trial sponsors with a remote monitoring system in a timely manner, and 3820 trial issues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: When public health emergencies occur, an optimal clinical trial model combining on-site and remote management could guarantee the health care and treatment needs of clinical trial participants, in which remote management plays a key role.","output":"Minimizing the Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Oncology Clinical Trials: Retrospective Study of Beijing Cancer Hospital"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Oral therapies for the early treatment of COVID-19 may prevent disease progression and health system overcrowding.

These include dengue, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, yellow fever and influenza viruses, cytomegalovirus and coronaviruses. There are currently seven human endemic coronaviruses, all of which cause respiratory diseases and bind to receptors found within the endothelium. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly infectious. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, it binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), which is expressed in many cell types, particularly in the lung, including endothelial cells. The initiation of a cytokine storm by the virus along with infection of endothelial cells leads to apoptosis and structural and functional changes that attenuate vascular integrity in many organs including the lungs, heart, liver and kidney. Endothelial damage also enhances the coagulation pathway leading to thrombus formation in major vessels and capillaries. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has an adverse outcome for individuals with particular comorbid diseases, e.g. hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is possible that this is due to the presence of pre-existing endothelial dysfunction and systemic inflammation in subjects with these diseases.

Further understanding and revealing the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer are indispensable for the development of effective diagnosis and treatments. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a series of non-coding RNAs with a length of >200 nts, have been regarded as crucial regulators of many cancers playing a tumor suppressive or oncogenic role, depending on circumstances. lncRNA ZNF674-AS1 was reported to be abnormally expressed in TC, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to probe the mechanism and roles of ZNF674-AS1 in TC. The expression patterns of RNAs and proteins were determined via qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were detected using MTT and Transwell assays. ZNF674-AS1 and SOCS4 expression was remarkably reduced while miR-181a was upregulated in TC tissues and cells. Enforced expression of ZNF674-AS1 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and reduced tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistic assays verified that ZNF674-AS1 directly interacts with miR-181a to increase SOCS4 expression. In addition, miR-181a overexpression aggravated proliferation, metastasis and EMT by inhibiting SOCS4. Interestingly, inhibition of miR-181a diminished the promoting effects of ZNF674-AS1 silencing on the malignant behaviours of TC cells. These data illustrate that ZNF674-AS1 alleviates TC progression by modulating the miR-181a/SOCS4 axis (graphical abstract), further suggesting that ZNF674-AS1 might be used as an therapeutic target in TC treatment.","output":"lncRNA ZNF674-AS1 inhibits the migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of thyroid cancer cells by modulating the miR-181a/SOCS4 axis."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The accelerated development of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) candidate vaccines is intended to achieve worldwide immunity.

The infectivity, severity, and immune evasion properties of Omicron relative to the Delta variant will determine 1) the probability of dominant future transmission, and 2) the impact on disease burden. Here we apply an individual-based transmission model to identify thresholds for Omicrons potential dominance, impact on health, and risk to health systems; and identify for which combinations of viral properties, current interventions would be sufficient to control transmission. We show that, with first-generation SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and limited physical distancing in place, the threshold for Omicrons future dominance will primarily be driven by its degree of infectivity. However, Omicrons potential dominance may not necessarily lead to increased public health burden. Expanded vaccination that includes a third-dose for adults and child vaccination strategies is projected to have the biggest public health benefit for a highly infective, highly severe variant with low immune evasion capacity. However, a highly immune evading variant that becomes dominant will likely require alternative measures for control, such as strengthened physical distancing measures, novel treatments, and second-generation vaccines.

However, even if most physical distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing via conventional methods or mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of physical distancing. We aimed to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy to be successful. METHODS: We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a contact tracing strategy using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection and symptom onset, and between symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation (testing delay). The model also includes tracing of close contacts (eg, household members) and casual contacts, followed by testing regardless of symptoms and isolation if testing positive, with different tracing delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a contact tracing strategy (RCTS) for a population with physical distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of their contacts. FINDINGS: For the most optimistic scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%), and assuming that around 40% of transmissions occur before symptom onset, the model predicts that the estimated effective reproduction number of 12 (with physical distancing only) will be reduced to 08 (95% CI 07-09) by adding contact tracing. The model also shows that a similar reduction can be achieved when testing and tracing coverage is reduced to 80% (RCTS 08, 95% CI 07-10). A testing delay of more than 1 day requires the tracing delay to be at most 1 day or tracing coverage to be at least 80% to keep RCTS below 1. With a testing delay of 3 days or longer, even the most efficient strategy cannot reach RCTS values below 1. The effect of minimising tracing delay (eg, with app-based technology) declines with decreasing coverage of app use, but app-based tracing alone remains more effective than conventional tracing alone even with 20% coverage, reducing the reproduction number by 176% compared with 25%. The proportion of onward transmissions per index case that can be prevented depends on testing and tracing delays, and given a 0-day tracing delay, ranges from up to 799% with a 0-day testing delay to 418% with a 3-day testing delay and 49% with a 7-day testing delay. INTERPRETATION: In our model, minimising testing delay had the largest impact on reducing onward transmissions. Optimising testing and tracing coverage and minimising tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology, further enhanced contact tracing effectiveness, with the potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. Access to testing should therefore be optimised, and mobile app technology might reduce delays in the contact tracing process and optimise contact tracing coverage.

Recently, CoVs were recognized as important pathogens in captive wild ruminants. This is the first report of the isolation and detailed genetic, biologic, and antigenic characterization of a bovine-like CoV from a giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) in a wild-animal park in the United States. CoV particles were detected by immune electron microscopy in fecal samples from three giraffes with mild-to-severe diarrhea. From one of the three giraffe samples, a CoV (GiCoV-OH3) was isolated and successfully adapted to serial passage in human rectal tumor 18 cell cultures. Hemagglutination assays, receptor-destroying enzyme activity, hemagglutination inhibition, and fluorescence focus neutralization tests revealed close biological and antigenic relationships between the GiCoV-OH3 isolate and selected respiratory and enteric bovine CoV (BCoV) strains. When orally inoculated into a BCoV-seronegative gnotobiotic calf, GiCoV-OH3 caused severe diarrhea and virus shedding within 2 to 3 days. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses were performed to assess its genetic relatedness to other CoVs. Molecular characterization confirmed that the new isolate belongs to group 2a of the mammalian CoVs and revealed closer genetic relatedness between GiCoV-OH3 and the enteric BCoVs BCoV-ENT and BCoV-DB2, whereas BCoV-Mebus was more distantly related. Detailed sequence analysis of the GiCoV-OH3 spike gene demonstrated the presence of a deletion in the variable region of the S1 subunit (from amino acid 543 to amino acid 547), which is a region associated with pathogenicity and tissue tropism for other CoVs. The point mutations identified in the structural proteins (by comparing GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, BCoV-DB2, and BCoV-Mebus) were most conserved among GiCoV-OH3, BCoV-ENT, and BCoV-DB2, whereas most of the point mutations in the nonstructural proteins were unique to GiCoV-OH3.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comparatively assess the efficacy of therapist-guided online therapy with that of self-help, internet-based therapy focusing on COVID-19Cinduced symptoms of anxiety and depression among individuals living in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This was a 6-week-long pragmatic randomized controlled trial involving 60 participants who were recruited from a study sample surveyed for symptoms of anxiety or depression among the Omani public amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the intervention group were allocated to receive 1 online session per week for 6 weeks from certified psychotherapists in Oman; these sessions were conducted in Arabic or English. The psychotherapists utilized cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy interventions. Participants in the control group received an automatic weekly newsletter via email containing self-help information and tips to cope with distress associated with COVID-19. The information mainly consisted of behavioral tips revolving around the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy. The primary outcome was measured by comparing the change in the mean scores of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale from the baseline to the end of the study (ie, after 6 sessions) between the two groups. The secondary outcome was to compare the proportions of participants with depression and anxiety between the two groups. RESULTS: Data from 46 participants were analyzed (intervention group n=22, control group n=24). There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics between both groups. Analysis of covariance indicated a significant reduction in the GAD-7 scores (F(1,43)=7.307; P=.01) between the two groups after adjusting for baseline scores. GAD-7 scores of participants in the intervention group were considerably more reduced than those of participants in the control group (=?3.27; P=.01). Moreover, a greater reduction in mean PHQ-9 scores was observed among participants in the intervention group (F(1,43)=8.298; P=.006) than those in the control group (=?4.311; P=.006). Although the levels of anxiety and depression reduced in both study groups, the reduction was higher in the intervention group (P=.049) than in the control group (P=.02).

The disease spectrum was different with a significant decrease of >95% in the number of patients with infectious or contagious diseases. The online visits accounted for 14.7% of all visits. Online patients came from all over the country, covering 91% of the administrative regions of China, and the largest proportion of inquiries were for infants (33.7%) (P<0.01). The response rate of experts to requests for online consultations was 100%. During the study period, 266 experts from 25 pediatric specialties completed 12,318 effective consultations, proving different degrees of online supplementation for various specialties (4.3-168.4%). Online consultations mainly addressed two types of problems: (I) accessibility of the traditional hospital visits and (II) consultations regarding an illness. Data from pediatric nephrology showed that 96% of the patients with stable chronic kidney disease successfully received follow-up medication adjustment guidance through the online platform. Conclusions The traditional hospital medical services have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The multidisciplinary online medical consultation system is a strategy to actively respond to the medical needs of children during unique periods.","output":"An internet-based multidisciplinary online medical consultation system to help cope with pediatric medical needs during the COVID-19 outbreak: a cross-sectional study."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Depleting natural resources and large amounts of waste increase the environmental pressure affecting the economy and humans Emerging sustainability challenges require new behavioural patterns from both the business and consumers Responding to these constraints, the circular economy is promoted as a new way towards a sustainable future While the circular economy provides new principles for improving resource efficiency and reducing waste, most of companies run traditional business models with the perception that competitive advantages can be achieved by increasing production Instead circular business models seek for increase of profitability and efficiency through adapting various business model innovations However, their adoption process and results are unclear for many industries highlighting the topicality of this article This research shows that milk processing companies lack an experience and understanding of benefits and challenges of circular business models In milk processing, the whey is considered as problematic waste or the production leftover, which requires new treatment The research provides analyses of the whey recycling circular business models that ensured new revenue streams, higher profitability, return on assets and competitive advantages for milk processing companies The COVID19 pandemia increases the importance of this issue as the dairy industry due to livestock requirements shall ensure business continuity despite a crises or other risks that slowdown the business ?

METHODS: This study uses a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design to rigorously evaluate an adaptive, trauma-informed, culturally tailored technology-delivered intervention tailored to the needs of immigrant women who have experienced IPV. In the first stage randomization, participants are randomly assigned to an online safety decision and planning or a usual care control arm and safety, mental health and empowerment outcomes are assessed at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-baseline. For the second stage randomization, women who do not report significant improvements in safety (i.e., reduction in IPV) and empowerment from baseline to 3 months follow up (i.e., non-responders) are re- randomized to safety and empowerment strategies delivered via text only or a combination of text and phone calls with trained advocates. Data on outcomes (safety, mental health, and empowerment) for early non-responders is assessed at 6 and 12 months post re-randomization. DISCUSSION: The studys SMART design provides an opportunity to implement and evaluate an individualized intervention protocol for immigrant women based on their response to type or intensity of intervention. The findings will be useful for identifying what works for whom and characteristics of participants needing a particular type or intensity level of intervention for improved outcomes. If found to be effective, the study will result in an evidence-based trauma-informed culturally tailored technology-based safety decision and planning intervention for immigrant survivors of IPV that can be implemented by practitioners serving immigrant women in diverse settings.

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly within congregate residential settings (2-4), including psychiatric facilities. On April 13, 2020, two patients were transferred to Wyoming's state psychiatric hospital from a private psychiatric hospital that had confirmed COVID-19 cases among its residents and staff members (5). Although both patients were asymptomatic at the time of transfer and one had a negative test result for SARS-CoV-2 at the originating facility, they were both isolated and received testing upon arrival at the state facility. On April 16, 2020, the test results indicated that both patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. In response, the state hospital implemented expanded COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures (e.g., enhanced screening, testing, and management of new patient admissions) and adapted some standard IPC measures to facilitate implementation within the psychiatric patient population (e.g., use of modified face coverings). To assess the likely effectiveness of these procedures and determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among patients and health care personnel (HCP) (6) at the state hospital, a point prevalence survey was conducted. On May 1, 2020, 18 days after the patients' arrival, 46 (61%) of 76 patients and 171 (61%) of 282 HCP had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All patients and HCP who received testing had negative test results, suggesting that the hospital's expanded IPC strategies might have been effective in preventing the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the facility. In congregate residential settings, prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and application of strong IPC procedures are critical to ensuring the protection of other patients and staff members. Although standard guidance exists for other congregate facilities (7) and for HCP in general (8), modifications and nonstandard solutions might be needed to account for the specific needs of psychiatric facilities, their patients, and staff members.","output":"Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Within a Psychiatric Hospital and Considerations for Limiting Transmission Within Residential Psychiatric Facilities - Wyoming, 2020"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Importance: Population-wide facial masking decreases COVID-19 transmission but may also decrease the severity of disease by reducing the viral inoculum to which the wearer is exposed. The mortality of COVID-19 infection decreased in the U.S. in the second wave over the summer of 2020 compared to the first, but reasons for declining severity of disease have not been fully elucidated. Objective: To determine if facial mask mandates instituted in U.S. counties over the spring and summer of 2020 were associated with declining severity of infection as measured by the number of hospitalizations for COVID-19. Design: Data on hospitalizations due to COVID-19; testing access determined by number of tests performed per day per 100,000 people; new cases per day normalized by population; measures of population mobility to control for other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns, social distancing, and business closures; age categories in each census tract; and dates of masking mandates in U.S. counties were all obtained from open-sourced epidemiologic datasets. We used a staggered difference-in-difference study design to assess the impact of the introduction of mask mandates (defined as the treatment) on the proportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 per week from March 10-September 16, 2020. Setting: U.S. counties with available full datasets on relevant COVID-19 metrics Exposure: Mask mandates Main outcome: Proportion of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 Results: Using data from 1083 counties (34% of U.S. counties, 82% of U.S. population) from 49 states, we found a statistically significant drop in hospitalization rates due to COVID-19 up to 12 weeks following county mask mandates of 7.13 (95% CI: -4.19, -10.1) percentage points, after controlling for age categories by county, testing access, numbers of cases, and population mobility. Conclusion and Relevance: Facial masking may decrease COVID-19 severity by decreasing the viral inoculum to which individuals are exposed. Mask mandates across 1083 counties in the U.S. in 49 states decreased hospitalization rates from COVID-19 even when controlling for other factors that could impact disease severity, including age, testing access, number of cases, and mobility (as a proxy for other non-Pharmaceutical interventions such as sheltering-in-place).

OBJECTIVES: The objectives pf the study were to analyze the performance of a chest computed tomography (CT) AI quantitative algorithm for determining the risk of mortality/mechanical ventilation (MV) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and explore a prognostic multivariate model in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City. METHODS: Chest CT images of 166 COVID-19 patients hospitalized from April 1 to 20, 2020, were retrospectively analyzed using AI algorithm software. Data were collected from their medical records. We analyzed the diagnostic yield of the relevant CT variables using the area under the ROC curve (area under the curve [AUC]). Optimal thresholds were obtained using the Youden index. We proposed a predictive logistic model for each outcome based on CT AI measures and predetermined laboratory and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The highest diagnostic yield of the assessed CT variables for mortality was the percentage of total opacity (threshold >51%; AUC = 0.88, sensitivity = 74%, and specificity = 91%). The AUC of the CT severity score (threshold > 12.5) was 0.88 for MV (sensitivity = 65% and specificity = 92%). The proposed prognostic models include the percentage of opacity and lactate dehydrogenase level for mortality and troponin I and CT severity score for MV requirement. CONCLUSION: The AI-calculated CT severity score and total opacity percentage showed good diagnostic accuracy for mortality and met MV criteria. The proposed prognostic models using biochemical variables and imaging data measured by AI on chest CT showed good risk classification in our population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","output":"Validation of Chest Computed Tomography Artificial Intelligence to Determine the Requirement for Mechanical Ventilation and Risk of Mortality in Hospitalized Coronavirus Disease-19 Patients in a Tertiary Care Center In Mexico City"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Tersebarnya Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) telah memberikan pengaruh pada kondisi keamanan dan ketertiban masyarakat di Indonesia dan ketahanan nasional.

OBJECTIVE: Conduct a meta-analysis of the frequency of LQT in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection treated with HCQ. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and preprint servers (medRxiv, Research Square) for studies published between December 2019 and June 30, 2020. METHODS: Effect statistics were pooled using random effects. The quality of observational studies and randomized controlled trials was appraised with STROBE and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tools, respectively. OUTCOMES: Critical LQT was defined as: (1) maximum QT corrected (QTc)500 ms (if QRS<120 ms) or QTc550 ms (if QRS120 ms), and (2) QTc increase of 60 ms. RESULTS: In the 28 studies included (n=9124), the frequency of LQT during HCQ treatment was 6.7% (95% CI: 3.7-10.2%). In 20 studies (n=7825), patients were also taking other QT-prolonging drugs; the frequency of LQT in the other 8 studies (n=1299) was 1.7% (95% CI:0.3-3.9%). 20 studies (n=6869) reported HCQ discontinuation due to LQT, with a frequency of 3.7% (95% CI: 1.5-.6%). The frequency of ventricular arrhythmias during HCQ treatment was 1.68% (127/7539) and that of arrhythmogenic death 0.69% (39/5648). Torsades de Pointes occurred in 0.06% (3/5066). The group with highest risk of HCQ-associated LQT were those older than 60 years (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HCQ-associated cardiotoxicity in SARS-CoV-2 patients is uncommon but requires ECG monitoring especially in those older than 60 years and/or taking other QT-prolonging drugs.","output":"Frequency of Long QT in Patients with SARS-CoV-2 Infection Treated with Hydroxychloroquine: a Meta-analysis"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This chapter discusses the methods for the separation and characterization of leukocytes from the intestine.

To evaluate the ramification of infectious disease outbreaks on major traumatic injuries, we compared changes in the incidence of major trauma cases during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) period with COVID-19 in 2020. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the trauma registry of a major, tertiary-care teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Patients presenting with major traumatic injuries during the first six months of 2001C03 and 2018C20 were retrieved for analysis. Patient characteristics, injury mechanism, admitting service, and emergency department (ED)/hospital lengths of stay (LOS) were recorded. Raw and adjusted survival rates (using the modified Trauma Injury Severity Score (TRISS)) were recorded. RESULTS: The number of trauma cases fell dramatically during 2003 and 2020 compared with previous years. In both 2003 and 2020, the number of trauma registry patients fell by 49% in April (compared to the preceding reference years of 2001/02 and 2018/19, respectively). Patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were also different during the outbreak years. Comparing 2003 to 2020 relative to their respective reference baselines, the percentages of injuries that happened at home, patients without co-morbidities, and patients' mean age all increased in 2003 but decreased in 2020. Work-place injuries drastically dropped in 2003, but not in 2020. Average ED LOS dropped in 2003 by 36.4 min (95% CI 12.5, 60.3) but declined by only 14.5 min (95% CI -2.9, 32.1) in 2020. Both observed and expected 30-day mortality declined in 2020 vs. 2003 (observed 4.5% vs. 11.7%, p = 0.001, OR 0.352, 95% CI 0.187, 0.661) (expected 4.5% vs 11.6%, p = 0.002, OR 0.358, 95% CI 0.188, 0.684). CONCLUSION: Major trauma cases dropped by half during both the peak of the 2003 SARS and 2020 COVID-19 pandemics in Hong Kong, suggesting a trend for future pandemic planning.

Socio-demographic questions and standardized self-report questionnaires were administered online. Results highlighted a moderate level of worry, anxiety and distress. People with higher perceptions of COVID-19 severity exhibited higher levels of worry in contrast to those who perceived a greater control over the possibility of infection. Multiple regression analysis indicated that coping styles, emotion regulation strategies and personality traits significantly contributed to explain the variance in worry scores. Findings supported that cognitive reappraisal, emotion-focused coping and extraversion were protective factors for worry, while expressive suppression, dysfunctional and problem-focused coping, and neuroticism were related to high worry. However, neuroticism and dysfunctional coping were particularly important predictors of worry.

The calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway and the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase)/Erk (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway contribute to the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy as an interdependent network of signaling cascades. How these pathways interact remains unclear and few direct targets responsible for the prohypertrophic role of NFAT have been described. METHODS: By engineering cardiomyocyte-specific ETS2 (a member of the E26 transformation-specific sequence [ETS] domain family) knockout mice, we investigated the role of ETS2 in cardiac hypertrophy. Primary cardiomyocytes were used to evaluate ETS2 function in cell growth. RESULTS: ETS2 is phosphorylated and activated by Erk1/2 on hypertrophic stimulation in both mouse (n=3) and human heart samples (n=8 to 19). Conditional deletion of ETS2 in mouse cardiomyocytes protects against pressure overloadCinduced cardiac hypertrophy (n=6 to 11). Silencing of ETS2 in the hearts of calcineurin transgenic mice significantly attenuates hypertrophic growth and contractile dysfunction (n=8). As a transcription factor, ETS2 is capable of binding to the promoters of hypertrophic marker genes, such as ANP, BNP, and Rcan1.4 (n=4). We report that ETS2 forms a complex with NFAT to stimulate transcriptional activity through increased NFAT binding to the promoters of at least 2 hypertrophy-stimulated genes: Rcan1.4 and microRNA-223 (=n4 to 6). Suppression of microRNA-223 in cardiomyocytes inhibits calcineurin-mediated cardiac hypertrophy (n=6), revealing microRNA-223 as a novel prohypertrophic target of the calcineurin/NFAT and Erk1/2-ETS2 pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a critical role for ETS2 in calcineurin/NFAT pathway-driven cardiac hypertrophy and unveil a previously unknown molecular connection between the Erk1/2 activation of ETS2 and expression of NFAT/ETS2 target genes.","output":"Cooperative Binding of ETS2 and NFAT Links Erk1/2 and Calcineurin Signaling in the Pathogenesis of Cardiac Hypertrophy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Guillain-Barr syndrome (GBS) is the commonest postinfectious inflammatory peripheral neuropathy with undiscerned aetiology. The commonly reported antecedent infections implicated in India include Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni), chikungunya, dengue and Japanese encephalitis (JE). In this study from south India, we investigated the role of these four agents in triggering GBS. METHODS This case-control study was performed on 150 treatment-naive patients with GBS and 150 age and sex-matched controls from the same community. IgM immunoreactivity for C. jejuni, chikungunya and dengue were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in serum patients with GBS and control subjects. Immunoreactivity against JE was detected in serum as well as CSF from patients (n=150) and orthopaedic control (n=45) subjects. The immunoreactivity against infections was compared between demyelinating and axonal subtypes of GBS. RESULTS Overall, 119/150 patients with GBS had serological evidence of antecedent infection. Amongst those with evidence of antecedent infection, 24(16%), 8(5%), 9(6%) patients were exclusively immunoreactive to chikungunya, JE and C. jejuni, respectively. In the remaining patients (78/119), immunoreactivity to multiple pathogens was noted. C. jejuni infection was found in 32% of GBS patients compared to 2.7% controls (p<0.001), whereas chikungunya virus was reported in 66.7% of patients with GBS compared to 44.7% controls (p=0.006). Anti-dengue immunoreactivity was significantly associated with the demyelinating subtype of GBS. Patients positive for JE IgM (CSF) manifested demyelinating electrophysiology.

When additional evidence is supplied, people should update VOI to adjust subsequent information seeking, but the neurocognitive mechanisms of this updating process remain unknown. We used a modified beads task to examine how the VOI is represented and updated in the human brain. We theoretically derived, and empirically verified, a normative prediction that the VOI depends on decision evidence and is biased by reward asymmetry. Using fMRI, we found that the subjective VOI is represented in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Critically, this VOI representation was updated when additional evidence was supplied, showing that DLPFC dynamically tracks the up-to-date VOI over time. These results provide new insights into how humans adaptively seek information in the service of decision making.","output":"Dynamic Representation of the Subjective Value of Information"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) are at increased risk for adverse outcomes with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID\\\\19). Early data show a lower severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2) spike antibody immune response among SOTRs leading to patient concerns about vaccine efficacy. Public health messaging has largely left out immunocompromized individuals leading to a higher risk of vaccine misinformation. The American Society of Transplantation recommends COVID\\\\19 vaccination for all SOTRs; however, patient concerns and beliefs about vaccination are largely unknown. METHODS: We conducted a transplant\\\\center\\\\based, pragmatic pilot trial to encourage COVID\\\\19 vaccination among 103 unvaccinated SOTRs. We assessed vaccine concerns, barriers to vaccination, answered questions about efficacy, side effects, and clinical recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 24% (n = 25) of SOTRs reported that they will schedule COVID\\\\19 vaccination after the study call, 46% reported that they will consider vaccination in the future, and 30% said they will not consider vaccination. Older age and White race were associated with lower willingness to schedule the vaccine, whereas Black race and longer time from transplant were associated with higher willingness. Common vaccine concerns included lack of long\\\\term data, inconsistent messaging from providers, scheduling inconvenience, and insufficient resources. Follow\\\\up approximately 1 month after the initial outreach found 52% (n = 13) of liver transplant recipients, and 10% (n = 3) of kidney transplant recipients subsequently received COVID\\\\19 vaccines for a vaccination rate of 29% among respondents. CONCLUSION: Transplant center\\\\based vaccine outreach efforts can decrease misinformation and increase vaccination uptake; however, vaccine\\\\related mistrust remains high.","output":"A pragmatic outreach pilot to understand and overcome barriers to COVID\\\\19 vaccination in abdominal organ transplant"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper aims to better understand the resilience and further entrenchment of food aid through food banks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first months of the pandemic in the Netherlands, concerns quickly rose about the number of people falling into conditions of food insecurity. Adding insult to injury, food banks reported problems in their operations. The analysis shows that after some adaptations to initial problems, food banks were largely able to continue their service. This ability was partly based on organizational flexibility. However, in order to understand the resilience of food aid through food banks, it is imperative to understand food banks as part of a system of food aid that extends beyond the organizational boundaries. This system includes a range of other actors and resources, including donors, public support and governmental backing that contributed to the resilience of the food aid system. While this embeddedness in a system as well as broad public support were essential for the resilience of food aid through food banks, both factors also indicate the further entrenchment of food banks in the understanding and practices of ensuring food security for people in poverty. Ultimately, when the root causes of a need for food aid are not addressed, a resilient system of food aid through food banks can eventually prove detrimental to societal resilience, specifically the ability to ensure dignified access to adequate food.","output":"Too big to fail: the resilience and entrenchment of food aid through food banks in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of continuing cochlear implantation during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis and to report on trends of referrals via the neonatal hearing screening programme.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical validity and utility of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. DESIGN: CaseCcontrol study. SETTING: First month of testing for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by using a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) on nasopharyngeal swabs at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland (11 066 persons). PARTICIPANTS: Of the 11 066 tested persons, 115 (1%) were hospitalized adults investigated for COVID-19. Clinical record review was performed to classify them into a COVID-19 case group (n = 60) or a nonCCOVID-19 control group (n = 55). The laboratory control groups comprised 513 persons not tested by NAAT: 160 healthy laboratory employees, 101 persons positive for IgG antibodies against Epstein-Barr virus capsid antigen, 215 positive for thyroperoxidase antibody, and 37 positive for rheumatoid factor. MEASUREMENTS: Serum IgG and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were detected by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay were 0.976 (95% CI, 0.928 to 0.995) and 0.988 (CI, 0.974 to 0.995), respectively, when performed 14 days or later after symptom onset, but sensitivity decreased at earlier time points. Immunoglobulin G developed rapidly and was sustained at high levels throughout follow-up (up to 58 days). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 predicted the odds of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome, which increased by 62% (CI, 48% to 81%; P < 0.001) for every 2-fold increase in IgG. Of 11 066 NAAT-tested patients, 457 were repeatedly NAAT-negative, and serum samples were obtained for 18 such patients: 6 COVID-19 case patients and 12 nonCCOVID-19 control patients. Antibodies were present in 5 of 6 case patients and none of the 12 control patients (P = 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The study was retrospective and performed at a single-center; the sample was small; follow-up was limited; and selection bias may have occurred. CONCLUSION: Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 demonstrate infection when measured at least 14 days after symptom onset, associate with clinical severity, and provide valuable diagnostic support in patients who test negative by NAAT but remain clinically suspicious for COVID-19.

OBJECTIVES: To present the contributions of a Swiss pharmacy of an academic outpatient care department (Unisant) to the prevention of COVID-19 transmission and the precautionary measures plan implemented as well as to evaluate the impact of Swiss semicontainment on its pharmacy services. METHODS: Contributions to COVID-19 transmission prevention and the precautionary measures plan are described. The impact on pharmacy services was measured by quantitative comparison before, during and after semicontainment. RESULTS: The pharmacy supplied protective equipment to the population and to liberal healthcare professionals and provided COVID-19 recommendations to patients and community pharmacies. The precautionary measures plan implemented required a reorganization of the premises, facilities, staff operation and pharmacy services. Semicontainment had a strong impact on pharmacy services; however, clinical bonds with patients and other healthcare professionals were maintained. Unseen negative impacts may exist and need to be investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Although innovative solutions remain to be developed to guarantee continuous and secure remote communication with patients, this pandemic was an opportunity to demonstrate the versatility, benefit and importance of community pharmacy services.","output":"Response to the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the community pharmacy of a University Center for Primary Care and Public Health"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health problem that the WHO declared a pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide lockdown and threatened to topple the global economy. The mortality of COVID-19 is comparatively low compared with previous SARS outbreaks, but the rate of spread of the disease and its morbidity is alarming. This virus can be transmitted human-to-human through droplets and close contact, and people of all ages are susceptible to this virus. With the advancements in nanotechnology, their remarkable properties, including their ability to amplify signal, can be used for the development of nanobiosensors and nanoimaging techniques that can be used for early-stage detection along with other diagnostic tools. Nano-based protection equipment and disinfecting agents can provide much-needed protection against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, nanoparticles can serve as a carrier for antigens or as an adjuvant, thereby making way for the development of a new generation of vaccines.

Each viral pathogen has unique, frequently nuanced, aspects to its replication, which affects the host response and as a consequence the capacity of the virus to produce disease. There are, however, common features to the T cell response to viruses, which produce acute limited infection. This is true whether virus replication is restricted to a single site, for example, the respiratory tract (RT), CNS etc., or replication is in multiple sites throughout the body. In describing below the acute T cell response to virus infection, we employ acute virus infection of the RT as a convenient model to explore this process of virus infection and the host response. We divide the process into three phases: the induction (initiation) of the response, the expression of antiviral effector activity resulting in virus elimination, and the resolution of inflammation with restoration of tissue homeostasis.","output":"T Cell Responses during Acute Respiratory Virus Infection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been increasingly used to pool research findings from multiple studies in medical sciences. The reliability of the synthesized evidence depends highly on the methodological quality of a systematic review and meta-analysis. In recent years, several tools have been developed to guide the reporting and evidence appraisal of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and much statistical effort has been paid to improve their methodological quality. Nevertheless, many contemporary meta-analyses continue to employ conventional statistical methods, which may be suboptimal compared with several alternative methods available in the evidence synthesis literature. Based on a recent systematic review on COVID-19 in pregnancy, this article provides an overview of select good practices for performing meta-analyses from statistical perspectives. Specifically, we suggest meta-analysts (1) providing sufficient information of included studies, (2) providing information for reproducibility of meta-analyses, (3) using appropriate terminologies, (4) double-checking presented results, (5) considering alternative estimators of between-study variance, (6) considering alternative confidence intervals, (7) reporting prediction intervals, (8) assessing small-study effects whenever possible, and (9) considering one-stage methods. We use worked examples to illustrate these good practices. Relevant statistical code is also provided. The conventional and alternative methods could produce noticeably different point and interval estimates in some meta-analyses and thus affect their conclusions. In such cases, researchers should interpret the results from conventional methods with great caution and consider using alternative methods.","output":"Good Statistical Practices for Contemporary Meta-Analysis: Examples Based on a Systematic Review on COVID-19 in Pregnancy"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The health workforce is a vital aspect of health systems, both essential in improving patient and population health outcomes and in addressing contemporary challenges such as universal health coverage (UHC) and sustainable development goals (SDGs) [...].","output":"The Future Health Workforce: Integrated Solutions and Models of Care"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Quality healthcare is a key part of peoples right to health and dignity, yet access to high-quality care can be limited by legal, social and economic contexts. There is limited consensus on what domains constitute quality in abortion care and the opinions of people seeking abortion have little representation in current abortion quality measures.

Among the many aspects of care that mattered to clients, the clientCprovider relationships emerged as essential. Clients prioritized being treated with kindness, respect and dignity; receiving information and counselling that was personalized to their individual situation and reassurance and support from their provider throughout the entire abortion process, including follow-up after the abortion. Many clients also noted the importance of skilled providers and appropriate care. There were similarities across the two country contexts, yet there were some differences in how clients defined high-quality care; therefore, specific political and cultural influences must be considered when implementing measurement and improving person-centred quality of care.

Numerical simulations are carried out in a test chamber with a source of infectious contaminant and a manikin (Manikin A). To give a good visual illustration of the breathing zone, the contaminant source is visualized by the mouth of another manikin. Manikin A is regarded as a vulnerable individual to infectious contaminant. Exposure index and exposure intensity are used as indicators of the exposure level in the breathing zone. The results show that in the stable condition, the infectious contaminant proceeds straightly towards the breathing zone of the vulnerable individual, leading to a relatively high exposure level. In the unstable condition, the indoor air experiences a strong mixing due to the heat exchange between the hot bottom air and the cool top air, so the infectious contaminant disperses effectively from the breathing zone. The unstable air can greatly reduce personal exposure to the infectious contaminant in the breathing zone. This study demonstrates the importance of indoor air stability on personal exposure in the indoor environment and provides a new direction for future study of personal exposure reduction in the indoor environment.","output":"Assessment of personal exposure to infectious contaminant under the effect of indoor air stability"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating illness induced by systemic inflammation e.g., sepsis or local lung inflammation e.g., COVID-19 mediated severe pneumonia, has an unacceptably high mortality and has no effective therapy. ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)34. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y32, within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y32, preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function. Together, our data identify a new post-translational mechanism of Rac1 inhibition through its nitration at Y32. As NipR2 also reduces sepsis induced ALI in the mouse lung, we conclude that Rac1 nitration is a therapeutic target in ALI.","output":"RAC1 nitration at Y32 IS involved in the endothelial barrier disruption associated with lipopolysaccharide-mediated acute lung injury"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: The Covid-19 pandemic has raged on and heavy clinical research have been promoted worldwide. We aimed to assess the adequacy of treatment clinical trials set forth as early response to COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: First, we performed a systematic review of trial registries. The World Health Organization International Trials Registry Platform and national trial registries were searched for COVID-19 trials through April 19th, 2020. For each record, independent researchers extracted interventions, participants, and methodological characteristics. Second, we evaluated on September 14th, 2020 the recruitment status and availability of results of COVID-19 treatment trials previously identified. Results: On April 2020, a total of 580 trials evaluating COVID-19 treatment were registered. Reporting quality was poor (core participant information was missing in 24.1% to 92.7%). Between 54.0% to 93.8% of the trials did not plan to include older people and people at higher baseline risk. Most studies were randomised (67.9%), single-centre (58.3%), non-industry funded (81.1%), to be conducted in China (47.6%), with a median duration of 184 days and a median sample size of 100 participants. Core endpoints (mortality, clinical status, and hospitalization length) were planned to be assessed in 5.2% to 13.1% of the trials. Five months later, 66 trials (11.4%) are reported as Completed, and only 46 (7.9%) have public results available. 144 of 580 trials (24.8%) are either under the status Not yet recruiting or Suspended, and 18 (3.1%) trials were prematurely stopped (Terminated or Withdrawn) The number of completed trials and trials with results are much lower than anticipated, considering the planned follow-up.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical characteristics and predictors of silent hypoxemia in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study including consecutive hospitalized adult ( 18 years) patients with confirmed COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department with oxygen saturation (SpO2)  80% on room air from March 15 to June 30, 2020. We analyzed the characteristics, disease severity, and in-hospital outcomes of patients presenting with dyspnea and those without dyspnea (silent hypoxemia). RESULTS: We studied 470 cases (64.4% men; median age 55 years, interquartile range 46C64). There were 447 (95.1%) patients with dyspnea and 23 (4.9%) with silent hypoxemia. The demographic and clinical characteristics, comorbidities, laboratory and imaging findings, disease severity, and outcomes were similar between groups. Higher breathing and heart rates correlated significantly with lower SpO(2) in patients with dyspnea but not in those with silent hypoxemia. Independent predictors of silent hypoxemia were the presence of new-onset headache (OR 2.919, 95% CI 1.101C7.742; P = 0.031) and presenting to the emergency department within the first eight days after symptoms onset (OR 3.183, 95% CI 1.024C9.89; P = 0.045).

The coronavirus spike proteins are very effective molecular mechanisms, which provide the coronavirus entrance to the host cell. The number of these spikes is different; it dramatically depends on external conditions and determines the degree of danger of the virus. A larger number of spike proteins makes the virus infectivity stronger. This paper describes a mathematical model of the shape of coronavirus virions. Based on this model, the characteristics of light scattered by the coronavirus virions were calculated. It was found two main features of coronavirus model particles in the spectral region near 200 nm: a minimum of intensity and a sharp leap of the linear polarization degree. The effect of the spike protein number on the intensity and polarization properties of the scattered light was studied. It was determined that when the number of spike proteins decreases, both the intensity minimum and the position of the linear polarization leap shift to shorter wavelengths. This allows us to better evaluate the shape of the coronavirus virion, and, therefore, the infectious danger of the virus. It was shown that the shorter the wavelength of scattered light, the more reliably one can distinguish viruses from non-viruses. The developed model and the light scattering simulations based on it can be applied not only to coronaviruses, but also to other objects of a similar structure, for example, pollen.","output":"Photopolarimetrical properties of coronavirus model particles: Spike proteins number influence"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND Widowed people have a high risk of common mental disorders, however no summary estimates of the prevalences exist. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of common mental disorders in widowed people in the community. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase and PsycInfo were searched for papers reporting on prevalence of common mental disorders and widowhood. Eligible studies were included in random effects meta-analyses of the prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders. Subgroup analyses were performed on method of assessment of depression and age and sex. RESULTS The literature search identified 13,781 titles of which 42 were eligible for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of depression in studies using a screening scale was 40.6% (33.6%-47.6%) (n = 30). For studies using full diagnostic criteria the pooled prevalence of depression was 19.2% (13.4%-25.0%) (n = 12). Subgroup analyses of age ( or < 65) and sex did not show any differences regarding depression. Five studies reported the prevalence of anxiety disorders. The pooled prevalence estimate was 26.9% (8.1%-45.7%). LIMITATIONS The prevalence estimates in this study are summary estimates of prevalences from existing literature. Although the reporting bias assessment showed no evidence, there could be some reporting bias, as studies might only present results if there is a high prevalence.

In group 1 (n = 139), a single-layer continuous suturing method was used; each bite contained the pubocervical fascia and vaginal mucosa anteriorly, and vaginal mucosa and rectovaginal fascia posteriorly. In group 2 (n = 63), a double-layer continuous suturing method was used; only vaginal mucosa was included in the first layer, and a second layer incorporated the pubocervical and rectovaginal fascias. RESULTS Patient characteristics (age, body mass index, parity, previous abdominal surgery, smoking, comorbidity) were similar between the two groups. There were also no differences in total operation time, length of hospitalization, intraop-erative complications, and perioperative change in hemoglobin levels. There was no difference between the two groups in terms of vaginal cuff dehiscence, which was the primary outcome measure of the study.

In the central nervous system, myelin sheath is the result of the complex packaging of multilamellar extensions of oligodendrocyte (OL) membranes. Before reaching myelinating capabilities, OLs undergo a very precise program of differentiation and maturation that starts from OL precursor cells (OPCs). In the last 20 years, the biology of OPCs and their behavior under pathological conditions have been studied through several experimental models. When co-cultured with neurons, OPCs undergo terminal maturation and produce myelin tracts around axons, allowing to investigate myelination in response to exogenous stimuli in a very simple in vitro system. On the other hand, in vivo models more closely reproducing some of the features of human pathophysiology enabled to assess the consequences of demyelination and the molecular mechanisms of remyelination, and they are often used to validate the effect of pharmacological agents. However, they are very complex, and not suitable for large scale drug discovery screening. Recent advances in cell reprogramming, biophysics and bioengineering have allowed impressive improvements in the methodological approaches to study brain physiology and myelination. Rat and mouse OPCs can be replaced by human OPCs obtained by induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from healthy or diseased individuals, thus offering unprecedented possibilities for personalized disease modeling and treatment. OPCs and neural cells can be also artificially assembled, using 3D-printed culture chambers and biomaterial scaffolds, which allow modeling cell-to-cell interactions in a highly controlled manner. Interestingly, scaffold stiffness can be adopted to reproduce the mechanosensory properties assumed by tissues in physiological or pathological conditions. Moreover, the recent development of iPSC-derived 3D brain cultures, called organoids, has made it possible to study key aspects of embryonic brain development, such as neuronal differentiation, maturation and network formation in temporal dynamics that are inaccessible to traditional in vitro cultures. Despite the huge potential of organoids, their application to myelination studies is still in its infancy.

Although our understanding of coronaviruses has undergone a huge leap after two precedents, the effective approaches to treatment and epidemiological control are still lacking. In this article, we present a succinct overview of the epidemiology, clinical features, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. We summarize the current epidemiological and clinical data from the initial Wuhan studies, and emphasize several features of SARS-CoV-2, which differentiate it from SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), such as high variability of disease presentation. We systematize the current clinical trials that have been rapidly initiated after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. Whereas the trials on SARS-CoV-2 genome-based specific vaccines and therapeutic antibodies are currently being tested, this solution is more long-term, as they require thorough testing of their safety. On the other hand, the repurposing of the existing therapeutic agents previously designed for other virus infections and pathologies happens to be the only practical approach as a rapid response measure to the emergent pandemic, as most of these agents have already been tested for their safety. These agents can be divided into two broad categories, those that can directly target the virus replication cycle, and those based on immunotherapy approaches either aimed to boost innate antiviral immune responses or alleviate damage induced by dysregulated inflammatory responses. The initial clinical studies revealed the promising therapeutic potential of several of such drugs, including favipiravir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that interferes with the viral replication, and hydroxychloroquine, the repurposed antimalarial drug that interferes with the virus endosomal entry pathway. We speculate that the current pandemic emergency will be a trigger for more systematic drug repurposing design approaches based on big data analysis.","output":"A Review of SARS-CoV-2 and the Ongoing Clinical Trials"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objective: To evaluate the frequency, duration and patterns of long-term coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms and to analyze risk factors for long-lasting COVID-19 sequelae among hospital employees (HEs). Design: Retrospective observational cohort study. Setting: Three medical centers in Cologne, Germany. Participants: We included HEs who had a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test between March 2020 and May 2021. Methods: We conducted a survey in mid-2021 with all HEs tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive during the study period and asked about the presence and duration of 24 different COVID-19 related symptoms. Chronological development and patterns of symptom complexes, probability of symptom persistence and possible risk factors for protracted COVID-19 course were analyzed. Results: Of 221 included HEs, a number of 104 HEs (47.1%) reported at least one persisting symptom for more than 90 days after initial SARS-CoV-2 detection. A symptom duration over 28 days was associated with multiple symptom complexes. The most common was the interrelated occurrence of shortness of breath, memory disorder, concentration disorders and fatigue. Each one cycle higher initial Ct value significantly increased the chances of overcoming symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05; p = 0.019). The occurrence of breathlessness within the first ten days (OR = 7.89; p = 0.008), an initial Ct value under 30 (OR = 3.36; p = 0.022) and a definitely nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission (OR = 3.05; p = 0.049) showed a statistically significant association with increased odds of illness duration over 90 days. Conclusion: About half of the HEs suffered from long lasting symptoms over 90 days after almost entirely mild acute COVID-19. Different symptom complexes could be shown and predictive factors for long-term symptoms were identified. Predictive factors at the onset of the infection could possibly be used for early treatment to prevent development of long-term symptoms after COVID-19 in future.","output":"Long-term symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection in a cohort of hospital employees: duration and predictive factors"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus classified in the family Coronaviridae. In this review, we summarize the literature on light-based (UV, blue, and red lights) sanitization methods for the inactivation of ssRNA viruses in different matrixes (air, liquid, and solid). The rate of inactivation of ssRNA viruses in liquid was higher than in air, whereas inactivation on solid surfaces varied with the type of surface. The efficacy of light-based inactivation was reduced by the presence of absorptive materials. Several technologies can be used to deliver light, including mercury lamp (conventional UV), excimer lamp (UV), pulsed-light, and light-emitting diode (LED). Pulsed-light technologies could inactivate viruses more quickly than conventional UV-C lamps. Large-scale use of germicidal LED is dependent on future improvements in their energy efficiency. Blue light possesses virucidal potential in the presence of exogenous photosensitizers, although femtosecond laser (ultrashort pulses) can be used to circumvent the need for photosensitizers. Red light can be combined with methylene blue for application in medical settings, especially for sanitization of blood products. Future modelling studies are required to establish clearer parameters for assessing susceptibility of viruses to light-based inactivation.

Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively evaluated 690 lesions obtained from 35 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia based on typical findings on non-contrast high-resolution CT (HRCT) in our hospital. The diagnoses of the patients were also confirmed by other necessary tests. HRCT images were assessed in the parenchymal window. In the images obtained, COVID-19 lesions were detected. For the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, the Confusion matrix was used based on a Tensorflow Framework in Python. Result: A total of 596 labeled lesions obtained from 224 sections of the images were used for the training of the algorithm, 89 labeled lesions from 27 sections were used in validation, and 67 labeled lesions from 25 images in testing. Fifty-six of the 67 lesions used in the testing stage were accurately detected by the algorithm while the remaining 11 were not recognized. There was no false positive. The Recall, Precision and F1 score values in the test group were 83.58, 1, and 91.06, respectively.

Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are widely used for this task, modeling each subfamily separately by one pHMM. However, a major drawback of this approach is the difficulty of dealing with subfamilies composed of very few sequences. One of the most crucial bioinformatical tasks affected by the problem of small-size subfamilies is the subtyping of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) sequences, i.e., HIV-1 subtypes for which only a small number of sequences is known. RESULTS: To deal with small samples for particular subfamilies of HIV-1, we introduce a novel model-based information sharing protocol. It estimates the emission probabilities of the pHMM modeling a particular subfamily not only based on the nucleotide frequencies of the respective subfamily but also incorporating the nucleotide frequencies of all available subfamilies. To this end, the underlying probabilistic model mimics the pattern of commonality and variation between the subtypes with regards to the biological characteristics of HI viruses. In order to implement the proposed protocol, we make use of an existing HMM architecture and its associated inference engine. CONCLUSIONS: We apply the modified algorithm to classify HIV-1 sequence data in the form of partial HIV-1 sequences and semi-artificial recombinants. Thereby, we demonstrate that the performance of pHMMs can be significantly improved by the proposed technique. Moreover, we show that our algorithm performs significantly better than Simplot and Bootscanning.","output":"A model-based information sharing protocol for profile Hidden Markov Models used for HIV-1 recombination detection"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In December 2019, in Wuhan, China, the first cases of what would be known as COVID-19, a disease caused by an RNA virus called SARS-CoV-2, were described.

At present, the pathogenesis of this kind of disease is not completely clear, and there is no radical cure. The main purpose of the treatment of this disease is to slow down the deterioration of pulmonary fibrosis. For this kind of disease, if it can be found early, it can be treated as soon as possible and the life of patients will be prolonged. Clinically, the diagnosis of pulmonary fibrosis depends on the relevant imaging examination, lung biopsy, lung function examination, and so on. Imaging data such as X-rays is a common examination means in clinical medicine and also plays an important role in the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis. Through X-ray, radiologists can clearly see the relevant lung lesions so as to make the relevant diagnosis. Based on the common medical image data, this paper designs related models to complete the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis. The model designed in this paper is mainly divided into two parts: first, this paper uses a neural network to complete the segmentation of lung organs; second, the neural network of image classification is designed to complete the process from lung image to disease prediction. In the design of these two parts, this paper improves on the basis of previous research methods.

The questions to be explored were: Are there discernable differences in hours of sleep and sleep habits between the normal operational environment and the stay-at-home condition? and How seriously anxiety-induced insomnia or other sleep disorders may affect individuals during the stay-at-home? Methods This international prospective study analyzed results from the sleep-wake patterns questionnaire, daily logs, and interviews. During COVID-19 pandemic, surveys were administered to the healthy volunteers with stay-at-home for 14 days or more, without previous sleep disorders; volunteers were not involved in online education/work daily timetable-related activities. Results We analyzed 14,000 subjects from 11 countries with average stay-at-home of 62 days. The most significant changes in sleep occurred during the first 14 days of stay-at-home. The difference in the sleep duration between weekdays and weekends disappeared. Most of the participants discontinued using alarm clocks.

METHODS: The evaluations were carried out by means of an online survey, with a sample of 3480 persons in the first data collection and 1041 and 569 persons in the successive evaluation periods. The presence of depressive symptoms, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated by means of screening tests. Sociodemographic data, Covid-19 variables, loneliness, psychological well-being, social support, discrimination and a sense of belonging, were collected. RESULTS: Depressive symptoms increased significantly throughout the confinement, decreasing at the last assessment but not dropping to previous levels. In anxiety, there are no significant changes between the three evaluations, but a downward trend can be seen over time. Regarding the symptomatology of PTSD, a downward trend is observed throughout the three evaluations, with significantly lower scores between the first and third assessments. The different regression models developed reveal the importance of perceived loneliness and spiritual well-being as the main predictors of mental health, as well as the importance of the lower age for depression and the female gender for anxiety and PSTD.

Witnessing a substantial increase in the number of infections in Germany, the authorities have imposed drastic restrictions on everyday life. Resulting panic buying and increasing home consumption had versatile impacts on transport volume and freight capacity dynamics in German food retail logistics. Due to the lack of prior research on the effects of COVID-19 on transport volume in retail logistics, as well as resulting implications, this article aspires to shed light on the phenomenon of changing volume and capacity dynamics in road haulage.

The results of this study prove that the increasing freight volume for dry products in retail logistics does not depend on the duration of the COVID-19 epidemy but on the strength quantified through the total number of new infections per day.

This landscaping outlines how current mental models for MNH programs have fallen short for urban slum populations and identifies implications for the global community. We employed a three-pronged approach, including a literature review, key informant interviews with global- and national-level experts, and a case study in Bangladesh. MAIN BODY: Our findings highlight that the current mental model for MNH is inadequate to address the needs of the urban poor. Implementation challenges have arisen from using traditional methods that are not well adapted to traits inherent in slum settings. A re-thinking of implementation strategies will also need to consider a paucity of available routine data, lack of formal coordination between stakeholders and providers, and challenging municipal government structures. Innovative approaches, including with communications, outreach, and technology, will be necessary to move beyond traditional rural-centric approaches to MNH. As populations continue to urbanize, common slum dynamics will challenge conventional strategies for health service delivery. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed weaknesses in a system that requires intersectoral collaborations to deliver quality care. CONCLUSION: Programs will need to be iterative and adaptive, reflective of sociodemographic features. Integrating the social determinants of health into evaluations, using participatory human-centered design processes, and innovative public-private partnerships may prove beneficial in slum settings.

Numerous studies have confirmed that people have changed their travel to urban green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in China, where COVID-19 has been effectively controlled, how the travel behavior of visitors to urban parks has changed under different risk levels (RLs) of COVID-19 is unclear. Faced with these gaps, we took a highly developed city, Wuhan, as a case study and a questionnaire survey was conducted with 3276 respondents to analyze the changes in park visitors' travel behaviors under different COVID-19 RLs. Using a stated preference (SP) survey method, four RLs were assigned: new cases in other provinces (RL1), Hubei province (RL2), Wuhan (RL3), and in the district of the park (RL4). The results indicated that visitors reduced their willingness to visit urban parks, with 78.39%, 37.97%, and 13.34% of visitors remaining under RL2, RL3, and RL4, respectively. Furthermore, the service radius of urban parks also shrank from 4230 m under no new cases of COVID-19 to approximately 3000 m under RL3. A higher impact was found for visitors using public transport, those with a higher income and higher education, and female visitors.

SARS-CoV-2 infections were first detected in a Chinese Province in December 2019 and then declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. An infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 may result in asymptomatic, uncomplicated or fatal coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fatal disease has been linked with the uncontrolled cytokine storm manifesting with complications mostly in people with underlying cardiovascular and pulmonary disease conditions. The severity of COVID-19 disease and the associated mortality has been disproportionately lower in terms of number of cases and deaths in Africa and also Asia in comparison to Europe and North America. Also, persons of colour residing in Europe and North America have been identified as a highly susceptible population due to a combination of several socioeconomic factors and poor access to quality healthcare. Interestingly, this has not been the case in sub-Saharan Africa where majority of the population are even more deprived of the aforementioned factors. On the contrary, sub-Saharan Africa has recorded the lowest levels of mortality and morbidity associated with the disease, and an overwhelming proportion of infections are asymptomatic. Whilst it can be argued that these lower number of cases in Africa may be due to challenges associated with the diagnosis of the disease such as lack of trained personnel and infrastructure, the number of persons who get infected and develop symptoms is proportionally lower than those who are asymptomatic, including asymptomatic cases that are never diagnosed.

As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID-19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.","output":"How COVID-19 has impacted the role of pharmacists around the world"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The coronavirus pandemic has hit the world lately and caused acute respiratory syndrome in humans.

OBJECTIVE: Describe the COVID-19 pandemic experiences of and effects on individuals participating in the HERO registry. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, self-administered registry enrollment survey conducted from April 10 to July 31, 2020. SETTING: Participants worked in hospitals (74.4%), outpatient clinics (7.4%), and other settings (18.2%) located throughout the nation. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,600 healthcare workers. MAIN MEASURES: COVID-19 exposure, viral and antibody testing, diagnosis of COVID-19, job burnout, and physical and emotional distress. KEY RESULTS: Mean age was 42.0 years, 76.4% were female, 78.9% were White, 33.2% were nurses, 18.4% were physicians, and 30.3% worked in settings at high risk for COVID-19 exposure (e.g., ICUs, EDs, COVID-19 units). Overall, 43.7% reported a COVID-19 exposure and 91.3% were exposed at work. Just 3.8% in both high- and low-risk settings experienced COVID-19 illness. In regression analyses controlling for demographics, professional role, and work setting, the risk of COVID-19 illness was higher for Black/African-Americans (aOR 2.32, 99% CI 1.45, 3.70, p < 0.01) and Hispanic/Latinos (aOR 2.19, 99% CI 1.55, 3.08, p < 0.01) compared with Whites. Overall, 41% responded that they were experiencing job burnout. Responding about the day before they completed the survey, 53% of participants reported feeling tired a lot of the day, 51% stress, 41% trouble sleeping, 38% worry, 21% sadness, 19% physical pain, and 15% anger. On average, healthcare workers reported experiencing 2.4 of these 7 distress feelings a lot of the day. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare workers are at high risk for COVID-19 exposure, but rates of COVID-19 illness were low. The greater risk of COVID-19 infection among race/ethnicity minorities reported in the general population is also seen in healthcare workers.

More-over, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress levels among people across the globe. Therefore, continuous monitoring and detection of stress are necessary. The recent advances in wearable devices have allowed the monitoring of several physiological signals related to stress. Among them, wrist-worn wearable devices like smartwatches are most popular due to their convenient usage. And the photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor is the most prevalent sensor in almost all consumer-grade wrist-worn smartwatches. Therefore, this paper focuses on using a wrist-based PPG sensor that collects Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals to detect stress which may be applicable for consumer-grade wristwatches. Moreover, state-of-the-art works have used either classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted features or have used deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which automatically extracts features. This paper proposes a novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features and the automatically extracted features by CNN to detect stress using the BVP signal. Evaluation on the benchmark WESAD dataset shows that, for 3-class classification (Baseline vs. Stress vs. Amusement), our proposed H-CNN outperforms traditional classifiers and normal CNN by 5% and 7% accuracy, and 10% and 7% macro F1 score, respectively.

METHODS: During the pandemic, the scheduled medical visits were converted into telephone consultation. For each teleconsultation, the physician assessed the efficiency and the patient\\\\rated global satisfaction of the teleconsultation. The physician and the patient assessed whether this teleconsultation replaced a physical visit. RESULTS: About 358 neurologic patients were included in the study. The mean efficiency of the telephone consultation was 9.3/10 (1.5). The mean global satisfaction was 9.0/10 (1.3). The majority of the patients (52.4%) would prefer a physical consultation. 90.2% might convert some clinic visits to teleconsultations in the future. No agreement was found between the patient and the physician when they were asked if the teleconsultation replaced the physical consultation initially scheduled (weight kappa = 0.02; 95% confidence interval = [?0.06 to 0.11]). Cognitive impairment, difficulty to obtain relevant information, and lack of physical examination were unfavorable to the efficiency of the teleconsultation.

Although harm perceptions have been linked to youth e-cigarette use, little research focuses on vulnerable populations, such as Appalachian youth. This study examines associations between e-cigarette harm perceptions and tobacco use among a sample of Appalachian youth. METHODS: Using data from the 2014C2016 Youth Appalachian Tobacco Study (n=1074), distributions of six e-cigarette harm perceptions by tobacco use (never, ever non-e-cigarette, ever e-cigarette) were examined, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used. RESULTS: Nearly one-fourth (23.4%) of the sample were ever e-cigarette users. More e-cigarette users were male (53.4%) and in high school (57.0%). Fewer e-cigarette users strongly agreed that e-cigarettes cause health problems (15.1%), breathing problems (20.3%), and oral health problems (18.7%) and that e-cigarettes are addictive (25.1%), compared to never and non-e-cigarette users. More e-cigarette users strongly agreed (32.3%) that e-cigarettes are healthier alternatives to cigarettes compared to never (24.1%) and non-e-cigarette (25.7%) users. Regression models indicate that e-cigarette users had greater odds of strongly disagreeing with e-cigarettes being harmful or addictive, compared to never users. E-cigarette users had approximately six-fold odds of strongly disagreeing with e-cigarettes causing health problems (OR=6.12; 95% CI: 3.16C11.90) and two times greater odds of disagreeing with e-cigarettes being addictive (OR=2.09; 95% CI: 1.07C4.08) compared to never users.

If the poison stagnating in the paper is desorbed, it may pose a secondary threat to personnel and make it more difficult to dispose of the scrapped paper. Using an alkali-free glass fiber as the base material and zirconium hydroxide as the decontaminant, a self-decontaminating air filter paper that can degrade HD and VX simultaneously was successfully prepared by an intra-pulp addition method, with high filtration efficiency, low pressure drop and moderate tensile strength. The physicochemical properties were characterized by FE-SEM, EDX, XRD and TGA, and the results indicated that Zr(OH)4 was dispersed uniformly in the paper and filled in the interstices of the glass fiber. The preparation of the composite material had no impact on the structure of fibers and Zr(OH)4. The preparation technology of the self-decontaminating air filter paper was optimized. It was found that the paper with a fiber grammage of 50 g m-2, the adhesive of 2% and a Zr(OH)4 retention rate of 175.0 wt% could completely degrade HD and VX, whose conversion rate exceeded 99.0%, and had a tensile strength of 0.1193 kN m-1, a filtration efficiency of 99.995%, and a pressure drop of 313.6 Pa. Using GC-MS to detect the decontamination products, it was speculated that HD mainly underwent hydrolysis and elimination reactions, VX mainly underwent hydrolysis and polymerization reactions, and their products were non-toxic or low-toxic. The reaction kinetics of HD and VX on the paper was investigated and the half-lives were 2.6 h and 16.2 min, respectively, which demonstrated an outstanding degradation performance.

To combat this crisis, research community world-wide are falling back on the existing repertoire of approved/investigational drugs to probe into their anti-coronavirus properties. In this report, we have described our unique efforts in identifying potential drugs that could be repurposed against main protease of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). To achieve this goal, we have primarily exploited the principles of neighbourhood behaviour in protein 3-D (workflow-I) and chemical 2-D structural space (workflow-II) coupled with docking simulations and insights into the possible mode of actions of the selected candidates from available literature. Such an integrative approach culminated in prioritizing 29 potential repurpose-able agents (20 approved drugs and 9 investigational molecules) against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Apart from the approved/investigational anti-viral drugs, other notable hits include anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-coagulant drugs. Our analysis suggests that some of these drugs have the potential to simultaneously modulate the functions of viral proteins and host response system. Interestingly, many of these identified candidates (12 molecules from workflow-I and several molecules belonging to the chemical classes of alkaloids, tetracyclines, peptidomimetics from workflow-II) are suggested to possess anti-viral properties which are supported by laboratory and clinical data. Further, this work opens a new avenue of research to probe into the molecular mechanism of action of many drugs which are known to demonstrate anti-viral activity but are so far not known to target viral proteases.

Mental illness and associated medication use has been proven to have a negative effect on bone health and fracture healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collated data retrospectively from the records of orthopaedic inpatients in a non-COVID and COVID period. We analysed demographic data, referral and admission numbers, orthopaedic injuries, surgery performed and patient comorbidities, including psychiatric history. RESULTS: There were 824 orthopaedic referrals and 358 admissions (six/day) in the non-COVID period, with 38/358 (10.6%) admissions having a psychiatric diagnosis and 30/358 (8.4%) also having a fracture. This was compared with 473 referrals and 195 admissions (three/day) in the COVID period, with 73/195 (37.4%) admissions having a documented psychiatric diagnosis and 47/195 (24.1%) having a fracture. DISCUSSION: There was a reduction in the number of admissions and referrals during the pandemic, but a simultaneous three-fold rise in admissions with a psychiatric diagnosis. The proportion of patients with both a fracture and a psychiatric diagnosis more than doubled and the number of patients presenting due to a traumatic suicide attempt almost tripled. CONCLUSION: While total numbers using the orthopaedic service decreased, the impact of the pandemic and lockdown disproportionately affects those with mental health problems, a group already at higher risk of poorer functional outcomes and non-union.

In a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) world, such time-lags feel intolerable. In these extraordinary circumstances could years be made into months? If so, could those lessons be used to accelerate medical research when the crisis eases?To measure time-lags in health and biomedical research as well as to identify ways of reducing them, we developed and published (in 2015) a matrix consisting of overlapping tracks (or stages/phases) in the translation from discovery research to developed products, policies and practice. The matrix aids analysis by highlighting the time and actions required to develop research (and its translation) both (1) along each track and (2) from one track to another, e.g. from the discovery track to the research-in-humans track. We noted four main approaches to reducing time-lags, namely increasing resources, working in parallel, starting or working at risk, and improving processes.Examining these approaches alongside the matrix helps interpret the enormous global effort to develop a vaccine for the 2019 novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Rapid progress in the discovery/basic and human research tracks is being made through a combination of large-scale funding, work being conducted in parallel (between different teams globally and through working in overlapping tracks), working at greater (but proportionate) risk to safety than usual, and adopting various new processes. The overlapping work of some of the teams involves continuing animal research whilst entering vaccine candidates into Phase I trials alongside planning their Phase II trials. The additional funding available helps to reduce some of the usual financial risks in moving so quickly. Going forward through the increasingly large human trials for safety, dosage and efficacy, it will be vital to overlap work in parallel in the often challenging public policy and clinical tracks. Thus, regulatory and reimbursement bodies are beginning and preparing rapid action to pull vaccines proving to be safe and effective through to extraordinarily rapid application to the general population.

The COVID-19 triggers a lung infection with a multiple proinflammatory cytokine storm in severe patients. Without effective and safe treatments, COVID-19 has killed thousands of people, becoming a pandemic. Stem cells have been suggested as a therapy for lung-related diseases. In particular, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been successfully tested in some clinical trials in patients with COVID-19. The encouraging results positioned MSCs as a possible cell therapy for COVID-19. The amniotic membrane from the human placenta at term is a valuable stem cell source, including human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs). Interestingly, amnion cells have immunoregulatory, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, hAECs and hAMSCs have been used both in preclinical studies and in clinical trials against respiratory diseases. They have reduced the inflammatory response and restored the pulmonary tissue architecture in lung injury in vivo models. Here, we review the existing data about the stem cells use for COVID-19 treatment, including the ongoing clinical trials. We also consider the non-cellular therapies that are being applied. Finally, we discuss the human amniotic membrane cells use in patients who suffer from immune/inflammatory lung diseases and hypothesize their possible use as a successful treatment against COVID-19.","output":"Stem cells and COVID-19: are the human amniotic cells a new hope for therapies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus?"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"There is a need for accurate monitoring of PM2.5 that adversely affects human health. Consequently, in addition to the monitoring performed by fixed microbalance instruments installed under legal obligation, we are proposing to deploy the Pollutrack network of mobile sensors within the city of Paris (France). The measurements are performed by mobile aerosol counters mounted on the roof of cars, providing a constant series of readings in the 0.3C10 m size range that are then aggregated to identify areas of mass concentrations of pollution. The performance of the Pollutrack sensors has been established in ambient air in comparison with the microbalance measurement devices and with the Light Optical Aerosols Counter (LOAC) aerosol counter. A measurement uncertainty of about 5 g. m?3 is obtained with absolute values from the Pollutrack measurements made at a given location. Instead of the current modelizations based on very few PM2.5 values, maps built from real measurements with a spatial resolution down to 100 m can now be produced each day for Paris, and potentially for specific times of the day, thanks to the high number of measurements achievable with the Pollutrack system (over 70,000 on weekdays). Interestingly, the global trend of PM2.5 content shows several significant pollution events in 2020 despite the COVID-19 crisis and the lockdown. The Pollutrack pollution maps recorded during different PM2.5 pollution conditions in the city frequently identified a strong spatial heterogeneity where the North and the East of Paris were more polluted than the west. These hot spots could be due to the city topology and its sensitivity to wind direction and intensity. These high-resolution maps will be crucial in creating evidence for the relevant authorities to respond appropriately to local sources of pollution and to improve the understanding of transportation of urban PM. ? 2021 by the authors.

Failure to distinguish the 2 diseases may increase the risk of transmission. A fast and convenient differential diagnosis between COVID-19 and influenza has significant clinical value, especially for low- and middle-income countries with a shortage of nucleic acid detection kits. We aimed to establish a diagnostic model to differentiate COVID-19 and influenza based on clinical data. MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 493 patients were enrolled in the study, including 282 with COVID-19 and 211 with influenza. All data were collected and reviewed retrospectively. The clinical and laboratory characteristics of all patients were analyzed and compared. We then randomly divided all patients into development sets and validation sets to establish a diagnostic model using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Finally, we validated the diagnostic model using the validation set. RESULTS: We preliminarily established a diagnostic model for differentiating COVID-19 from influenza that consisted of 5 variables: age, dry cough, fever, white cell count, and D-dimer. The model showed good performance for differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: This initial model including clinical features and laboratory indices effectively differentiated COVID-19 from influenza. Patients with a high score were at a high risk of having COVID-19, while patients with a low score were at a high risk of having influenza. This model could help clinicians quickly identify and isolate cases in the absence of nucleic acid tests, especially during the cocirculation of COVID-19 and influenza.

We describe an accumulation of CD163-expressing monocyte-derived macrophages that acquired a profibrotic transcriptional phenotype during COVID-19 ARDS. Gene set enrichment and computational data integration revealed a significant similarity between COVID-19-associated macrophages and profibrotic macrophage populations identified in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. COVID-19 ARDS was associated with clinical, radiographic, histopathological, and ultrastructural hallmarks of pulmonary fibrosis. Exposure of human monocytes to SARS-CoV-2, but not Influenza A virus or viral RNA analogs, was sufficient to induce a similar profibrotic phenotype in vitro.

A retrospective chart review of consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) case records was conducted for one month before and after the start of lockdown. Patients seen during lockdown were relatively younger; t = 1.8, p = 0.074.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes among hospital pharmacists about COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to pharmacists participating in the 7thNational Hospital and Institution Pharmacists Congress. The questions included in this questionnaire were created using the Turkish COVID-19 Scientific Committee guideline (COVID-19 Guideline). Results: Analysis of 237 questionnaires (72.6% completed by women) showed that the media (television, newspaper), internet (nonscientific resources), internet (scientific resources), and social media were the most popular sources of information (60.3%, 53.6%, 53.2%, and 41.4%, respectively). The participants age and the source of information that they used had an important influence on their knowledge of and attitudes towards COVID-19 infection. The majority of the participants (72.6%) stated that they were not wearing any kind of mask. Transmission of the disease by airborne route was well known by the participants (91.1%), as well as the main symptoms such as fever (92.4%), cough (84.4%), and dyspnea (60.3%). The participants were aware of the risk groups for COVID-19 infection such as advanced age (84.8%) and having comorbidities (80.2%).

The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic disaster of 2019-2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions were the most important response strategy based on community interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good personal hygiene (hand-washing)-all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster.

In this context, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) can be used as prognostic factors. We study NLR and PLR trends at different timepoints and compute optimal cutoffs to predict four outcomes: use of Continuous Positive Airways Pressure (CPAP), ICU admission, invasive ventilation and death. Methods: we retrospectively included all adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia admitted from 23 rd January 2020 to 18 th May 2021. Data were extracted using ICD9 codes and our Covid-19 registry. Analyses included descriptive statistics and non parametric tests to study the ability of NLR and PLR to distinguish the patients outcomes at each timepoint. ROC curves were built for NLR and PLR at each timepoint (minus discharge) in order to identify cutoffs to distinguish severe and non severe disease and their statistical significance was assessed with the Chi-square test. NLR and PLR were compared with DeLongs test. Results: we included 2169 patients. NLR and PLR were higher in severe Covid-19 at all the timepoints, with a difference that gets bigger and a trend that is steeper in more severe disease. Both ratios were able to distinguish the outcomes at each timepoint. For NLR, the areas under the curve (AUROC) ranged between 0.59 and 0.81, for PLR, between 0.53 and 0.67. From each ROC curve we computed an optimal cutoff value (e.g. NLR 7 for CPAP for males at admission). NLR performed better than PLR. Conclusion: our results are in line with other studies that computed NLR and PLR trends and values in disease, especially with those that distinguished between different grades of severity.

We compared the number of ACS patients in 2020 to the same period in 2018 and 2019. Predictors of adverse outcome in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients were recorded: symptom-onset-to-first medical contact (FMC), and FMC-to-sheath insertion times. During the studied period (calendar weeks 8-17, 2018-2020), 144 ACS patients were included. In 2020, we observed two distinct phases in the ACS admissions: a first significant fall, with a relative reduction of 73%, from the week of lockdown (week 12) to 3 weeks later and then an increase of ACS. Median symptom-onset-to-FMC time was significantly higher in 2020 than in the two previous years (600 min [298-632] versus 121 min [55-291], p < 0.001).

In response to unprecedented restrictions on human contact during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, studies measured social contact patterns under the implementation of physical distancing measures. This rapid review synthesizes empirical data on the changing social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: We conducted a systematic review using PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We descriptively compared the distribution of contacts observed during the pandemic to pre-COVID data across countries to explore changes in contact patterns during physical distancing measures. RESULTS: We identified 12 studies reporting social contact patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Eight studies were conducted in European countries and eleven collected data during the initial mitigation period in the spring of 2020 marked by government-declared lockdowns. Some studies collected additional data after relaxation of initial mitigation. Most study settings reported a mean of between 2 and 5 contacts per person per day, a substantial reduction compared to pre-COVID rates, which ranged from 7 to 26 contacts per day. This reduction was pronounced for contacts outside of the home. Consequently, levels of assortative mixing by age substantially declined. After relaxation of initial mitigation, mean contact rates increased but did not return to pre-COVID levels. Increases in contacts post-relaxation were driven by working-age adults.

Recent advances in visual recognition are based on image classification and artefacts detection within these images. The purpose of this study is to classify chest X-ray images of COVID-19 artefacts in changed real-world situations. A novel Bayesian optimization-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed for the recognition of chest X-ray images. The proposed model has two main components. The first one utilizes CNN to extract and learn deep features. The second component is a Bayesian-based optimizer that is used to tune the CNN hyperparameters according to an objective function. The used large-scale and balanced dataset comprises 10,848 images (i.e., 3616 COVID-19, 3616 normal cases, and 3616 Pneumonia). In the first ablation investigation, we compared Bayesian optimization to three distinct ablation scenarios. We used convergence charts and accuracy to compare the three scenarios. We noticed that the Bayesian search-derived optimal architecture achieved 96% accuracy. To assist qualitative researchers, address their research questions in a methodologically sound manner, a comparison of research method and theme analysis methods was provided.

CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 20 has been reported to be important in inflammation and fibrosis in the liver. We hypothesized that visfatin, an adipocytokine, could play a role in hepatic fibrosis via CCL20. We investigated the effect of visfatin on CCL20 in THP-1 human promonocytic cells and examined the molecular mechanisms involved. Following treatment of THP-1 cells with visfatin, CCL20 expression and secretion were assessed. We assessed the intracellular signaling molecules IKK/NF-&#954;B, JAK2/STAT3, MAPKs, and MKK3/6 by western blotting. We treated THP-1 cells with visfatin and signaling inhibitors, and examined CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. To investigate the effect of visfatin-induced CCL20 expression in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), LX-2 cells were co-cultured with the culture supernatant of THP-1 cells with or without anti-CCL20 neutralizing antibodies, and fibrosis markers were examined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting. In THP-1 cells, visfatin increased the CCL20 mRNA and protein levels. visfatin increased the activities of the NF-&#954;B, p38, and MLK3/6 signaling pathways but not those of the JAK2/STAT3 and ERK pathways. Visfatin treatment together with an NF-&#954;B, p38, or MLK3 inhibitor reduced the mRNA and protein levels of CCL20. The visfatin-induced CCL20 increased the expression of fibrosis markers and CCR6 in HSCs. Following neutralization of CCL20, the levels of fibrosis markers and CCR6 were decreased. Visfatin increases the expression of CCL20 via the NF-&#954;B and MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathways in macrophages, and visfatin-induced CCL20 expression promotes the fibrosis markers in HSCs.","output":"CCL20 induced by visfatin in macrophages via the NF-B and MKK3/6-p38 signaling pathways contributes to hepatic stellate cell activation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The use of quantile regression to calculate risk measures has been widely recognized in the financial econometrics literature.

In this paper, we develop a model built on a mixed-frequency quantile regression to directly estimate the Value-at-Risk. In particular, the low-frequency component incorporates information coming from variables observed at, typically, monthly or lower frequencies, while the high-frequency component can include a variety of daily variables, like realized volatility measures or market indices. We derive the conditions for the weak stationarity of the daily return process suggested while the finite sample properties are investigated in an extensive Monte Carlo exercise. The validity of the proposed model is then explored through a real data application using the most important financial indexes.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to identify barriers and facilitators of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) HCP vaccination program. DESIGN: We conducted key informant interviews with employee occupational health (EOH) providers, using snowball recruitment. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 43 VHA EOH providers representing 29 of VHAs regionally diverse healthcare systems. APPROACH: Thematic analysis elucidated 5 key themes and specific strategies recommended by EOH. KEY RESULTS: Implementation themes reflected logistics of distribution (supply), addressing any vaccine concerns or hesitancy (demand), and learning health system strategies/approaches for shared learnings. Specifically, themes included the following: (1) use interdisciplinary task forces to leverage diverse skillsets for vaccine implementation; (2) invest in processes and align resources with priorities, including creating detailed processes, addressing time trade-offs for personnel involved in vaccine clinics by suspending everything non-essential, designating process/authority to shift personnel where needed, and proactively involving leaders to support resource allocation/alignment; (3) expect and accommodate vaccine buy-in occurring over time: prepare for some HCPs slow buy-in, align buy-in facilitation with identities and motivation, and encourage word-of-mouth and hyper-local testimonials; (4) overcome misinformation with trustworthy communication: tailor communication to individuals and address COVID vaccines in every encounter, leverage proactive institutional messaging to reinforce information, and invite bi-directional conversations about any vaccine concerns. A final overarching theme focused on learning health system needs and structures: (5) use existing and newly developed communication channels to foster shared learning across teams and sites. CONCLUSIONS: Expecting deliberation allows systems to prepare for complex distribution logistics (supply) and make room for conversations that are trustworthy, bi-directional, and identity aligned (demand). Ideally, organizations provide time for conversations that address individual concerns, foster bi-directional shared decision-making, respect HCP beliefs and identities, and emphasize shared identities as healthcare providers.","output":"Promising Strategies to Support COVID-19 Vaccination of Healthcare Personnel: Qualitative Insights from the VHA National Implementation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Robotic surgical technology has grown in popularity and applicability, since its conception with emerging uses in general surgery. The robot's contribution of increased stability and dexterity may be beneficial in technically challenging surgeries, namely, inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this project is to contribute to the growing body of literature on robotic technology for inguinal hernia repair (RIHR) by sharing our experience with RIHR at a large, academic institution. We performed a retrospective chart review spanning from March 2015 to April 2018 on all patients who had undergone RIHR at our university hospital. Extracted data include preoperative demographics, operative features, and postoperative outcomes. Data were analyzed with particular focus on complications, including hernia recurrence. A total of 43 patients were included, 40 of which were male. Mean patient age was 56 (range 18-85 years) and mean patient BMI was 26.4 (range 17.5-42.3). Bilateral hernias were diagnosed in 13 patients. All of the patients received transabdominal approaches, and all but one received placement of synthetic polypropylene mesh. There was variety in mesh placement with 23 patients receiving suture fixation and 14 receiving tack fixation. Several patients received a combination of suture, tacks, and surgical glue. Mean patient in-room time was 4.0 h, mean operative time was 2.9 h, and mean robotic dock time was 2.0 h. Regarding intraoperative complications, there was one bladder injury, which was discovered intraoperatively and repaired primarily. Same-day discharges were achieved in 32 patients (74.4%) of patients. One patient was admitted overnight for management of urinary retention. Additional ten patients were admitted for observation. Post-operatively, none of the cases resulted in wound infections. Eleven patients developed seromas and one patient was diagnosed with a groin hematoma. Median follow-up was 37.5 days, and one recurrence was reported during this time. The recurrent hernia in this case was initially discovered during a separate case and was repaired with temporary mesh. The use of the robot is safe and effective and should be considered an acceptable approach to inguinal hernia repair.

A simple screening tool may support risk stratification, identification, and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated and compared the accuracy and clinical utility of existing screening questionnaires for identifying OSA in different clinical cohorts. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies assessing the diagnostic value of OSA screening questionnaires. We identified prospective studies, validated against polysomnography, and published to December 2020 from online databases. To pool the results, we used random effects bivariate binomial meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 38 studies across three clinical cohorts in the meta-analysis. In the sleep clinic cohort, the Berlin questionnaires pooled sensitivity for apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)  5,  15, and  30 was 85%, 84%, and 89%, and pooled specificity was 43%, 30%, and 33%, respectively. The STOP questionnaires pooled sensitivity for AHI  5,  15, and  30 was 90%, 90%, and 95%, and pooled specificity was 31%, 29%, and 21%. The pooled sensitivity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire for AHI  5,  15, and  30 was 92%, 95%, and 96%, and pooled specificity was 35%, 27%, and 28%. In the surgical cohort (AHI  15), the Berlin and STOP-Bang questionnaires pooled sensitivity were 76% and 90% and pooled specificity 47% and 27%. CONCLUSION: Among the identified questionnaires, the STOP-Bang questionnaire had the highest sensitivity to detect OSA but lacked specificity. Subgroup analysis considering other at-risk populations was not possible. Our observations are limited by the low certainty level in available data.

Recent data suggest a prominent B cell germinal-center (GC) response elicited by mRNA vaccines in draining lymph nodes. Thus, in this study we aimed to explore the correlation between VAHL and humoral immunity as reflected by post-vaccination serologic testing and by comparing the incidence of VAHL between lymphoma patients treated recently with B cell depleting therapy and those that were not. METHODS: A total of 137 patients with hematologic malignancy that had post-vaccination [(18)F]FDG PET-CT were included (All-PET group), 86 received both vaccine doses before imaging (PET-2 group). Their VAHL status and grade on imaging were recorded. Among 102 lymphoma patients, 34 (33.3%) were treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy. A subgroup of 54 patients also underwent serologic testing 2C3 weeks after the booster dose, and their anti-spike titers were recorded and graded as well. RESULTS: The overall incidence of VAHL in patients with hematologic malignancy was 31.4%. The 34 lymphoma patients treated during the year prior vaccination with anti-CD20 antibody containing therapy had significantly lower rates of VAHL comparted with all other lymphoma patients (8.8 versus 41.2% in all-PET patients, Pv < 0.01). VAHL rates were 10% in patients with negative serology, 31.3% in patients with low anti-spike titers, and 72.2% in patients with high anti-spike titers. The positive predictive values of VAHL were 90 and 93.3% in all-PET and PET-2 patients, respectively. A positive statistically significant correlation was found between VAHL and serology ranks in All-PET patients (r(s) = 0.530, Pv < 0.001), and stronger correlation was found in PET-2 patients (r(s) = 0.642, Pv < 0.001).

This study aims to evaluate morbidity and mortality in the COVID-19 era compared to the preceding year in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Tamale Teaching Hospital, Ghana. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study carried out on neonates admitted to NICU between March 1st to August 31st, 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) and March 1st to August 31st, 2020 (COVID-19 era). Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of mortality for both periods. Results: From 2,901 neonates, 1,616 (56%) were admitted before, and 1,285 (44%) were admitted during the pandemic. Admissions decreased during the COVID-19 era, reaching their lowest point between June and August 2020. Compared to the previous year, during the COVID-19 era, admissions of patients born at TTH, delivered at home, and with infections decreased from 50 to 39%, 7 to 4%, and 22 to 13%, respectively. Referred status (OR = 3.3) and vaginal delivery (OR = 1.6) were associated with an increased likelihood of mortality. For low- birth weight neonates, admissions of patients born at TTH, with vaginal and home delivery decreased from 62 to 48%, 8 to 2%, and 59 to 52%, respectively. Neonatal infections and congenital anomalies decreased from 8 to 4%, 5 to 3%, respectively. The likelihood of mortality among referred patients increased by 50%. Conclusion: We observed a marked decrease in admissions and change in the diagnosis landscape and related mortality during the pandemic. Underlying challenges, including fear, financing, and health system capacity, might intensify delays and lack of access to newborn care in northern Ghana, leading to higher rates of lifelong disabilities and mortality.

To assess how and in what extent the electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) use substituted the consumption of traditional combustible cigarettes (c-cigarettes, c-cig). MATERIALS AND METHODS. We performed a systematic review of the literature up to August 2019 in scientific databases. Primary outcomes were proportion of complete or partial substitution of conventional to electronic cigarettes and related economic aspects. Secondary outcomes were odds ratio of substitution and country-wise time trends. RESULTS. We retrieved 3,628 references and included 49 studies, providing economic and epidemiological data. Economic studies of cross-price elasticity showed that combustible cigarettes are partially substitutable for electronic cigarettes. Most studies reported that electronic cigarettes consumption prevalence increased over time. Three studies reported a significant reduction of combustible cigarettes consumed per day among dual users (combustible- plus electronic- cigarettes users) versus combustible-cigarettes users. The pooled adjusted odds ratio of quitting combustible cigarettes among electronic cigarettes users versus never or past electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes, e-cig) users was 1.19 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.30; heterogeneity score 0%). Longitudinal studies showed globally a growing prevalence of electronic cigarettes use, mainly in adolescents. A negative relationship between consumption and price increase of electronic and combustible cigarettes was found. CONCLUSION. The chance of quitting smoking combustible cigarettes among current electronic nicotine delivery systems users was increased with respect to never- or past- electronic nicotine delivery systems users.

Conclusion: Rate of barotrauma in COVID-19 intubated patients was noted to be 19% in our study, which is on par with the rate of ventilator-induced barotrauma with the previous SARS virus-associated ARDS, and higher than that of the general population with ARDS. Patients who developed barotrauma were also noted to be intubated for a significantly longer duration (16.52 days) as compared to their non-barotrauma counterparts. These findings suggest a need for more data and randomized studies to establish appropriate ventilator management strategies for patients with lung injury associated with COVID-19.","output":"Ventilator-induced barotrauma in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a retrospective observational study"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is an important cause of diarrhea in calves and its diarrheagenic properties are related to presence of certain virulence genes. In this study, the prevalence of virulence genes F5, F17, F41, sta, stx1, stx2, eae, and saa in E. coli isolated from pre-weaned calves presenting with (n= 329) or without diarrhea (n= 360) was explored using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. We also evaluated the association between detection of E. coli and the presence of diarrhea. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was detected in 56.3% (388/689) of the fecal samples and showed the highest prevalence (66.5%) in 21C40-day-old calves and the lowest (46.3%) among those that were 1C20 days old. The prevalence of the enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) pathotypes was detected in 73.9% and 15.9%, respectively. The results showed no association between diarrhea and the presence of E. coli in general, ETEC or STEC. The F17 gene was the most frequently detected virulence factor in E. coli of calves of all ages regardless of diarrhea. Interestingly, the results show that the calves aged 41C60 days with F17-positive E. coli are at a higher risk for production of Shiga toxin (Stx1; 95% confidence intervals: 1.86C31.95; P = 0.005) compared to calves aged 1C20 days; no association between this finding and diarrhea was observed among the calves of this age group. Moreover, the virulence genes associated with the ETEC and STEC strains were not significantly associated with pathogenicity in this study cohort. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that while the incidence of E. coli is age-related, there was no relationship linking E. coli virulence genes to calf age and diarrhea. Furthermore, the present study demonstrated that detection of E. coli strains either with or without virulence factors was not associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves.","output":"Characterization of virulence genes in Escherichia coli strains isolated from pre-weaned calves in the Republic of Korea"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a newly emerged coronavirus that is responsible for the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has resulted in more than 3.7 million infections and 260,000 deaths as of 6 May 20201,2. Vaccine and therapeutic discovery efforts are paramount to curb the pandemic spread of this zoonotic virus. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein promotes entry into host cells and is the main target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we describe several monoclonal antibodies that target the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, which we identified from memory B cells of an individual who was infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003. One antibody (named S309) potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV pseudoviruses as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2, by engaging the receptor-binding domain of the S glycoprotein. Using cryo-electron microscopy and binding assays, we show that S309 recognizes an epitope containing a glycan that is conserved within the Sarbecovirus subgenus, without competing with receptor attachment. Antibody cocktails that include S309 in combination with other antibodies that we identified further enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, and may limit the emergence of neutralization-escape mutants. These results pave the way for using S309 and antibody cocktails containing S309 for prophylaxis in individuals at a high risk of exposure or as a post-exposure therapy to limit or treat severe disease.","output":"Cross-neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by a human monoclonal SARS-CoV antibody"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: What are the clinical profiles, outcomes, and antimicrobial costs attributed to patients admitted with presumed urinary tract infection (UTI) but deemed to have no infection (NI) by infectious diseases (ID) MD reviewers? METHODS: We performed a review of a subset of patients entered into a randomized, controlled, AS trial that began 7.1.2015. Patients with UTI and 3 other ID syndromes were evaluated by ID MDs within 12C24 hours of receiving empirical antimicrobials. The ID MD designated patients as having NI when a patient lacked compatible symptoms, signs, and laboratory evidence to support a diagnosis of UTI. Patients with NI were tracked but not included in the study intervention to identify AS opportunities. RESULTS: Over 21 months 6,402 antimicrobial starts were entered into the AS study; 2,196 (34.3%) were UTI. Of these 564 (25.7%) were designated NI. The initial admission of 104 patients designated NI are the subject of this report. Four had possibly clinically significant UTI and were excluded. Of the remaining 100 the average age was 83.6 years, 80% were female and 50% were admitted with acute or chronic altered mental status (dementia, seizure, or stroke); Sixty-five % of urine cultures were positive. The mean Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) score was 0.6; the mean quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score (qSOFA) score was 0.9. A mean 3.7 days of antimicrobials were prescribed during the admission; 3.2 additional days at discharge. Of the 100 NI patients followed (up to 21 months following study entry) 34% have died (all-cause), 49% had a subsequent episode of bacteriuria; the mean number of re-admissions per patient was 2.4(range 0C14) and 9% developed C. difficile infection (CDI). CONCLUSION: AS identified a subset of patients treated for UTI but determined by ID MDs as NI, as an elderly, predominantly female cohort, with a high incidence of new or pre-existing neurological conditions, subsequent bacteriuria, re-admission, and short -term mortality. Low SIRS and qSOFA scores in these patients supported a lack of clinically significant infection. AS programs should focus on early efforts to identify ASBU. Preservation of antimicrobial resources, antibiotic cost savings (estimated over 3 years to be $ 450,000), and avoidance of CDI are among the likely benefits.

During times of global disruption, society has repeatedly relied on the literary and performing arts to entertain and inform. I will use the television series Retrograde (2020) as a case study to consider screenwriters resilience during times of turbulence and unrest and how they were able to create television in isolation to deliver comic relief to an online audience. Retrograde was written and produced entirely online in direct response to the restriction of movement and face-to-face interactions imposed due to the global Covid-19 pandemic. The comedic television show was written for a multiscreen performance and features a predominantly female writing team and cast. It is set in the online video conferencing space, which many have become accustomed to using for educational, professional, and social encounters during lockdown. Retrogrades characters depict the intersection of cultures of disability, sexuality, gender, race, and class, with the shared experience of being stuck at home, alone together. The Retrograde project proves intercultural representations can flourish within screenwriting practice when given the opportunity, and intermedial collaboration is possible despite the imposed hindrance of isolation. ? 2021, Australasian Association of Writing Programs.

Furthermore, HFNC can be used during bronchoscopy for oxygenation, before intubation for preoxygenation, and after extubation to avoid reintubation. The high gas flow prevents the patient from inspiring ambient air, allowing precise adjustment of an inspiratory oxygen fraction; furthermore, a positive end-expiratory pressure is built up by a resulting dynamic pressure, mucociliary clearance is improved by humidification and warming of the air breathed and the work of breathing is reduced by flushing the upper airways. Compared with conventional oxygen therapy, aerosol formation is not increased by HFNC; therefore, this procedure can also be used for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In hypercapnic respiratory failure the data are inconclusive and in this case noninvasive ventilation should currently be preferred instead of HFNC. It is important to remember that patients treated with HFNC are critically ill and therefore require continuous monitoring.

It is of considerable significance to utilize a new generation of information technology to improve the artificial intelligence level of respiratory disease diagnosis. Methods: Based on the semi-structured data of Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs) from the China Hospital Pharmacovigilance System, this paper proposed a bi-level artificial intelligence model for the risk classification of acute respiratory diseases. It includes two levels. The first level is a dedicated design of the BiLSTM+Dilated Convolution+3D Attention+CRF deep learning model that is used for Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition (CCNER) to extract valuable information from the unstructured data in the CEMRs. Incorporating the transfer learning and semi-supervised learning technique into the proposed deep learning model achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in the CCNER task than the popular Bert+BiLSTM+CRF approach. Combining the extracted entity data with other structured data in the CEMRs, the second level is a customized XGBoost to realize the risk classification of acute respiratory diseases. Results: The empirical study shows that the proposed model could provide practical technical support for improving diagnostic accuracy.

This study aims to evaluate the decisions of doctors who've resigned or retired during the COVID-19 pandemic from a sociological perspective. This qualitative research was conducted online using the semi-structured face-to-face interview technique with physician interviewees. Of the interviewees (Mage = 50.9 years), 9 had resigned and 10 had decided to retire. When coding the interview statements, the factors affecting the decision to leave employment were investigated such as organizational problems, managerial approaches, the conditions for cognizance in performing and understanding the profession, personality traits, and approaches in their immediate environment. During the pandemic, healthcare workers' acts of resigning or retiring have been explained through the fear of being infected/infecting someone else, problems in the health system, intense work conditions, and feeling burned out due to not knowing how long the process will take. In the context of the crisis as an anomie in which the individual loses faith in society and social solidarity dissolves, the main factors setting the basis for leaving work have been identified as unfair distribution of tasks, organizational disorders, ambiguity regarding the concept of responsibility due to uncertainty, collegiate behaviors that shirk duty, lack of appreciation, and personality traits. The imbalance in exchange with society has led individuals to choose to give themselves the rewards that they are unable to get from others. This research performs a kind of autopsy to understand the factors behind cases of resignation and retirement during the COVID-19 pandemic and what needs to be done to prevent this from turning into a contagion turnover.","output":"Adanm??l?ktan Tkenmi?li?e, Tkenmi?likten Vazge?i?e: COVID-19 Pandemisi'nde stifa Eden/Emekli Olan Hekimlerin l"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Music based interventions have been found to improve the wellbeing of people living with dementia. More recently there has been interest in physiological measures to provide additional information about how music and singing impact this population. Methods: This multiple-case study design explored physiological responses (heart rate-HR, electrodermal activity-EDA, movement, and skin temperature-ST) of nine people with mild-to-moderate dementia during a singing group, and six people in the later stages of dementia during an interactive music group. The interactive music group was also video recorded to provide information about engagement. Data were analysed using simulation modelling analysis. Results: The singing group showed an increase in EDA (p < 0.01 for 8/9 participants) and HR (p < 0.01 for 5/9 participants) as the session began. HR (p < 0.0001 for 5/9 participants) and ST (p < 0.0001 for 6/9 participants) increased during faster paced songs. EDA (p < 0.01 all), movement (p < 0.01 for 8/9 participants) and engagement were higher during an interactive music group compared to a control session (music listening). EDA (p < 0.0001 for 14/18 participants) and ST (p < 0.001 for 10/18 participants) increased and in contrast to the responses during singing, HR decreased as the sessions began (p < 0.002 for 9/18 participants). EDA was higher during slower music (p < 0.0001 for 13/18 participants), however this was less consistent in more interactive sessions than the control. There were no consistent changes in HR and movement responses during different styles of music.

Using a calculated minimal clinically important difference score of 12, 20% reported worse, 54% unchanged and 26% better QOLIBRI-OS scores between 3 and 12 months. Age below 65 years predicted a negative change (odds ratio (OR) 0.4, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION In this population with mild and moderate stroke, QOLIBRI-OS scores were slightly higher in the Norwegian region. Approximately 50% of participants experienced clinically important changes in satis-faction with functioning and wellbeing between 3 and 12 months post-stroke. Younger age predicted nega-tive change. This result could indicate increased rehabilitation needs over time in young patients and should be investigated further.","output":"Post-stroke health-related quality of life at 3 and 12 months and predictors of change in a Danish and Arctic Norwegian Region."},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Evolving requirements for patient and physician safety and rapid regulatory changes have stimulated interest in neurosurgical telemedicine in the COVID-19 era. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic literature review investigating treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine, and to evaluate barriers and challenges. Additionally, we review recent regulatory changes that affect telemedicine in neurosurgery, and our institution's initial experience. METHODS: A systematic review was performed including all studies investigating success regarding treatment of neurosurgical patients via telemedicine. We reviewed our department's outpatient clinic billing records after telemedicine was implemented from 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020 and reviewed modifier 95 inclusion to determine the number of face-to-face and telemedicine visits, as well as breakdown of weekly telemedicine clinic visits by subspecialty. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies (25 prospective and 27 retrospective) with 45 801 patients were analyzed. A total of 13 studies were conducted in the United States and 39 in foreign countries. Patient management was successful via telemedicine in 99.6% of cases. Telemedicine visits failed in 162 cases, 81.5% of which were due to technology failure, and 18.5% of which were due to patients requiring further face-to-face evaluation or treatment. A total of 16 studies compared telemedicine encounters to alternative patient encounter mediums; telemedicine was equivalent or superior in 15 studies. From 3/23/2020 to 4/6/2020, our department had 122 telemedicine visits (65.9%) and 63 face-to-face visits (34.1%). About 94.3% of telemedicine visits were billed using face-to-face procedural codes.

In addition, we face the spread of novel variants. Until we overcome the pandemic, reasonable mitigation and opening strategies are crucial to balance public health and economic interests. Methods: We model the spread of SARS-CoV-2 over the German counties by a graph-SIR-type model with particular focus on commuter testing. We account for political interventions by varying contact reduction values in private and public locations such as homes, schools, workplaces, and other. We consider different levels of lockdown strictness, commuter testing strategies, or the delay of intervention implementation. We conduct numerical simulations to assess the effectiveness of the different intervention strategies after one month. The virus dynamics in the counties are initialized randomly with incidences between 75-150 weekly new cases per 100,000 inhabitants (red zones) or below 10 (green zones) and consider 25 different initial scenarios of randomly distributed red zones (between 2 and 20 % of all counties). To account for uncertainty, we consider an ensemble set of 500 Monte Carlo runs for each scenario. Results: We find that the strength of the lockdown in regions with out of control virus dynamics is most important to avoid the spread into neighboring regions. With very strict lockdowns in red zones, commuter testing rates of twice a week can substantially contribute to the safety of adjacent regions. In contrast, less strict lockdowns with the same commuter testing rate quickly and substantially lead to overall higher infection dynamics. A further key contributor is the potential delay of the intervention implementation. In order to keep the spread of the virus under control, strict regional lockdowns with minimum delay and commuter testing of at least twice a week are advisable.","output":"Regional opening strategies with commuter testing and containment of new SARS-CoV-2 variants"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Online learning is extremely prevalent in education, more than ever given the COVID-19 pandemic that has shifted most educational services to an online platform.

Many studies are not conclusive on which dimensions of national culture affect the spread and death rate of COVID-19. The researchers, therefore, consider that studying the pandemic from the perception of quality can prevent its spread and contribute to the care and security of people affected by COVID-19. This study may be another way of providing information to those stakeholders. Method: To determine which aspects of culture affect the quality of life of Europeans during the COVID-19 pandemic, the researchers analyzed data through stepwise multiple regression analysis to predict the relationship between independent variables (cultural dimensions) and dependent variables (perceptions of the quality of life). Findings: It was found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with higher power distance and higher uncertainty avoidance had a lower quality of life in several dimensions, mainly in Eastern European countries and Latin European countries (France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain). In the Nordic or Scandinavian countries with higher levels of indulgence, people were more satisfied with their quality of life in spite of the COVID-19 epidemic. Novelty/Improvement: The results may inform policy-makers and stakeholders on how national cultures have both positive (i.e., indulgent and long-term) and negative (high power distance and high uncertainty avoidance) effects on the quality of life of Europeans during the COVID-19 pandemic. There should be (1) short-term measures to provide equal economic measures and public health assistance to reduce anxiety (reduce high power distance and high uncertainty avoidance), (2) medium-term measures to promote education and training to prepare people for new modes of working in the future (decrease high uncertainty avoidance), and (3) long-term measures to cultivate cultures to save for the future and to be optimistic and happy, both mentally and physically (increase long term orientation and indulgence). ? 2022 by the authors.

This pilot study aimed to describe the immunogenicity and adverse events of the heterologous CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 regimen, in comparison with homologous CoronaVac, and homologous ChAdOx1. Between May and August 2021, we recruited a total of 354 participants from four vaccination groups: the CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 vaccinee (n = 155), the homologous CoronaVac vaccinee (n = 32), the homologous ChAdOx1 vaccinee (n = 47), and control group of COVID-19 patients (n = 120). Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring the level of IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (anti-SRBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit and the level of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against variants of concern (VOCs) using the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and pseudovirus neutralization test (pVNT). The safety profile was recorded by interviewing at the 1-month visit after vaccination. The anti-SRBD level after the second booster dose of the CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 group at 2 weeks was higher than 4 weeks. At 4 weeks after the second booster dose, the anti-SRBD level in the CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 group was significantly higher than either homologous CoronaVac, the homologous ChAdOx1 group, and Control group (p < 0.001). In the CoronaVac-ChAdOx1 group, the PRNT50 level against the wild-type (434.5 BAU/mL) was the highest;followed by Alpha variant (80.4), Delta variant (67.4), and Beta variant (19.8).

The aim of this study was to propose a minimum peak inspiratory flow (PIF) as a standardized simple tool for successful decannulation after surgery. STUDY DESIGN Prospective review between January 2011 and June 2013 in a university teaching hospital. METHODS Fifty-six patients after head and neck cancer surgery requiring tracheotomies were included. Decannulation failure was defined as the need to recannulate patients within 24 hours. PIF values did not influence the decisions to decannulate or recannulate. Pre- and postdecannulation PIF values, measured with a handheld PIF meter (In-Check Dial), were registered until definitive decannulation. RESULTS A total of 67 decannulation attempts were performed, with 47 positive and nine negative decannulations at the first attempt. Of the latter, seven were positive at the second attempt and two at the third. All patients were decannulated (mean, 6.3 days). PIF values of 40 L/min appear to be the threshold with the best sensitivity (90%) and specificity (95%) for predicting decannulation success. There was a significant difference (P < .001) between mean PIF in the positive (86 L/min) and negative (20 L/min) decannulation groups and between mean PIF values with (77 L/min) and without cannula (100 L/min). CONCLUSIONS PIF 40 L/min with cannula (>60 L/min without) using the In-Check Dial oral method is a threshold associated with decannulation success.

Preventive measures like social distancing and mask usage have been taken all around the globe but still, as of September 2020, the number of cases continues to rise in many countries. Evidently, these measures are insufficient. Although decreases in population density and surges in the publics usage of personal protective equipment can mitigate direct transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), indirect transmission of the virus is still probable. By summarizing the current state of knowledge on the stability of coronaviruses on dry materials, this review uncovers the high potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through contaminated surfaces (i.e., fomites) and prompts future research. Fully contextualized data on coronavirus persistence are presented. The methods and limitations to testing the stability of coronaviruses are explored, and the SARS-CoV-2 representativeness of different coronaviruses is analyzed. The factors which dictate the persistence of coronaviruses on surfaces (media, environmental conditions, and material-type) are investigated, and the review is concluded by encouraging material innovation to combat the current pandemic. To summarize, SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on the timescale of days on hard surfaces under ambient indoor conditions. Similarly, the virus is stable on human skin, signifying the necessity of hand hygiene amidst the current pandemic. There is an inverse relationship between SARS-CoV-2 surface persistence and temperature/humidity, and the virus is well suited to air-conditioned environments (room temperature, ~ 40% relative humidity). Sunlight may rapidly inactivate the virus, suggesting that indirect transmission predominantly occurs indoors. The development of antiviral materials and surface coatings would be an extremely effective method to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To obtain applicable data on the persistence of coronaviruses and the efficiency of virucidal materials, future researchers should understand the common experimental limitations outlined in this review and plan their studies accordingly.","output":"Infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and Other Coronaviruses on Dry Surfaces: Potential for Indirect Transmission"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: The experience of disability and of how work is conducted in the American economy is undergoing new shifts in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic This unique space in time provides an opportunity to re-examine the importance of universal design (UD) as a way to respond to a workforce that is growing more diverse and living longer with disabilities UD is a set of strategies that creates places and resources that are accessible to all and considers the needs and wants of people from the outset Through the use of UD, work environments can be more accessible and useable to all employees OBJECTIVE: This article describes the changes in the experience of disability within the context of COVID-19 and defines UD and UD for learning principles We then consider how UD reduces stigma and reduces the need for individual accommodations while promoting inclusivity and improving productivity in the workplace CONCLUSION: We offer strategies for embedding UD into vocational rehabilitation from pre-professional training to practice, all with a new sense of urgency and opportunity that is present as a result of COVID-19 ? 2021 - IOS Press All rights reserved","output":"Reframing workplace inclusion through the lens of universal design: Considerations for vocational rehabilitation professionals in the wake of COVID-19"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Infection of human cells with poliovirus induces the proliferation of double-membraned cytoplasmic vesicles whose surfaces are used as the sites of viral RNA replication and whose origin is unknown. Here, we show that several hallmarks of cellular autophagosomes can be identified in poliovirus-induced vesicles, including colocalization of LAMP1 and LC3, the human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Atg8p, and staining with the fluorophore monodansylcadaverine followed by fixation. Colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 was observed early in the poliovirus replicative cycle, in cells infected with rhinoviruses 2 and 14, and in cells that express poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A, known to be sufficient to induce double-membraned vesicles. Stimulation of autophagy increased poliovirus yield, and inhibition of the autophagosomal pathway by 3-methyladenine or by RNA interference against mRNAs that encode two different proteins known to be required for autophagy decreased poliovirus yield. We propose that, for poliovirus and rhinovirus, components of the cellular machinery of autophagosome formation are subverted to promote viral replication. Although autophagy can serve in the innate immune response to microorganisms, our findings are inconsistent with a role for the induced autophagosome-like structures in clearance of poliovirus. Instead, we argue that these double-membraned structures provide membranous supports for viral RNA replication complexes, possibly enabling the nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents, including progeny virions, from infected cells.","output":"Subversion of Cellular Autophagosomal Machinery by RNA Viruses"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, many governments have implemented national or regional lockdowns to slow the spread of infection.

The purpose of this editorial is, therefore, to stimulate debate by considering some of the barriers that have stopped governments setting the benefits of lockdown against, in particular, mental health costs during this process and so to make possible a more balanced approach going forward. First, evidence that lockdown causes mental health problems needs to be stronger. Natural experimental studies will play an essential role in providing such evidence.

We analyzed the gut microbiome in 346 fecal samples (6-36 months; 112 non-AD, 110 mild AD, and 124 moderate to severe AD) from the Longitudinal Cohort for Childhood Origin of Asthma and Allergic Disease birth cohort. The microbiome-host interactions were analyzed in animal and in vitro cell assays. Although the gut microbiome maturated with age in both AD and non-AD groups, its development was disordered in the AD group. Disordered colonization of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) producers along with age led to abnormal SCFA production and increased IgE levels. A butyrate deficiency and downregulation of GPR109A and PPAR-?3 genes were detected in AD-induced mice. Insufficient butyrate decreases the oxygen consumption rate of host cells, which can release oxygen to the gut and perturb the gut microbiome.

This study was undertaken to identify and compare findings of chest radiography and computed tomography among patients with SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. METHODS: This retrospective study was undertaken at a tertiary care center. Eligible subjects included consecutive patients age 18 and over with documented SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection between March and July 2020. The primary outcome measures were results of chest radiography and computed tomography among patients with documented SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection. RESULTS: Among 724 subjects, most were admitted to a medical floor (46.4%; N = 324) or admitted to an ICU (10.9%; N = 76). A substantial number of subjects were intubated during the emergency department visit or inpatient hospitalization (15.3%; N = 109). The majority of patients received a chest radiograph (80%; N = 579). The most common findings were normal, bilateral infiltrates, ground\\\\glass opacities, or unilateral infiltrate. Among 128 patients who had both chest radiography and computed tomography, there was considerable disagreement between the 2 studies (52.3%; N = 67; 95% confidence interval: 43.7% to 61.0%).). The presence of bilateral infiltrates (infiltrates or ground\\\\glass opacities) was associated with clinical factors including older age, ambulance arrivals, more urgent triage levels, higher heart rate, and lower oxygen saturation. Bilateral infiltrates were associated with poorer outcomes, including higher rate of intubation, greater number of inpatient days, and higher rate of death. CONCLUSIONS: Common radiographic findings of SARS\\\\CoV\\\\2 infection include infiltrates or ground\\\\glass opacities. There was considerable disagreement between chest radiography and computed tomography. Computed tomography was more accurate in defining the extent of involved lung parenchyma.

The impact of the illness as well as the efficiency of the therapy are also monitored carefully when performing this imaging exam. Coronaviruses, specifically CoV-2, as RNA viruses, have a tendency to frequently change their genome, giving the virus beneficial characteristics such as greater transmissibility, pathogenicity and the possibility to escape the previously acquired immunity. Therefore, genome evaluation became an extremely important routine practice worldwide. In particular, in Italy, four variants have been recognised and each of them represent a specific temporal wave of the disease. Hence, our goal was to describe imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, specifically its most typical imaging identified during the period of our study, and to assess whether or not SARS-CoV-2 variants determine different CT patterns.

METHOD We enrolled 105 adults injured while riding e-scooters who presented to an emergency department in Washington, DC, during 2019. Enrolled participants completed an interview during the emergency department visit, and their charts were abstracted to document their injuries and treatment. Logistic regression examined the association of incident location and circumstances with the likelihood of sustaining an injury on the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS)  2, while controlling for rider characteristics. RESULTS The most common locations of e-scooter injuries in our study sample occurred on the sidewalk (58%) or road (23%). Accounting for other trip and rider attributes, e-scooter riders injured on the road were about twice as likely as those injured elsewhere to sustain AIS  2 injuries (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.23-2.36) and those who rode at least weekly more often sustained AIS  2 injuries compared with less frequent riders (RR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.11-2.32). CONCLUSIONS Greater injury severity for riders injured on the road may reflect higher travel speeds. Practical applications: Injury severity associated with riding in the road is one factor that jurisdictions can consider when setting policy on where e-scooters should be encouraged to ride, but the risk of any crash or fall associated with facilities should also be examined.

METHODS The registry HOPE-COVID-19 (Health Outcome Predictive Evaluation for COVID-19, NCT04334291) is an international ambispective study, enrolling COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital, dead or alive. RESULTS HOPE enrolled 2798 patients from 35 centers in 7 countries. Median age was 67 years (IQR: 53.0-78.0), and most were male (59.5%). A relevant heart disease was present in 682 (24%) cases. These were older, more frequently male, with higher overall burden of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking habit, obesity) and other comorbidities such renal failure, lung, cerebrovascular disease and oncologic antecedents (p < 0.01, for all). The heart cohort received more corticoids (28.9% vs. 20.4%, p < 0.001), antibiotics, but less hydroxychloroquine, antivirals or tocilizumab. Considering the epidemiologic profile, a previous heart condition was independently related with short-term mortality in the COX multivariate analysis (1.62; 95% CI 1.29-2.03; p < 0.001). Moreover, heart patients needed more respiratory, circulatory support, and presented more in-hospital events, such heart failure, renal failure, respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, SIRS and clinically relevant bleedings (all, p < 0.001), and mortality (39.7% vs. 15.5%; p < 0.001).

A sensor-based automated system was designed and implemented for the collection of CO2 concentrations at selected locations. In the final stage, a CO2 footprint map was generated to highlight the vulnerable areas of CO2 in the academic building. It was concluded that offices have higher CO2 concentrations at both intervals (morning and afternoon), followed by the laboratory, corridors, and praying area. The CO2 concentration did not exceed 500 ppm at any location. Thus, all locations other than offices had normal CO2 concentration levels. Similarly, the humidity level was also satisfactory. The average humidity level was below 50%, which is below the permissible value of 65%. The recommended range for temperature values as per ASHRAE standards is 22.5 degrees C to 25.5 degrees C, except for prayer places. It was concluded that the selected academic institute is providing a good environment to the users of the building, but that may change once the academic institute becomes fully functional after COVID-19. This study assists the stakeholders in making guidelines and necessary actions to reduce CO2 concentration in academic buildings, as it is expected to rise once the human load increases in the next academic year.

We have previously established that axolotl salamanders can fully repair large articular cartilage lesions, which may be due to the presence of an interzone-like tissue in the intra-articular space. Study objectives were to further characterize axolotl diarthrodial joint structure and determine the differentiation potential of interzone-like tissue in a skeletal microenvironment. DESIGN Diarthrodial joint morphology and expression of aggrecan, brother of CDO (BOC), type I collagen, type II collagen, and growth/differentiation factor 5 (GDF5) were examined in femorotibial joints of sexually mature (>12 months) axolotls. Joint tissue cellularity was evaluated in individuals from 2 to 24 months of age. Chondrogenic potential of the interzone was evaluated by placing interzone-like tissue into 4 mm tibial defects. RESULTS Cavitation reached completion in the femoroacetabular and humeroradial joints, but an interzone-like tissue was retained in the intra-articular space of distal limb joints. Joint tissue cellularity decreased to 7 months of age and then remained stable. Gene expression patterns of joint markers are broadly similar in developing mammals and mature axolotls. When interzone-like tissue was transplanted into critical size skeletal defects, an accessory joint developed within the defect site. CONCLUSIONS These experiments indicate that mature axolotl diarthrodial joints are phenotypically similar to developing synovial joints in mammals. Generation of an accessory joint by interzone-like tissue suggests multipotent cellular differentiation potential similar to that of interzone cells in the mammalian fetus.

In conclusion, the results of the present meta-analysis demonstrate that Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with higher D-dimer values, lower platelet count and prolonged PT. This data suggests a possible role of disseminated intravascular coagulation in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 disease complications.","output":"Differences in coagulopathy indices in patients with severe versus non-severe COVID-19: a meta-analysis of 35 studies and 6427 patients"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The recent worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 has had a detrimental worldwide impact on people of all ages. Although data from China and the United States indicate that pediatric cases often have a mild course and are less severe in comparison to adults, there have been several cases of kidney failure and multisystem inflammatory syndrome reported. As such, we believe that the world should be prepared if the severity of cases begins to further increase within the pediatric population. Therefore, we provide here a position paper centered on emergency preparation with resource allocation for critical COVID-19 cases within the pediatric population, specifically where renal conditions worsen due to the onset of AKI.","output":"Kidney Replacement Therapy in COVID-19 Induced Kidney Failure and Septic Shock: A Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy [PCRRT] Position on Emergency Preparedness With Resource Allocation"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background COVID-19 vaccines reduce morbidity and mortality, but mass vaccination faces multiple challenges leading to different vaccination rates in different countries. Malta, a small European country, has achieved a very rapid vaccination rollout. This paper presents a narrative review of Malta's vaccination strategy and its impact on the country's COVID-19 situation. Methods Data was obtained through a literature review of Maltese newspapers and from Malta's COVID-19 government dashboard. A comprehensive summary of vaccination operations was provided by Malta's COVID-19 vaccination team. Results Malta comprised part of the European Commission joint procurement and obtained the maximum vaccines that were eligible from all manufacturers. Four tier priority population groups were set up, with both vaccine doses (where applicable) allocated and stored for each individual. Multiple hubs were set up to simultaneously administer first and eventually second doses accordingly. To date (August 9, 2021) 398,128 of the population are fully vaccinated and 405,073 received the first dose, with both morbidity and mortality declining progressively as vaccination coverage progressed. Conclusion Malta has successfully implemented a COVID-19 strategy that rapidly covered a substantial proportion of the population over a short period of time, with herd immunity reached by end of May 2021. Low population vaccination hesitancy and high vaccine doses availability were two major factors in this success.","output":"The fastest national COVID vaccination in Europe - Malta's strategies"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"This paper presents a data-based simple model for fitting the available data of the Covid-19 pandemic evolution in France. The time series concerning the 13 regions of mainland France have been considered for fitting and validating the model. An extremely simple, two-dimensional model with only two parameters demonstrated to be able to reproduce the time series concerning the number of daily demises caused by Covid-19, the hospitalizations, intensive care and emergency accesses, the daily number of positive test and other indicators, for the different French regions. These results might contribute to stimulate a debate on the suitability of much more complex models for reproducing and forecasting the pandemic evolution since, although relevant from a mechanistic point of view, they could lead to nonidentifiability issues.","output":"The Ockham's razor applied to COVID-19 model fitting French data"},{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"We previously reported the expression of soluble A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) hemagglutinin in insect cells and the molecular and immunological structure of an aggregated fraction, only observed in cell supernatant when expression was performed at low pH [23].
